[??]McCrory: State of North Carolina Governor’s objection s and veto
message House Bill 392,  an act requiring a County Department of Social
Services to verify whether an applicant or a recipient of Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families  benefits.  It is critical that public
benefits be protected from abuses by felons and those fleeing
prosecution. The criminal background requirements make sense in House
Bill 392. Thereby, under my existing executive authority, I’m directing
the Department of Health and Human Services in our state Chief
Information Officer to develop a plan and recommendations to assure the
fugitive felons and probation-

  <p id="05:00">While parole violators do not receive those public benefits. This
administration believes that there are better ways to fight addiction
and prevent criminal drug abuse. However, this is not the best way
forward and I must veto this bill because of my concerns about the
implementation of the drug testing provisions which were not thoroughly
analyzed prior to passing the legislation. Additional veto reasons
include the changes that would be required are not funded in this bill
or in the 2013/2015 budget. The bill is a step backwards for DHHS and
it's efforts to assist people in combating substance abuse. The
department currently screens all adult applicants for substance abuse
issues and, as appropriate, facilitates the treatment plan which the
applicant must comply prior to receiving benefits. I'm concerned that
the means for establishing reasonable suspicion, as outlined in the
bill, are not sufficient to mandate a drug test under the fourth
amendment. The punitive mandates of this bill go too far in restricting
future access to benefits that could have a negative impact on children
and families. Similar efforts in other states have proven costly for tax
payers and did little to help fight drug addiction. There are potential
obstacles to consistent application across 100 counties. I continue to
recommend further study on this issue, Pat McCrory, governor of the
state of North Carolina. Calendar, governors objections and veto
message, House bill 786, an act to require the department of public
safety to study measures for addressing the problem of illegal
immigration in this state and to clarify which employers are subject to
the state's E-verify laws. I am vetoing House bill 786 because I
promised to protect and find jobs for North Carolinians. This bill has
been thinly disguised as a measure to help our farming community, when
in fact it applies to a broad spectrum of other businesses in both urban
and rural areas. There's a loophole that would allow businesses to
exempt a higher percentage of employees from proving that they are legal
U.S. citizens or residents. This legislation increases the seasonal
employee 90 day exemption to nearly nine months in a calendar year and
will put our legal residents at a disadvantage in the job market. We
must do everything we can to help protect jobs for North Carolinians
first and foremost. This legislation needs further study as I
recommended months ago, however the bill did not provide funding for a
study. North Carolina has the fifth highest unemployment in the country
and now is not the time to put our citizens at a disadvantage to find
jobs. I have remained focused on job growth in North Carolina and I will
continue to do so in the future. Therefore, I veto the bill. Pat
McCrory, governor of the state of North Carolina.

Ladies and gentlemen of the assembly, this was a bill that --

[Speaker Changes]
Representative Fulghum, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes]
Speak on the bill.
[Speaker Changes]
The gentleman is recognized to make the motion.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker Changes]
Ladies and gentlemen, in April this House approved H392 to deny Work
First and nutritional assistance to fleeing felons and parole and
probation violators.  On August 14th Governor McCrory issued Executive
Order #21 directing the Department of Health and Human Services to
implement the provisions of that version of H392.  The conference
version of H392 before us today was ratified in July with new language
from the Senate repealing existing law dealing with Work First
applicants and substance abuse.  Work First is a program that's been
around since 1994, initially with benefits for 129,000 North Carolina
families.
In 2012 and 13 -- 21,000 families were enrolled with 34,000 children
and 6,600 adults.  The goal of Work First is to move families below 200
percent of poverty to self sufficiency.  The Department of Social
Services in 100 North Carolina counties assist needy families so that
children can be cared for in their own homes or homes of relatives.
They seek to reduce the ?? of needy parents by providing job
preparedness, work, and marriage to prevent or reduce the incidence of
out of wedlock pregnancies to encourage the formation of two parent
families to keep families off welfare by making work mandatory as a
condition of benefits with a two year limit and to help keep parents
employed by assisting with childcare and transportation.
Substance abuse involving alcohol and drugs often ruin any chance of
these stressed families to move up from the punishing depths of poverty.
 The current Work First program is administered in all 100 North
Carolina counties -- requires all applicants to be screened by qualified
substance abuse professionals for signs of alcohol or drug abuse.  A
mutual responsibility agreement will require if indicated participation
in a substance abuse treatment program.  Compliance with the program and
any subsequent drug testing are conditions to receive Work First benefit
and is a part of the benefit package.  Over two-thirds of the adult US
population consume alcohol on a regular basis.  Over 18 million US
adults are considered alcohol abusers.  A similar number use illegal
drugs -- at least 30 to 50 percent are considered abusers.
If an applicant or recipient of Work First cannot comply with the
substance abuse program it is currently configured.  The offending adult
will lose benefits, but the family's children do not.  And by the way,
70 percent of the beneficiaries in this program are our children.  The
practical result is for example a family of one parent and one child is
receiving its own average at $236 per month.  They would lose only the
parents -- $36 per month share for a failed drug test.  The new Work
First drug screening law as proposed eliminates the substance abuse
testing and treatment protocol.  Based on reasonable suspicion
standards, an additional drug test would be required of the applicant
for Work First benefits for quote, &quot;Illegal use of controlled
substances&quot;.  If the test is positive the applicant would be
ineligible for benefits for one year.  An applicant may...

  <p id="15:00">reapply in thirty days, but is eligible for benefits only after
successful completion of a substance abuse treatment program and a
negative drug test, with all costs related to the treatment and testing
going by the applicant. If tested positive again, no reapplication is
possible for three years. Why do I object to this version of 392? What's
the problem this new law seeks to remedy? Does the current program fail
to discover alcohol and drug abuse, which would cause tax payers to
support a drug habit, or keep the work force program from achieving its
goals? To the contrary, this new law proposed seeks only to discover
use, not abuse, and fails to include the most commonly abused substance,
alcohol, in its language. An already distressed family, in poverty, now
also must shoulder the additional cost of treatment and testing if they
hope to qualify for benefits, should the initial drug test come back
positive. And to the drug test, exactly what, quote, controlled
substances are subject to illegal use? In the North Carolina Control
Substance Act, 336 drugs are listed by name, and subject to abuse and
illegal use. Do we discard a substance abuse program now appropriately
administered in all 100 counties in this bad bill, which is so poorly
written it fails to specify which of the 336 controlled substances it
seeks to uncover. And also fails to disclose WHAT costs are to be
incurred by the absence of a physical note. By these actions, it
indulges in micro-management and disregards the judgement of the fine
social work professionals in  all 100 North Carolina  counties. Is there
evidence the current program is not working, and will the suggested
replacement actually help the applicant hold down a job  and support the
family,or is this really a punitive measure? Which brings me to my final
objection. In my opinion, these new provisions meets the definition of
kicking a man while he is down. It also brings to mind the message of
Paul, found in Galatians 6:2. &quot;Bear one another's burdens, and so
fulfill the law of Christ.&quot; I support the Governor's veto of HP392,
and respectfully ask you to join me in voting no on override. Thank you.

Representative Larry Hall, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and uh fellow House members. I think, uh,
Dr. Foljam probably said it correct, that, uh, this is kicking folks
when they're down. This is a measure that should never have been passed.
One that, uh, the Governor's staff, and researchers have looked at and
determined several things in his letter explaining his veto. And I would
support his veto and would vote red on this motion to override his veto.
Now, we can come back and pass a bill in a short session or in the next
long session, and get it right, but the many problems that Dr. Foljam
pointed out won't go away because someone says, &quot;Well, let's
override the Governor's veto&quot;. On this one, the Governor is right.
We should support his veto, and vote red on this motion to override.

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The gentleman may approach the well of the House. If we could get a
mic up there. Looks like the mics are out.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
We've got one. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Um, I speak in an opposition
to, um, overriding this veto, but I do so for a couple of reasons. Um,
having spoken on this bill at length, uh, when it was here the first
time and the second time, and appreciating everything that
Representative Arp tried to negotiate, but if you remember, um,um, and,
and, there are multiple parts to this bill. And one of the other parts
to the bill, besides drug testing, is the issue of the fingerprinting.
And there was a resolution reached, um, on the House floor, that allowed
some of us to have some comfort level, uh, about that provision. And the
comfort level was, uh, that there was an agreement that there really
wasn't going to be an attempt to seek the extended record check of
anyone that would require fingerprinting, unless there was reasonable
grounds to believe that the federal record check would disclose

  <p id="20:00">Something that the state record check, which doesn’t require the
fingerprinting, would otherwise suggest the; would lead the person to
not an appropriate recipient of program assistance. And, we were going
to do that by giving the commission time to pass rules that made that
clear by February of 2014, and then not put those rules into effect
until 2015 by a provision in the Bill that would say 2015 was the
effective date so that if the commission didn’t do as we wanted or we
were misled in any way in what was going to happen, there was time in
the short session to fix that.
Well, as you know, the Senate backed up on the agreement the House
had in conference, and so if you look at your Bill that passed 2015 is
not the effective date but 2013 is the effective date. Effective date
even before the social services commission promulgates the rules in
2014, which is it’s own issue. But I was asked at that point whether I
still supported it, and I made inquiry about that 2015 date and was told
by folks in the majority, well, the Governor is likely to veto’d the
Bill and there wasn’t any reason to try to get in worse negotiations
with the Senate.
Well, there was from my point of view. That 2015 date for a lot of us
was the reason that we were willing to go along, because what it did was
it said even if the commission gets the rules wrong, even if there is an
issue, and in good faith across party lines we can do that. But that
wasn’t honored. That agreement wasn’t part of the bill. And that
fundamentally broke the trust that existed as to why there was a middle
ground here that we should strike, and that we could strike. So for that
first reason, I think the Governor is right. Right now, we put in the
law that particular provision without the regulation, without the
capacity to fix it before we come back in short session.
Secondly, I indicated at the time I had concerns but I was willing to
override them on the definition of reasonable suspicion. I’m not at all
sure that’s what ought to be and the Governors’ made that clear that he
isn’t either. But what I am sure of now that I’ve had even more time to
go back and read is that we added in on the Senate side one of the
provisions on what establishes reasonable cause, or reasonable
suspicion. It says that if you have a record in the last three years.
Well, I’ve decided to take some look at that and I can’t for the life of
me figure out why because someone once did something wrong, within the
last three years, that that alone gives rise to reasonable suspicion to
then have them drug tested or record checked. We all make mistakes, and
their only mistake at this point as far as we know is being poor. No
something they chose to do. And that gets back to Dr. Fulghum’s eloquent
point. I am at a loss to figure out why we have as a standard of
reasonable suspicion that if you have a prior conviction in the last
three years, that’s enough. I just don’t think it is. And because I
believe we have the wrong standard in here; fixable; but nonetheless in
here, and we can’t seem to be able to do that today, and because I think
there was a breach of the agreement that existed on this floor that
allowed some of us, in fact, 20 on this side to vote for that bill on
the date, and because a number of us had questions to begin with, I
believe that the Governor is more right than wrong on this, I’m going to
vote to sustain his veto on this Bill, thank you.

Speak on the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The [??] is recognized to debate the Bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What I’d like to do is address some of the issues and the reasons for
the legislation as it is currently before you. Much of this had centered
around the drug testing of the TANF benefits. What I want to make clear
is that the drug testing component is not for the food stamps; it is
only for the TANF program, or what is called the Work First North
Carolina. North Carolina’s temporary assistance for needy family is cash
assistance to help move people off of welfare and into jobs. Being
drug-free is an essential part of that mission. This requirement is not
unreasonable given that many hard-working families willing to spend
their tax dollars to provide this aid are tested for drug

  <p id="25:00">… in their own jobs. The program is specifically for helping move people
off of welfare and into jobs. Being drug-free is an essential part of
being able to find and keep a job. It is not the intent of House Bill
392 to be an effective way to fight criminal drug abuse, but rather to
end the bad practice of supporting active drug use and abusers with
hard-earned tax money of the law-abiding North Carolinians. Illegal drug
use is a violation of the law in North Carolina, and this specific
welfare aid should go to law-abiding North Carolinians first, who are
able to successfully participate in the workforce program, and not to
active drug-users and abusers who are not able to find and keep a job.
This Bill specifically requires drug abusers be referred to those other
programs already in place to help overcome their drug addiction; then
those people will be able to participate in this program. The Bill was
funded in the budget, and actually to release those funds that are
propriate in the budget to cover the cost of this program, we actually
have to pass 392 because it was a contingent basis. If you vote for this
Bill, you are saying that fleeing felons are not entitled to welfare
benefits. If you vote for this Bill, you are saying that those illegally
using drugs are not entitled to the workforce benefit program. If you
vote for this, you’re saying government agencies should work together
with law-enforcement to keep us safe and to catch criminals. If you vote
against this motion, then you’re saying it’s okay for fleeing felons to
receive welfare benefits. If you vote against this override vote, you’re
saying those illegally using drugs are okay to continue receiving
benefits. If you vote against this Bill, you’re saying that government
agencies should remain in their silos and not cooperate to keep us safe.
I urge your vote for the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative [??], please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[??] has recognized to debate the motion a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I am against tax payers supporting a drug habit of
welfare recipients, and I think most of us, if not all of us, are. This
Bill is not about that. The current system that we have in place is a
substance-abuse and alcohol discovery program, and it tries to find out
who these people are, assist them in their treatment, support their
families, try to get them to where they’re work-able, and in no way
supports drug-use; and to imply that my opposition to the Bill is based
on my liberal attitude of supporting drug-use is just not accurate. I do
not think it is healthy. It is deadly, it is counter-productive to a
productive individual supporting their family; and I think the current
system demonstrably works very well, and my only puzzlement here is why
we’re trying to change a system that seems to be working just as well as
it can be. And I’m certainly aware of the fact that the Governor’s
Executive Order 21 implemented the first part of the Bill involving
fleeing felons, probationers and parolees, so I just don’t think this is
a useful addition to the law, and that’s why I’m supporting the
Governor’s veto.

Thank you. Representative [??], did you realize that the existing
system that you’re talking about continues to remain in place, still
using the standard questionnaires that they’re been using to determine
drug addiction, and that this is – drug and alcohol addiction – and that
this is merely giving additional tools in the toolbox to identify those
people who have a substance abuse problem?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I disagree. I don’t think it adds anything to the toolbox at all. I
think the qualified substance-abuse professional at each county level…

a motion. The governor ?? motion and to debate the motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank-you Mr. Speaker. I'd like to make a motion to pass house
bill 786 not with standing the objection of the governor. Ladies and
gentleman, colleagues this is the exact same bill that we passed out
here a few weeks ago with a bipartison strong vote of 85 to 28. And the
senate followed us with a very strong almost unanimous vote of 43 to 1.
Nothing has changed in this bill. I encourage to join me in voting to
overwrite the veto. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion. Further
debate. If not the motion is to pass. House bill 786 not with standing
the objection of the governor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker. Mr.
Speaker. I'm sorry. My light wouldn't go on. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Millis, the chair apologizes. Did the gentleman have a
malfunction? I'm counting on the fact that there were no lights on when
I put the question, but I'm counting on the fact there has been a
malfunction. Is there any objection to allow the chair to withdraw the
question and allow further discussion. Is there an objection?
Representative Millis, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
would like to speak briefly on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
us recognized to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the house. I apologize for that
malfunction there. It was my intent to speak on this bill just to relay
to you all and to the members of the public of why I was opposed to this
bill on the 2nd and 3rd reading and why I will be voting against this
veto override today. And so my comments are definitely intended to
articulate that reason. And in discussing this bill it has been said and
it is true that it is against federal law to hire an undocumented
illegal immigrant. That is the truth, but one thing we must realize in
conjunction with the truth is that we have a federal government that is
not enforcing its own laws. And we have to revisit the fact of why that
we passed, an e-varify law some sessions back based for the citizens of
North Carolina. And the reason is is because the ?? federal forms to
actually show that you are complying with federal law is fraudulently
used in many cases. And this chamber passed an e-varify law in order to
make sure that the employers of this state were actually employing
documented legal citizens. So, I just wanted to put that back into the
minds of the chamber here of why e-varify was passed. And the reason why
it's important is because unlike the federal government ability to
ignore its laws and its ability to print its own money is that this
state can only take in what it takes from the patrians of the citizens
of North Carolina. Therefore, we have a financial responsibility to make
sure that we're spending tax payer dollars.

  <p id="35:00">...on the aspects within the role of government. I would say that the
federal government does not foot the bill for all of our Medicaid. It
does not foot the bill for K-12. These are state expenses that an
undocumented illegal immigration population has on this state. They are
not minor costs. Indigent care within medical facilities and also in
regard to, like I mentioned, K-12. We have a responsibility to the
citizens of this state to actually have state laws that does not
encourage illegal immigration within our borders. I would like to say
this in closing, is that the question is is whether we are encouraging
or discouraging illegal immigration by fundamentally gutting our
E-Verify law. I can say, without the shadow of a doubt, that we are. The
E-Verify is the best, the one mechanism we have to ensure that employers
in this state are truly hiring documented, legal citizens. For us
tonight, to vote to override and the bill before us, is truly voting to
prevent employers in this state to hire undocumented, illegal
immigrants, and I would urge you in regard to the cost it impairs our
state and with the aspect of the rule of law to actually vote red on
this bill before you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the opportunity to
speak, and thank you, members of the Chamber.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, and in this instance, I would ask that you
support this veto override, and I want to tell you why. This certainly
is a measure that we debated. A lot of work was done on this. At the
heart of it, we're still number one agricultural state. We still have
farmers and people in the industry that have to depend upon labor from
all over the world, not just south of the border, but from all over the
world and all over the United States, and this bill gives them the
opportunity to have more security in their workforce. It doesn't force
anyone to do anything illegal. It doesn't force anyone to hire anyone
from any other state or from this state. It expresses the confidence in
our farmers and their integrity and it gives them an opportunity to have
a stable workforce so they can help contribute to the number one
industry we have in this state. Again, I'd ask that you override the
governor's veto on this, and let's give the farmers and the agricultural
industry in our state the chance they need to compete. Let us continue
to be one of the top agricultural states in the United States.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We passed HP36 in 2011. HP36 provided a
90-day window for farmers to have illegal aliens working in their
fields. They were happy with that. They asked for the 90 days. We gave
them the 90 days. This present move to expand this to nine months has
nothing to do with the farm community. They say it does. They're out
there saying it does. I guess, in a way, it'd probably make it easier
for them to hire and fire anybody they want for nine months instead of
90 days. What we're doing is opening up illegal aliens to just about
every other profession in the state. This is a jobs bill for illegal
aliens. That's exactly what it is. We presently pay 2.2 billion dollars
in support of the illegal population in this state, and I'll bet you a
dollar to a doughnut that two years from now, we'll probably be paying
3.2 million or more. We're going to become a magnet for illegal aliens,
the same way we were in the early 2000s, late 1900s, '97, '98, along in
there. It's the wrong thing to do. The governor is right. He's trying to
protect jobs for citizens of this state. We've got a nine percent
unemployment rate, and here we are with a jobs bill for illegal aliens.
It makes absolutely no sense that we should go down this road. The law
that we passed in 2011 that will effect most of the farmers in this
state just went into effect 01 July. They have no idea what it's going
to...

  <p id="40:00">[NEW SPEAKER] And for them, whether it is gonna harm em or not, and I
don’t think it will, because they got their 90 days for bringing in
their crops. Georgia passed a more strict law than we did. Their farms
are still functioning, they’re still growing crops, they’re still an
agricultural state. Why we would want to take and make it harder for our
citizens to gain employment is beyond me. I would vote to sustain the
governor’s view.
[NEW SPEAKER] Representative Collins, please state your purpose.
[NEW SPEAKER] Debate a bill. The gentleman is recognized to debate
the motion.  Well, I really didn’t plan on saying anything tonight I was
hoping I wouldn’t have to, but with some of the other comments I feel
compelled to reply. I’m from a big farming area. The farmers in our area
employ people for six months at a time. A lot of these folks work the
citrus orchards all down through Florida and then come up to our area up
in May and stay until November. They work the cucumber fields, then they
work tobacco and then they dig sweet potatoes last of all. I know that
because I served as a pastor of a Haitian church, group of Haitian
migrants for 5 years back in the 1980s and was also part of a ministry
to a bunch of Spanish speaking migrants that the associate pastor at my
church had started he had come here from Texas, and had actually lived
in Mexico for about 18 years and was fluent in the language. I was
fluent enough to help him out and talk to the people and that was about
it. 90 days will not work for the farmers in my area, one of the effects
of this bill is to help the agricultural community in our area and
that’s why they have been so stridently opposed to the governor’s veto.
I would also point out that the only other thing this bill does is,
other than study a lot of stuff, it used to contain a lot of provisions,
most of them now are just studies, but the other thing it does is
provide parity for businesses in our state with businesses outside of
our state trying to do business in our state. In other words, trying to
take business away from businesses in our state because they have to use
the same e verifier procedures that we use now. If we don’t pass this
law, outside interests have an advantage over the businesses in our
state as far as the e verified process is concerned. So I would ask that
you vote along with me, vote green to override the governor’s veto and
thank you for listening.
[NEW SPEAKER] Further discussion, further debate? If not, the motion
before the house is the passage of House Bill 786 notwithstanding the

Members, since this body last met we've lost in Afghanistan two of our
adopted North Carolinians.  One is Master Sergeant George Bannar who is
from Orange, VA.  He was killed August 20th in Wardak Province in
Afghanistan.  He served at Fort Bragg with Charlie Company, 3rd
Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group, Airborne.  He had an associates
degree from Fayetteville Tech Community College and earned a bachelor's
degree from Campbell University.  So, his ties to our state were indeed
deep.  This was his fifth deployment to Afghanistan.  He was 37 and
leaves behind a wife and his parents.
Sergeant First Class Ricardo Young was from Rosston, Arkansas.  He
was killed this past Wednesday in Ghazni Province, Afghanistan.  He
served with the 738th Engineer Support Company, 307th Engineer Battalion
Airborne, 20th Engineer Brigade, 18th Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg.  His
commanding officer was quoted as saying, &quot;He loved family,
football, and the army.&quot;  He had done two tours to Iraq, one to
Afghanistan, and was 34.  I ask that you keep their family, their
friends, and their units in your thoughts and prayers.

proponent of the North Carolina mafia.
He had on the dark classes and I just had to inquire, &quot;What's
this all about?&quot;  He said, &quot;Well.&quot;
