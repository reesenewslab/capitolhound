Will come to order. Members will take their seats. All other guests will
remove to the back of the room. Take any conversations outside. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, do you know who took the peppermints from the
podium? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think the peppermints were Representative
Stevens'. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright. If members will take their seats,
we'll move in to our next amendment, which you already have. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chair, I did not remove my gavel from the podium so I'll be
curious as to where it went. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Amendment ALU-17V3,
amendment 30. Sponsored by Representative Horne. Representative Horne,
you are recognized to present your amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you Mr. Chairman, I don't know how familiar folks in this room are about
with the child advocacy centers.
But the child advocacy centers in this state just this past year served
nearly six thousand eight hundred new cases. When I talk about child
advocacy centers, we're talking about services to kids. And of those six
thousand, nearly 800 cases, 75% of these were to kids 12 and under. And
75% of those were sexual abuse. Now you maybe familiar with what happens
when a child is sexually abused. They're interviewed by everybody. At
the worst possible time in their life. North Carlina is honored and I
think proud to have  26 of these centers across our state. They perform
an invaluable service to our state, to these kids, and to us by allowing
those kids to only have to go through relive these incidences once.
I've been in close contact with them. All I want to know is what do ya
have to have. Not what would you like to have, what do ya have to have
to operate? And I'm like several others in this room, are out raising
money for them well outside the government. What they need to operate is
$400 thousand dollars. We have in the budget, I think it's $3455. In
fact if you look on in the special provisions, I believe it's a page G1
Item 2. But in special provisions it's page 152, I think. I may be wrong
about that. My amendment, simply moves, 54 thousand 450 dollars to the
child advocacy centers from the, I'm trying to see where I pulled this
from, where is it. I pulled it from G1 Item 2.
And it goes to G5 for a child advocacy center. I request your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mr. Chair. I just wanted to know if we have designated physicians cause
G1 includes very specific positions that are being reduced. So does this
amendment tell us what additional positions being removed? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Is that a question to the amendment sponsor? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Or staff, either one. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright. If staff would approach
the mic, identify yourself and respond to the question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]
It's item 2 on G1. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Susan Jacobs, physical research.
Mr. Chairman, Representative Horne, members of committee, I think the
amendment is increasing the reduction on page G1, Item 2, which is a
historical...</p>

and the elimination of vacant positions so that would be the item that
would be being increased rather than item number one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Earle.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you.  I would certainly like to speak in favor
of the amendment.  I think you know over the years we have always funded
this.  This is a great need and the way it happens is that these
children don't have to be interviewed by three or four different
agencies and they’re under a lot of stress already and all I think we
certainly need to find as much money as possible to fund these programs
across state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Further comments, questions?  If not all, those in
favor of the amendment signify by saying aye.  All opposed no.  The ayes
have it and the amendment is agreed to.  The next amendment is ALG– 22,
v5.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mister Chairman?  May I ask a favor?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The lady wishes to be recognized.  What’s your
inquiry
please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Would you object to saying the sponsor’s name before
you give the number so that when we have more than one by the same
sponsor it’s easier to find?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   We can do that will if that will be helpful to the
member. This amendment is offered by Representative Cleveland, and it is
ALG– 22, v5 amendment number 33 and Representative Cleveland is
recognized to present his amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mister Chairman.  Most of this is
technical; I'll just run through it and pick out what’s going on line
five. the management flexibility reserve there was a five hundred
thousand dollar reduction given to the administrative part of the arts
program, the administrative part of the art grants program because the
resources came and asked for some change there to give them the
flexibility for half of that which we have done within the flexibility
to take the reductions administrative savings department wide.  Line ten
that is nothing more than a technical correction moving that position
instead of the first, Line thirteen, this is a reduction.  Items six is
a two hundred fifty thousand dollars that we would put up at line five
for reduction.  Line seventeen that is strictly a technical item to
balance state funding. Line twenty we’re combining two special
provisions on page 251 on the special provisions, items 19.3 and 19.4
and we are making it one special provision and that goes on down to line
31.  On the backside of the amendment.  The line one is removing things
that we moved up and combining the two special provisions.  Line three
removes special provision 20.4 and we’re going to replace that with the
item on line six, PD study of licensure fees and the Department of
Insurance and online thirty one Secretary of State asked that the date
be changed from one, October of thirteen one August of thirteen so and
the provision they had, they would have time to prepare for it and
appropriately address it and with that Mister Chairman I’ll take any
questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Cleveland are you rewriting your
budget?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  It’s not exactly ??   Questions, comments on the
amendment?   Seeing none all those in favorite of the amendment pleas
signify by saying aye.   Opposed no.  The ayes have it in and the
amendment is agreed to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   I'm just trying to keep as many people happy as I
can.

<p id="010:00">
All for that. Alright. The next amendment is offered by representative
Daughtry, amendment AST/102V4. This is amendment 28 and representative
Daughtry is recognized to present his amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. This amendment is supported by County
commission association and it has to do with the lottery formula that
was setup when the lottery was passed. A lot of people voted for the
lottery believing it was the education lottery and the funds were to be
divided. 50 percent going to the classroom of special needs children, 40
percent to school construction and 10 percent to scholarships.
Unfortunately, that didn't happen and a number of counties particularly
mine counted on that bill and when they got assorted build schools to
get the money from the lottery to help pay on the school bond. Because,
they didn't get the money they were promised, my county has to go into
reserves and cut spendings and they have been very agitated with this
body since the time we did not renege on our promise that was on the
bill. The budget takes out that provision that says 50-40-10 I just
talked about and what my bill does is keep that provision in and it
says, as it has for the last three years that not we are standing on
what we agreed to do. When the lottery was passed, the general assembly
still may take out funds and do what we originally planned. So it's not
great but it's keeping the language in statues so may be down the road
we can support our counties. I appreciate your support on adopting that
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Iler.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. A question for the amendment sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there anything on page 13 of special provisions Section 5.5G, is
there anything that changes the distribution below that line
particularly in the prekindergarten program A7A935, So forth does it
change all there or?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, it doesn't change any of that because that's being done not
withstanding these provisions. I wish it would change it but it doesn't,
what it does it says &quot;Not withstanding the fine we agreed on
50-40-10, we are gonna do this instead&quot;.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The way of explanation, the language Representative Dr. is addressing,
there was a distribution in the lottery. The general assembly for the
past several years have not been withstanding that language and then
appropriating accordingly.Okay?
In senate budget, the senate proposed simply removing the language that
we have not been withstanding for all these years and frankly we'll
probably be not withstanding for some time to come. What representative
Daughtry does is instead of taking the senate position and removing that
language moving forward, he wants to keep the status qua, let me
rephrase, he wants to keep the practice we have done last several years
that to not withstand the language as opposed to moving the language.
Representative Ramsey.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speaking in support of the amendment. I'd request that this committee
support this amendment. We understand we have been through several
difficult years and this is not a optimal distribution based on what we
have done in the past but in the end of the day when the lottery was
passed, it was intended to go on a 50-40-10 distribution and I think
that ought to be something in the future that we work to try to regain.
So I'd support this amendment and per say keeping this language in ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Conrad.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I also support Representative Daughtry's amendment. My county</p>

<p id="015:00">
Also, with counting on the 40% allocations from the lottery funds are
last bond referendum was the principal was $250 Million and we set a tax
rate that counted on the general assembly living up to the original
allocation promise. I do support the language, unfortunately, the $100
Million in the budget only represents about 22%, but we hope that that
would change in the future. Because, lower class sizes have really put a
burden down on the local government to build more bricks and mortar
classrooms for those children.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To be clear, and I think the representative referenced this, this
amendment will not change the distribution for the upcoming year.
Representative Horn.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Well, that's really my question. I know that its been stated and
restated that it won't change . . .
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
If it did, we would rule it out of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Okay. But, you added the caveat for the upcoming year and therefore does
this commit this general assembly to a distribution formula in
subsequent years?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I think generally speaking, the decision that would have to be made the
general assembly moving forward, if the language remains, is whether or
not to withstand the language in the future. That would be a decision
that you would have to make, essentially, on an annual basis whether or
not you're going to, not withstand, the language. Which is the reason
why the Senate took it out in the first place. I hope that answers the
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I thought. Representative Arp.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to speak in favor for the amendment. I
understand the financial reality is what we have to do with the budget.
But, my county and Union County was one of the fastest growing in the
state for many, many years. We had a 9% to 10% population growth. We
built buildings, schools with 30 year commitments and bonds. It was
based upon the promise distribution of the lottery. Many folks were
skeptical of the lottery proceeds going and being retained.
Unfortunately, that's where we are and I'm in support of this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Further . . . Representative Bumgarner.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to speak in favor of this
amendment also. I think that people should do what they say they're
going to do. If we said we were going to use the lottery money in this
formula, that's what should happen.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Further comment? All those in favor of the amendment please signify by
saying aye. All opposed no. The ayes have it and the amendment passes.
Next amendment, offered by Representative Faircloth. ALG-24 Version 1,
amendment 36. Representative Faircloth is recognized to present his
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Sir. This amendment speaks to a project that is going on, on
the borderline between Guilford and Forsyth County in our great state.
It is a project that comes together, bringing many people to the project
and a great, great number of them are veterans, veterans families,
survivors, etc. This request is for a world class, 8 acre field of
honor, that has already been planned, and funds have already been
gathered in great amount. To give you a feel for this, it will be titled
The Carolina Field of Honor, it's a $5 Million undertaking to construct
a large veteran memorial on approximately 8 acres in a park called Zyad
Park, that already is existing. There is a World Memorial Foundation,
which is a 501-C3 non-profit. That non-profit exists for one purpose and
that's to gather the funds necessary to build this memorial. It will
then step out of the picture, the memorial will then be operated by
Guilford and Forsyth Counties by a pre-existing agreement. To show you
the support locally there is a $250 Thousand joint</p>

Pledge by Greensborough Winston Salem and Highpoint, there's a pledge by
Curnersville $10000, there are, they raised about $3 million dollars
already, they expect to have the rest of that by the end of this year.
They have requested participation by the state, in the amount of 350
thousand dollars which is a very, based upon the other money that's been
raised, a very small amount. But it is a crucial part of getting this
attraction built by next year. I've requested that 350 thousand dollars
be appropriated as the state's contribution to this project. It would
come out of, and I'll give you the reference to that, the housing trust
fund. Would leave $6 million 650 thousand dollars in the housing trust
funds.
So it's a small hit on that. Be glad to answer any questions. But this
will be a world class attraction it will bring visitors and it also an
educational piece for children. I ask for your support. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Sho. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, I'm having
a bit of a problem. This $350 thousand dollars is coming out of the
Housing trust fund. And would it appears as though we're about to do is
about to open up that trust fund for some other folks to be start
picking and choosing at that. And I don't think we ought to be doing
that to our housing trust fund. That housing trust fund has been very
very good to the citizens of this state and out to remain in tact. I
hope you would not approve this, take away from that trust fund.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glaizer. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. And I'm really in support of
Representative Faircloth, what he's trying to do, but the fund is the
real problem. If we look at the budget, we've already are cutting trust
fund by a million dollars this year. And at a time when that money is
leveraging enormous private money in additional funds and federal funds
to create housing opportunities, including housing opportunities for a
lot of homeless veterans in my area. I think the project is worthwhile
and I would assume that the majority can find the 350 thousand dollars
somewhere but to take it from the housing trust fund, which leverages
that money in so many of our communities for a what amounts to a
memorial, doesn't strike me as a good exchange.
And not because I disfavor the project but because of where it's coming
from. I would be voting no and would recommend that we try to find some
other place for the money. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Avil, do you
wish to be recognized or passed at this time? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes,
maam. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I just have a question that maybe the staff, but
in the DOJ settlement, there was money from all different kinds of
places that was going help us create a housing slots for the people.
Would this be part of that money, or is this any part of that at all?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would ?? staff respond to that. I don't believe so.
Miss Denise Thomas and staff, if you would respond to that. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Avila that is not part of that money. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]
Representative Insko. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, this
housing trust fund is not part of the DOJ settlement but a great portion
of this money, some portion of this money goes to support housing for
disabled people. For people with mental illness, developmental
disabilities and other disabled people. And it is peaked this trust fund
at 10 million dollars in it. So it's been a fund that we have reduced
year after year. So I would hope that we would find the money for this
memorial, which is a very good project and I support but we would find
it some place else. And I would vote against this amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Faircloth
recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hearing the concern, would it be permissible to displace this and see if
can find the money elsewhere? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The amendment, at the
request of sponsor has been displaced. Next amendment is offered by
Representative Saine. AML-11 version 1, amendment 42. Representative
Saine, you are recognized to present your amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

Next amendment is offered by representative Insko, AMG-23 Version 2
AMG-23 Version 2, amendment number 45 and representative Insko is ?? ask
to explain the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, this
amendment actually returns money to our local health department to
fulfil an implement the charges that we give them that they legally
require to do, I see the health department is one of the few healthcare
providers that we have in the system that actually tries to keep people
healthy, their major goals are to improve the population health and
individual health, I think we heard a lot from our local health
department about how they are reducing their funds probably through ??
and probably through cuts that we made and diversions that we have made
from local health department we are eliminating the tobacco cessation
programs this year that this is ?? will eliminate services for pregnant
women's health, as so this deletes a new appropriation to Carolina
pregnancy care fellowships, these are crisis intervention systems that
cancel pregnant women to fulfil their pregnancy and I think I don't have
a problem what that during that at all but these crisis ?? provides some
ultrasounds, and some other testing that is health care related, but
they are not medical facilities, 92% of them have no medical staff on
board at all, they tend not to identify themselves as agencies they
amply that they are medical facilities. They also incorrectly state the
26% of them have been founded incorrectly state that abortions leads
breast cancer, so I support having our tax dollars go to agencies that
have a standard a medical standard that we can depend on and ?? wanna
fund these agencies I would like first to make sure that that that that
we have that their license people in some ways we have a standard to
measure them by and so I hope that you will appreciate your support for
this amendment to return this money to our local health department to
implement the programs they already have in place. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Stam  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman members
committee I would of course oppose the amendment this money of course is
in the senate budget, its for crisis pregnancy centres and I really
frankly don't know why the abortion clinics are so afraid to have
pregnancy support centres surrounding them, their are about 80 in the
state, their staffed mostly by volunteers or people working on very low
wages, they give good information on the ??, we past two years ago the
women's right to no-act and frankly you may not know this some of the
clinics are sending women to the support centres to have 24 hour
information because they know its good, they were ?? with them, its a
small amount of money, its a just a what they need to barely survive
these are the people who are putting their own lives and treasure and
resources on the line to help women in trouble. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Evelyn [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman I too
would like to ask that you not support this amendment, I think the
Representative Stam spoken eloquently as to the reasons why, I believe
everybody has idea of what government should do for its citizens should
be honoured and this is one of our way of doing this [SPEAKER CHANGES]

<p id="030:00">
at all. My concern is that we continue to take money away from programs
that already counsel women who are pregnant. We should be, actually, if
we really want to help pregnant women we should be expanding our
healthcare access to that through insurance, through expanding our
Medicaid. I favor giving services to women to continue their pregnancy.
I think that's important, but I don't think that we should be doing it
by robbing programs that are already in existence and already very
successful that are a part of our public sector essential services, So
that's my concern with this amendment. I'm not familiar with some of the
things that are already been stated. I support our local Health
Departments and we have taken too much money away from them for the
programs that they have already now. We're hearing from our local Health
Departments that they need this money.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Arp.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to speak on a couple of issues. In our
county we actually have a very good crisis pregnancy center that works
in conjunction with the Health Department. In many times they have
referrals that come to that health department, or from the Health
Department to the CPC. The second thing was asserted in support of this
that somehow there's unlicensed practice of medical activities going on.
That is just simply not the case. In every CPC that undertakes anything
regarding medical practice there is a doctor, who is maybe a volunteer
or something, but has medical charge over the nurses. And I just
strongly oppose the assertion that that's not and ask you to vote
against the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Mr...
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Farmer-Butterfield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I'd like to ask you a question, Mr. Chair, and it's probably relevant to
staff and maybe Representative Stam. How many crisis support centers are
there in the state like this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Staff wish to respond, if they have the answer? Does Representative Stam
have a response to the lady's question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Approximately 80. Although, sort of depends on how you count, but
approximately 80.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Why are we trying to give funding to just this one?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Oh, this is an umbrella group that will distribute the money to the
other 80. This is not going to one group.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Is this similar to what Planned Parenthood was doing, and what's the
difference?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Stam, you want to respond to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I can't think of any similarities to what Planned Parenthood is doing.
These is people giving care, you know, helping people get baby
bassinets, and clothes, and food, and medical care for people who want
to continue a pregnancy. Hand of Hope Ministry in Fuquay-Varina, Care
Net, Gateway, Durham Pregnancy Support Services, Chapel Hill Pregnant...
Every major city has this, but even, I was at a fundraiser dinner in
Hertford County, or where ever Ahoskie is, a year ago and the place was
filled with people contributing their money to take care of women in
crisis pregnancies.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up. Statement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up or just statement?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Statement. I'm not going to ask any more questions of Representative
Stam or anyone else on this. I do want to say that we eliminated funding
for Planned Parenthood and we're now talking about giving funding to
support centers to distribute to other crisis centers for pregnancies,
and I think that this amendment is important and we need to put that
money within the Health Department as the amendment recommends.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Just for clarity, I think this budget is silent with regard to Planned
Parenthood.
Representative Mobley.
Representative Insko, did you have another...?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yes. I'd like to speak a second time please. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I
didn't mean to imply that, well let me just say, so it's clear that we
have some crisis pregnancy centers that do a very good job and they work
with our health departments. That actually makes my point that they
don't all do that. If we had a procedure in place where we had standards
and licensing for these agencies then they would all measure up to be
like the good ones are right now. My concern is they don't all measure
up and we don't have any way of knowing that our tax dollars will be
distributed to the one</p>

[Speaker changes.] Representative Fulghum?
[Speaker changes.] Of all the agencies involved in crisis pregnancy
management, Representative Stam, Representative?????? mentioned, these
are public, not government, versions of how to take care of these kinds
of problems. This money has to be highly leveraged. I have no idea what
the total amount of money is being spent on these programs around the
state but there's very little doubt, this is seed money and this is a
very, very small percentage of their total budget and I can't imagine a
great leverage that we can do than to help these people do what they do
so well and keep it private.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Whitmire?
[Speaker changes.] Speak on the amendment a second time.
[Speaker changes.] You're recognized.
[Speaker changes.] Earlier, my questions were exactly concerned with
where the money might go...and, with the Carolina Pregnancy Fellowship,
I'll simply share this. Nonprofit pro-life organization committed to
equip, encourage and network pregnancy care ministries of North
Carolina...and, with that, I ask that you oppose the amendment.
[Speaker changes.] Further discussion...all those in favor of the
amendment, please signify by saying &quot;aye&quot;.  (Ayes.) All those
opposed, no. (No's.) The no's have it and the amendment fails.
[Speaker changes.] The next amendment offered by Representative Lucas is
Amendment AMK-25V1. AMK-24V1. Amendment 40 offered by Representative
Lucas and Representative Lucas, you are recognized to present your
amendment.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chair. This amendment attempts to
place some money back into the Text Book Fund. Most of you are probably
aware that we have really been bleeding the Text Book and Supply fund
for the last four-five years and it's now reached a point where we have
now provided about one...less that one-fourth of adequate money for text
books. We know that we are rapidly moving to digital learning but we're
not there yet. We are making great strides and we're trying to get there
but we haven't arrived.  We still have many children who lack the
connectivity and broad-band necessary to really work into the digital
divide. Many of our poor students, even if they had connectivity and
broad-band, would not have personal computers to really take
advantage...and won't have that personal textbook.  If they don't have
that security blanket, a textbook, to take home, I'm afraid that their
education's gonna suffer. Now we recognize that this is a tight budget,
very tight...and we have really, really searched the budget, tryin' to
find a place to secure our textbook funding. It's dropped now from what
is considered to be one-hundred-and-nine million dollars to be
adequate...even with this amendment...would still only be about
twenty-eight point two million, still only about a fourth of what we
would need to adequately supply textbooks.  Our children's education is
gonna' suffer.  I regret where we're havin' to take the fund from and
that is the teacher insurance fund but, we hope that we won't need it.
Appreciate your support.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Blackwell.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chairman. The co-chairs of the Ad
Appropriations Committee would urge the committee not to approve this
amendment. We added this liability insurance protection at no cost....

…to school employees in previous budget. In an era in which raises for
our teachers are sometimes hard to come by, this is a benefit for
everybody employed in the school system, that we think is worthwhile and
ought to be maintained.
Now we understand that textbooks need to be funded and we’re pleased
that the lottery is setting aside some money. As I mentioned earlier
this morning as we were presenting the education budget that we are
going to have some more money from that source to transition into more
digital and online resources as we move away from hard copies.
But the other two things that this amendment would undo that I think are
mistakes. The program that has been demonstrated by studies done through
UNC, to be most effective in terms of the teacher’s having the most
positive impact on student performance, is Teach for America.
And on line 17 of this amendment, if you will see the reference to
deleting item 26, that is reducing or eliminating the additional half
million dollars that would go to Teach for America, to expand that most
successful program.
Even though we’re in an era of strict budgeting, we need to try to take
some initiatives as well as simply holding the line. And we would urge
you not to cancel out that small increase in the most effective teacher
source, in order to put some money back into textbooks.
Finally if you’ll look at line 19 through 22, this amendment also
removes money that was put there to benefit the counties in this state
that are rural and have lowest performing students. It would be a pilot
program that only involves slightly over a half million dollars, to help
provide additional options for students in those counties. And the
concept is that in those counties, this money would help provide the
personnel to guide and help to develop other school options in the form
of charter schools, where they don’t exist.
Charter schools typically are in a lot of our urban areas and more
metropolitan counties. You have more highly educated people there. You
have more businesses there that can provide people who can help to
explain and set these things up. This would be a program that is
designed to help provide that kind of assistance in areas of the state
that are in fact the most needy because of the lower performance of
their students.
And I would urge the committee not to adopt this amendment, and to get
rid of the good things in the form of liability insurance, an increase
in Teach for America, and the rural charter accelerator program, to put
a few dollars back in the textbook fund.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lucas?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative Blackwell would yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Will the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Blackwell. I too share your
zest to work with those students who have the least. And I think we both
have that in common. But can you share with me how a student who has no
access to the digital divide, and then we cut the textbook fund to the
limit that he won’t have a textbook to take home, how this student is
expected to get an education?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think there are two responses to that,
Representative Lucas. This budget allows, I would say maximum
flexibility to local school districts to move funds as they feel are
most important for their particular school system. With the exception of
being able to move money into the central office, or to move money on a
way that would violate federal requirements that are associated with the
receipt of federal funds. Thus, if a school…</p>

...system has a continuing pronounced problem that it can't offer
digital instruction and devices and so forth. It has the option of
transferring other dollars within its budget to fund textbooks if that
is what is most important to them. However, as I said earlier, some of
the lottery funds we're glad are being dedicated to this digital process
and a significant concern with that, as well I think, as with some
legislation that Representative Horn has helped to pilot through the
House this year, is designed to continue working on matters of
connectivity and access throughout the State. So through a combination
of the flexibility and the budget, and the additional resources coming
from lottery and the initiatives that we're taking to work on spreading
the ability for students to access even at home and not just in their
schools, we believe we're moving in the right direction.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry I'm not seeing the individual.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just wanted to address the liability insurance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll come right back to you, Representative Hastings.
Representative Hastings.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just have to say in my little town of Cherryville,
where I live, I have numerous teachers come up to me and tell me that
they had never been able to afford liability insurance and when we went
through and analyzed this and provided the FT's the liability insurance
for about $16 per FTE, when they were having to send approximately $400
off to the NCAE and the NEA, I just think it would be a bad mistake to
remove what we tried to do to better things for our teachers and school
personnel. This liability insurance for our teachers and school
personnel was in fact a pay raise for many of those teachers and other
personnel. I would not remove the liability insurance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion? All those in favor of the
amendment say aye, opposed no. The no's have it and the amendment fails.
We're going back to the amendment offered by Representative Glazier.
This is now Amendment 25A. And it's ALE-34 V1, ALE-34 V1. And
Representative Glazier is recognized for another shot.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And this is the nurses master
pay. And I work with Representative Horn and the co-chairs. And where
this takes it from in the second year, if you'll notice in the book,
we've been able to reduce the discretionary cut, I think by about seven
point some million, with a clear understanding that since it's in the
second year, we'll be able to find that $200,000 in a different way in
the following year. And I do not know of any opposition to the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McGrady.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier has stated it well. We support
the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All in favor of the amendment, please signify by
saying aye. Opposed no. The ayes have it and the amendment is agreed to.
The next amendment is offered by Representative Whitmire. It is AMK-19

present his amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Very briefly, what this
amendment does, it takes that vouchers opportunity scholarships and puts
the money for that back in ADM so it best effects the classroom of 87%
of our students in the State. You've all heard my thoughts in terms of
the efficacy of how the funding actually works, having gone through it
and having to make drastic cuts to the school board chairman for year
after year, after year in some very high performing systems. I want you
to think of these two thoughts as you consider how you vote and I ask
that you support this amendment. When the middle class goes to the poles
and they realize we heard all about the voucher bill, but I didn't
qualify. And I know that it grows, grows exponentially over time, but
then when they get to that point over time, they realize that the
capacity, especially in the rural areas of private schools which serve
less than 4% of the...</p>

$4,200 a year would actually work for and for those that do have
capacity in my area, in West North Carolina general, they range from
$14,000 - $25,000 a year. The final thought’s this, I support these
schools absolutely wholeheartedly and I have talked to many of them in
my area recently. Do we think that Christian schools want government
bureaucrats setting the standards and making demands on them? Absolutely
not. What we have here is the potential for an absolute Trojan horse
that brings government into a private setting and ultimately undermines
and compromises what those schools stand for in the first place. I ask
you to support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Horn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I certainly appreciate
Representative Whitmire’s enthusiasm and strong support for public
schools. Can’t say that we look particularly as kindly toward rewriting
the entire K-12 education budget as this amendment does, where it
addresses supplies and cuts and addresses flex cuts, addresses DPI cuts.
We would encourage the appropriations committee to vote against this
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bryan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Let me make a few points.
Obviously as one of the bill’s sponsors for house bill 9944, which is a
bipartisan bill, filed with Representative Brandon, Hanes and Brown. I’m
a fan of the bill and let me tell you why I disagree with the amendment
and with Representative Whitmire’s comments. I think the opportunity
scholarship bill does three very significant things that are what we
should be all about. It saves money, it improves public schools and it
improves student outcomes. And despite all the rhetoric and concern, we
have the State of Florida who’s been running a program , which our
program is largely modeled on. That program’s been running for ten
years. The sky has not fallen and in fact the exact opposite has
happened. Florida has saved millions of dollars. I think they’re set
this year to save about $57 million dollars. Their public schools have
improved and their student outcomes have improved, in particular we can
see in studies that have been done. There have been 23 studies on the
impact of public schools of having choice programs. Twenty two of those
studies show that public schools actually improved. One study showed no
impact. No negative studies. These are the gold standard random
assignment type studies. On student outcomes, 12 different studies have
been done. One of them showed no impact on student improvement, 11
showed positive student outcomes. That’s on achievement but it’s also on
attainment. More kids matriculated in college, more high school
diplomas. That’s been the impact of school choice and that’s what the
impact will be of this house bill. It is in size, a small program.
Effectively you could call it a pilot program in that you only have
about a half of one percent of students that will initially be able to
use this but those are the students that are most in need and most
desire an opportunity, a chance that they have not been given. It’s not
a silver bullet to fix all of our educational problems but it is one
piece of the educational puzzle that parents and their students need. I
ask you to vote against the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brandon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. I was also a proud sponsor of the
bill. I would like for you to also oppose this amendment. I think it’s
very important to know that my colleague Representative Bryan let you
know about the programs in Florida but folks we have a very similar
program in Charlotte, NC. It does basically the same exact thing with
much, much, much less money and providing access and opportunity to a
number of kids that are in the same demographic in Charlotte. I think if
we need to be very careful when we hear the rhetoric that people won’t
be able to access…</p>

Speaker: Scholarship we have been doing it the community had been doing
it for years and years and years and years and you an see private school
after private school this is not necessary like Representative whit more
say talking about fourteen fifteen thousand dollar schools if a parent
chooses ??? i guess that's OK but we are talking about private schools
and other organizations that have been taking care this demographic for
number of years and this is just give up one more step and if you guys
wanna look at scholarship program ?? you can see that this is a great
access for lot of folks and for lot of folks that in community need some
type of opportunity some type of choose i urge that you  please oppose
this amendment and give dignity and respect to parents all across state
who needed choice thank you,
Speaker Changes: Representative ?? thank you Mr chairman in addition to
the remarks that Representative whit more has made also would like to
support this amendment fro three reasons one i think this a major shift
in education and i think it's a debate we need to have but i do not
believe that it need to be in the budget i think it is separate ?? that
is need to be debated and discussed however turns out will more forward
from there so i think for that reason because of the policy it does not
need to be in the budget and ?? i believe our local school districts
will have been hit hard already they are already doing more or less
they are already doing the best that they can do with the needle with
the funds and to take more funds out of public schools is something i
opposed to and finally I'll be brief i believe in free markets i believe
in competitions but but do not believe vouchers that make fifth grade
teachers and new elementary across no elementary work harder than their
already working i think they had already given it all they have so for
those three reasons i will support this amendment and i would encourage
to do the same thank you Mr.Chairman,
Speaker Changes:Representative Samuelson,
Speaker Changes:thank you Mr.Chairman members about two weeks ago my
husband an i gt invited by the fundraiser for a christian school ??
culturally diverse community they have throb the community for raising
money from people like me to help them and to support for the
scholarship program they have for students however they are excepting
the demands to exceeds and ?? because they need things like this
opportunity scholarship when we showed they said oh ?? excited we
already know soon kids struggling in school already right now need this
kind of environment and only with like this opportunity  scholarship can
provide them a place in our school so i do ask that you oppose the
amendment to just do ?? current division rate is under $5400 so with
this scholarship they can easily raise the money ?? they can afford to
have this children count ?? it's not a $54 school it's a $5400 school
that meets the needs of kids often don't have the kinds of options as
they rest of the have the urge to oppose the amendment ,
Speaker Changes:Representative Adam ,
Speaker Changes: thank you Mr.Speaker i want to speak and support the
amendment i here lot about opportunities ?? like the Representative over
there who just spoken they have the dollars to provide for the students
i think that they have to i don't think they need to continue to rate
our public schools if you want to make to the private school that the
choice you make apparent and i will still continue to stay that these
parents we are talking about the lowest end of the scales will not have
the funds to make this opportunity a real opportunity for children so
the children that bill proposes to will not be supported i was opposed
to that bill and I'm supporting this amendment because it would correct
the action taken before and i hope that you would support the amendment
,
Speaker Changes: Representative whit more
Speaker Changes: thank you me chair to speak a second time on the
amendment,
Speaker Changes: the gentlemen is recognized,
Speaker Changes: folks i have great respect for the sponsors of this
bill and that is been stated to them personally many times their intend
were always genuine,</p>

... means of doing it. I just have to emphasize that I have great
concern because, being in an area where parents invest time in their
schools, in making them better. This in effect serves more as an escape
than it does as a help. And, this has not had a full house vote. It's in
the budget, as with a couple other things that... it hadn't been fully
vetted. So that's why with that I will rest my case and ask Mr. Chair
for a showing of the ayes and the nos and we conclude the debate,
please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ayes and nos have been requested. Representative ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Everybody knows that I've
spent my life in public education. And, I think this is a step in the
wrong direction. For two reasons, we've just taken out of the budget all
the policy items that the Senate put in. And, here we are putting in the
same kind of things. It is inappropriate and we should not be doing
that, and I urge you to support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative ??
Thank you Mr. Chairman. It takes a lot for me to speak on this type of
issue, but I finally had to step up a little bit. And, I couldn't
disagree more about the gentlemen who are saying this shouldn't be in
the budget. So to me this is an underhanded way to defang 944 before it
even gets off the ground. And, so I really do not agree with the
amendment. And, the funding should be in the budget. And, it can always
not be used if 944 doesn't pass, but obviously if
944 passes and becomes law then there's no funds at that point. So...
and the argument that very few people can take advantage of it... that
it's going to destroy public schools... you can't make both of those
arguments at the same time. I'm sorry it's not logical at all. So, if
very few people use it, then it's not going to have any effect. And if a
lot of people use it, it still won't destroy public schools because it's
the law of percentages, as someone's already
mentioned. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative L Hall
Thank you Mr. Chairman. And, I'll speak briefly... won't reiterate the
points that have already been made about the drain on public school
system resources that would happen or the unfairness of having a major
policy shift happen in the budget without full discussion. But, I will
assert this. Those families out there who might would qualify for this
type of assistance, those who already
have their children in school in programs that may have run out of
resources or no longer eligible for whatever assistance program they're
on... they would be disclosed from or foreclosed from participating in
the program. And, so for some reason we're creating now two tiers in
addition to taking money from public schools where these families will
have to go back to should they lose the other support. So, I'm gonna
support the amendment. I hope you will, too.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative ??
Thank you Mr. Chairman. We've talked about technicalities in here and we
haven't had a chance to  discuss this, and if anybody believes that
vouchers haven't been discussed for a few years  hasn't been awake. The
state has a responsibility to educate our children. Our kids had an
option. We could have sent them to private schools. We chose the public
schools because our schools
were such that the kids got a good education. Now there were a few years
I had to kinda monitor things a lot. And that wasn't the fault of the
school, in whole. But our kids got a good education. That's not the case
in a lot of our public schools. We might as well admit that. And I don't
feel like that we are doing our children justice by not using our tax
dollars to move them into a school where they can get the education that
they need. These are the children that we're talking about. We're
talking about children who simply can not get what it is they need in
our  public schools. The schools that we fund in general can't be
everything to everybody. And we're gonna have to have the opportunities
for those children who need specialized education  whether it's small
classrooms or certain emphasis or certain types of teaching. And we are
not doing our children the justice by crippling them and not being able
to put them in an environment  and get them educated for becoming
productive citizens. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative ??
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Just to speak briefly. What concerns me
basically about this is that this is a situation you say that everybody
can take advantage of about $4200 even on a $5400...</p>

<p id="065:00">
Some folks can’t afford that. But what’s more disturbing is the areas
where you don’t have the opportunity for those kids to become enrolled
in a private institution. There are places down east that don’t have
these schools in the area. What are you going to do with all those kids
who can’t do that? If you were really going to open up this thing, then
what you should do is you should at least provide what it costs for us
to educate a child in our public school system rather than if you did-
?? what it cost us. You ought to put that kind of money in a scholarship
program for them to be able to take advantage of it. I don’t care what
you say, I look every day during this season of the year, a lot of the
private schools are running pictures of their classes. And I look at a
lot of them in the paper, I looked at one this morning out of about 102
graduates, there were maybe 8 dark faces, the same color as me, in that
picture. There was one run the other week on a school that was not quite
as expensive as the one that ran this morning, there were only 3 faces
out of 98 that took advantage. And the final thing on this is that
unfortunately these schools, they’re not like charter schools. Charter
schools at least get the money for educating those kids. But here these
schools cherry pick. I mean, let’s face it folks, if you don’t cut it in
those schools, you’re out. It’s just that way. In order to get in the
school you’ve got to be able to meet the standards of that school to get
in. How do you get in if you’re saying our public schools are failing
us, how do you get in to those schools? And if you get in there, how do
you stay in ‘em? This $4,200 you’re giving is nothing but a mere
pittance, a mere taking-away of $4,200 that could be used in our
schools. Why don’t we go ahead and put what we need into our public
system to make our schools even better than some of those schools that
you want to put these kids in?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Elmore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would just like to speak
about the amendment. Since this is appropriations, I would like to talk
about the actual financial side of it. A concern of mine that I have is
that this policy has been stated as saving money, and I’m concerned with
the ADM adjustment if we can actually predict that. In Education
subcommittee I was hoping to draw up an amendment that would save money
dealing with this, only applying Opportunity Scholarships to Wake and
Mecklenberg County. But after it was ran through our formulas it was
found that that would cost an additional $8 million of appropriation to
be able to cover it. So a concern that I have is our estimates with the
ADM adjustment with these Opportunity Scholarships, if they could be
accurate, if that’s a true number that we could actually use, are we
going to have a short-fall with it that has to be back field. I don’t
know if all of that has been panned out yet with this policy change, and
that’s a concern of mine. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insco.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Members, every year since
I’ve been a member of the General Assembly, with the exception of the
last few years, Republicans and Democrats alike joined together to take
steps to improve educational opportunities for our children. We started
Smart Start and ?? Four. We gave star ratings to our daycare centers. We
increased our childcare subsidy. We had drop-out prevention programs. We
expanded our teacher training programs. We had superb teacher
development programs go on. We saw the achievement gap beginning to
close, and our school ratings- the quality of our public school
education across the state improved. I don’t know why we are stopping
our efforts to improve public education. I don’t know why the advances,
the success that we’ve had in these programs that are paying off—our
public schools are getting better—I don’t understand why we aren’t
continuing on that same track of making our schools better every year.
You’re never going to have schools that you think are perfect, you’re

[Speaker changes.]...we've been successful. It is very distressing to
see us now taking steps to undermine...intentionally undermine and put
at a disadvantage, our public school system that is responsible for
serving every child. I believe every one of these scholarships that will
be used...all the money that is available will be used but it will go to
parents...and I would just add that there are schools that have a...good
schools that have lower than $15,000 or $20,000 tuition. The Durham
School for Children is a very good school...it's tuition is not...it's
below $10,000 a year so those schools do exist. But, by and large,
across the state, the tuition is higher and, in those schools that are
private schools, they don't have buses to pick up children so working
parents have to arrange for their children to get transportation.  There
are often extra expenses like paying for your athletic uniforms, paying
for field trips...it's not all free plus schools already...private
schools already give tuition waivers to bright minority students that
are academically gifted that they want in their student body...and they
already give tuition waivers to athletes that they want and many of
these voucher programs will go to those students that already have been
admitted. I don't have any problem with people sending their children to
private schools.  My grandchildren attend private schools and we're
happy to pay our taxes to have our children go to public schools so I
think it's 'specially...at this time, when we have, we're just beginning
to enlarge our STEM programs and concentrate on the jobs of the future
through our public school system...that this is not the time to take
away resources from that system and I urge you to vote for the
amendment.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Glazier...and if I can ask the
indulgence of the members to speak briefly. We have probably 35 more
amendments so unless you wanna be here past midnight, it would be
wonderful if you could be &quot;presbyterian&quot; with your comments.
(Laughter.)
[Speaker changes.] Well, that may be more difficult for me than others,
Mister Speaker. (Laughter.)
[Speaker changes.] We're good to go here, Mister Chairman. Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Glazier, we will grant you some
latitude.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chairman and I will try to be
brief.
[Speaker changes.] ??????????? good to go, Mister Chairman.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Chairman, it seems to me, right now, we are
having a terribly difficult time as a General Assembly, and I know the
Chairs are struggling to fund our first system of public education. It
seems really inappropriate time to start trying to fund a second system
of public education...or a second system of education. I can't improve
on a number of the comments, particularly those by Representative
Dobson, Representative Elmore and Representative Whitmire but we're not
putting in this budget a raise for teachers, who are demoralized this
year...after a number of years by both Democrats and Republicans of not
funding teacher raises, we're not attacking at all the discretionary cut
which has hampered badly, because of the recession, the school
system...and there's no question at all but that vouchers will increase
the cost past this first year, over the next several years. In addition,
I really think that the problem with vouchers as it's expressed is
summed up in the percentages. This bill talks about...as I
remember...130% free and reduced or poverty level, which is a good thing
even if you can believe that those students will be able to make up the
difference of the 5000 they need for elementary or the 6000 more for
middle or the 7000 more for high school, which is the average of what
they need, but Representative Whitmire may have hit the point...what do
you say to all those people who earn fifty or sixty thousand dollars,
have three kids and want this option that your tax dollars will go not
to their kids.  Well, I think that the real answer to that came when the
original bill was drafted, which had a 300% level and that was the true
intent and we all know that was gonna move to four and five hundred
percent because that was where this was scheduled to go. Only because of
trying to cobble together votes has it been reduced to the real poverty
level children and we know, based on the data, that those are not the
children who are likely going to  seriously be able to access in most
places and, even if they get the scholarship, will private schools for
that ....</p>

Amount of money adequately and give children a sound education who are
ADD and ADHD and rheumatoid arthritis and all of the hard to educate
children who cost far more than that. And so we need ourselves coming
and going here. We don't have enough in it to make a difference. When we
put more in it we are really doing exactly what many of us fear which is
trying to fund a whole new system of education. And so wherever you fall
on this, as a matter of policy it's complex and wherever you fall on
this in the end timing is everything. Governing is about the scarce
allocation of resources and in the end this is not the year to be
funding a voucher program even if we make this public policy choice. And
I would urge us to adopt the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. I want to speak briefly against
the amendment. It's been interesting to sit and watch the debate for the
amendment because we're taking entirely too much from public schools and
yet we're not doing enough that will send it out away from here. As a
parent I was fortunate enough to live in Surrey county where we have
three school systems and they're competitive against each other. They
may as well somewhat be private schools because the two city schools
will compete against each other and the county schools are trying to
keep up. So I had the advantage of my children were at a school that was
much more intimate in its discussion.
Now as my children have grown one wants to be in a population of total
university population of 1600, the other one's at a university that's 80
to 100,000 people. There's a difference in children that parents
recognize as to whether they need more one on one instruction which
these tuition scholarships would give or these vouchers would give,
whereas others could function well in whatever school it is.The people
who argue that it's only going to cherry pick, well I'm sorry if parents
are involved enough to get their children to these schools then those
children should have the benefit. This is about the children, not about
a system, not about the traditional public schools. This is about what's
best for each and every one of those individual children.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry, Representative Bryan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. To speak a second time. I just
want to make a couple of follow-up comments. First with respect to cost
just to be clear our own fiscal note on the state and local combined
savings over a five year period shows about $40 million dollars in
savings. So when you talk about money and what you're going to do with
money if you don't vote against this amendment you will have less money,
so let's be clear, you will have less money for your public schools. All
the studies that have been done on choice programs show savings,
savings. The second point. Okay, I think I'm good now. The second point
with respect to access, people have made a lot of comments about whether
or not kids will be able to use the scholarship.
Florida again started this program ten years ago. They started with
about 10,000 students and just FYI they have not changed their income
limits, it's in the roughly 185% to 225% of federal poverty guidelines
range over that ten year period. Haven't changed their income limits but
the number of students utilizing the scholarship which has gone from
about a $3500 dollar scholarship to about a $4100 dollar scholarship
this year has gone from 10,000 to over 50,000. And they are schools that
are serving those students needs. And remember again just when you think
about the savings there are all these schools out there. The brick and
mortar is not paid for by us. The transportation and all these other
things are not paid for by us but these students are able to utilize it.
Let me encourage you to vote against the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Riddell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Folks I've been listening to
the debate on this for quite some time now and I have not spoken to the
committee about it but it's time for me to be heard on this. I am very
thankful that we have something like the opportunity scholarship coming
forward and I oppose the amendment brought by my good friend and seat
mate representative Whitmire. It was said in a previous committee
meeting that this is robbing Peter to pay for Paul. Unfortunately there
are some pockets of education, public education in our state where...</p>

<p id="080:00">
Peter has been robbing Paul and Paul’s child of a sufficient education
and we have many programs that we have put in place to help
disadvantaged children, to help them get a good public education.  We
have the Disadvantaged Student Supplemental Fund, there’s the Low Wealth
Supplement, there’s the Small County Supplement, there’s the At-Risk
Student Services, there’s the Improving Student Accountability and many
many more that we have either put in place in the past or that are
currently in place.  But there are some schools where these programs are
not doing the job.  We cannot take children who are in a high poverty
situation, where there’s high teacher turnover or low student
performance and leave them there without any hope.  The Opportunity
Scholarship, friends, it provides them an opportunity to succeed and get
them out of a school where they have no hope.  And rather than
consigning them to a future of failure or mediocrity or getting involved
in gangs and end up in crime and in jail, you give them the hope for an
education.  You give them the hope of a future that will help them
amount to something and be a benefit to the community and a blessing to
their parents.  This is a good, good step that we’re making here with
public education, the Opportunity Scholarship.  I would encourage you,
please vote down the amendment.  This is simply keeping children from
getting access to the education that they deserve.  Thank you.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  Representative Presnell.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes, I have a
question for Representative Whitmire.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman
yield?  [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] I really wanted to
vote for this amendment, but I do want to point out on line 17, it says
reduces the state support for the department of public instruction
operations, including salaries and benefits by 2.5%, and I just wanted
you to explain that.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] In looking at the physical note
in the math, which I take great issue with because it doesn’t account
for fixed cost and a whole lot of things that turn into rather creative
math.  But I’ll give absolute credit where credit is due to the bill’s
sponsors.  We had to come up with the difference.  You take away so much
and you think if you just put it back in it would be the same, but
that’s where they say it saves money, and it does not.  I can attest to
that.  So we had to look for places and with that	, the DPI cut which,
you know, everything is doing more and more and more with less.  That
additional cut to DPI would put the House budget the same as the Senate
budget when it comes to DPI, and when it comes to instructional
supplies, look at many things, and yes there are many things that are
hurting for funds.  But that was the least of those that I, and others,
many others in this room came to the consensus to pick the instructional
supplies.  Now there is a couple provisions that Friday we were able to
put a little bit back into instructional supplies, we mitigated a little
bit.  If you go into the next year, you will find that that takeaway
actually gets replenished almost double.  So in the two year, it
actually comes up better but we had to do that in order to make the
numbers work.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Stam.   [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  Thanks Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.  Of course I
oppose the amendment.  Math includes addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division and I know a little bit of algebra, but for
this, you really don’t need that.  If you take- and I’ve shared this
information with many of the people who have spoken for this amendment.
They forget when you divide  	you have a numerator and a denominator.
If you take money away from the numerator but don’t take it away from
the denominator, you can pretend you’re losing money.  But if you change
the denominator, you find out that after the Opportunity Scholarships
pass, the traditional public schools next year will have an additional
$1.30 per pupil.  In the second year they’ll have an additional $7 and
some cents per pupil.  And the LEA’s will save about $7 or $8 per pupil
beginning in year two.  So, if your decision is based on support for the
public schools, if that’s your reason, the fiscal impact, you will vote
no on this amendment.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  The question before the
committee is the passage of the amenment division. Roll call having been
requested, the clerk will call the roll.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Adams.

&lt;h3&gt;MN-28 V2. AMM-28 V2 Amendment 23 offered by Representative
Pittman. Representative Pittman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. This amendment simply would remove the eugenics
payment plan from the budget and from policy. And if I could just
comment on that. They say that the road to hell is paved with good
intentions and I don't doubt the good intentions of this eugenics
conversation plan. I'm very sympathetic to the reasons for the people
supporting that. Eugenics was a horrible crime that it didn't just occur
in North Carolina or across the United States, it was an international
crime. There were people who were involved in it, I believe, who thought
they had good intentions but were very misgauged. But behind them there
were people who knew exactly what they were doing who were evil people.
People like Adolph Hitler, and Joseph Mengel and Heinrich Himler. The
Heinrich Himler's American friend Margaret Singer. And I would favor
holding perpetrators of that crime responsible if we could get to them.
Many of them are dead and gone, there's nothing we can really do about
them now, and I really wish that something had been done like this if it
was going to be done at the time that we did away with the eugenics
plan. That would've been the proper time. But I don't believe most of
those people are still around and I certainly don't think there's
anybody in the legislature today who is serving when all of that was
going on. I know some of you have been here a long time but I don't
think you've been here that long. It's today's tax payers that we paying
for this. Today's tax payers are not responsible. In 1974 I believe it
was when we entered into North Carolina I was 20 years old, I was in
college, and I think I was aware of what went on in Nazi Germany but I
wasn't aware we did this in North Carolina at that time. A lot of people
have been born long after this was all over with. I mean my own children
the oldest one was born in 1980. We have a lot of tax payers in this
state today who had nothing to do with this, they weren't around when it
happened, they're not responsible for it and as I recall from the bible
we're told we don't punish children, they're not responsible, for their
parent's crimes. So I feel like we would be putting a burden on people
who were not even responsible for this program to pay the compensation
for it. And I don't think that that's the right thing to do. Plus I
believe it sets a bad precedent and would open the door for others to
seek the same kind of compensation. Opening sort of a Pandora's Box.
Besides all that, I think 10 million dollars is not really likely to be
sufficient anyway. There may be more than the 200 that are estimated.
And it may lead to expensive litigation costing more than the 10 million
dollars in addition to many more will probably crawl out of the woodwork
trying to get compensation for their grievances. So lo and behold, there
was an injustice that was done that we deeply regret, that we abhor and
I understand the feeling of wanting to do something about that. But I
don't believe that we can wipe away that injustice that was done by
creating another injustice of holding people accountable who had nothing
to do with it. And so I would appreciate if you would support this
amendment and remove this from our budget. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Pierce.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Don't want to inflame anybody with any remarks
that I might make I surely would not do that, but we have some hurting
people crossing off who have been hurt by this program and we need to
make those people whole surely we cannot really pay them for all that
they've been through, but I think we need to make an attempt, and this
would be just one way to get this behind us. It would always be in our
memories and in all kinds of our state, but this is one way to put it to
rest. And I think we have this a bipartisan at this point I believe it's
a bipartisan support from this and I think we need to go out and do the
right thing. I understand what Representative Pierce was saying but we
do the right thing, make these families whole if we can. It's
impossible. But let's give it a try. I think we will be doing the right
thing and I think we will be on the right side of history if we take
care of this. Thank you Mr., Madam Chair.

I'm a oppose the amendment, and I would hate to have this time without
telling you something happen for five hundred years ago, but there was a
case in England where they decided that the king can do no wrong. that
is a that was the origin of sovereign immunity and a lot of the American
Republican and small are small, our experience has been chopping away at
that ridiculous doctrine of the last several hundred years, because in
fact the King can do wrong. this is not about what lawmakers did fifty
years ago four years ago. thirty years ago. it's what the state of North
Carolina. the sovereign state of North Carolina. good to its own
citizens involuntarily the thousands of them more than any other state
and for longer than any other state. now we pay claims all the time for
things the state itself is done wrong. the tort claims act condemnation
of you. don't you fire somebody improperly. we quite pay claims. what
makes this one different, I ask you, here we have a no group of people
who were alive. this is not reparations. these are people who are alive
and to this day they are in their bodies. the proof and the scars of
what the state of North Carolina did for them involuntarily. this is not
an open door to anything any claim somebody wants to bring up the bill
makes the makes it very clear that the statute of limitations has run,
this is a limited claim for limited. and I will remind you that this
particular bill that passed the House last session, eighty six, the
thirty one had pulled by I would encourage you to go ahead and do it,
pass it is the just in
Change speaker:
opposing amendment passed the bill, Change speaker:Representative
Stevens, Change speaker: Mister chair, and my guess is really more of a
question which is why would support this amendment. there are an
estimated seventeen hundred and twenty four hundred people who are
eligible under this program to except that benefits revolver and an what
happens if more than two hundred people on board because I probably
provided finances for work and we also have not provided anything for
administration of the program, so I guess my objection to having this
the program and I guess support of the amendment is, it's not adequately
fund Change speaker:the would observe, opposites that person 's comment
on this, but I would observe that I believe his commission 's been
working for some time to identify victims. it's been worked on for a
number of years. I think I got some appreciation for the individuals
were living at this time. Change speaker:some researchers and staff tell
us how many that is in our ardor, only two hundred people. Change
speaker:but yes if Mister bongo would like to respond to human. Change
speaker:yes, ma'am, are part of fiscal research found an apartment
administration presented to the general government subcommittee and
March of this year. there are a hundred ninety seven, burned on victims
that could not receive compensation

that and several of Madonna Tom, Change speaker:if you have a follow-up

there. what happens if more than two hundred come from where we can pay
the monies
Change speaker:
Mister not millions who live their lives in the same trick in Japan and
worked on it for several years, Anita Bill says if more people come
forward then in the next year will appropriate s'more money now.
frankly, I don't think if they haven't come for by now, the committee
will, but it's of the debt is irritable and compensate everybody there
is a time. I have just a couple of years to make the claims, but were in
the right ballpark, it might be additional money, but that would still
be compensating the people who were severely damaged by the actions of
the state of North Carolina and compensating them in a much smaller
amount than you would expect if you were net if this happened to you

happened in our lifetime. There are victims that are alive today, direct
victims that were subject to a medical procedure as administered by the
State of North Carolina. Hence, I feel we have an obligation to
compensate those direct victims, and I would oppose the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Speciale.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't think that we have all the answers on this. I don't think we
know what all of the ramifications are. There are some concerns about
the dollar value; there's concerns about the number of people. I know
that this has come up before, and I think that we all would have been
better served had this been debated on the floor on a separate bill as a
separate issue, rather than to have been slid into the budget here. So I
recommend that we vote yes on this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Adams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just want to remind everybody, we just slid
something into the budget just not too long ago. We do it all the time.
But, if you weren't here, perhaps you don't know the history, and we
don't have the time today to go through it, but clearly North Carolina
was wrong. In spite of the fact that there was some national issue
around eugenics in other states, we represent North Carolina, and when
North Carolina is wrong we were sent here to make those adjustments. Let
me remind you that we've done it over and over and over again. We've had
local legislation in various cities and towns. We ran, some of us, on
positions that we would come here and we would reverse decisions and
straighten then out, and we've done it. I've opposed a lot of that, but
we still did it because we felt we had an obligation to correct the
wrong. We have an obligation today to correct the wrong. We've got
people who have lived with this, who have suffered, their families have
suffered, and we're going to sit here and pretend that nothing has
really happened. We should be ashamed as a state. This is one way to
make some small amend. And, yes, it's probably not enough money. But,
you know, we just didn't put enough money, we said, in the
opportunities, but those who will have the opportunity will take
advantage of it, and that will be the same thing here. We need to do
what's right. We need to oppose this amendment. This issue has been
debated on the floor many times for a long time. We need to now go ahead
and correct this wrong that North Carolina made. We represent North
Carolina, and we need to do right by this state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hurley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I am against this amendment, and I'll tell you
why. I have been involved with this since I have been down here. This
was not done to just little boys. It was done to boys and girls, men and
women, black and white, and it was done by a panel that was chosen by
the State of North Carolina. It started in America, eugenics did (I
thought it started in Germany; I couldn't believe America was the start
of this), according to what I have been told and read. Having met some
of the victims, some did not know until they got married that they could
not have children, and then they found out why they couldn't have
children. Yes, maybe their parents did sign for them, maybe they didn't
know what they were signing, we don't know. Supposedly some of the
records have been lost. We need to know exactly what they did to those
little boys. Maybe some were sent to reformatory school, and they felt
that they weren't minding, therefore they were sterilized. I just feel
like it's very important that North Carolina does the right thing. I
know it's money. We didn't do this, but the people are living now, from
1929 to 1974, longer than any other state, and if we don't do it now, it
will keep coming back every year. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Presnell.

this, having children, and now, having grandchildren, and to take that
right away from you, by someone and sometimes not even have known that
that was taken away from you, is the worst thing I think that could ever
happen to someone. And not to give these victims who are still alive,
some of them barely alive, and not to do this as a state when we do have
the money this year, is shameful. And I am against this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brody.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, just to start out, if we recall we really don't
have the money, now we're looking around to spend, to get any kind of
money we have, but just my opinion and I'll be brief, is that I've got
to go back to the people or, I've got to represent the people of my
district, and tell them that they are gonna be taxed for something that
they did not do. What I would suggest, to anybody who wants to do this
is, you're always welcome to volunteer, to put together a program, put
together a fund, a drive of some sorts, to address these issues, but I
cannot, in good conscience go back to the people of my district and ask
them to be taxed for something that they had nothing to do with.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Floyd.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. As I sit here and listen in and look at this
amendment, when we first reconvened here in a June assembly, I can
recall the Speaker of this House call us a group of Representatives
together. And said and expressed that this was and is important, the
Speaker of this House took a very bold step in trying to compensate
these victims for something we all say we had nothing to do with it. And
if I sit here and I look at the highway's trust fund, the highway fund,
well you know, we're still trying to improve roads for what people did
in the past, we're still trying to do that. We're still trying to plan
roads for the future, we are doing that. But here we are talking about
10 million dollars from 20 million dollars from last year to compensate
victims, and I don't too much agree with things that Skip say, but today
he has made some very profound statements, and I'm about to be in
agreement with him wholeheartedly 100%. And I might pray tonight, you
know for agreeing with him on this, but we owe this, and I say again, if
the Speaker of this House agrees that this is is important, then I do
too. And from a biblical standpoint, and we talk about biblical, the one
that I serve, say he only put enough weight on you that you can carry,
and 10 million dollars is not a loss, so when we talk about that, we pay
claims all the time, all the time, we're just talking about 10 million
dollars, haven't said that, if the money run out, the money run out,
then the next general assembly will have the responsibility of
appropriating additional funds if need be, that's up to the next general
assembly. But what we are saying here today is that, let's get on with
this, let's pay the victims the 10 million dollars which we're down from
20 million dollars and let's move this day forward, I support the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative- would you like to revise that last remark? I think he
opposes the amendment. Representative Baumgartner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairmen, I would like to speak in favor of this
amendment because I think it's wrong to make people pay for something
they didn't have anything to do with, and I can't go back to my district
and face people and say, yes I voted to take your money and give it to
these people, we've had plenty of time since all this happened, we
could've settled this a long time ago, if some people wanted to settle
it, but obviously that didn't happen, and we're growing government right
here on page 27, line 13 and 14, and 25 and 26, we're creating an- in
the Department of Administration the Office of Justice for Sterilization
Victims. There's no telling where's this gonna wind up, it says 10
million now, it could wind up being 100</p>

expensive. I could not even get congress to vote for this to force
people, now, to pay for this.
Speaker: Representative Holler?
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chairman. Again, I tried to remain silent,
like last time, but the story that I got to tell, well, first thing, I
have been here four years next week. I have heard this subject since I
got here. So, someone who has not, or has not been listening, I
understand, but, we pay for these things all the time, i.e. Medicaid,
medicare. Someone who goes to the hospital, I am going to pay for some
of that, and you are too; and, vice versa: if I go to the hospital, you
are going to pay for it. Several stories I could tell but one, a current
one. Last time, last session, we passed this and senate did not. A lady
in my county had come forward and had a newspaper article, who went back
to her after it passed, for a comment, and she said that we were just
waiting for her to die. “They are just waiting for us to die:” that is
the signal we sent last session. Is that the signal you want to send
again this session? Vote for this and vote against the $10 million. If
you have 9 million residents and collected a dollar, you would just
about have it, but that is not the way we collect taxes. It is NC: we
pay for things other people do all the time, and vice versa. So, let’s
go on and do this, and send the right signal, not that we are waiting
for them to die.
Speaker: Representative Steinberg?
Representative: Thank you MR. Chairman. With a name like Steinberg you
can imagine that I am a little sensitive to issues of eugenics. I find
this absolutely hard to believe that this happened in a state like NC. I
know that it happened elsewhere. I am kind of confounded by the comments
I hear today as it relates to how this is going to impact the folks back
home. How are the folks back home going to react to this. It could be
something that could affect us negatively, in terms of us getting
re-elected, but there is a bigger issue here than whether we are getting
re-elected. That is the issue of doing the right thing. How anyone, and
I respect everyone’s opinion, how anyone, with deep thought and prayer,
could come to the conclusion that we need just to idly skip by this and
forget about it – the stain on NC history, is, to me, beyond the pale.
The other states in the Union, I understand, who have been involved with
eugenics in the past, these folks have done nothing like what we are
preparing to do right now. I think that says a lot about us as people in
the state of NC. we are not looking for someone else to be trendsetter:
we will be the trendsetter. We are involved in reforming government, and
part of that reforming government means that we need to pay attention to
things done in the past. We are trying to correct wrong through tax
legislation and other statutes we have enacted, but somehow, there are
those that feel like that this is not worthy of that kind of
consideration. When in fact, I cannot believe that we can proceed on any
course, to do anything, until we blot out this injustice. It will always
be there. We will not be able to deny that it happened. Nonetheless, we
can take a giant step here to</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dobson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I know the hour is drawing late in the
afternoon, so I'll be brief. Notwithstanding the last debate on
opportunity scholarships, there are not too many issues that my good
friend, Representative Stam, and I disagree on, and this one is no
different. I do not think it is unreasonable to compensate individuals
who are alive today for the wrongs that have been done to them. I think
it's the right thing to do, and for those reasons, I would ask that you
oppose the amendment. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cunningham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I wasn't here, but I'm here now, and I did attend
the meetings that came across the state on the eugenics, and I believe
that youngest victim was 12 years old. Most of those people were poor,
some of them mentally challenged, and children with behavior problems.
And some of their parents were even threatened to take away their food
stamps, or other things that were provided by the state. So I do oppose
the amendment. Today, the North Carolina House has the opportunity to
correct the wrong that was done, to let the victims know that they do
matter. It is time now. Thank you Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Pittman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I'm gonna speak a second time, and I would just
have to say that there's no question that what was done to these people
was utterly reprehensible and needs to be thoroughly repudiated. And
despised, what was done to them. But, you know, there's a big difference
between us helping to pay somebody else's medical bills, and punishing
us for crimes we didn't commit. I mean, you know, I have two sons. If I
go strangle somebody today, which one of my sons are you going to put to
death for it? That's what we're talking about, punishing people who did
not commit the crime, because you can't get your hands on the people who
did. And I just can't see the justice in that, I don't believe this is
going to straighten anything out, I don't believe it's gonna correct
anything, it's gonna be making some statement that makes us feel better
about ourselves because we hated what was done. That's about all it
amounts to, and I don't think, you know, that really $50,000 apiece is
really adequate. If you're gonna do this, I don't think any sum we could
give them could make up for it. And so the sum is not really as
important, although, as has been said, we're struggling to figure out
what we're gonna do in the budget and a lot of other things and we're
gonna do this that's really not going to correct what happened. And I
understand the desire for it, I understand the feelings that are behind
it, I respect that, but I just don't feel it's the responsible thing to
do, to make people today pay the price for what somebody did way back
when, and, sir, if it'd be appropriate, I'd ask for division on this
vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Division having been called for, Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We often talk around here about what is the
role of government, and one of the roles of government is to protect the
safety of its citizens. Our citizens trust us to defend them against
injustice. We have ways to defend them and to compensate them if they
are wrongfully convicted, if they are wrongfully imprisoned. We should
have one if they have been wrongfully sterilized. You say that we don't
have the money; they don't have the children or the grandchildren. I ask
you to oppose this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Shepard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the amendment, sir. I was here last session, and I'll be honest
with all of you, I was one of those that opposed eugenics funding. In
listening to many people that know a lot more about this than I do and
reading and doing research, there were some in my county; I know a young
lady at 16 -- that was born slow, she wasn't severly handicapped -- but
she was raped at 16 years old and then, after she gave birth to a child,
she was sterilized because it was</p>

The child went on to lead a successful life was adopted into a family,
was also an ?? in the air force and she never got to know that child,
because of the records it was disclosed. And I am sure in this with you
because as representative Holley said It not just happened to one type
of individual, it happened to many. And I don't think it was right and I
didn't support it last time because I don't think you can make up with
money for what's happened with some of these people. And I know the
question was asked about representative Presnell and we all discussed
this before whether or not any other states have done this. But I;d like
to share with you I try to tell people not ministry. It doesn't really
matter to me what someone else down the street is doing, I am
responsible for doing the right thing and I believe the right thing or
North Carolina and for us is to support this 10 million dollars to these
victims and I can't answer for what someone else does and doesn't do but
I know in my I have to do what I think is right and so I'm not going to
be critical with supporting this. I just ask you to ask yourselves, what
is the right thing to do? Because we all have to get up tomorrow and
face ourselves into the mirror and ask ourselves have we done the right
thing.
Thank you.

Committee will come to order. Committee will come to order. The ayes
being 22 and the no’s being 64, the amendment is not agreed to.
We’d like to take just a moment… We’ll move to the next amendment, but I
would like to take a moment. This afternoon we have some additional
pages with us who we’d like to welcome to the committee. Lilly Rose from
Pit County, sponsored by Representative Martin, S. Martin. Christine
Rhodes from Catawba County, sponsored by Majority Leader Starnes. Drew
Rober from Orange County, sponsored by Representative Insko. Mary
Catherine Starnes from Caldwell County, sponsored by Representative
Starnes. And Stefan Stiner in Orange County, sponsored by Representative

The next amendment is ALH-39V1. Representative Pierce. ALH-39V1,
Amendment 43.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s ALH-39, Version 1, Amendment 43.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is an amendment for the Richmond County Juvenile
Detention Center, and it’s very important to that area and surrounding
areas. They have youth coming from different counties to be housed there
on a temporary basis. We know how important this facility is in that
area of the state. It really reaches out to a lot of areas. We were able
to find the funding from different areas and I just wanted to bring it
before the committee. And if I could just have staff to further explain
it, Representative Burr would help me out please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That’d be fine. Staff…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Where the funding came from.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff would like to…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Mr. Chair. The funding for this came from
removing the expansion funding for item 51 for the Juvenile Justice
Community Programs. That was $1,000,000 a year recurring. And from Item
44 on page I6 of your Committee Report, which is the expansion funds for
electronic monitoring equipment, and it reduces that funding by $287,000
a year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Daughtry?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Regrettably we’d
have to speak against this amendment. The fact is that we did not choose
the facilities to close. They were picked out by the Department of
Prisons. We have too many beds, and this was one that was chosen. And to
take the money from the community programs is a program that the
governor is very interested in. It has to do with drug addiction and
ways to fight drug addiction with treatment. We would respectfully
request that you vote against this amendment.</p>

that, that surrounding area, Scotland, Hoke, Robeson, Richmond
surrounding areas receive juveniles from those areas and probably other
areas, and we have some IDAs here today that know the importance of that
and they shared it with me along with the sheriffs in the surrounding
area and the juvenile agencies in that area.

You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Also, part two was to take some of the money I think, if I'm
corrected from staff from the monitoring? And she, all is yes. This is a
very important part of justice reinvestment that we just passed last
year, and I think this would in another respect the gentleman from
Richmond, I would have to oppose this amendment as chair and because we
need those monitors for the justice reinvestment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Goodman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chair, I just want to reinforce what Representative
Pierce said. Our sheriff says this will create a hardship on his
Sheriff's Department. It would be tough on a struggling economy down
where we are and I ask that you support the amendment.

The amendment fails. Next amendment is Representative Boles' amendment,
amendment number 53 ALL-59 version two. Representative Boles.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chair. What, what this does is, recommendation from the
Department of Corrections. It will, extend, move the date I think of
Wayne Correctional closure to October 1 of thirteen and Johnson would,
it moved that date out so that we're able to go from a minimum to a,
medium to a minimum custody in Johnson county. It gives them time to do
the repairs that were needed, and they're taking it out of their
consolidation effectiveness. This is once again by their staff and I
recommend it to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate on the amendment. If not, those in favor of
Representative Boles' amendment, amendment number 53, please say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Those opposed no. The amendment passes. Next, Representative Michaux,
amendment number 39, AMK-23 version one. Representative Michaux.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman. What this does, it cuts the excellent public
schools act by five million dollars and removes the CTE bonuses and it
restores ten point seven million into the teachers salary supplements,
to allow the STEM teachers to get massed the supplement after the
deadline. It's just that simple.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blackwell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman. The cochairs of education and preps would
recommend against this. This is going back and cutting money that was
committed, it's not new money, but cutting about four million dollars
out of money that was available this past year for funding the
requirements under the excellent school act which include the new
provision that is designed to ensure that all children are able to read
by the time they finish the third grade before they go on to the
remainder of their schooling. Secondly, the, I came to the legislature a
little over four years ago, and one of the statements that I heard
frequently and early was that people would say in behalf of programs.
Well, this is data supported, or evidence based. In this instance the
CTE program that is dealt with here, the career technology education
piece</p>

<p id="135:00">
Is modeled after a program coming out of Florida and that's the data,
that's the evidence that supports the program and what it represented,
and what Michaux's amendment does is it guts the program by deleting the
portions of the program that provide an incentive or a bonus to teachers
in school systems for their success.  It's an ideological opposition to
paying our educators who do a better job for our students and it
demonstrated by the success of the students, and I urge you to not gut
the program by making that change.  The final thing is that here again
it's an evidence based, data driven decision.  The information provided
to us is that having a Master's, with the exception of one very isolated
area involving math teachers in high school, does not produce better
outcomes for students who have teachers with Master's versus teacher's
who simply have a Bachelor's, and we're trying to put on many into
programs that are data supported, evidence supported and new programs
that are innovative rather than simply sticking with something because
it's something that we've always done. So, I would encourage the
Committee strongly to reject this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Michaux.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Yes, just to speak a second time.  The STEM Program
I think is a program that deserves a holding in our whole educational
system and what we've done is we've put an arbitrary deadline
particularly for those who are receiving help to get their Master's.
What this would do is extend that deadline for those teachers who can
better perform and a lot of folks' instances with having received their
Master's.  I suggest that you give it a try and let's see where we go.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Blackwell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Speak the second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  The evidence does not support that STEM teachers do
any better for their students if they have a Master's than if they only
have a Bachelor's.  Lets don't pay extra for something that doesn't give
us more bind for the book in terms of student outcomes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you Mr. Chairman.  I have a questions.  I'm
not sure if it goes to staff or it might go to Representative Blackwell
but sometimes teachers become teachers because of the Master's Degree.
They don't get an Undergraduate in teaching.  They maybe had an
Undergraduate in another degree and they get their Master's in Teaching,
which takes them into the classroom.  How is this being handled?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Blackwell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  If you have a Master's and are receiving Master's
pay, but the end of the coming school year you will be grandfathered and
can continue to receive the pay.  After that time, unless you are
required to have a Master's in order to be employed by the school
system, or I think now with an amendment unless you are a nurse, you
will not receive Master's pay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Further discussion or debate on the amendment?  If
not.

Then were saying that these individuals are already in the pipeline? Is

Mr. Chair conceivably there could be some individuals who are already in

get the supplement before this provision goes on to effect.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, mam

I thank you for clarifying what is does. We’ve got individuals who are

that people, individuals go to school and continue to get further
degrees because they want to be compensated for that as well, and I mean
they are already in the system, that’s where they are headed and I think

Amendment number 38, Representative Murray, ame-31 version five.
Representative Murray
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, this amendment seeks to broaden the and do some
edits to the farm supervisions of the hss budget. The first provisions
on line one and two, deletes the four brand limit for medic aid and
health choice. On pages four and five, delete section 12h.13g which
deals with actual acquisition cost or invoice processing and gives a
department a menu of options to achieve the same amount of savings. The
next section on 21-23, this addresses something the department is
already working on, dealing with proper authorizations for adah and add
medications that I believe many people in this room might need, on pages
25 and 26 look at the squirrel, on lines 25 and 26 this addresses the
ability for c c and c to develop care management programs, just add some
clarifying language. Starting in line 30 on page one and going to page
two, this addresses the withhold, there’s a two percent withhold
dispensing fees for the pharmacy, this establishes a program by which
some pharmacies might be able to participate and earn some of that with
hold back that’s the idea of the withhold, the shared savings to develop
new programs for a broader savings, so this establishes a way for
pharmacies to earn that back and participate in a shared savings program
with the department and then the duration of the amendment just reflects
the money report to reflect the changes in this amendment and I will
move  that the option to be able to answer any questions.
Representative, Avila
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks you Mr. chairman, I would ask for your support for this
amendment, we had worked very hard with the pharmacists to overcome some
deficiencies in the pricing which was going to be a little detrimental
and hard for them to deal with and we really appreciate the effort that
they have put forward to still come up and help us meet the savings that
we had set.

Thank you Mr. Chair I have a question for Representative Murray,

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, I am just trying to get a clear handle on this thing, I’m
wondering is this going to encourage or slow down the use of drugs like
Ritalin and that sort of thing?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Generally proper authorization is a management tool to help make sure
that is appropriately prescribed and it’s a management tool that we
appropriately put in place and it generally results in less utilization
of these medications but at the end of the day it’s a management tool
that we use to help make sure that it’s appropriately prescribed.

version 4.
Representative Steinburg?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Basically, what this amendment does is
restores some fundings for the one of the partnerships which have come
up so often here during discussion for the budget, the partnership for
the sounds and What this amendment is proposing to do is to partially
restore what was budgeted for this area, $195,704 which in the
governor's budget has been reduced or the house has reduced that.., No,
the house reduced it altogether and...Let me get this right. The house
is recommending a $58,000 grant as opposed to the $195,704 that was
there last year. That creates a difference of 137,704 which is a one
time no recurring expense. The money is proposed to be taken from North
Carolina branding initiative. Now the thinking behind this, is being
discussed before with other partnerships, is to allow this particular
group to transition, not to go completely to zero and disappear. It is
basically buying them a year. It's a non-recurring expense but it is
giving them the transition to independence over the physical 12 months
and eliminating these partnerships, a lot of them ?? ??, is very very
difficult.  This is a partner parcel of tourism, helps promote tourism,
and tourism is one of the biggest industries in this state and certainly
over the eastern North Carolina, that is indeed the case. This amendment
asks that to restore to the ?? of 137,704 to come from North Carolina
Branding initiative and isn't it interesting that this money is coming
out of the branding initiative and the branding initiative is</p>

being used to promote the state  of North Carolina for tourism among

closing some of these places that are absolutely committed to creating

Mckelraft
-Thank you Mr. chair.
- The partnership for the sound is a group of museums and we approached
them with a grass roots museum. We got a resolution from them, that they
would like to have the Estuarium as part of the grassroots museum , and
so we did unlike the senate. They gave them zero funding. We put them as
on of the grassroots museum at 58 thousand their first year; and, then
we put them at 58 thousand the second year with the funding mechanism
that will give them about 65 thousand with their budget in the second
year. Now that 123 thousand that they were not funded by the senate.
They will continue as a grassroots museum where they will continue
getting funding as a museum.
Now, they have not been left out in the cold. They are a museum. They
agreed to that;so, I don't understand what this is all about. They are
trying to take money from branding for the entire state in order to
provide funding for this museum which we have already given funding to;
so, please do not support this amendment. thank you.

the support of the co-chairs of education. Most of you know there is a
seven hundred and thirty million dollar outstanding budget that the
state owes the public schools that is sitting there; and, we have only
paid 18 million dollars on the judgement. This doesn't change anything
that is in the budget but says to the extent that we realize excess
receipts that we don't anticipate in the civil penalty and forfeiture
fund. They can be allocated to the school technology fund as a way,
weather if its one dollar or a hundred dollars, that we can begin slowly
to continue to down pay our judgement and at the same time aid school

assures that if we're going to surcharge students, that they and their
parents receive notice ahead of time that that's going to happen and
also doesn't count towards their tuition surcharge courses they've taken

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I think that this is the one regarding the regional
partnerships.  Is that correct?  Inquiry of the chair.  I've misplaced
it on the...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe that's correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.  It was proposing to take the funding for the northeast,
southeast, and the west, divide that three ways.  The initial amount was
1.9 million.  The committee earlier approved an amendment to remove a
half million dollars for RTI, so I assume the amount is now 1.4 million.
 The rationale for this amendment is we either need to make a decision
not to fund the regional partnerships and let them die this year, or we
need to find out what the Department of Commerce proposal for
public-private partnerships will be.  The net effect for western North
Carolina previously, Advantage West got about a million dollars for
marketing our region.  If you add up all the money from Buncombe and
Henderson counties that our funded through our county commissioners,
that's around a half a million dollars.  The other counties would be
much smaller than that.  So when you take a million dollars out of the
west, it's a significant impact.  And if there's nothing to come behind
that to back-fill that, you're going to put our region at a severe
economic disadvantage.  And that's the purpose of the amendment, to help
the more rural areas of the state.  And I would ask for the committee to
support this amendment.

So this amend… This is Aubrey from Fiscal Research. This amendment
reallocates the 1.4 million to three of the regional economic
development commissions and partnerships as opposed to the seven to
which it’s being distributed currently. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We would
oppose – [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. We
would oppose this amendment, There are still seven regional
partnerships. The Department of Commerce does have a plan for those
partnerships. They’re called prosperity zones. They intend to… They have
had conversations with the seven regional partnerships. They intend to
use those regional partnerships and glean their expertise, and so at

please do not put the funding in only the three. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Tolson. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, same
thing. I hope that we will oppose this amendment. It doesn’t even

mention us but it’s affecting the money that we’ll get, so I hope you’ll
oppose this amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further
debate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, speak a second time on the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. Representative Ramsey. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] And it was my understanding that the eastern region had a
dedicated funding source that the other partnerships did not have. I
would accept a friendly amendment to include the eastern region, if that
was within the rules to divide it four ways instead of three ways. The
intent was to help the more rural areas. The Charlotte, the Triad and
the Raleigh-Durham areas have significant corporate support, have
Fortune 500 companies headquartered in those regions and have much
greater ability to raise private dollars than we do in the eastern parts
of the state, so that was the motivation of the amendment. [SPEAKER

amendable to that? If you are, we’ll displace the bill; if not, we’ll
just… we’ll vote. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would still say no to that. At
this point we do not need to divide those partnerships. As I said
before, it’s not a lot of money to begin with, the 1.4 million, and at
this point, we are still working with Commerce to work with all of those
partnerships, even those four that are not in those urban areas.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens and then Chairman Burr.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, I just wanted to point out that this leaves
you and me out too. So we frequently get left out of everything that
happens with Greensboro, and we were told last year it was fine for us
to leave but we didn’t get to exit. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Chairman Burr.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would just as well as Representative McElraft and
Stevens and others ask that members oppose this amendment. I am in the
Piedmont Region Triad and in the Charlotte region and I represent a tier
one and a tier two county when they’re not close to being anything as a
Charlotte and don’t have those kinds of funds to raise those monies, so
he’s taking away from rural counties as well that are in the Piedmont
area, so I would respectfully ask that you oppose this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Seeing no further discussion, all those in favor of
the amendment signify by saying aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] All opposed, no. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
no’s have it. The amendment fails. Next up is ALD-32 volume 1, amendment
number 66. Representative Pierce. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, I don’t
have a copy of… [SPEAKER CHANGES] We’re going to displace that when
we’ve got one and we’ll come back to that one. Next up is ALG-24 volume
1, amendment 36. Representative Faircloth. We don’t have that one
either? We’ll come back to that one too. I’m just taking them in the
order that I’ve got them up here. Let’s try this one. AME-34 volume 2,
amendment64. Representative Fisher. And it says it’s been passed out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ve got it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does everybody have
that one? Representative Fisher, you’re recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry, I just had to kind of get my own mind

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Perfectly understandable.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's the positions of Chief Information Officer to be
reporting to the State Board of Education instead of to DPI, so that the
State Board continues to exercise it's constitutional requirement for
oversight.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would he please explain that again, Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Representative Cleveland. What I understand and

we'll give you a minute to find it if you need, but you're recognized

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, very much. All of our teachers deserve a
bonus for the tremendous job they do preparing our students to be
globally competitive. Therefore, we should not discriminate by trying to
give one group of teachers a bonus without looking at all teachers. And
I know that our budget does not allow us to give increases to all
teachers, so I'm asking that we remove the bonuses from the AP teachers
and put it in the LEA adjustment for 2014-2015. And I also need to
remind folks that DPI has a goal to increase access to these advanced
placement courses. This is part of their rigor, they're goal to increase
graduation rates. When we pit one group of teaches against another, as
far as bonuses are concerned, we cause a moral problem. And I would ask
you to support this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blackwell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairs of ?? would ask
the committee to oppose this amendment. It is similar to the earlier
amendment which was designed to deny the aspect of this program that
involves bonuses for teachers who are successful with their students in
AP and in national baccalaureate courses. Again, we got data, we don't

Adams. Representative Adams, you're recognized whenever you’re ready.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chair. Ladies and gentlemen of the committee, we all
know that education is the passport to the future, that students today
are having a very difficult time paying their way. There was a recent
article in Sunday’s paper, in my paper, that talked about student debt
and the responsibilities that they have and that they have taken on
while in school. This amendment will basically decrease the tuition for
non-resident students from the twelve, I think it's twelve percent of
the budget now, to six percent, and that would just put these schools in
line in terms of the ivy state students with all of the other schools
that the increases are six percent and so, this increase instead of
being twelve will be six, six, six percent. The schools have had
increases over the years for not only undergraduate students who were in
state and also out of state students, and it puts a tremendous burden on
the institutions, but I also want to add that we're talking about a good
university system. What makes a good university system is also the make
up of its student body. Diversity adds to that. Students who come to
North Carolina pay taxes while they're here. Many of them do as I did,
they get educated and they stay and they remain and contribute to this
economy. So I think that it will benefit our students who are from North
Carolina to have students from other states, and I just believe that if
we continue to increase this tuition, we're going to look up and
everybody in our classrooms in higher education will be from North
Carolina. Now that's not so bad, but I do think that diversity will add
to their learning and will contribute to the contributions that they can
make. And I would appreciate your support for the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McGrady.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chair. The education appropriations chairs would ask
the committee to pose the amendment. This amendment is directed at
increases in tuition for non resident students, and the House budget is
based on a recommendation that is contained in the Governor's budget,
that we basically raise tuitions for one group of universities and, at
six percent, and basically the larger universities at twelve point three
percent. What the House did was rather than making that effective in the
upcoming fiscal year, we moved it to the second year, in part because we
felt that it was the university board's role most appropriately to take
this into consideration. So we followed the governor's recommendation,
but we were trying to be deferential to the university board. I would
suggest to you that the tuitions for our public universities for
non-resident students, if they want to address their debt situation,
they might want to stay home and go to a university in their own state,
if that's the major concern, but we ought to be pricing our tuitions for
non-residents in a competitive fashion, and there's nothing to suggest
here that we're not doing that. Again, I'd urge you to</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Representative Richardson’s
trying to fix a problem that she sees, but what she’s trying to do:
she’s taking money from tobacco trust fund, the clean water management,
the non-commercial lust/g, and biotech, and for that reason I would ask
you to oppose this amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion on
the amendment, Representative Pierce. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Chair,
we try to work where we can with you. We appreciate all that we do.
These organizations are very important, and we’re really disappointed
that, first of all, that the Senate failed to provide any fundage to
enable the minority in these organizations to work. They have a 20 year
track record of doing great things in the state and at this fragile time
in our economy to get rid of these organizations</p>

Organizations would do more damage than we really can see. So during the
past somebody made a statement that they were being phased out. But in
due, just to make a point, we just reduced the fundings. I remember
that. We never had the idea of just getting rid of these organizations.
They  have a great, they do a great job in the State of North Carolina.
So I would ask that we would consider Representative Richardson’s
amendment and see if we could work something out to help these
organizations continue to stay alive. We talked about in, during this
process through the transition period if nothing else. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Harrison.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just want to echo the sentiments expressed by
Representative Pearson Richardson. These are very important programs in
terms of economic development. And in particular the Land Loss
Prevention Project has helped keep black farmers on their, on their
farms and they’ve been. They faced historical discriminations. I don’t
think, I don’t think that we ought to be cutting these people out cold
turkey. I’m think that phasing them out is probably appropriate, but
completely eliminating their funding is harsh move. So I urge you to
support the amendment. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Adams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to speak in support of the amendment. And I
still have to raise the question I raised earlier, why are we going into
the budget? Why did this particular department, area go into the budget
and slash all of  the minority groups? You left one maybe. When you look
at the total appropriations given to these organizations it's minuscule
compared to this total budget. Well, I think it’s very unfair that we
have targeted these organizations. If as has been stated there was a 5
year phase out, I think that the organizations should have been told
that they were being phased out. I think the organizations did not ask
for additional funding because they were sympathetic to the economic
situation in our state. And we're talking about organizations that have
had a tremendous economic impact on this state. When we talk about
wanting to promote jobs and business growth, those kinds of things.
That’s exactly what these organizations continue to do over two decades
and more. They continue to do that. One in particular provides business
assistance in the areas of marketing opportunities and provides the
support for women and minority owned businesses. And I don’t know why we
seem so afraid to support minority businesses. We’re talking about
thousands of jobs that have been created. Millions in commercial
development that have been provided. But
when we talk about cutting these groups, you are also impacting the
people who they impact in the community and those, and that means we’re
going to lose more jobs. That means services that people are being
provided for through these organizations won’t be provided for. We need
to have some compassion around here. You’ve cut people from
unemployment, they don’t have medical insurance. Now we say that we
promote business and we want to improve the economy and we’re doing
destructive kinds of things like this. I think, I think it’s pretty
shameful for us to be doing it. We’re talking about tremendous job loss
to low wealth neighborhoods. And I think we, we need to consider as we
consider the richest in this state, we need to consider people who are
struggling and people who are in low wealth communities. This is a good
amendment. It’s a fair amendment. We’re talking about allowing these
organizations to transition. We did that in the other area and in the
other areas departments earlier today. Why not in this department as
well? Why are not we providing an opportunity for these organizations to
transition appropriately so that they can continue for at least a short
time to do the work and make some provisions for the next year? And I
would ask that you support this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair and I’ll be very brief. One of things that North
Carolina can be proud of is that nationally, we’re nationally known for
our Minority Economic Development Package What, what you’ve done in this
is that you’ve cut it out. We sat down, many of us sat down and thought
about this and tried to get some way or other that we could.</p>

<p id="205:00">
Actually not phase it out. We know, for instance, that the Department of
Congress is to changing up a little bit. Now, we also know what we are
hoping to do is to go for a grant type of program. No money has been
appropriated yet for it. We understand that. The Senate didn't do it,
and the House hasn't done it yet. But we still hold out hope for it. And
this will tide us over at least for a year in these organizations. So
that if that program does come about, and we should know within a
certain period of time. If that program does come about, this would
allow those organizations to try to continue their funding through the
grant situation. And as Representative Adams and others have said, we
ought to be proud of what the minority economic development programs
have done for this state in terms of providing jobs, in terms of
providing infrastructure, and a lot of things that they have done. I can
look at the Institute for Minority Economic Development, and recognize
the fact that many state agencies have been able to take advantage of
the expertise that's in that agency, that's in that institute, in order
to form programs for this state. So I, all we ask is very simply that
they be allowed and carry over at least for a year, in order, and number
one, if we have to phase out, then that would be phasing them out, but
hopefully that we would be able to get into the grant program that
hopefully Congress is trying to do. We ask please that you support this
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative McGrady.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I would urge you to oppose the amendment, primary for
the reasons that Chairman West articulated. You can be for something,
but then you've got to figure out where the money comes from. And in
this case, you're taking the money from all of the wrong places. The
Leaking Underground Storage Tank Fund, Biotech, Tobacco Trust Fund,
Clean Water Management Trust Fund. It may be a good cause, but the
mistake here would be taking the funds from these line items, and I urge
you to oppose the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Farmer-Butterfield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to speak in favor of the
amendment. When I look at East and North Carolina, and what has happened
because of these programs, especially The Community Development
Initiative and the Association of Community Development Corporations. In
my district, I can see housing involving home ownership in my community
that would not have occurred otherwise. I see apartments for citizens
that would not have housing otherwise, I see senior citizens programs,
incubator programs that have created jobs for people in my community.
Even a shopping center was set up in my district. So, in downtown
redevelopment, revitalization, and all of these created jobs. So those
are some specific things that I've have seen in terms of outcomes in my
communities because of these initiatives. So I ask that you support the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Hall.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the Committee.
I'd ask that you support this amendment, and there's several reasons
why, and the final reason is it's good business for North Carolina.
First of all, there's no dispute that the programs that we're seeking to
fund work. They work, they've got a track record of having excellent
success. No one has said their funding is being cut because they don't
work or they aren't efficient or they don't produce the bests results.
There's no viable substitute proposed in the budget to help fill in
where these services will be lost throughout the community. Now,
additionally, if we cut these programs without providing for transition,
we leave those businesses and those opportunities that are being
developed right now by these organizations to be cut adrift, and all of
that investment lost, both private and public that have participated in
it. The Department of Commerce, which seeks to fund these in the future,
again recognizing their value, is not ready at this point, to provide
those matching public, private, grants and partnership funds that they

and the financial and capital management information assistance they
provide is essential for small businesses. We know they're responsible
for the majority of jobs that are created in this state.</p>

create an environment for small business to thrive and then not provide
the opportunity for the small businesses to have the support that they
need; we'll have major areas of our state that don't get developed, both
inner cities and rural areas so I'd ask you to support the amendment.
It takes a little from other organizations that are also doing a fine
job but allows us to capitalize on the investment we have already made
in North Carolina through these organizations that have done a great job
and again are recognized by the Department of Commerce for future
funding but they don't have the funds necessary to operate during that
gap time so we are asking to have a transition.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Michaux.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I apologize for speaking at the same time, Mr. Chairman, but I forgot to
mention; what we are talking about in terms of dollars is about $3.6
million and when you look at it in the overall scope of things is just a
really mere pittance and what it does, yes, it takes a little bit of
money, half a million here and half a million there from programs that
are really viable programs and doing a great job but I just don't think
we can just flush what has been a tremendous asset to North Carolina
down the drain, it just would not be, and I don't think you want that,
things that we can be proud, we always want to uplift those and try to
do the best we can for them and all we are asking in this situation is
just for another year in order to phase out and be able to take
advantage of some other programs that might come along.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Further discussion, further debate on the amendment?  Representative
Richardson.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes, thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I think when we looked at the funds that
we selected to pull money from, we saw that there were some supporting
funds in there, for example, the Clean Water Trust fund, and there is
not a number of how many people will be using the Non Commercial Leaking
Underground Trust fund right off so I doubt you would expect that money
to be absorbed within one year because I'm sure we don't have that many
people so we did try to look at funds that  were, had, like the special
taxes or tags and deed stamps and things that had recurring funds so we
did go after some money that was off limit and we went back and
renegotiated so, thank you, we did not just go at this at random.  Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]

amendment by Representative Speciale is AMK-27V1, AMK-27V1, Amendment 54
and Representative Speciale is recognized to explain his amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
This amendment makes a change, the small school system supplemental
funding.  There was a change in the formula which is going to cost some
of these smaller schools some of their funding, however, that was in the
Senate budget but there was another change made since we received it
yesterday, I guess, in Committee that changed the criteria from counties
that have 3200 students to 3900 students which added four counties and
some funding was added but not enough, bottom line here is, some of
these smaller counties are going to loose a lot of money because of this
change, trying to add four more counties.  $563,000 from Pamlico county,
Pamlico county has about 1200 students; you can't take $563,000 from a
county that they were depending on and expect them to be able survive,
their school system. Basically what this does it puts it back to what
was in the budget yesterday before that amendment.  It changes the
county size from 3900 students to 3200 students and removes those four
additional counties.  One of those four additional counties would have
gotten, by the formula, would have gotten over $700,000 that the school
system wasn't anticipating getting, but some of these other schools and
some of your school systems are on here, Green County, Graham County,
I've got a whole list here, they are going to be loosing a couple
hundred thousand dollars</p>

<p id="215:00">
?? so I requested it that you folks for this amendment let’s put it back
the way it was yesterday.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative McGrady.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The education appropriations chairs take no position
on this amendment. The amendment would put the formula for how this
allotment is done back to actually the way that we originally addressed
it. But it's really sort of a policy question. I mean, thirty two
hundred was a number that we look at all of the various districts and
felt like that was the right number.  The education Appropriations
Committee had a motion to move that number up to thirty six hundred
students and as my colleague has just stated what that does,  the money
doesn't change it simply changes the allocation within  the block of
money that's provided for the small, for the small county allotment,  If
any member is interested in knowing the difference between the two I
have the charts right up here and you can come by and see what the
difference between the two is but  we don't take a position on this
amendment one way the other its non- budget affecting in terms of the
this no new money here.  It’s just an allocation question
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative McGrady just for clarity, could you
characterize the types of counties that would be receiving more
additional funds and those that would be receiving less.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I’ll see if I can quickly do that.  Basically you’ve
got counties between thirty two hundred and thirty six hundred would not
be getting would not have gotten any monies under the earlier formula
when you move it back, when you move up you’re including several
counties that would not have otherwise gotten monies and I don’t want to
pick on anybody but Chairman Weston I talked about this and he's got so
many counties now he's affected both ways. I believe it was Graham
County that does better under the formula when the number is thirty two
hundred, but then Cherokee County does much better under the Formula
when it’s at thirty six hundred.  So it really varies from place to
place.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you.  Representative Whitmire.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mister chair, I've got these numbers and have
researched them for many months now.  In changing it from thirty two to
thirty nine what the intent and what it did.  First of all we go back to
one September two thousand ten, when the General Assembly sanctioned
study gave the recommendation in the template on which the house has in
their budget, a new way of doing small school funding so that it
recognizes a sliding scale and economies of scale and as you get a
little larger but your still small in you suffer from a lack of
economies of scale your rewarded appropriately for your smallest. Now
here are a couple of issues that weigh in and I sympathize with
Representative Speciale’s situation.  The Senator ??? rather creative
formula that is still in today’s small school funding that rewards you
for square miles of water on which no one lives in varying degrees, has
provided over many years. as much triple of what a normal student at any
other school not receiving this fund would get,   It is extremely skewed
so changing it from thirty two hundred and thirty nine hundred you
always have winners and losers, but in doing that it mitigated the
extreme losses and the extreme gains that I don’t want to belabor, but I
will say this, the ones who in the house formula that have water that's
rewarded. they're going to be losers significantly regardless to
different degrees but when you move over to all the other areas what you
do is you dampen the ?? so that you end up producing and of course this
may sound too good to be true nineteen winners out of twenty seven
total, and if it is reduced to thirty two hundred, from where it is now,
and Anson County will drop out very soon Ashe County is within four
students of dropping out Greene county is within eighteen Martin County
is with thirty five</p>

<p id="220:00">
And for those others that have been small but not small enough, or least
they were small enough but their tax rate was too high it kills another
4. So I will simply say that there’s a lot more winners in this room
than losers, with the 39.  Someone wants to show the numbers one on one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stevens.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  I was just trying to let you know that the
counties who benefit when it goes to 39 are Cherokee county who would
get no other small money at this point, Currituck county, Jackson
County, and Transylvania county. And that it is written out as to
exactly as to who it helps out and who it hurts.  It also changes the
per student amount from 1625 when it’s 3900 students to 2300 when it’s
only 3200 students.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Elmore?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  This is a question for staff. Prior to this
change with this, going back to last fiscal year. What was the small
school max number that you could have?  Meaning, the number of students
you could have in the system, what was the number there?  To qualify for
small school prior?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff, care to respond?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chris Nordstrom, fiscal research. The largest number of students you
could have last year under the small county formulas was 4,080.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative West?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.  I guess there comes a time every once in a
while in the legislature when you see a bill or an amendment before you
that your really don’t like.  Although this would help Cherokee county
to the tune of about $735,000.  I represent Graham and Clay county, two
of the poorest counties in the state and they would actually lose money
so being in that predicament I want to oppose the amendment and support
the poorer counties.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further comment on the amendment?  If not, Representative Speciale?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just want to make sure that last gentleman knew he needed to support
the amendment if he’s trying to keep them counties from losing money.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s right. That’s right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McGrady?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe Representative West misspoke.  His point, he would be, I think
be supportive of this amendment based on the comments that
Representative West made. Again remember there really are two things
going on here.  The Education Chairs change the formula itself based on
study that had been done of the formula.  Everybody recognized the
original formula was way out of date and couldn’t even really remember
why it was this way. All we’re arguing about here is where you draw the
line.  And it’s the same amount of money spread out over some number of
schools, and there are winner schools systems and losers. Our judgment
as chairs were that we wanted to keep the number lower because as a
general matter that is going to favor the smallest counties, the
smallest systems. And that’s why we took a shot a 3200. There’s no magic
to it but I’ll be supporting the amendment offered with respect to this
matter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All those in favor of the amendment signify by saying aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Oppose, no.  The ayes have it and the amendment passes.  Net amendment

G-27V3. ALG-27, excuse me, 25V3. Amendment 56, offered by Representative
Queen.
Representative Queen is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, thank you. This concerns the funding for the North Carolina arts
council. It is J1 in your money report. Earlier, Representative
Cleveland had an amendment on item six, administration for the North
Carolina arts council in J1.
Our budget started out with a cut of a half a million dollars each year
recurring to administration in item seven. We also have cuts to the
grants program to 228 million each year in cuts. What I'm attempting to
do with my amendment is sort of stem the hemorrhaging of our arts
councils. The arts council supports the arts in all of our communities.
The arts council helps with our economic development, particularly in
the mountains and our small towns. It helps with building our
infrastructure, collaborating, working with our communities to build our
arts institutions from community theaters to local orchestras and
courses, fairs, and street events. They do the music trails and craft
trails, and lots of other things in the mountains. It's a very small
amount of money in the state budget that has a huge effect, certainly in
my district and I assume it does in yours. Just to give you a little
background of why I'm concerned about this item, in 2008, we had over
10,500,000 state actual appropriations. In 2009, it went to 9,500,000.
2010, 8,300,000. In the last three years, we've cut 1.2 million
additional from that, and three staff positions. My concern is, when we
started we had a cut of a half a million dollars a year in each year of
item six of administration. The arts council reported that would
represent about eight staff members from their organization.
What the Cleveland amendment did is take that 500,000 and make half of
it department wide flexibility cuts, and left the other 250,000 as cuts
directly from administration. What my amendment does is takes out that
second 250,000 dollars of cuts from the administration, so they do take
a department flexibility cut of 250,000, but it restores 250,000 back
into their budget.
Again, it's a very effective program. Now, where do we get the money?
Where do we get this 250,000? It's hard to find the money in the general
government sector, so I look as hard as I could. I tried not to step
toes that I had stepped on earlier, so I've taken it from the auditor's
office. The auditors, even if we take the previous amendment that
Representative Fisher passed earlier with us where we restored the
humanities council from the audit, we're still just cutting the audit
office 2.7 per total. This is what we have cut in general government.
Administration has had a 16 percent cut. General assembly has a 2.5
percent cut. The governor has had a 6.7 percent cut. Housing and finance
agents, a 10.6 percent cut. Boards of election, a 29 percent cut. The
state controller has had 1.9 percent.</p>

<p id="235:00">
Representative: … the secretary of state, 2.3% cut. For an average, I
just say that to say that our average cut is 3.6%. So, a 2.7% is not a
wide cut to the auditor’s office. I think it is a reasonable place to
take the cut, to protect this very effective state wide program of the
arts council. So I recommend your support of my amendment.
Speaker: Representative Cleveland is recognized.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chairman. We do not support this. First of
all, we are talking about the administration, not the arts council. The
council, when it came to committee, was reduced well over a million
dollars. We only gave them a 220,000 per year to buy in reduction. We
did the best we could do for the arts council. The administration was
given a 500,000 reduction and as I said earlier in a moment that I ran
the closer resources came and asked to change that to a $250,000 to
administration, and give them the other $250,000 as an across the
department reduction, which we did. This leaves, right now with the
$250,000 reduction, leave $1.3 million in the budget for the
administration, which is sufficient for them to function. We are also
doing a study of them as to what is actually going on there. To say that
the auditor can afford the money is a humongous misnomer. The auditor,
we tried to give some new positions, so she could get into the IT
portions of the agencies, because of the problems we had in the IT
portions. Due to money restrictions, we could not do that. The auditor,
at this point, cannot afford a $250,000 reduction. Please vote no.
Speaker: If members can speak briefly. I believe the two speakers have
covered the points for and against. Representative Adams?
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chair, I will be brief. I do not know a
lot about a lot of things, but I do know a lot about the arts. I also
know that because these programs that are administered there, are
administered for counties and cities all over this state, that they need
people. As Representative Queen, has mentioned to you, the number of
cuts they have sustained, which means that they have - their staff has
been diminished, and, of course, you cannot administer programs and
deliver the service without the people. They have been doing more for
less over and over again. This is a good amendment and will help them to
serve , in a more effective way, all the counties that you are
representing. I would ask for your support for the amendment.
Speaker: Representative Earl?
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chair. You beat me to what I was going to
suggest and request, that, given the hour, that we be brief with
comments.
Speaker: All those in favor of the amendment signify by saying aye

ALG-27V2. Representative Fairclothe is recognized to offer his
amendment.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chairman. We did replace this in order to
go back for a different source of funding. We have done that. I told you
about the war memorial program, i.e. the field of honor. I will not
repeat that, but speaking to the funding, this is a one time reduction
in the office of the state controller, and I am told by the staff that
is very workable. So I ask for your support.

Cleveland?

Although the war memorial is probably a worthy program, my county built
their own war memorial and we paid for it. But that, as an aside, the
department or the State comptroller cannot take a $350,000 reduction.
They were given over a $1.2 million reduction from the Senate. I talked
to the comptroller and he laid out what he needed as a minimum to

another $350,000 from them at this time would be detrimental to the

[SPEAKER CHANGES] ALM-36, version 5, is an amendment to allow for the
Department of Commerce to establish a public/private partnership and
engage in a, just gives them the permission to engage in a
reorganization effort to help save money. Before we come back in short
session, the Department of Commerce has to report back to the House on
their progress and I would ask that, this is in the Governor's budget.
We advanced the reporting date compared to the Governor's, the
Governor's proposed budget and we removed the, they asked for $1 million
to help make this happen. So we removed the money. This doesn't effect,
this is just permission for the Department of Commerce to establish this
public/private partnership and reorganize and realize operational
savings. I'd move adoption of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative West?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to ask
Representative Murry a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Murry. Can you assure this
committee that this is in no way an attempt to incorporate the Rural
Center with the Department of Commerce?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative West, currently the Rural Center is not
part of the Department of Commerce and this amendment just deals with
reorganization of the existing department of commerce and so this in no
way seeks to impact the operations of the Rural Center.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You said currently. Is it in the picture somewhere
down the road to do that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, sir. If anything there could be a better
relationship between the Department of Commerce and the Rural Center,
but this in no way seeks to seize operation. I think that issue has been
addressed in the budget with the complete funding in the House budget of
the Rural Center and I think that's the will of this body and I think we
were trying to operate within that context.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Murry.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Represent...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If there was to be a plan that may or may not
reorganize the Rural Center or put it under the Department of Commerce,
would that proposal have to come before the General Assembly before that
took place?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly. If any plan, anything that would have that
impact would definitely be something that would require legislative
action.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
