  <p id="000:00">The House will come back to order. All member elect for the 2015 House
of Representative will please occupy the seats to which you have been
assigned. All visitors will please repair to the lobbies and the
galleries and the acting sergeant at arms will close the doors. Please
be in order and silence your cellular phones. We welcome all the family
members who are gathered, the friends and the guests here today and
those who are watching and listening. Obedient to law you have assembled
at this time and place for the convening of the regular 2015 bi-annual
session of the General Assembly. I shall ask all members elect and
guests in the chamber to rise for the opening prayer, which will be
offered by Representative John Torbett. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and
gentlemen, we asked all members, the year is 1774 and representatives
from each of the 13 states were meeting in Philadelphia to iron out
political differences that threatened to destroy a new nation. The
arguments intensified until one man stood and spoke these words, that
man was Benjamin Franklin, &quot;I have lived, sir, a long time, and the
longer I live the more convincing proofs I see of this truth, that God
governs in the affairs of men, and if a sparrow cannot fall to the
ground without His notice, is it probably that an empire can rise
without His aid? I therefore beg leave to move that henceforth prayers
imploring the assistance of Heaven and its blessings on our
deliberations be held in this assembly every morning before we proceed
to business.&quot; The first prayer was offered on the morning of
September 7, 1774 at 9:00 AM and delivered by the the Reverend Jacob
Duchet, rector of Christ Church of Philadelphia, PA. He delivered the
first prayer of the Continental Congress, this prayer I offer today.
Will you join me? Oh, Lord, our heavenly father, high and mighty king of
kings and lord of lord, who does from thy throne behold all the dwellers
on earth and reign us with a power supreme and uncontrolled over all the
kingdoms, empires and governments. Look down in mercy we beseech the on
these, our American states, who have fled to thee from the rod of our
oppressor and thrown themselves on thy gracious protection, desiring to
be henceforth dependent only on thee. To thee have they appealed for the
righteousness of their cause. To thee do they now look up for that
countenance and support with thou alonst can give. Take them, therefore,
heavenly father under thy nurturing care. Give them wisdom in council
and valor in the field. Defeat the malicious designs of our cruel
adversaries. Convince them of the unrighteousness of their cause and if
they persist in their sanguinary purposes of own unerring justice,
sounding in their hearts, constrain them to drop the weapons of war from
their unnerved hands in the day of battle. Be though present, oh God of
wisdom, and direct the councils of this honorable assembly. Enable them
to settle things on the best and surest foundation, that the scene of
blood may be speedily closed, that order, harmony and peace may be
effectually restored and truth and justice, religion and piety prevail
and flourish amongst the people. Preserve the health of their bodies and
vigor of their minds. Shower down on them and the millions they here
represent such temporal blessings as thou seeist expedient for them in
this world and crown them with the everlasting glory in the world to
come. All this we ask in the name and through the merits of Jesus
Christ, thy son and our savior. Amen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Amen. Please
remain standing for the presentation of the colors by the North Carolina
National Guard Honor Guard.

The national anthem will be sung by Amanda Watson Bailey North Carolina,
Miss North Carolina 2008 and a resident of Wake County.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
O say can you see by the dawn&#39;s early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight&#39;s last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,
O&#39;er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets&#39; red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave,
O&#39;er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

Please be seated.
The Secretary of State, being the custodian of the North Carolina
election returns, has deposited in the Principal Clerk&#39;s office for
inclusion in the journal, a complete certification of all members elect
as evidenced by the abstract of notes filed in that office under the
hand and seal of Clerks of the Superior Court of several counties of the
state and the State Board of Elections. This will eliminate the
necessity of individual filing of election credentials with the Clerk.
The names of persons so certified as being elected shall be called in
numerical order of the House districts. As your name is called, please
stand, answer present, and remain standing until the roll is completed

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please be seated. Now that you have been seated as a member of the House
of Representatives, the first order of business is the election of a
speaker from your membership. In the absence of adopted rules  the House
is governed by usage, custom and precedent, and by the general
parliamentary law. The best evidence of what are the established usage
and customs are the rules as last in effect. It has not been the custom
of the House of Representatives to allow a member to pass on a role call
vote. The election of speaker requires a majority of the members present
in voting. An answer of present at the time your name is called is not a
vote. No member may vote unless the member is in the chamber when the
question is put to the body. The floor is now open to nominations. For
what purpose does the gentleman from Johnston County representative
Daughtry rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To nominate Tim K Moore as speaker of the North Carolina House
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor and may proceed to the well of the house.
[SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you madam clerk. Former speaker Tillis, now senator Tillis,
members of the supreme court, special guest and fellow members. It is a
pleasure and a great honor in just a few moments to place in a
nomination as the next speaker of the house of this coming biennium, the
honorable Tim K Moore. But before I do, I would first like to speak to
those members who have aspirations of being speaker in the next
biennium. If Tim Moore is running I would suggest that you not put your
name in the ring. He is hard to beat, I know from experience. Most of
you do not know this, but Tim Moore will not the the first
representative Moore to serve as speaker of the House. In 1870, W A
Moore of Chowan county, also a good republican, served as speaker. And
for those of you who are wondering, I wasn&#39;t there during that
session. But I have served under five different speakers and I think I
know a little something about what it takes to make a successful
speaker. First, a good speaker must have a clear understanding of the
importance of public education. K through 12, our community colleges,
and our university system. Tim is a product of public education, he
graduated from
Kings Mountain High School, and the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill. He also served as a member of the University Board of
Governors from 1997 to 2001, giving him additional insights into our
public education system. He therefore realizes that an education is the
great equalizer. And that anyone, in this state, no matter where that
person lives, should be, if willing to apply themselves, ought to be
able to be educated and successful. Tim is committed to our public
education system. Secondly, a good speaker must appreciate our third
branch of government, the judiciary, as a practicing attorney in
Cleveland county since 1997 he has seen first hand the importance of the
root of law.

  <p id="025:00">While we suffered the disaster at the Boston Marathon, we stood with
Boston. Today, we stand with the people of France. We are Charlie. He
wants to ensure that the laws we passed are enforced without partiality
or favoritism, and further, he is ready to help bring our court system
into the 21st century. Third, a good Speaker must provide leadership and
so our state can continue to emerge from the crises of the great
recession that occurred a few years ago. In addition to being a
practicing attorney, Tim is a small businessman and he has seen
firsthand how our state must continue down the road of being competitive
with our neighboring states and putting a welcome mat, welcome mat out
for new industry that is looking for a place to call home. He wants
everyone to have a job and be secure in that job and successful
financially. What greater legacy could a Speaker have than to be a job
creator? Four, a good Speaker must be a good parent because every parent
wants in the long run to see that their children are left a better state
than we have now. Tim has fine, two fine young sons, McCrag and Wilson.
I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll introduce them to you later. Because of them, he
will take the long view of making sure that we make decisions now that
will impact our state for years to come. Whether that, that involves
farmers, rural areas or, or whether that involves distressed counties,
make no mistake, Tim is up for the job. When we elect Tim, all ranks in
North Carolina will be proud and thank us, both Democrats, Republicans,
and Independents. He can get along with people. He knows how to find the
common ground with the Senate or the Governor. But most importantly, he
is ready to work with all of us for the betterment of our state. He will
do an outstanding job and there is a lot to be done. This is the
people&#39;s House, and Tim is ready to lead it. Madam clerk, my fellow
members, I proudly place into nomination for the Speaker of the North
Carolina House, my friend, the gentleman from Cleveland, the honorable
Tim K. Moore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake, Representative Dollar
wish to be recognized?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Speaker, I rise to second the nomination of the gentleman from
Cleveland County, Timothy K. Moore, as Speaker of the North Carolina
House of Representatives.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, honored guest, family and friends, one way to tell if a person
is a native North Carolinean is to ask them a question. Where are you
from? If they answer with the name of their home county, they&#39;re a
native North Carolinean. In this chamber, the recognition to speak
begins with the calling of the county name of a member who&#39;s being,
who wishes recognition. Tim, Representative Tim Moore is a true son of
his native Cleveland County. Tim&#39;s best day is walking atop
King&#39;s Mountain with his two boys, McCray and Wilson, soaking up the
sun, soaking up the moment, soaking up the history. And as you recall
from our history, some 235 years ago, North Carolineans won an
unexpected and pivotal victory defeating a British led Tory army at the
top of King&#39;s Mountain. The continental army and militia had
experienced a crushing defeat at Camden, and our state lay open for
invasion. Lord Cornwallis advanced to Charlotte, and with a strong
flanking column of Tories on his left led by Major Patrick Ferguson, the
British were determined the pacify the Western counties of our state
threatening to

  <p id="030:00">Put the countryside to, quote, “fire and sword”. As Representative West
will attest, that was a bad idea. Answering the call to serve,
frontiersmen, hunters, farmers, tradesmen, led by such backcountry
kernels with names that we honor today – leaders like Joseph McDowell,
Joseph Winston, Isaac Shelby and Benjamin Cleveland. 900 patriots
strong, they surrounded and repeatedly stormed up King’s Mountain,
eventually winning the high ground and taking the battle. Having lost
the left wing of his arm, Wallace was forced to retire back to South
Carolina. The western Piedmont mountains of North Carolina and beyond
were secure from invasion, and a young nation cheered a much-needed
victory. These were ordinary people willing to work together to
sacrifice, to serve a cause greater than their own. The character and
value of those patriots lives on today. They have shaped and inspired
leaders like Tim Moore with that same willingness to serve, the courage
to fight for what is right, and the determination to stand firm for what
is best for all North Carolinians. He will do this as he helps lead this
great state to an even brighter and more prosperous future. Madam
Speaker, Timothy K. Moore will honorably serve as Speaker, exhibiting
the best qualities of leadership and service. I second the nomination of
the gentleman from Cleveland County. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Are there further
nomination? For what purpose does the gentleman from Harnett,
Representative Lewis wish to be recognized? [SPEAKER CHANGES] For a
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Speaker. I move nominations be closed and Timothy K.
Moore of Cleveland County be elected by acclamation Speaker of the North
Carolina House of Representatives for the 2015-16 session of the North
Carolina General Assembly. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there objection? Hearing
none, the Chair declares nominations are closed. Those in favor of the
election of Representative Tim Moore as Speaker will say “aye”. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed, “no”. The ayes have it and
Representative Tim Moore is elected Speaker of the 2015 House of
Representatives. At this time I would and Representative Daughtry,
Representative Dollar, Representative Cotham, Representative Bumgardner,
Representative Hastings, Representative Torbett, Representative Brian
Brown, Representative McElraft, Representative Hager and Representative
Larry Hall to please join our newly elected Speaker at the rear of the
chamber and escort him to the well of the House.

didn&#39;t pull out the little step stool for me to step on this time.
He normally likes to do that for me. Distinguished justices of the
Supreme Court, members of the court of appeals, thank you for being
here. Members of the House, government secretaries, other distinguished
visitors, thank you for being here with us today on this great day. I
want to first of all congratulate my colleagues here in the House on
your reelection, and whether it&#39;s your first term or your tenth
term, it&#39;s always an honor to be here and those of us who run and
serve, we have this job to do but the only way we can do it is because
our families and our friends and our supporters let us do it. I would
ask my fellow members of the House to please rise and thank our family
members who stand by us and allow us to do this, please. [Applause] In
that same sense, with a spirit of gratitude, I do want to that my family
who are here today. I have numerous relatives who&#39;ve traveled across
the state to be here, friends from outside the state, and it means a lot
for you all to be here. Most family down front here and of course my two
sons who were up here helping me a bit ago, I love you all and
appreciate the support you give and can&#39;t thank you enough for your
support and the opportunity to serve. Let me tell you a little bit about
myself. My good friend Nelson Dollar stole the history lesson about
King&#39;s Mountain, and we were trying to find a witness to the battle
of King&#39;s Mountain but George Cleveland was not willing to come up
here and talk to us today. You know, if you think about

the absolutely best state in the nation and you go back to the
Revolutionary War and the Freedoms that were fought for and the freedom
that we have today to sit in this very chamber and pass the laws and do
the things we do. We have so much that we owe our predecessors.  Growing
up in Kings Mountain I practiced law in a small town, have two boys who
are growing up into your men.  The youngest one now is into drivers ed.
I think we have to file a bill now to raise the drivers age.  I
don&#39;t know.  That might be something we need to do.  Growing up in
North Carolina in a small town I learned the value of hard work, learned
the value of getting back and had the opportunity to serve in this house
seat since 2002.  I remember the first time I sat in here getting sworn
in my oldest one was two years old and the youngest one was just a baby
and now here we are with them being 14 and 12 these many years later and
being here in the house.  One thing I can tell you is that this is a
great institution.  It&#39;s a great institution not because of the
building or where we are but because of the people who are here.  Those
of you who are serving, those of you who served before, like my good
friend Jack Hunt.  Jack, thank you for being here with us today former
Speaker ETM and Rules Chairman.  Jack, you did a wonderful job for
Cleveland County and you honor us by being here again today.  Thank you
very much.
It&#39;s an interesting public service I think that drives every single
member who is here. An interesting public service aside from party
labels, ideaology anything else we all have different backgrounds, we
all have different views of how we see the world but at the end of the
day we all come together in this very room to reach solutions to try to
move North Carolina forward.  I remember two examples when I was here in
the minority that I can think of.  We worked on legislation to
strengthen the laws with child predators the (sp) Act.  A number of you
here worked with me on that bill.  That bill is now in effect and we now
have one of the toughest laws in the state on predators.  We passed
legislation to increase the penalties on repeat drunk drivers.
We&#39;ve done alot of things that were nonpartisan or bipartisan and
I&#39;d like to see us continue to do those kinds of efforts as we move
forward.  You know, but we have alot of challenges facing this state.
The last few years we&#39;ve dealt with alot of issues.  We&#39;ve dealt
with unemployment, we&#39;ve dealt with economic development, trying to
improve the way we do road funding and infrastructure.  Well,
there&#39;s still more work there to be done.  There are great ideas
from the problems facing North Carolina from both sides of the aisle and
the answers are never Republican or Democrat.  Their North Carolina
answers, there North Carolina solutions and I pledge that we work to see
that we arrive at those.  All of us have a desire to improve our
communities back home and state wide.  It&#39;s those interests,
it&#39;s those efforts that make it worth being here and I thank
everyone of you for taking the time away from your families, your
careers to come up here and give of your time to serve in the house.
And, I think alot of time folks don&#39;t realize the amount of time it
takes.  Of course those of you who served here know and you folks here
you&#39;re about to find out.  So, it does take quite a bit of time.  I
wanted to touch on a couple of ideas that I thought we should address in
this upcoming session.  One is an initiative to work with public private
partnerships with groups like the YMCA, Boys &amp; Girls Club of North
Carolina, Big Brothers &amp; Big Sisters to help address issues with
afterschool care.  Alot of youth, sometimes it&#39;s that period between
the end of school and when a parent or some other caregiver gets home
that alot of either good things can happen or alot of bad things can
happen.  I think that&#39;s an issue that this year we ought to work on.
 That&#39;s something I think we can work together.  Both parties can
and the folks will come behind.  I&#39;m going to task our Education
Committee with working on that, finding those solutions and coming up
with a good plan moving forward to address those matters.  Also, I want
to recognize the fact that North Carolina is made in large part, in
major part frankly, to the sacrifices of those who have served our
country and to the military.  We are one of the most military friendly
states in the nation.  We have alot to be thankful for.  I&#39;d like to
ask those who are serving in the military or have served in the military
to please rise so we can appropriately thank you for your service.
Those members who are here please rise.

  <p id="045:00">Would also like to extend that same recognition to any law enforcement
officers, firefighters, or first responders who also serve. If you are,
please rise so that we can welcome and thank you as well. Members, we
have a special guest with us today, and I saw Sergeant Reed Ellington
rise and I&#39;d like to take a moment to tell you about a special guest
we have today. We&#39;d like to welcome Cooper Ellington, who is seated
here in the back of the chamber along with his parents Sergeant Reed
Ellington and Stephanie Ellington. If ya&#39;ll would please stand.
Cooper is an honor roll student in ninth grade at Union Pines High
School in Moore County. Representative Bowles is their representative.
For the last three and a half years, Cooper has courageously battled VHL
syndrome. Cooper, I want you to know the North Carolina House is proud
to have you here. You honor us with your presence, and you have, you are
in our prayers, and we wish you the best and hope one day you will be
here serving with us. Thank you again for being here and for your
courageous fight. Now, a lot of what we do, in fact most of what we do
is about the future. If we pass a law here, it has an effect, but
it&#39;s down the road. The major policy changes we effect are long term
through the things that will effect our children and grandchildren and
beyond. And I think it&#39;s important we remember that in everything we
do. The challenges going forward, we also have, I mentioned a couple of
initiatives. We probably need to make, priority number one, jobs in this
state. What can we do to retain the industries, the companies, the
businesses we have, and to recruit new ones. I pledge to you as your
speaker I will do all I can in this body to make sure that we pass
policies and laws that do just that. That we bring jobs to this state,
that we keep taxes low, that we invest in infrastructure, and that we
continue to move North Carolina forward. There are a lot of issues that
will come up that frankly none of us are thinking of right now. And
I&#39;m sure when we do, we will deal with those the way we have. We
will confront them directly, we will deal with one another candidly, and
we will try to reach the best solution we can. At the end of the day, we
need to listen to our constituents and make sure that we are in fact
putting them first. Something speaker Tillis always said that I thought
was always, was very appropriate was vote your conscience, vote your
constituents, and then vote for your caucus. Vote in that order. Always
put your principles above anything else, and then your, then your folks
back home, and then your caucus at that point. I think if we all try to
adhere to that it&#39;ll help the session, it&#39;ll help us all be even
better members. I&#39;ll work this set out before us. We will work
together and cordially. Every now and then we will disagree. Not as much
as you would think. You know what, you see the media, you think
we&#39;re up here fighting and arguing all of the time. That in fact
isn&#39;t the case. I would say probably 85% of the time we&#39;re
generally in agreement. It&#39;s that 15% that gets talked about a
little more. And the key is when we get those 15% of the times when we
disagree either between the parties or within the parties or who knows
what, that we just do so respectfully with one another. I pledge to you
as your Speaker to do that. I&#39;m looking very forward to serving as
your Speaker in this biennium. Looking forward to working with each and
every member of this House. I want you to know that I consider this the
highest honor for this job and I will give everything I can every day to
make sure that we do it. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless this
great state of North Carolina. Thank you.

  <p id="050:00">Representative ?? is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I have placed a resolution with the Clerk for consideration
by this body. The Clerk will follow the resolution and assign a member.
House resolution 1, ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sponsor representative Lewis, a House resolution adopting the temporary
rules of the House of Representatives for the 2015 Regular Session. The
gentleman from Harvard has the floor to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, the House, I would like to
direct your attention to the temporary rules of the House that are
before you. In the effort to be expedient, I will point out to the
members only the changes that are proposed in these temporary rules. On
page 1, line 26, specifies that no votes will be taken on the House
floor on Sundays.
Page 1, lines 30 and 31 specifies that the House floor will be cleared
of all non-members and staff 5 minutes prior to the convening of
session.
Page 3 — pardon me, ladies and gentlemen, page 5 — lines 8 through 11,
this is a rule change that says, &quot;If an amendment is offered, and
it is the intent that the amendment do lay upon the table, that the
amendment sponsor would be given at least 2 minutes to explain it prior
to it being laid upon the table.&quot;
I would also direct your attention on page 5, lines 46 and 47. This
simply adds to the list the vice chair or chairs of the Committee on
Rules, Calendar, and Operations of the House. If the chair of the
Committee on Rules, Calendar, and Operations of House is not on the
floor or unable to participate in debate, this makes clear that the vice
chair would have the same authority to move the previous question.
I would like to direct your attention to pages 9, 10, and the top of
page 11. There are various changes to the committees. I&#39;ll be glad
to go through those if members desire.
On page 11, lines 24 through 27, this is also an empowering change in
the rules for the members. This says that if there&#39;s a bill that
two-thirds of the members of the committee are willing to sign a letter
to the Chairman and ask for it to be heard, that the Chairman will place
it upon the agenda for the next scheduled meeting of that committee.
Members, I direct your attention to page 14, beginning at line 8 and
going all the way down. These are largely — pardon me, these are purely
technical changes conforming the dates for bill request to be filed,
bill drafts to be requested, and ?? This conforms our rules to match
this year&#39;s dates.
I would also point out, on line 39 is a very small change that,
recognizing that the House now uses the electronic dashboard, and it
makes reference to following the bill electronically under procedures
established and published by the Principal Clerk.
Members, I would point out that on page 16, lines 14 and 15, there&#39;s
also a change. This, too, is purely technical, reflecting the way the
House does business now with the electronic dashboard.
Members, on page 16, also, beginning at line 31, the old rules
referenced a legislative commission that no longer exists. This simply
conforms to the legislative — the Joint Legislative Commission on
Government Operations, which, of course, does exist.
Page 17, members, beginning on line 26, this is a substantial change
that&#39;s a part of Speaker Moore&#39;s attempt to further empower and
inform the membership and increase transparency. This will

dedication and his many contributions to this institution and to the
state of North Carolina for those of you who  are newly arrived members
amongst us or who are visiting the people’s house today let me make a
few points a public service is a desired quality Paul Stam may taste
throughout his adult life a U.S marine serving his country a son is
school teacher serving his church he is practiced and distinguished
attorney serving his profession and his community and local expat leader
serving his party are just a few examples with respect to this house
representative Stam is in his 8th  term and served as minority and
majority leader and most recently as speaker for tam. Skip Stam is
personally responsible for successful transformation of many of this
chamber for being active and interested citizen candidates to become
dedicated and effective legislators. His availability to offer advice
his willingness to collaborate on bill of development his careful
deliberation and honesty in his critique and his stressful cooperation
within the crocus and  across the hall has consistently resulted in
quality legislation and best interest of those we served. Skipper is a
teacher and a mentor and I personally thank him for that. I echoed an
agree with the thoughts of the representative Nelson Dollar when he said
that Paul Stam is qout.

  <p id="060:00">A man of unshakeable character, after a difficult legislative battle
when the rhetoric often became heated,Paul Stan is as quick to offer a
smile and a handshake to his adversaries as he is to his allies. He
serves as an example in our democratic process that you can fight
passionately about deeply held beliefs. And when the battle is over, win
or lose,he holds no grudges or ill toward his opponents in a campaign,
in court, or in this chamber unquote. Paul Stan is not willing to take
on an assignment to do just enough to fulfill to the job requirements,
we can rest assured that if we see fit to elect him to this office, he
will stand ready to assist our speaker and to participate in the
leadership activities necessary to support us all in our duties and
responsibilities. He will personally be involved in promoting meaningful
policy development and will personally be participating in the
furtherance of legislation in keeping with the strong conservative
principles and his deep christian faith. I can think of no more
qualified candidate no more concerned, inclusive member of the
leadership team of this twenty fifteen/sixteen house then Paul Stan. For
these reasons and more, I respectfully ask for the support of the

North Carolina house and this one hundred and fifty second convening of
the general assembly. Today representative Stan will begin serving his
eighth term as a member of the House of Representatives.He is one of the
most trusted and respected members of this body. I have served with him
eight years and during that time he has served as minority leader,
majority leader, and speaker Pro Tempore. His door is always open as all
of you know and he will give you advice and answer your questions. He
may not always agree with you but he respects you and will give you the
truth. His integrity is beyond reproach and contrary to what some of you
may think,he did not write the MagnaCarter. However, I&#39;m sure he can
read it. He is a go to person for anything pertaining to history and I

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Wake has the floor. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] This paperwork thing again… Members, guests, Justices Edmonds,
Newby and Jackson, I am especially pleased that former Speaker Pro
Tempore Jack Hunt is here today. He and I served here together many
years ago when I was young and he was distinguished. I accept your
election. Two years ago on this occasion, I thanked my family and I used
the examples of my eldest grandsons for some lessons in how we could do
legislation better, but they’re here today and I’m not going to
embarrass them, Aiden and Will, but this is a time to be reminded of
first principles, and 2015 is the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta, and
members of the House would be shocked, shocked if I did not mention it
and draft it into the service of the House. Magna Carta was a deal
between the nobility and King John. He was in deep trouble and barely
kept the crown and perhaps his life by making 63 campaign promises. In
Section 25 he promised every county shall remain at its ancient rent
without increase. Some issues never die. Tax increases and unfunded
mandates were not invented last year. Litigation, then and now, requires
years to complete. His campaign promise number 40 provides “To no one
will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice. Many of us are
working now to realize that promise so that the resolution of criminal
charges at least may require months and not years. In a day when the
principles of free trade and free enterprise are attacked from the right
and the left, King John’s campaign promise number 41 provides… and I
should say this is all in Latin, so this is translated for all of us.
Promise number 41 provided “All merchants may enter or leave England
unharmed and without fear by land or water for purpose of trade, free
from all illegal exactions, in accordance with ancient and lawful

  <p id="070:00">Customs. Free trade, free enterprise have many friends, except when
it&#39;s friends, think it damages their own pocketbooks. Eight hundred
years ago the English realized that free trade and free enterprise are
powerful engines of economic growth for the state as a whole.
Environmental issues didn&#39;t just surface fifty years ago. Eight
hundred years ago there were those advocating that the locking up of
land from use by the public. Robin Hood and the sheriff of Nottingham
came to blows over this provision. Of this question. Robin Hood won with
campaign promise number forty seven provided this, all forests, remember
he got exiled to the forest and he got in trouble for shooting the Kings
deer, all forests that have been created in our range shall at once be
disafforested and a similar course shall be followed with regard to
riverbanks. I am not advocating today that we literally fulfill this
campaign promise by eliminating the parks at Grandfather Mountain,
places like that. Well, I&#39;m just telling it&#39;s not a new issue.
Religious liberty, is always an issue. In 1215 the first and last
sections of Magna Carta protected the church from the government. In
2015 when the Little Sisters of the Poor, a charitable order of nuns, is
threatened with massive fines by the federal government, we need a
restoration of religious freedom. When we next reconvene on January 28th
there will be a legislative rethink on that subject, open to all. And
Magna Carta even addresses  separation of powers, and I&#39;m glad
senator Tillis is here today, because he may get an idea here from
promise number sixty one. North Carolina was perhaps the first state to
place the principle of separation of powers in its constitution. On
instruction, from the inhabitants represented ?? of Orange County to the
provincial assembly in 1776. But what is the remedy for use or ?? of
power by an executive like King John. Is it lawsuits? Magna Carta
suggested a unique consequence. This requires not only a translation
from Latin to English, but a paraphrase so that you may enjoy it.
Senator Tillis take note. King John made campaign promise number sixty
one. If we, or our attorney general, offend in any respect against any
man, an offense  is made known to the senate. That is, the 25 chosen ??
They shall come to us, or to the attorney general to declare it and
claim immediate redress. And if we, or the attorney general make no
redress within forty days, forty days, the senate may then distraint
upon and assail us in every way possible with the support of the whole
community of the land by seizing our castles, our lands our possessions
and anything else, except only our own person and that of the first
lady, and our children. Until they have secured such redress as they
have determined upon. And having secured that redress, the senate may
then resume its normal obedience to us.  That would really turn things
around in Washington. Let us enjoy the session as we address new
challenges, new technology, new demographics and the ideas of new
representatives. But old principles will often suggest the way forward.
Thank you very much for your election.

The lady is recognized to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Most of us know that change is ever present as
we look around this body and seen new faces and new bodies, but some
things are good that we wish to keep steady and constant, and over the
past 22 years, Mrs. Weeks has served alongside the 400 men and women and
the 7 speakers who have served before us. Mrs. Weeks is excellent and
has the ability that has made her an institution in our honorable
assembly and she is a strong pillar in our house. Through our most
chaotic times, and we&#39;ve had some, in proceedings over the past two
decades, Denise Weeks has made sure that our calendars were printed,
that the session bell always rings on time and our votes are counted.
Her knowledge, her composure and particularly her integrity has earned
the respect of this body and extensive national praise from all of her
peers. Ms. Weeks is recognized as a leader throughout the country. She
served as the President of the American Society of Legislative Clerks
and Secretaries and she currently serves as the Vice Chair of [??] of
Legislative Procedures Commission. Members of the House, it&#39;s an
honor and a privilege for me to have this opportunity to nominate our
friend and I feel our colleague to each of us, place the name of Denise
Weeks in nomination for the office of House Principal Clerk. Her
dedication, professionalism and efficiency certainly merits re-election
to this great body. I ask for your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what

but that&#39;s not quite true, Moses was in high school when I came, but
there&#39;s one other person here, I&#39;ve had the privilege of serving
six governors, 11 speakers, but only three clerks. Three clerks. My
first clerk was Joanne Smith in &#39;73, my second clerk was Grace
Collins, and the only clerk that I really know very well is Denise Weeks
because she&#39;s been here about as long as I have, not quite as long,
but just, but she&#39;s better looking than me. Denise has done a great
job. I call her the 121st member of this body and the most important
member of this body, and I say that because in her position she advises
us, she tells us where we go wrong, she tells us what we should do, she
tells us what we shouldn&#39;t do, and the funny thing about it is all
of us listen to her. I call her an ego bust. If you are ever in this
body and you can see a member storming down to the front because that
member perceives a problem that he should have presented and he comes
face to face with a smiley, cheerful Denise Weeks that says, &quot;No,
you&#39;re wrong.&quot; That&#39;s an ego buster. So, Mr. Speaker,
ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to second the nomination of
Denise Weeks for the office of Principal Clerk of this House. She has
done this state well, she has done the nation well, and I would hope
that we would continue her service with this election. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Harnett,
Representative Lewis rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman may state his motion and is recognized to debate
the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I
would move that nominations for the office of Principal Clerk
