<p id="00:00">
Good morning. We're winding down the session. You know that the things
need to move along quickly, so if everyone would give their attention
please so that we can get along and now we'll ask that if the Sergeant
at Arms needs to allow people to sit on the back rows where they're
already sitting and in other spots if we have overflow in the room, so
if the Sergeant at Arms would do that, please. And our Sergeant at Arms
staff today is Anderson Mettis, Steve McCaid, Guiles Jeffrey and Billy
Fetcher, and thank you all for what you do. We're going to start with
the House Bill 1114 this morning, Elk Park Deed Transferring Property,
Senator Soucek, is he here to run? OK, thank you, sir, and you have the
floor. Senator Soucek, I'm sorry. Members of the committee, this is a
local bill for the town of Elk Park in Avery County. Senator Soucek and
I share Avery County. We're both in agreement. Basically states that the
registered deeds won't record a deed of property in the town of Elk Park
unless the tax has been paid on that property. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Dobson. Any questions from the
committee? Hearing none, we have a motion for a favorable report from
Senator Tucker. All those in favor, please say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed like so. Motion carried. Thank you,
Representative Dobson. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Next, House Bill 1154, Moore County Schools Property
Transfer, Senator Tillman, good morning. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's good to see you at your age standing up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, Committee Members, this is a simple transfer of
this school building to the town of Taylortown and it does need approval
from the General Assembly. Nobody that I know in Moore County's opposed
to this thing, so I ask your ??. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? Questions, we have
a motion for a favorable report from Senator Cook. All those in favor,
please say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Oppose, like
said. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion carried. Third
bill, House Bill 1155, Pinehurst Annexation. Senator Tillman, you want
to run that one too since you're on your feet today? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would ask staff to explain this bill just a
little bit for me if they would. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And you have an
amendment, would you like to do that now? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do have an
amendment, and they can explain the amendment. It's technical in nature.
Well, it just changes the date. June is past and it makes it a July
date. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Is staff going to? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator. OK. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Gregory with the
research division. What House 1155 does is it is a satellite annexation
of about 65 lots and a cotswald subdivision near Pinehurst. It is a
satellite annexation. The city had voted in favor of pursuing the
legislation in addition to the annexation it is going to allow an
assessment on the 65 lots to improve the roads. I talked to the city
manager of Pinehurst and he said when it rains a lot the roads flood and
it takes a long time to drain and so the deal between the city and the
developer who still owns I think 14-65 lots, everyone kind of coalesced
an arrangement where the city would take 1/3 of the cost and then 2/3 of
the cost of redoing the roads so they don't flood is going to be
assessed to the property owner, so 1155 does two things. It does the
satellite annexation and it sets up the assessment regime and then as
the Senator said, the amendment, the first edition of the bill just has
a June effective date which was missed and this makes it a July 31st
effective date. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Senator Hartsell. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If I'm not mistaken, property in a
municipality can be assessed for roads now anyway, can it not? I mean,
I'm just, how does this differ from that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think
that's on a contiguous annexation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Im just, if it's in
the municipality, you can assess, I'm just.</p>

<p id="05:00">
does this differ an any way from the-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It does differ. They did not, I'm not sure what aspect of the general
law they could not meet but the regime that they wanted, this 2/3, 1/3
and assessments that were what was worked out couldn't be done on the
general law so you're right. The general law allows this but this
particular plan would not fit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, and I assume besides the developer the other land owners have
essentially agreed to this as well. Is that accurate or no?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, nearly all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay before we get any deeper into this there has been an amendment
brought forward. Let's vote on the amendment and then we'll talk some
more, okay? There has been an amendment brought forward so all of those,
any discussion on the amendment? If not, those in favor of the amendment
will please say aye. Opposed no. The amendment carries and now we will
talk about the bill as amendment and finish discussion. Senator Hise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I know over the past couple of years we've done a lot of discussions
here on annexations and I believe the conclusion was that the property
owners had the right 7 by petition to hold a vote and the majority of
the property owners living in the development would then have to agree
to be annexed by the municipality. Is that protection's still in place
for the residents who actually live in this annexed area?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, do you have or staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. They've had public hearings and they've had the votes and the
manager of the citizens that I have talked are, they believe they've got
to have this bill to do this but they've met all of those requirements
of the public hearing and, as far as I know, the votes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Tucker. Questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, would you consider this an involuntary annexation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir, I wouldn't. Would you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. If not all of the homeowners and folks involved are not on
board with it it would be involuntary to the city of Pinehurst with the
annex-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, Senator Tucker, you've got a great observation there so if two out
of a hundred don't want it don't you think we ought to go ahead with it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are those the numbers? You said nearly all. Nearly isn't defined, you
don't know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't know, but the great majority. I've been told great majority. I
didn't go to the public hearings but if you and I would pray that it
never rains in Pinehurst we wouldn't need to do this. It only happens
when the streets flood and it rains and they want the storm water fix.
That's all they want, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion between you two?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not today, tonight.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, just the fact that the-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Lerner do you have anything to bring to light on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you want me to answer the-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The city provided this document from the developer and so in the last
vote, according to the development entity, there was 31 yes, 9 no, 11 no
responses.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Thank you. Senator Tucker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does that answer your question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir, it's involuntary. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Okay. Any further discussion or debate, Senator Stein?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Tillman, is this one of those donut
holes or do those exist in Pinehurst? I remember a couple years ago
there was a story about a number of donut holes in Pinehurst.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You may call this a donut hole. It doesn't resemble a donut but it is
non-contiguous so we do need this action today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do those still exist or have those all been incorporated into Pinehurst?
Do you know?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand there still a couple more. I know we fixed Foxfire just two
weeks ago and this would take care of one more and I just try to take
them one at a time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion? Okay, hearing none, the question before the
committee is House Bill 1155 as amended. All of those in favor please
say aye. Opposed no. Motion carried. Thank you, Senator Tillman. Our
next is House Bill 1212, Senator Gunn. While that is coming forward I
will recognize our senate pages for this morning. They are Carly
Robertson from Cary, Weston Davis, or is that Davis Weston? From
Raleigh.</p>

?? We need to work on our penmanship some, pages. Mike ?? ?? from
Yadkinville, Sophie Hennings, East Bend, Autumn Fulton, Pleasant Garden,
and Ann Ray, from Raleigh. Welcome. Hope you all enjoy the morning.
Senator Gunn, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Once every 60 years or so, cities should revise
and consolidate their charter, whether they need to or not. Appreciate
your support, and be glad to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, would you like a little better explanation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would, I'd like to know how they change their charter, if you don't
mind, Senator Gunn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We got lines floating around everywhere, we got all kinds of issues.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Chair is in agreement with Senator Apodaca. Senator Gunn, would you
care to expand?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If nothing else, we've got different lines, and we need to get those
righted. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate? Senator Hartsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does it establish Home Rule in Burlington?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You want to say that again?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the charter establish Home Rule for the city of Burlington?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could you give me a definition? I'm sure it does. It's 112 pages. Would
you like Representative Ross to answer that question? He is the--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm just--it's legit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ross, would you like to answer that question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We can't hear you. Hit your mike please, Representative Ross.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let's let staff answer that, if they could.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can staff help us?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. I do know that the revision of this charter does not add
anything to the existing authority for the town of Burlington.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Question is answered. Senator Blue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In a serious vein--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Gunn, does this charter rewrite--I take it the city council
submitted it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, and it actually for them is time sensitive. They submitted it,
passed it unanimously, it passed the House unanimously.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does it in any manner change the way the city council is elected or
anything of that nature? Any elections-law changes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. We have a motion for a favorable report from Senator
McKissick. Any further discussion, further debate? If not, the question
before us is a favorable report for House Bill 1212, committee, it is a
committee substitute, rather it is not--it is not a committee
substitute, I apologize. All those in favor of the motion please say
aye, opposed no, motion carried. The next bill is being presented by
Senator Cook, Senate Bill 788, Town of Duck/Eminent Domain.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Cook. Welcome, Senator Cook.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Chairman. Currently the law allows certain coastal counties
and municipalities eminent domain power as needed to address beach
erosion control or flood and hurricane protection. These governmental
entities can acquire needed property through condemnation proceedings
known as quick take. This local bill simply adds the town of Duck to the
long list of counties and municipalities that use quick-take
condemnation to protect their beach. This bill has the support of the
town council and community. I know of no opposition.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Questions by the committee. We have a motion for a favorable report from
Senator Brock. All those in favor of the motion please say aye, opposed
no, motion carried. Thank you, Senator Cook.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, members, thank you, Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I believe our final bill this morning is going to be House Bill
1145, Insurance Registration Required for Mopeds. Senator Apodaca.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I believe we have a PCS to approve. We took the
controversial parts out of this bill, ?? and ?? down to the state health
plan.

He's General Rabin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
General Rabin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I won't say what you didn't call me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I won't say it in public either. This is our moped bill. Some of us that
were here, what, five or six years ago remember this bill. It came forth
and had some spirited debate on the floor. It was an incredible
experience. I think it's one of the only bills I've ever seen lose on
the floor of the Senate and Senator Rand and I were both happy because
we were sponsoring it. So anyway, we're resurrecting this bill. Things
haven't gotten any better in the last five or six years with mopeds on
our roads and as we navigate our roads and try to avoid hitting these
mopeds I think it's fair for them to have a little skin in the game when
it comes to insurance. And what this bill does is basically two things.
Number one, they have to register the moped and number two, they must
have financial responsibility. That's what it does and I ask for your
support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Apodaca, ladies and gentlemen we, Senator Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't think we need to worry about moped
riders having skin in the game when they have accidents.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, that wasn't nice now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My question is, I don't have so much a problem with the registration as
I have concerns about the insurance. Have we heard from the insurance
industry what a policy like this would cost a moped person.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, thank you so much for asking that. Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes indeed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have someone from the Rate Bureau and then we have someone from the
Department of Insurance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, if you gentlemen would please get to a microphone and
identify yourselves. Front and center, that would a nice place. Yeah,
thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm Tim Lucas with the North Carolina Rate Bureau.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Tim, it might be easier if you use that one. Yeah, so you don't get a
crick in your neck.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm Tim Lucas with the North Carolina Rate Bureau. Currently mopeds do
come under the Rate Bureau's jurisdiction. The current price for a moped
basic limit policy runs about $65.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir, $55 was our follow-up. Senator Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Basic limit liability.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that annually?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further questions from the committee? Senator Michael Walters.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I'd like to ask the gentleman, that $65 rate, what kind of
liability coverage do you have?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is 30-60-25 with liability only with uninsured motorist as required
by statute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And Senator Curtis, question? You're good with that now? Thank you. We
have one members, Mr. John Hill from the North Carolina Motorcycle
Dealership Association who would like to address the group. Mr. Hill.
Oh, excuse me, before we have public comment we'll finish with the
members. Senator McKissick. Excuse me, Mr. Hill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, and this is a question for the gentleman from the Department of
Insurance. The policies that are issued now, would they be for those
that are licensed drivers? Because you don't have to be a licensed
driver to operate a moped however with this new bill that we're about to
move forward with there would be a lot of drivers that are not licensed
drivers that would not have any driving history that would now require
insurance and do we have any projections as to what that would cost for
unlicensed drivers without a history because I'm assuming now the
coverage available might be for those with a drivers' license. If I'm
mistaken I certainly stand to be corrected.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The insurance today is not for licensed operators and you're not
required to have a drivers' license to operate a moped and liability
coverage is not required on a moped. So this would require the license.
Also this would take mopeds out from under the Rate Bureau's
jurisdiction and each individual company would price their own liability
coverage.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Quick follow-up, if I could, on that issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just, do we have, and maybe, Mr. Chair, you were about to hear from
somebody from the industry but do we have any industry reps that could
talk about what, based upon I guess their actuarial projections and
other data. I mean what this insurance</p>

<p id="20:00">
I've, I've heard data from people that suggested it would be
substantially higher than sixty five dollars.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Who, who was gonna answer that? Yes, please. Senator Apodaca.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, you are right, and I wanna clarify that. I think
when, I think you were quoting a rate based on a clean record license
driver with a moped, is that correct sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's my understanding, Senator McKissick, when we move to probably the
likely person that will be driving or operating a moped is probably in
the neighborhood of three hundred to four hundred dollars a year. Miss
Williams, or someone from the industry can probably speak better to
that, but I do wanna put that out there and be honest about Senator
Stein. Rose, are you here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Please identify yourself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mister Chairman. Rose Vaughn Williams, I'm
legislative counsel to the Department of Insurance. And what we did,
Senator McKissick was just shocked like we were a person went through an
agent and it does depend, just like all drivers, on your record, so we
priced it for a licensed, person with a license and no record, and it
was, I think, ninety two dollars a year. A person unlicensed and no
record, it was a hundred dollars a year approximately, for this minimum
coverage. And then, if you had a, had a license, and you had it fifteen
years, but it had been suspended, with the same area of coverage the
price for an annual policy was three hundred and eighty dollars,
approximately. So it's like with your automobile, depends on your record
and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Beautiful.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I want to point out, follow up  Rose, here. I wanna ask you this,
because there are people who lose their licenses for everything from
driving while impaired to other things. What kind of cost would it be
for that kind of driver, if you know?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, and yes sir, if I may mister chairman and Senator McKissick,
because I think that last price would cover it. That was for a person
with twelve STIP points. So that was a pretty hefty record, I guess.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Rose. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the Committee, Senator Wade.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, do you know if, since it's not required now for people
to have insurance, if we required it, the pool would be much larger I
would imagine, so that causes the price to drop, because there would be
more people in the pool?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade, it possibly could, but I doubt it with the liability
exposure there, I would think it would probably stay in that
neighborhood. If I had to guess, I am definitely not an actuary but that
would be my guess.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In the back of the room, sir, would you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The bill not allow cession to the reinsurance facility for these mopeds.
So the pool would not get any bigger.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator Hise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My question on this bill has to do with the registration, and this may
be for DMV, how confident are we that registration of the mopeds will
allow us to eliminate out the motorcycles that are, as we say,
masquerading as mopeds? Will part of that registration identify that
this moped's engine is less than fifty CCs, which is kind of what the
current law requires? And I know we've got a lot of them out there that
will go fifty, sixty miles an hour in that, and so that may be a DMV
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do we have someone?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. And will you identify yourself please sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Tim [??] of North Carolina Division of Motor Vehicles.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As part of the registration process, they would be, a lot of them would
be required, if their VIN did not perform, they would be required to go
through an inspection by license and theft bureau inspector, to certify
they have a federal safety decal on them, and to ensure that they do fit
the moped definition.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Senator Hyde.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If they do not, they can then be registered as motorcycles? Is that
what.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. Just as they are currently allowed to be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator Rabon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a quick question, it seems like the issue really is should we have
insurance or not, and we're off on a tangent of cost, is that about
right, Senator Apodaca?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well not only cost, Senator, that and a registration issue. Yeah. Yeah,
thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, we've heard from the committee, we do have one number, Senator
McKissick, you're back.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, and this was just to follow up on the registration, and I don't
know if this gentleman who was at the podium can answer this or not. The
thing I was curious about, because this provision in this bill we're
talking about, this is applicable only for mopeds designed and
manufactured for highway use, those are the only ones that can be
registered. Of the fleet of mopeds that are</p>

<p id="25:00">
and out there today. What it would be, I mean, they're not being
grandfathered in necessarily, I mean, are the ones that we currently see
sold by vendors designed for highway use, and how many of them actually
do have a serial number that is traceable, that's verifiable? Because I
would assume that many of them, being manufactured abroad, and that this
has not been required in the past, and is not commonly needed for any
purpose, that they might have a date and a stamp as to when and where it
was manufactured, but not necessarily the equivalent of a Vehicle
Identification Number or serial number.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All of them that I've come in contact with do have some form of
identification number on it, but they may not and do not always conform
to the 17-digit standard set forth by federal code. So that is why we
require a lot of times, when it doesn't conform to the 17-digit code, to
verify that VIN number on the vehicle, to check it for theft and to
check it to be sure it conforms to federal safety standards, and that it
is in fact a moped and is not a pocket bike or some other form of
motorized vehicle that do not adhere to the statute that defines a
moped.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Quick follow up if I could, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So are you confident that the vast majority of mopeds that have already
been manufactured and bought by individuals would be able to be
registered in North Carolina as they are today, either by having a VIN
or through some type of inspection program that would be required?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If it is truly a moped as set forth by statute, it would be able to be
registered with the Division. If it's not a moped, if it falls outside
of that definition, then it would have to be titled and licensed and it
would require a licensed driver.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? sir. Members, we have one member of the audience who would like to
speak, and as I recognized a few moments ago, Mr. John Hill of North
Carolina Motorcycle Dealers Association. Mr. Hill, you have the floor.
Welcome to the Senate. Is that mike on, Sergeant at Arms?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. There we go.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are we on now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm here mainly as a small business owner and part of the Motorcycle
Dealers Association. I can attest to you there are plenty of motorcycles
being operated as mopeds illegally. I see it every day in my business.
It irritates me. I'll see a newspaper story where they claim a moped was
involved in an accident and it wasn't, it was some Internet-bought
product that was running without a tag, and they were sliding under the
radar as a moped, which it was not. And therefore the reports you're
seeing are probably falsified to a large degree. People can go online,
$600, bring 150cc scooter into their possession, begin operating it with
no inspection, no registration, nothing. You're talking about they're
being used for drugs and illicit activity? Those are capable of doing
it. A true moped is limited to 30 miles an hour on a flat level ground.
I live in Greensboro, where ??. We have a lot of university students
can't afford the parking permits that's required to park on campus, they
park these up near their dorm. The biggest thing is the business owner.
We have to order in advance. I have a considerable amount of inventory
now that it really will not sell if you put this insurance requirement.
We are all for the registration requirement. It will eliminate these
illicit and illegally operated vehicles. I live out in a rural area; I
hear these things coming into town every morning, a true moped. I know
because it takes forever for them to get down the road, but I know
they're coming into town, they're going to work, there will bring their
family income that night. And you're talking about insurance that is,
it's--I have a friend in Wilson is a moped dealer. The average income of
his client is $662 a month. That's how they're on that moped. They can't
afford anything else. Nor is there a bus, they can't afford a car. And
you're going to hit a dealer as myself. I'm going to have a $500 penalty
per vehicle that I refuse that they ship. I have a manufacturer trying
to ship me 25 right now. And I've been begging him to hold off 'til we
see what happens here. I've got an inventory of over 45 right now that
will not sell, and I'm not going to sell you one knowing in a year from
now you're going to have to pay an exorbitant amount for insurance that
you're not going to be able to get, number one, because you don't have a
driver's license. I can't find an agent that will sell you liability
insurance if you don't have a driver's license. Friends in Virginia went
through the same thing, they put it to a study committee, they did pass
a registration requirement, but they realized the insurance was not
going to work. So they pulled that from it. As the Dealers Association,
we were excited when we got this through the House, but when it got back
before it got the insurance added, it's created a lot of restriction for
us as businessmen. I brought my wife today and she can tell you we have
employees who are talking losing employment</p>

If this thing goes through they will not sell and I'm not going to sell
you one knowing that you're going to be in a hardship a year from now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. OK,
Senator Stine, one last comment or question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] A
question for Senator Apodaca. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca do you
yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] So we have the section A which is a study
committee which is supposed to look at the number of mopeds involved in
accidents, the types of injuries, the causes for the accidents, whether
the moped was the cause or the automobile driver was the cause, does it
not make sense, wouldn't it be prudent to let that issue be studied and
come back and make a recommendation to us on the insurance piece? I mean
it sounds like everyone thinks the registration's a good idea but we
might be getting ahead of ourselves on the insurance piece. We haven't
even completed the study yet. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stine, I
appreciate that, but it seems like every 2 or 3 days there's something
in the paper about a moped accident and many times it's not their fault,
many times it is their fault, many times these are used by folks who
have lost their license and a lot of them don't have jobs. I don't want
to broad base characterization of who operates a moped and who doesn't,
but if they're in there operating amongst us and cars and such I just
feel like they should have some financial responsibility also, and I'm
thinking of one of our former colleagues who voted against this and his
son was hit by a drunk on a moped and the poor guy was hurt very badly
and it pretty well messed this guy's truck up, his son's truck, and he
had to pay for it all because it was not financial responsibility and
they were even trying to get some medical costs for the moped driver and
that person said they would've changed their votes if they had known
that. I mean, it's just a problem and, you know, it's not one of my
major issues. If it doesn't pass I'm not going to be upset, but I just
think it makes common sense for them to have some financial
responsibility. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK, thank you Senator Apodaca. Members
of the committee, the question before the committee and the motion
before the committee by. Do we have a motion? By Senator Rabin, for a
favorable report to the PCS of House Bill 1145, unfavorable to the
original. All those in favor of that motion please say aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed no. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion carries. Thank you. Thank you, Sergeant at
Arms, thank you, pages, this meeting is adjourned.</p>
