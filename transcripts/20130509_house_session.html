[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, this is an act to provide
a procedure to remove an area from my county’s service district. There
was a question in finance yesterday, as to why this was a statewide bill
rather than a local bill. It’s because it has to do with, we can’t have
local bills for the environment or public health, so that’s why it
became a statewide bill. It says that they may, this does not require
counties to do that, but I have an area in my county that has not been
provided service for many, many years and they wish become taken out of
a service district that they were put in and the county wants to take
them out of that service district, this allows them to do so. Please
support this bill. Thank you.

The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank you ladies and gentlemen of the House.
House Bill 609 that you have before you had quite extensive debate
yesterday. I would just like to reiterate that it does seek to address a
very serious healthcare issue. Some current insurance plans cover chemo
IVs, a medical benefit differently than they do oral chemotherapies. As
a result, the out of pocket costs for patients are sometimes too high
and they don’t get the treatment that’s prescribed for them from their
doctor. What this bill seeks to do, again, is to say, if a plan covers
cancer and provides treatment for cancer, doesn’t require them to
provide treatment if they don’t currently do it, but if they do it, it
says the method of that treatment will be treated the same, the costs
for it, the out of pocket costs to the individual will be the same. I
would respectfully ask for your support of this bill today. Thank you,
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative  Stevens, please state your purpose. .
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stevens moves to amend the bill on page 2, lines 4 and 5
by inserting the following between the lines.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This amendment, while it’s still a mandate for
this coverage to be offered at a better rate, dictates how much insurers
can charge for that chemotherapy, but it is better and doesn’t give the
drug away for free. It would allow a charge of up to $300 per filled
prescription and just like IV chemotherapy where there’s a charge for
each visit to the doctor, there’s a charge for each prescription. It
would limit that charge to no more than $300 per prescriptions. Insurers
can still charge less and they will for richer plans. Under federal law,
the $300 would apply to out of pocket maximums along with any medical
expenses including doctors and visits, so once you reach your out of
pocket maximum, which you do very quickly in cancer treatment, then
there would be no additional charges. Other states, have it in fact, as
they’ve looked at this cancer fair treatment, adopted this kind of
procedure. The whole problem in determining the price under the bill as
it exists is the second paragraph of the bill in which it says that the
charge cannot be greater than the co-pays co-insurance co-deductibles.
Well, how in the world is anybody going to determine that. So I’m going
to allow other people to speak on the amendment who will be more
knowledgeable than that, but I do ask you to support this amendment and
with this amendment, I feel I can support the bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ensco, please state your purpose...</p>

<p id="020:00">
The lady's recognized the right to abate the amendment.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you mister speaker. Part of the problem in explaining this is that
the cost of health care is very complex. Insurance companies negotiate
with hospitals for every drug, every procedure, everything, every
product, with every hospital and it's all different. Depending on the
negotiations. So if we say that the orally administered anti-cancer
drugs shall not be having more out of pocket expense then it applies to
the intravenously administered injected drug in the hospital. You can go
to one hospital and find that the cost is $3486.00. So I'm not sure how
the insurance company would know to pay that amount. At another hospital
it would be $15,000.00, that's for one visit with a drug for one cost.
If you go to an independent physicians office it's maybe $50.00 after
all the deductions are taken off. You cannot compare the cost so there's
not any real way to implement this without having the cost be zero.
Which means that there will be no reimbursement and the insurance
companies will not absorb all this cost, they would not do it. It would
be transferred to other users or they would reduce the coverage in some
other way. In other states where this has passed that's exactly what's
happened to the insurance companies because they have not been able to
figure or tell the pharmacist to charge because it's different
everywhere they go to get treatment. They don't know how much to tell
the pharmacist so they charge zero. Which is really good for the
patient, I like the bill actually because it's fine for the patient, it
allows a very expensive drug to be administered at no charge. But that
charge will not be absorbed by the insurance companies. They will
transfer that cost to other users by reducing the services that they
cover or by increasing their premiums. This amendment is a fair
amendment, it doesn't affect the costs that a hospital would charge. The
hospitals will still charge whatever they negotiated, it might be
$3000.00, $15,000.00 or $50. But it would even out the cost of what a
patient would pay for in-home services. It's a fair amendment and it
makes the bill a better bill. I hope you'll vote for it.
[Speaker change]
Representative Murray please state your purpose.
[Speaker change]
To abate the amendment.
[Speaker change]
The gentlemen recognizes to abate the amendment.
[Speaker change]
Thank you Mister Speaker. I would ask the members to support the
amendment. I think it's a reasonable alternative and option for, to
address this issue in a reasonable way. Currently on the state health
plan drugs along these lines the co-pay is actually $100.00. But you're
spreading that around to every state employee and retiree. This will
help address the cost situation for smaller group plans. And the small
group plan or the plan for what we call &quot;young invincibles&quot;,
people that aren't expecting to get cancer or specialty drugs that  the
average plan is around 25% percent cost sharing. Gleevec, one of the
drugs this would impact, anti-cancer chemotherapy that's taken orally
costs about $4000.00 a month. So that means patients on a young
invincible plan would pay $1000.00 a month, this would help address this
situation to help make it a little more affordable for that small number
of patients that this bill actually impacts. I would ask that you
support this amendment and I would be glad to answer any questions.
[Speaker change]
Representative Eshoo (??) please state your purpose.
[Speaker change]
I would like to ask Representative Murray a question.
[Speaker change]
Representative Murray, does the gentleman yield?
[Speaker change]
I yield
[Speaker change]
The gentleman yields
[Speaker change]
Representative Murray, I see that this amendment actually reads per
prescription, per filled prescription, so couldn't that patient actually
have to fill that prescription three or four times a month? Wouldn't it
be charged three times four or multiplied by however many times they
filled it?
[Speaker change]
You are correct. So this would be per fill, per prescription fill. So,
if they get a thirty day supply then they will pay $300.00 for that
thirty day supply. I would read this that if they got a ninety day
supply they would pay up to $300.00 for that ninety day supply. That's
how I read the amendment. It's per prescription fill.</p>

bill.  And so, I think this is a reasonable approach.  I think the other
thing we want to keep in mind, under the affordable care act, on January
1 of 2014, the maximum out of pocket cost for any patient is $6350.
6350 dollars.  The average cancer was there about a ??.  This just helps
address the situation where there is an appropriate cost share.  If you
have the other states that have passed similar legislation, this $300
per month, per prescription copay is within the range.  Some states have
done $500.  Some states have done 250, 300, 400.  In my opinion, this is
a reasonable approach to this legislation, and I'd ask members to
support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fulghum, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To address the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  The amendment, I'm sorry.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  If I
were prescribing these medications, the way I would approach this would
be to do more than a 30 day supply.  Sometimes insurance companies don't
like that.  But if it's in the therapeutic regimen, that would be what
I'd do as a physician, and it would be legal.  And, as Representative
Murray indicated, it would be $300 per prescription for however long
that prescription was written for.  The other thing is, it would be
unusual to prescribe more than one oral anti-cancer drug is a time.  You
get sick enough with one of them.  So having two or three would be
highly unusual, and I don't think would be applicable in many, many
cases.  I support this ammendment.  Thank you.

Representative Lewis, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen of the house.
I rise to oppose the ammendment that you have before you, and I'd like
to try and explain why.  Yesterday, during the time that this house so
graciously allowed this bill to be discussed, tried to define that what
this bill does is let the private insurers go out to negotiate whatever
contracts they have with whatever providers they want to do, put all
that together and go out and sell these health insurance policies.  It's
the free market.  Not all the policies are the same.  Some of them have
a real high deductible, some of them have a real low.  Some of them
charge per trip, some of them have a maximum that they charge.  But
they're all different.  The reason that I have concern with this
ammendment is that this would be establishing, again to my knowledge
based on the inquiry to our staff for the first time, this would be
establishing a cap or cost in statute.  This is in fact an infringement
on the way the free market system works now.  This bill is really, and I
know this is a bad word to use on this floor, but I'm not smart enough
at the moment to think of the word to not use the word simple, so I'm
going to commit that sin.  What this bill says is that if you provide
coverage for cancer, and if that coverage includes some kind of drug
therapy, some kind of treatment, that the cost for that treatment to the
individual who's having to pay it out of their pocket is the same.  It
doesn't try to tell the insurance companies with that should be. That's
what this ammendment does.  It tries to tell them what it should be.  I
agree with what the lady from Orange was saying earlier today.  All of
these things take part by much smarter people than me who go out and
negotiate these contracts and they are all different.  So a one size
fits all amendment is not a free market solution, and is not the intent
of the bill.  So I again would respectfully ask you to vote against this
ammendment.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

<p id="030:00">
Looking for a reason to vote for this bill.  This amendment would do
that.  I've talked with representatives of a major health provider
inthisstate for whom this will affect two.  The small business market
and the individual market.  And they've stated that, with this
amendment, there will be no premium increases, and are getting their
actuaries to sharpen their pencil, and they've come up with the decision
by now, I don't know that there still hoping they can extend this to
these types of drugs for all serious chronic illnesses like this with
fists or Kobe.  And I hope they can do that, I really do.  Is the thing
that bothers me the most, frankly, about legislative bodies like ours,
and this is both democrats and republicans, is that we do seem to be
very, very generous with other people's money.  Now, you might think I'm
the biggest conflict in the world.  If the check my tax returns, it find
out I'm a lot more generous with my personal money than I am with the
money that idea to have some say in with up here.  But it does a matter
for talking about taxpayers' money, ratepayers' money or premium payers
money, where very very comfortable doing things that raise those costs
on other people.  Again, the major provider has told us that if we pass
this amendment, we will not be raising premiums on small businesses and
individuals.  That means we will not exacerbate the problem that I
mention yesterday of small business owners continuing to drop their
Health Insurance.  As can affect a lot more than 100 people if that
trend continues.  So I beg and plead with you, let's not charge the
premium payers of North Carolina more and say, well that's just one more
thing they're gonna have to pony up on.  With so for this amendment, and
then pass a bill.  Thank you.

naively.  I did a lot of research on this issue.  So, here we are.  If
this amendment doesn't pass, the Koop a hell of the insurance companies
because they cannot establish a uniform Koop eight, they would be forced
to have a cocaine zero.  That's what's happened in other states with.
When they had this kind bill passed with no limit, with no cap, they
have a cocaine zero.  So now, we have, if we take our pill at home for
one month with a zero ko pay, or we go to the hospital and have a $3000
charge or a $5000 charge or a 15,000 charge for one month, is that fair?
 Shouldn't that be zero to?  You want to have a fair tradeoff between
home treatment and infusion treatment, hospital.  SoThis is a fair
amendment, and it does allow the insurance companies to implement this
without any increase in premiums.  I hope you'll both to the amendment.

To debate the bill Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, my fellow house members this bill is before you at the
request of that the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, we
are very proud to have this institution in my county and this bill is
supported by the entire local delegation. The University of North
Carolina School of the Arts open way back in 1965 and that was unique
and still is today and having a high school in addition to the
undergraduate and graduate programs. The high school students are
required to take the normal high school credits but they choose to come
to the school because they have an extraordinary talent in an area of
the arts such as music, drama or dance. They spent several hours a day
in developing their talent and the school is known for making sure their
students get constant performance experience at a high level of quality.
This is job training at an early age. From the opening of the school in
1965 until 2000 the instate high school students did pay some charge or
fees or room and board charges but in 2001 the General Assembly decided
to appropriate the full cost for instate high school students and make
it completely free but in recent years with the economic downturn and
the budget problems in the state the appropriations for the instate
students have not covered the full cost causing a short fall in the
funding. The school has covered the shortfall by using funds for the
undergraduate and graduate programs. The school average is about 200
instate students and between 50 and 70 out of state students which pay
full cost tuition which is in the ___[02:00] of around $20,000. In the
most recent year the total available cost for the instate students was
2.4 million but they only received 1.98 million in appropriations
creating a shortfall of around $450,000. And they use funds from the
undergraduate and graduate program to fill that gap. This bill, if we
pass this today will allow the school to re-instate a certain level of
fees to cover that gap. The level of fees will be determined by the
University Board of Governors and the Trustees of the School of the
Arts. If these will not be implemented into the fall of the 2014 school
year to give time for notification, I have ensured by the school that
this change has been fully disclosed and discussed with the current
student body and that they understand an onboard with the new cost.
Also, I had been assured that if these new fees do cause a problem for
any students that financial aid or scholarships will be available. The
bill passes unanimously both out of education and finance committees and
I can amend this bill for your approval.

Thirty. A bill to entitled and enact to establish standards of care for
large commercial dog breeding facilities and to provide law enforcement
with tools to ensure that dogs at those facilities are treated humanely.
General Assembly of North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Saine please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak
to the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. And as one of my
colleagues just passed by singing, Who Let The Dogs Out, we may know the
answer. No, as we begin the debate on this bill I would be remiss if I
did not thank my fellow sponsors for tolerating my repeated urgings over
the past seven months that we remain focused on what the goal of this
bill is. That we exempt hunting and sporting dogs and that we work with
all concerned to find a compromise legislation that seeks to do good and
not harm. Second I want to say a big thank you to all the 28 cosponsors
of this bill. We achieved this support not through individual lobbying
or strong-arming. But because you all believe this is a good bill that
addresses the issue and does not infringe on agribusiness or personal
freedoms. And I want to thank First Lady Ann McCrory who has worked
tirelessly with us on this issue and has been so supportive in our
efforts. I’m glad she is here today to watch the debate and I am hopeful
she will get to witness passage of the measure with your support. You’ll
see the letter on your desk that she sent yesterday to members of
Judiciary B where we passed this bill out without any opposition. It was
unanimous. Representative Carney yesterday made this point. And I’m
paraphrasing that good legislation comes through hard work, compromise
and buy-in from your colleagues. We have worked hard to do that with
House bill 930. As some of you may know or may not know I’m a volunteer
firefighter with East Lincoln fire department back in my district. In
the fire service we get to witness a lot of good things and all too
often a lot bad. As it should happen our fire department along with
several others assisted law enforcement and animal control in a
multi-day puppy mill bust in Lincoln county several years ago. As I’ve
said I’ve witnessed some pretty nasty things. But after hearing from my
fellow firefighters about the dreadful and putrid conditions at this
bust I decided I could better serve in a support capacity in our
station. In other words I did not have the stomach to witness the
conditions first hand. Though I did not get to see it firsthand I did
see many of the pictures and accounts of the bust afterwards in our
briefings. It even included dogs in freezers. This is part of the story
of how we got to this legislation. As well my family and I have two
basset hounds Chopper and Bailey. Bailey, Bailey’s a rescue dog we got
for Georgia. And although he won’t, he was once in bad shape with a lot
of care and socialization he has become a great dog. Not all are that
lucky. I think most of you through our interactions believe me to be a
very reasonable legislator. I am not an animal rights activist. I do not
elevate my dogs or any animals to anywhere near human status. They are
our pets. But they do not deserve to be mistreated. This bill simply
provides for more humane treatment of dogs in commercial breeding
facilities. And affords law enforcement with added tools to intervene in
situations where they are current, where they currently cannot under our
animal, animal cruelty statutes. By the time they can many of the
animals are too injured or ill to be rehabilitated. As many of you know
as Judiciary B I often claim I’m not a lawyer and defer to my friends in
the legal community. As such Representative Ramsey and I contacted
several district attorneys as to what this bill may mean for them. And
I’m quoting, as it stands now I have to first prove that the defendant
committed the acts in question. And then prove that the acts in question
are cruel as defined by 14-360. With H930 we would simply have to prove
that the defendant committed the acts that violated one or more of the
enumerated requirements. I think all of the enumerated requirements in
subsection A and the requirements in subsection B would cover any
hypothetical case of cruelty I can think of. I definitely think H930
would be helpful in prosecuting these kinds of cruelty cases. Some of
you may have received emails opposing the bill. Much of this opposition
has coming from the sporting community. I understand their position. But
quite frankly many have received bad information that is not warranted
with this legislation. I’m a gun guy. I appreciate hunting and sporting
and I’m a bird hunter. Perhaps bills in the past might have sparked fear
in the sporting community. But this is much different and it’s
intentional. This bill plainly exempts hunting, sporting, film/g and
show dogs. And I</p>

Will not support attempts to remove that provision. And I hope you'll
bear with me because my legislative assistant helped me write this
speech and it says my incredible legislative assistant, which many of
you know. Zane Stillwell has worked diligently on this bill. He is an
avid hunter, sportsman and gun rights advocate. His family has been
involved in the dog hunting community for decades
and we have kept these concerns in mind from day one. And let me be real
honest with you. He told me I was crazy and I should never touch the
thing. But through this process and through learning, being right there
at my side and assisting, he is more than supportive of the bill.
Historically, the agriculture and livestock communities have opposed
legislation to address similar issues. For the first time that I know
of, these interests are not taking a position. This further speaks to
the compromise and narrow focus of this bill. It simply addresses
commercial breeders who mistreat the animals and strengthens law
enforcement's ability to act. That's it. I believe Representative
Glazier has an amendment. We have had a good process and I yield.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
To send forth an amendment.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
The gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk will
read.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Representative Glazier moves to amend the bill on page 2 lines 23 and 24
by rewriting the lines to read.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you very much Mister Speaker and thank you Representative Saine. I
think the Representative has done, and the group who has put this
together have done a great job of finding a moderate bill that will move
us forward and protect animals but still allow the many good operations
that exist in this state to continue to do their job. And the goal of
the bill of course is to make sure that it exempts hunting and sporting
dogs and facilities that are training and breeding them from having
coverage under it.
The problem of course in doing things quickly at the end is that we did
an amendment in ?? that I think we came to regret as soon as it was done
which created on lines 23 and 24 an exemption that could be read so
ambiguously, it could go one of two ways. It could either be a loophole
that allows anybody, even an operation that's a puppy mill operation
that has one dog for sport, to be exempted from the whole bill. Or it
could go the other way. Which is, it could be read by judges to say that
unless you had everything as your dominant purpose, you aren't under the
bill.
So to be specific and try to get it exactly the purpose, we worked with
staff and Representative Saine. And the amendment in front of you is, I
think, exactly what we should have done in the first place and didn't
do. And it says, this act essentially does not apply to kennels or
boarding facilities where the majority of dogs are being bred or trained
primarily for hunting, sporting, field trials or show, being maintained
for hunting, sporting, field trials or show, or being kept primarily for
the purposes other than for sale as offspring as pets. That's to make it
as specific as it can be to exempt out all the things that we're trying
to exempt out so it couldn't be read any differently by any judge. I
think all sides are in agreement with the amendment but Mister Speaker,
I just asked Representative Saine his position on the amendment just to
be certain. Thank you.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Representative Saine, please state your purpose.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Yes. Thank you Mister Speaker and thank you Representative Glazier for
the amendment. I do support the amendment and so do our sponsors.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Further discussion? Further debate on the amendment? If not, the
question before the House is the passage of the amendment set forth by
Representative Glazier to the House committee substitute for House Bill
930. All in favor will vote aye, all opposed will vote no. The clerk
will open the vote. All members wishing to record please do so. The
clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. 115 having voted
affirmative, 1 in the negative. The amendment passes. We are now back on
the bill. Representative Avila, please state your purpose.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
To debate the bill.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill as amended.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you Mister Speaker. I have a great deal of respect for animal
lovers. I've lived in close proximity to cats and dogs most of my life.
But I also have a great deal of respect for the AKC and as an
organization that lives and breathes dogs and care and concern for them,
they have issues with this bill. This is another one of those cases
where we pass a law to take care of a law that we don't enforce. The
raid that Representative Saine mentioned was fully possible days, weeks,
possibly even months  before the day that it happened. But for various
reasons whatever they might be, it was  not taken action upon. So what
we need to do is to remove any definitions of breeders as people who are
owners of dogs. And when cruelty is reported whether it's a dog, a goat,
or a horse that we've heard complaints about, then I think we need to
follow the law and go rescue the animals and take care of them. As this
law is written</p>

It exempts all the dogs under 10 in the possession of owners. I cannot
support it. I know the intentions are good but we also do legislate a
lot of unintended. consequences down here, and I think with animal
cruelty laws that we have with some teeth to them would be sufficient
and we wouldn't be opening up a potential can of worms with this
approach to this situation. Thank you
Speaker
:Representative dollar, please state your purpose.
Dollar-
- To ask the bill sponsor a question.
Speaker
:Representative Sane is the gentleman you, The gentleman you.
Dollar
-Thank you
-I do want to ask you this quick question, if you know the answer to
this.
Does the AKC support this bill or is it at least neutral on this bill?
And I realize based on representative Glazier's amendment which I think
clarifies a number of things ; the answer to that may be different, but
can you comment on that?
Sane
- I'd be glad to comment,thank you.
No actually the AKC came out rite as the bill was filed and said that
the bill did not go far enough, and which I agree with.
However; we are all very aware of what we all will endure if we take
this bill to far. We have seen it to many times in this body, at this
legislature.
So, with that in mind , and the bill has been called watered down; It is
intentional so that we can get passage, so that we don't invade
agricultural interest.
So the AKC probably doesn't like it. They say in their press release it
doesn't go far enough, but We/I we are not ready to throw out a good
bill certain interests don't think it goes far enough. Thank You
Speaker
:Ms. Linda Mcelrap
Please state your purpose.

Speaker
: The lady is recognized to debate; the bill is amended.
Linda
-Thank you Mr speaker
Actually on the AKC , I spoke with one of their lobbyists as we were
developing the language for this bill and discussed this with them and;
this bill is actually the AKC standards appeal. So, I'm not sure why
they would object. We actually took the language from the AKC standards
appeal. This bill is so moderate compared to the Puppy Mill bills that
we tried to get through ever since I was a freshman here. In fact those
people called me a peever.
I am not a peever person.
I respect our farmers.I respect our hunters, and I respect our breeders
here.
I am not an animal extremist. I do not say that animals have rites but I
do respect the fact that if they are mistreated that we need to make
sure that they have the care that they need.
And that's all the bill does, is it makes sure that they are watered and
fed, and that they have veterinary care, and ; If you have seen the
pictures of some of these animals that are in these situations , you
know some of these situations are actually situations where people are
HORDERS .
Some of these people are very poor people that are in these puppy mill
situations.
I had a puppy mill in Jones County where the people were very poor, and
they actually needed someone to come in and rescue the animals and help.
We did have HSUS and some of the other animal people come in and take
those animals and then had to put them up and down,and also help their
owners.
So the owners really didn't have the resources to help their animals.
So some of these people really need to be rescued themselves from what
they are doing to these animals.
This is not registration. It is not going the route of asking the
department of agriculture to inspect breeding areas. This is when you
get a complaint from someone where there is abuse and where they are not
watering feeding the animals.</p>

Representative Cleveland, please state your purpose.
To speak on the bill.
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. This is our session animal bill. Every since I've
been here we've had one every session. This bill finally made it to the
floor. And I guess what disturbs me about this is when these first
started, when I first got here I thought there was a problem. That we
didn't have a law that would protect the animals. So I asked research,
our legislative research, &quot;Are there laws on the books to protect
animals in the state? Or do we really need to pass this law?&quot; And
the answer was, &quot;There are more than sufficient laws on the books
presently to protect the animals that are being harmed. So the law is
not the problem. The problem is getting the local authorities to act.
And this law, if we pass it, is not going to change that. It's not going
to change it at all. However, I feel we are opening the door to that in
the next section, session, we'll have another puppy mill bill, and it'll
build on this one. So I don't think this is a good idea, and I'm not
gonna vote for it. The law's on the books can handle it, the problem is
local, and we're not gonna change it by passing another law that's gonna
cause more problems down the road. But I am a PITA person, I'm a person
that likes to eat tasty animals.
Representative Cleveland, that comment was reminiscent of a debate that
happened between you and Representative Jones a couple of years ago.
Representative Whitmire, please state your purpose.
To ask the bill sponsor a question.
The gentleman is recognized, or Representative Saine, does the gentleman
yield?
I do yield.
The gentleman yields.
Appreciate your intent here. Just a question so we don't have too many
ambulance chasers. The very top line of page two, it says in addition
that any bedding material made available to dogs shalll be clean. Not
trying to be smart or retorical but, had I've heard this in committee or
had a chance to ask you earlier, give me some piece of mind that we know
how clean clean is so we don't turn this into something that becomes
extreme. Thank you.
Thank you. You know I probably just ask a retorical question, &quot;How
clean is clean?&quot; You know, this bill's not designed to go after and
enforce and be some type of police state tactics that would regulate
everybody that has a puppy dog with every ten females, and go after them
with such ferociousness that we're now going to commit a lot of time to
doing that. And I appreciate the question, and I can appreciate
Representative Cleveland's remarks though I obviously disagree. As I
read to you from the district attorney, our laws are not sufficient,
this gives a little more teeth to that. It does have the specific
exemtions, and that's really just one component. But I appreciate the
question. It has been properly vetted, we have seen what can happen when
bills get out of hand, but I'd also remind you that any bill that we
pass can be misinterpreted. Any law</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Saine to follow up on the
last question, the one before. Does the language in there say that the
bedding shall be clean and at the same time not pose a risk to the dogs?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well representative Jordon it does say that and so
another clear definition of what clean is. It's almost one of those you
know it when you see it. But it does spell out so that it does not pose
a risk to the dog. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't have a dog in this fight, excuse the pun, but
what concerns me -  one of the things that concerns me is over
regulation. I didn't come up here to over regulate, I didn't come up
here to stick my nose into people's lives where it didn't need to be. We
do have laws on the books that protect the animals.This bill
particularly concerns me because of the ambiguities, there's many areas
in this bill that can be misinterpreted 100 different ways. We just
covered the bedding, the clean not posing a risk. What does that mean?
When we're talking about a bill where somebody can get fined, somebody
can get a record or go to jail, have their property confiscated we need
to be a heck of a lot more specific than that. It exempts male dogs,
hunting dogs, sporting dogs, kennels, boarding facilities, show dogs,
nine dogs or less, are we protecting dogs here or are we not protecting
dogs? I don't get the point here. It requires regular lighting cycles,
what does that mean? Strobe lights in there. Allows for wire flooring,
appropriate and prompt treatment to any deviation in health. What is
considered a deviation of health? At what point is it required
treatment? I mean who makes these determinations? We're talking about
something that somebody can be charged with, their property can be
taken. We need to be a lot more specific than that. Exercise on a daily
basis, if IO kick him across the floor is that considered exercise?
Access to fresh food and water, if I put it on the other side of the
fence, if he's good enough and he can jump over the fence to get it he
has access to his food and water. It's just a very ambiguous bill and
we're looking at having people charged again and being fined, having
their property taken on something that can be - nearly every line of
this things can be misinterpreted one way or another. Euthanasia
performed humanely. So should I choose the axe or the baseball bat?
Please consider this when you get ready to vote on this bill, and I urge
you to vote know until if and when we can come up with a bill that's a
lot less ambiguous than this one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Steinberg please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentleman there have been some very I think
poor attempts at humor here during this debate that I personally have
found very distasteful. That often happens in debate and I understand
that. However, this bill, this bill is about something that we all, most
of us I think cherish. I have a dog, I've had dogs all my life. I don't
to exercise the dog as representative Speciale said I don't kick him
across the room. Dogs spelled backwards is G-O-D, GOD, right? We don't
find dogs, dogs find...</p>

the facts that we have in front of us and based on the goodwill or lack

who because this is something that she strongly believes in First Lady

to the kind of bad attempts at humour that I've heard so far that Find
quite frankly disgusting. this is not only a bad child is disrespectful
and so it's even okay okay I'm going to be supporting this bill today

reading through all these requirements of what you have to do and all,
it occurred to me I couldn't afford to get started in the business if I
have to do all that.  So I kind of have to wonder as a part of the
reason for this is to eliminate some of the competition breeding
operations starting so that the established businesses don't have that
new competition. I don't know. I don't want to attribute any of these
motives to Representative ??, he's a good guy and I think he has good
intentions.  I know he doesn't mean any of that stuff but I also, it
occurs to me, they say don't look ahead but I have to look ahead because
I think this is a slippery slope sort of thing. I don't think the bill
is intended this way by the sponsor but I know that there are forces out
there who would love to move us incrementally step-by-step toward no
ownership of animals, no hunting and that sort of thing, and even though
that's not the bill sponsors' intention I think a lot of the supporters
beyond this body for this legislation have that intent and I don't
intend to give them another step.  So I ask you to vote no on this bill.
 Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's been said several times that we already have laws

against it but what this bill does is have a much lower amount of things
that have to be proved and on the other hand the punishment is so
slight.  It's a Class 3 misdemeanor, which is the lowest possible
offense. I support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, first of all I
wanted to clarify for the record that I am not the Representative Jones
that was involved in that debate with Representative Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I did occur to me to mention it was former
Representative Earl Jones. And a most memorable exchange.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker I understand that sometimes it can be
difficult to keep up with the Joneses around here.  Mr. Speaker, I do
rise in support of this bill and I'd like to thank my friend from
Lincoln, Representative Saine, for taking on what I know has been a
difficult issue over the years and bringing people together and members
I would just say, I think in light of what Representative Saines said
also the perfect is not the enemy of the good. We have heard today from
some that believe the bill doesn't go far enough and some that believe
that the bill goes too far but I would say that at the end of the day
this is a good bill because I believe that if this bill passes that
animals will be treated more humanely. I think it's significant as has
been said that the First Lady of our State has taken a public stand on
this issue, been courageous to do that, and is here today and she honors
us with her presence here today.  But I'd like to thank her for being
willing to take a stand and as I say that ladies and gentleman I think
of my own first lady.  My wife at home has been very instrumental over
the years in rescuing animals.  Those of you that know me have heard me
speak about how we now have four dogs at home and we've helped to find
some dogs for others that are rescues.  But I've been told all my life
that you can tell a lot about the character of a person by the way that
they treat their animals.  It has been well said here on the floor that
those of us speaking here are very, very adamant about the fact that
nobody is making any sorts of claim that we believe that animals have
rights like human beings or anything like that.  I know that there are
extreme positions out there, but I think this is a good bill. I think it
does show a lot of character and I'd like to thank the sponsors and ask
for your support.

stand.  The first rule was that we ought to enforce the laws that we
already have on the books.  I don't know of any laws that we have on the
books that's ??  being enforced.  I think this is a bill that's needed
in order to prevent a lot of cruelty going on to animals in this state.
That's number one.  The second thing I heard was something about
ambiguity.  And we are a body of ambiguities in this year.  And I say
that because we know that we have laws against stealing, but we passed
laws against specific stealing.  For instance, some years back we passed
a law against stealing pine straw. Well, you know, stealing is stealing,
whenever it is to steal.  And we pass laws around here pinpointing those
things to happen, so we do ambiguity, and we've done it this year.  And
the one bill bill I can think of that we've done that had ambiguities in
it this year was the bill we passed last week called the gun bill.  You
wanna be ambiguous?  A gun locked up in a car, on a campus, with a
student in class.  Now how ambiguous can you get?  What kind of
protection is that person going to give anybody?  So, let's go ahead on
and pass this bill, because it's needed, and we need to shut down these
puppy mills.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  What this bill does is just make two basic
changes in our laws of municipal incorporations.  The first one's on the
front end.  Traditionally, we have always allowed the voter, the
registered voter to have the opportunity to sign a petition of 15%
threshold.  With this bill, we're going to add property owners, because
so many times, well not so many times, but there are occasions when your
property owner and your registered voter are not synonymous.  So, this
gives property owners the right to have a say before municipal
incorporation is anticipated or gone forward.  At the back end of it,
what we've done is to set a time frame for this municipal incorporation
because we have these on the books that are uncompleted, that date back
to like 2000 and before, and we know that those are not that valid,
because people die, and people move.  So we have set a three year term</p>

Thank you Mr. Speaker, fellow representatives. In 2011 this body passed
legislation making it a felony for speeding to elude arrest crimes, and
it set up a procedure for the forfeiture and sale of those vehicles
involved at the time the procedure that was used was a procedure that
had been used in the past for prearranged racing vehicles. Those
procedures turn out to be complicated, seldom used and did not work well
for those particular situations. This bill repeals those procedures and
inserts the procures already in the statues that used for the forfeiture
of vehicles for impaired driving. These procedures have worked well many
years. So simply put we are asking to repeal the procedures, and insert
the procedures for impaired driving into the statue for speeding to
elude arrest. Again these procedures are tried and true procedures that
have been used for many years received favorable report yesterday in

House Bill 698 is a little less controversial than the last one. It

this essentially does is, since folks are already hired, and these folks
are going into homes that many times...we want to make sure that the
public safety is acknowledged even after they’re hired, where you could
go into another state and maybe commit a crime and no one would know
about it, so that’s the intent of this bill. The departments will have

personnel. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House. This amendment makes a
pretty good deal a very good deal by extending exceptions to those times
when the public bodies will be required to record their closed sessions.
The first one of those is any information that’s privileged or
confidential pursuant to the laws of the state of North Carolina or the
United States. This covers the federal student records that are
particularly important to the boards of education. Number two,
14331811A3, which is the attorney/client privilege. And then number six
under that same section, which is personnel. And then one that I just

That which takes place in closed session.  This bill, in its previous
form, passed as far as I could tell, unanimously out of education and
judiciary A.  The recordings that are of closed session will become
eligible for public inspection, and will be retained for a period of two
years after they become eligible for public inspection.  The last thing
I want to say is that it becomes effective with those bodies that are
currently doing this that one day in October 1 of '13, and any of the
public bodies that are not doing this will have until July 1st of 2014
to become eligible for this.  I'd be glad to answer any questions.

For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham, representative Micheaux
arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Representative Dixon a couple of questions, if you don't mind.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dixon, I'm having a little heartburn with the bill here.
The first thing I want to ask you is, why would you go into closed
session if you're going to make these things available for inspection by
the public either then or anytime after?  What's the necessary of going
into closed session, if you're going to do that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Micheaux, my understanding is that in the state of North
Carolina, who do not allow secret meetings.  The current statutes in the
open meetings law occasionally, on a temporary basis, allows public
bodies to go into closed session.  While they're in that closed session,
they are still conducting public business, and they are only allowed to
conduct that public business behind closed doors for a temporary period
of time, and then they are required by current statutes to release what
they did in closed session to the public.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for another question.  Does the gentleman
yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

particular bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No longer than I've been up there, Representative Micheaux, it has been
my experience that it's never too late to reiterate again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Another question, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.  Oh, he does not yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I want to speak on the bill, then.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Durham is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen, I understand that there's always a
need in public bodies for closed sessions.  In this body in particular,
we close sessions, and you don't know what ever is coming out of there
that happen.  But here again, there are things in closed sessions, for
instance in the hiring of people in our school systems and whatnot where
you're hiring superintendents.  If you're going to let this information
come out and be public
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the representative yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Durham yield for question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Have you looked at the exceptions to that this ammendment we just passed
does?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have looked at the exceptions, yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Second question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield to a second question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you understand them?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm beginning to wonder whether I do or not.  That's why I'm arguing my
argument.  I'm trying to understand it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Durham continues to have the floor to debate the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  I just don't see if we're going to do this, and closed
sessions are there for a particular purpose, why are we going to let
this information come out to the public anywhere down the line?  I know
that there are exceptions in there, and we've got exceptions all over
the place, so it's just a puzzle to me as to why we have to do this in
this particular instance, and particularly if you're going to record
that meeting.  It's nice to have maybe a recordation of a vote that was
taken into close meeting, but any of the other information in their,
even with the exceptions or without the exceptions opens up a whole can
of worms to me, and I've just got a problem with it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hastings, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, to see if Representative Dixon will yield for a
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dixon, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a friendly question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Represented Dixon, this is a complicated area of law.  And I've just had

:Gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as amended.
Blackwell
- If I may and if so inclined, I had put on your desk earlier several
pages that are stapled together. The top sheet up at the top says in
enlarged type &quot;Cape Academy Trends &quot; ; and, Id like to refer
to that and explain a little of that information in support of this
bill.
Let me start by saying at the beginning of this session, the general
assemblies session back in late January early February ; One of the
early bills that we passed was a bill that would begin the process of
putting endorsements on the high school diplomas. There would be an
endorsement saying that someone was career ready or someone was college
ready, and if somebody wanted to sort of mix the two that was a 3rd
option, but; essentially the idea was some students are not interested
in going on to a four year college or university. They are interested in
primarily maby getting prepared for the workforce, and so therefore
there would be a career ready option, and then there would be the
college ready option.
Another thing that I would offer as we talk about this is its very
typical in my experience , in just over 4 years that I have been here in
this body for us to say that, and this is true of the educational
system, we are doing things on the basis of research and data that
supports what we are doing.
In this instance what I would like to argue is that is exactly what we
are doing , in the handout that I have put on your desk about  Cape
Academies; let me explain that this is from Florida and CAPE simply
means &quot;Career And Professional Education.&quot;
Florida began a process of requiring that all of it's school districts
have at least 1 of these Cape Academies its school district. This began
in 2008.</p>

<p id="110:00">
Because in this instance what we're talking about is some longitudinal
data that shows us trends and they are trends that I think we in North
Carolina would want to emulate. Now the top couple of things simply show
you the n umber of academies that have increased and the number of
students that have enrolled. Notice that since they began a program that
is similar to 968 would propose, they've gone from having just under
20,000 students enrolled in these programs to over 150,000 students. The
percentage of high school population participating in this has
increased.
A key feature of this though is that we're working towards industry
certifications and you can see that the industry certifications earned
in four years that the program was in place as shown on this chart, went
from under 1000 to 33,255. Let me also comment that I think
understanding that what we're talking about with an industry
certification is a further compliment to why we ought to want to do this
in North Carolina. These certifications are not something that a high
school gives a test of its own making and decides that you've passed it
and the high school gives you a certification. This is a certification
that is done on the basis of testing that is developed normally at a
national level by a business or industry group.
So it is in effect an independent evaluation of the quality of hat these
students have learned. And in Florida you can see there is a huge
increase in the number of those certifications that are being earned. If
you go to the second page of the handout you can also see some other
performance categories that show you that students that are
participating in these cape academies, or if they're not even in a cape
academy but they're involved in the certification programs, their grade
point averages are higher relative to the ones that are not working with
certification programs. Their absenteeism is less, their disciplinary
problems are less, their drop out rates are substantially less. They
earn diplomas at the twelfth grade level in much higher proportion. They
are more likely to take accelerated courses. And there's a reference to
bright futures, eligible seniors.Bright futures is simply a Florida name
for  a program that they have that offers scholarship funded by their
Florida lottery, and there are qualifications that you have to meet in
order to be eligible for it.
And this is simply showing that the students who participate in the
certifications and earn them are qualifying if they choose to go on with
their education for those supports at higher levels. And the 2011, 12
and the 2010, 11 numbers are there. Finally I would like to call your
attention to the last two pages. There's a pie chart there that shows
the ethnic breakdown for Florida's student population for the fall of
2011 and I'd like you to look at that in conjunction with the last page
which is the industry certifications earned by race, and look at the
bottom of that long page with all the figures where it says total...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And if you look at the black or African American
students as a percentage of the ones that are earning these industry
certification. For example for that year it was...

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blackwell, and I don't mean any
disrespect or anything but I noticed as long as you've been talking that
queue [??] has been going up and up and up. And I'm wondering...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I could sit down?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm fixing to say that. I thought we fixed the bill
when we took out the money and I don't know of anybody - there may be
somebody who's opposed to it but I really don't think there's anybody
who's opposed to it, and I'm just wondering, you know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I hope that you're right Representative Michaux
and I am at the end of my remarks with this final comment. The pie

demonstrates that this is across all population groups, and that is an
important message for us to keep in mind. That we want to encourage

that, and it's based on something that has worked well in Florida.

Representative Blackwell, does the gentleman yield?

I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Blackwell, the amendment that we just adopted took out
the language at the top of page 3, which referenced the amount of
appropriation that you, I guess you, believe is necessary to fund this
program. So where does that leave us in terms of the appropriation, are
you going to have to go before the Appropriations Committee and request
the dollar amounts that are in this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Just, you'll, your plan is to just roll that in to the overall Education
Budget?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
My hope is, Mr. Speaker, my hope is that in the appropriation process,
this program will be in place because the General Assembly, I hope, will
have already adopted this framework. And that the money to fund it will
be allocated in the budget appropriation process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you. Speak very briefly on the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you. Members of the House, especially my colleague, Representative
Michaux, I do actually have a problem with this bill. And it is simply
that I don’t think we ought to be giving bonuses to teachers to be
pushing particular curricula. As I said in the Education Committee,
globalization is an incredibly important area for people to study. Why
don't we give students bonuses for the, teachers bonuses if their
students go and get a scholarship in college to study globalization
issues? It doesn’t make sense to me, no one is a stronger supporter of
CTI than, CTE than I am and we've got a great program in Durham. But the
logic of the bill seems wrong to me. And I want to go home and so do
you, so I'm stopping right now, but I will be voting against the bill
for just that reason. Thank you.

Representative Blackwell, does the gentleman yield?

[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The question I have is, these Academies you're
talking about, can be within a school, like a school within a school, it
don't have to be separate buildings, am I correct on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Bell, we will not necessarily have an Academy per say.
The Academy model is used in Florida, and I was simply trying to explain
what it was so that Members who wanted to look at these chart to
understand the support for what happened there would understand what an
Academy was. But the basic thrust is that we will provide incentives to
all districts across the state to offer rigorous job related industry
certification coursework. And that is essentially what Florida did with
such success.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Holloway, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].

[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The gentleman is recognized to briefly speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yes, Mr. Speaker, and I certainly respect what Representative Michaux
had to say. I just wanted to quickly thank Representative Blackwell for
letting me work with him on this bill. Yes, there were a couple concerns
that were brought up with Education Committee, but we used this model
because it has produced results in other states. The thing that I
encourage you to keep in mind is this is about the students. This bill
provides more opportunities for them to help them excel, and I think
that's what our mission should be in Education. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Just a question, do we know where the, where the
Florida model, where their appropriations came from? Was it from the
state or was it from a private entity?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Mr. Speaker, I cannot be 100 percent sure, but I am almost 100 percent
sure that the money for the bonuses and the incentive payments, the
partnership came from state funding. There is some in kind contribution
from the College Board, who was working to assist with professional
development and so forth. At least in the case of the AP bill that's
coming up next. In the case of the</p>

<p id="125:00">
[Speaker Change]
That normally sound, maybe decent from going back to nineteen ninety
one. But once the partnership began and the program was put into place
that we would like to try, there was a three hundred and ninety one
percent increase that is shown by that chart. If you look at the next
page this is talking about not how many taking the course, it’s talking
about how many are passing with at least a three or higher. And you can
see there that overall there was a three hundred and sixteen percent
increase. Particularly noteworthy, on the next page you can see that
Florida’s Hispanic students, who had been dually unrepresentative in
those taking the courses and passing them experience of that same time
period of five hundred eighty five percent increase. Next page indicates
that for their, well I’m sorry. Skip over two pages. For the African
American students there were, there was an increase of seven hundred and
ten percent in students taking it but, I think the increasing passing
rate for African Americans in Florida was four hundred and seventy five
percent. We would only just like to do anywhere close to that in North
Carolina for our students. Finally if you’ll look at the two pages that
are stapled together and I think paper clipped at the back of those
first papers I mentioned, you can see from the first page that North
Carolina is not doing too badly in a sense that we are just below the
national average of U.S. public school graduates who scored a three or
higher on an A.P. exam. But Florida, on the other hand, is at twenty
seven point three percent, they are fourth in the nation. If you flip to
the next page there’s information that shows you what’s happened in
Florida versus  North Carolina in the ten year period from two thousand
two to two thousand twelve. Florida at the top now, second in the
nation, show a twelve point nine percent gain from fourteen point four
percent to twenty seven point three. North Carolina, you can see, is
well down the chart. We had a five point six percent in increase, which
brought us up to nineteen point three but still not making the kind of
gains and the broad based gains across all ethnic groups that were made
in Florida. Its on the strength of those numbers that we are
oppotomistic that if we try this program in North Carolina, that we can
have similar results. I urge the House to approve this.

[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and I will be brief ladies and gentlemen. I come
from a district that was able to provide funding for students who could
not afford to take the A.P. exams and I think that this piece of this
Bill is good. And we ended up having one of the highest A.P.
participation rates in the country. And what I think we’re after here is
to not miss the really good potential that students have, who may
otherwise not be able to take A.P. classes or take the A.P. exams. I,
while I am very concerned about what we pay our teachers overall, and I
think all teachers who are preparing students to take A.P. courses and
A.P. exams ought to be paid better than they are today. I do support
this Bill and I would ask my colleagues to support it as well. Thank
you.

We’re in agreement with the majority in the Senate and to move forward
with the government reorganization and efficiency. I’ll try to keep the
given the hour and given the day I’ll try to keep the explanation as
brief as possible. But let me suffice it to say we, we all debated
Senate bill 10. We understand the various boards and commissions that
were being eliminated in that and restructured. What this bill does that
is different essentially from what the conference report would have been
as the filling. All of the provisions there having to do with the
special superior court judges that a lot of folks objected to that’s
gone. There’s no reference to superior court judges in this bill in any
way. So that provision is entirely gone. All of the provisions with
respect to the board of elections that had some folks keyed up those are
all entirely gone at this time too. And all the provisions with respect
to the utilities commission have been stricken from the bill. There was
also some language in there about climate warming. That that language
came out of there. That was, that was in one, that was ?? one sentence.
Some people had some questions about that. Otherwise this bill is what
the majority had, had agreed upon and all of the conferees for the House
had signed off on. It’s slightly different from what we passed in the
House. It’s a lot different from what was passed in the Senate. And I
think it represents a good, a good compromise on the issue again as many
of you know the the main sticking points in the last bill were the
superior court judges and those provisions are out. I have, I have
requested staff to put on your dashboard and you should have it a bill
summary that goes through line item by line item of those various
commissions and boards for those who are so inclined to wanna go through
it. But I, I, at this time unless I get questions I’m not gonna go back
through all that because we spent many hours on this bill a while back.
And I, I want to be respectful of members’ times particularly given
we’re so thirsty. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Harrison
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To briefly debate the bill
and set forth an amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to
debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker of the House
and ladies and gentlemen of the House. I don’t want repeat the comments
I made during previous debates. But I did want to remind you this is
still an unprecedented sweep of board members on these important
oversight commissions. At least there’ll be 100 current members that
will be removed from the sitting board members from boards and
commissions. There this is important because these people have
particular expertise and it helps to have the institutional knowledge
when you transition from the new appointees. So I think it is
particularly problematic because 90 of those 100 are coming from
environmental boards. The Coastal Resource Commission. The Environmental
Management Commission. The Coastal Resources Advisory Commission. And
the, the Wildlife Resources Commission. And with regard to the
Environmental Management Commission in particular we are losing some
seats has specific designations for conversation and public health
interests. And I think that’s problematic. Also because we’re losing the
EMC sitting members those have ex officio positions on other commissions
and particular the Mining and Energy commission. And I think that’s
going to be important loss because the EMC appointee to the Mining and
Energy commission which we have tasked with writing our fracking rules
is now no longer going to be part of that body. And I understand
everyone agrees that he’s an integral part of that process. I think
that’s a problem. But what bothers me most is that the language that was
in the House version of the Senate bill 10 that would insure that a
majority of the members of the Environmental Management Commission don’t
profit from or otherwise represent in, the industries that the EMC is
supposed to regulate. That language, that conflict of interest language
is not in this bill. And it was in the House version of Senate bill 10.
And that if I can be recognized to send forth an amendment Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady’s recognized to send forth an amendment. The
clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Harrison moves to mend
the bill on page 10 lines 30 through 32 by rewriting the lines to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady’s recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen. This just
restores the language that was in the House version of Senate bill 10
that restores the conflict of interest language that applies to the
Environmental Management Commission. And I urge your support. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Moore please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker,
members. The, the language I would ask you to oppose the amendment. Very
simply the amendment is not necessary. The state ethics act applies to
this board. This one thing you’ll notice in this bill is makes it even
more clear that the state ethics acts apply to these various boards and
commissions. It was deemed that, that determined that, that that
language was problematic. And during, during the process of the
conference committee</p>

if I could get your attention again, I’ve had at least one committee
chair come to me, informing me that the 6PM session time conflicted with
a calendar appointment. I would encourage the members to consider
potentially moving up their, or I should say their committee meeting. I
would encourage the members to potentially consider moving their
committee meetings up an hour so that we can still accommodate the 6PM
start. [PAUSE] Notices and announcements. Representative Bill Brawley,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For two announcements,
please, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for
announcements. [SPEAKER CHANGES] First I wanted to announce the success
of the customer service attitude that’s been brought to the Department
of Environmental Natural Resources. 11 years ago, a water permit for
intervention transfer was authorized pending an environmental
assessment, and I’m happy to announce that after 11 years, that has
finally been granted and some children that were in the first grade that
have now gone to college can come home and get fresh ?? water in the
Yadkin Valley Goose Creek Basin. The second announcement is when that
basin was first formed by the glaciers during the last cold portion of
earth history, Greg Horn was farming somewhere in Pennsylvania. He has
survived yet another year and continues to advance in age and maturity
and we are grateful that we have had his presence. Thank you, Mr.

And ladies and gentleman, before we make the motion to adjourn, for
planning purposes next week. It will be a very busy week. It is
crossover week. The Chair does not anticipate that the crossover date
will change. Therefore, Thursday at midnight would be the last possible
moment that we will have to have bills crossover and be eligible. They
will be, for the freshman in particular, this is a very important week
to pay attention to meeting announcements. There will probably be
instances where we will need to recess in the middle...</p>

...session to allow committees to work. That's just a natural part of
the process. We will try to do our best to give you some breaks in
between, but we anticipate very lengthy sessions next week up into
Thursday evening. We do not anticipate session on Friday because that is
the day after Crossover, so that's at least one right spot. If you'll
bear with us we'll do everything we can. If any of you are having
problems trying to get bills moved, I've met with some of the members of
the Democratic caucus this week to see if we could offer some help on
bills that are supported by the leadership, and the same holds true for
any members obviously on the Republican side. We hope that it's an
uneventful week, but it will be one that everybody will be put to the
test.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blust, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
An inquiry of the chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentlemen may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would it be possible to get some precise and official guidance on
exactly what renders a bill not subject to crossover as far as maybe a
fee or an appropriation? What exactly can render a current bill not
subject to crossover, and when does that have to be done to be
officially recognized? I think a lot of people, a lot of members have
that on their mind.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, would the gentlemen like to respond to the
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure, I'd be glad to. The crossover rules, and I've had a lot of these
questions, good point to bring up. The crossover rule that members of
this chamber should be concerned with is the crossover rule of the
senate, because that's what dictates what bills come from this house
that the senate will consider. Of course, our crossover rule deals with
bills that we receive from the senate. What essentially the bill has to
do is it has to have an appropriation in it or it has to levy a tax or a
fee. It has to be that. It has to have that in the bill for it to be
eligible. The inquiry of whether it's crossover eligible, as I
understand, is when it arrives to the other chamber.
Does it have the fee, does it have the tax, does it have the
appropriations. That's the issue, but there are other ways to deal with
bills that run up on time when it's...you've seen PCSs and those sorts
of things, so just try to move your bills along, but there are other
avenues.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members should also be aware, again, for the, primarily for freshman
members, but it varies for ?? for all members that local bills are
obviously allowed in the short session. What Representative Moore was
also referring to is bills that move out of the chamber that may not be
used and some bills that came from the senate that may not be required
because the house bill was passed are all valid vehicles for future
legislation next year. Representative Floyd, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Inquiry, chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentlemen may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, there are some concerns. They always say that &quot;You are
an honorable person,&quot; and as we go through next week...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Did you say, &quot;There are some concerns that I'm an honorable
person?&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, they say that you are.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd just like to hold you to that as we go through the lengthy meetings
next week that we will be allowed to have some breaks because of our
age.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, yeah. We may even open all the doors, Representative Floyd, but we
will. The members need to be mindful that if it goes particularly long,
if you will communicate to me if you have a special circumstance and
it's something that we're voting on that's particularly important to
you, we'll do everything we can to accommodate it. Any further notices
and announcements? Representative Moore is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I've moved that subject to receipt of messages from the
senate, the receipt of committee reports, the receipt of conference
reports, and the re-referral of bills and resolutions that the house do
now adjourn to reconvene on Monday, May the 13th, 2013 at 6:00 PM.
