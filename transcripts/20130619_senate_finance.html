<p id="10:00">
or because most every business you are in or a partner in or have
ownership in, almost every business any of us can think of will you have
to do that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Well, I'm good at picking locks I can tell you that.
 And I used to have a locksmith license but I quit pickin' locks but if
you need my services I'll volunteer them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Mr. Chairman, question for Senator Bingham.  Did you
turn your license in or was it taken?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I've still got it in my pocket but I was supposed to
mail it in Senator Apodaca.  Thank you. Senator Blue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  On a serious vein Senator Bingham, I'm trying to
figure out on Line 13 you limit it to a person who works for a company.
Is there any reason that you would distinguish a person who holds
himself out as a locksmith, Stan's locksmith?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Senator Blue, I have a gentleman here who is on that
locksmith board and they crafted this.  He is of former law enforcement
and locksmith himself and so if you don't mind Mr. Chairman, I'd like.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  You'd like a friend to answer that question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Yeah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  If you would approach the podium please, yeah, back
in the rear of the room.  I want to say stern but in the rear, and state
your name please and who you are.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I'm Steve Straub.  I'm Chairman of the Locksmith
Licensing Board.  I have a 35-year law enforcement career, been
locksmithing for about 25, and I'm sorry I couldn't understand your
question Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Yeah, I'm wondering why you are distinguishing on
Line 13, Page 1, your stating for us there are kinds of people or kinds
of institutions that a locksmith works for and prohibiting anybody who
does services only if they work for one of these entities, and I'm
wondering why you exclude individuals if you're trying to regulate the
whole question about locksmith services?  Can you hear me okay now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  OK, I'm sorry.  We're not excludin' individuals,
we're just wantin' those individuals licensed.  Right now currently
institutional, that being hospitals, schools, and large apartment
complexes, which have access to our children's records, our health
records, they're not required to be licensed and that's what we are
trying to do.  They actually came to ask the Institutional Association,
wanting us to put this in the Bill.  We have some problems, maybe I'll
center on your question, in some large complexes, apartment complexes,
we have a general maintenance guy doing locksmith type work that he
really doesn't understand and is not trained to do, which allows one key
to fit multiple apartments in the complex, which is not a good thing if
you're living there.  Have I answered your question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  One follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Senator Blue, yes, if you look at Page 1 of the
Bill, Lines 8 and 9, that's the current law and that requires all
individuals holding themselves out as locksmiths to be licensed as a
locksmith.  This part was put in for referring to the Bill's
institutions that employ people who engage in locksmithing for that
institution.  There's a broad exemption in the current law that
allows... basically most companies that employ someone that does
locksmithing service for those individuals to be exempt.  What this law
is doing is it's requiring those institutions that employ individuals to
provide locksmith service, those individuals that provide the service
have to be licensed as locksmiths.  So that is what the language that
you are pointing to does.  So individuals that hold themselves out as
locksmiths currently have to be licensed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I think I understand.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Senator Hunt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you.  I think I just heard the answer to my
question but I want to ask anyway. When it talks about the employee of a
property owner, could that definition employee, would that encompass
their agent in addition to their employee?  The reason I ask that
question is many property owners employ management</p>

-- management companies to handle their property management, and I just
want to make sure that agency, that agent, is covered, in this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, it is. We worked with the entities from the property management
company, and they are covered under the current exemption and they will
not need to be licensed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion from the committee? Senator Allran.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I guess this is just sort of general. The only
thing I really remember about this bill is when it was first introduced
I got a letter from somebody in my district who said this was just a
terrible bill. My question is now, do you feel like you've worked
through all that and come up with a compromise that people support, or
is there still opposition to it? I mean, is this kind of a consensus
bill now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, Senator Allran, there were three groups who had concern. Neil Hunt
brought to my attention one, we got that worked out. And the other was
law enforcement, which the gentleman ??, he was also in agreement with
that because that's an emergency situation. So we got that worked out.
And the last one is the towers. And Senator Mclaurin has a ??, who he
may want to address this, but I know of no objection now unless you have
a problem with something. I don't know objection, I haven't heard
anything, at least.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McLaurin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, and sir, he's correct. The concern I had
expressed to me was the institutional locksmith, those that are working
in colleges. They would be covered under this and you address that with
the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, actually the intent and my interest with this was because there
are a lot of folks doing this type work who are fraudulent in the scams,
and he can give you a lot of examples, but I didn't want to tie up your
time here, but it's certainly a serious problem and this will resolve
it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, and further discussion from the committee? From the public?
Any further discussion? If not, we will entertain a motion from Senator
Tillman for favorable report. This is a PCS, correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK, favorable to the PCS and favorable to the original, all in favor
please say &quot;aye&quot;.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed, &quot;no&quot;. &quot;Ayes&quot; have it. Thank you, ladies and
gentlemen of the senate. Yes sir, Solid Waste Management Reform. Senate
Bill 328.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade? Senator Tillman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He's ready.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are you ready? Well you come on if you're ready.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was ready the day before yesterday.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 305. Has everybody got that? ??? contract changes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I do have a technical amendment. Mr Chairman, I believe we have
copies available.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does everyone have the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The amendment is in the packet.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ok, Senator Tillman, would you explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is just an editing amendment, that's all it is. And I believe you
have that in front of you, the wording is out of place, and this
replaces it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you have a motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Motion from Senator Walters for the amendment, all in favor please say
&quot;aye&quot;.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed? Amendment carries, Senator Tillman you may carry on with it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your help in scheduling this bill.
As you know, recently we passed the tag and fax together program and
that bill has been lauded as a wonderful thing, which would help collect
taxes at the local tag agent's DMV offices. This comes into play right
away, and those folks are having a huge workload on them. I have tag
agents here today who can testify to that if you need, but the counties
have been doing this and now counties won't have to do this. It'll be
done at registration time. There was not adequate compensation to pay
these folks. Now some of the commissioners had a little heartburn and
they thought they'd be losing a few dollars on this until I explained to
them that you will net an increase of 100 million dollars when we pass
this bill. You're going to get 100% collection because if the man wants
his registration to his car, he's going to pay his taxes. The problem
is, you've got to stand there in line and explain to them, tag
agencies...</p>

<p id="20:00">
to explain to them why your tax bill is different, why we're doing it
this way, and why is it this amount, and ?? that takes time, and that is
face to face, and you don't know how much time, but we have long lines.
We already have stacks of paperwork there in the tag agent's offices. If
you doubt my word, you check with these tag agents, folks. I've been
there, I've seen them at work, and I've seen a great stack of work and
the deposits that they have  to make several times a day, and all the
paperwork. To adequately compensate these tag agencies, we've put a bill
together to take part of this money that would be in the commissioner's
purview and pay these folks. Now if we didn't have this bill, the county
commissioners of the counties would be collecting  this tax and they
would be hiring people to do it, or in this case, they would be able to
make some reductions in their staff because the great load of this tax
collecting will be off their backs. And so it'll be a win-win for the
counties, and I believe the ones that I have talked to, once they
realized they were going to net a whole lot more than they would ever
cost them, said this is what we need to do. I ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir, Sen. Rabin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Move for favorable report on the PCS as amended, I've read the bill,
it's a good bill, and I think it rewards the right kind of people for
their work, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Sen. Rabin. We have a motion for a favorable amendment, any
questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
Sen. Tillman, I walked by your office earlier today to ask a couple
questions. If you'll allow me, I'll just ask a couple now. First of all,
the North Carolina County Commissioners' Association, do they or do they
not back this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't know, I've not heard- they've not told me that they didn't back
it. All the commissioners I've talked to when I explained what they
would be netting vs. what it would cost them, support it.  Initially,
any time when you say we're gonna take 5 million away from you, they
want to say no. I don't know what the association-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I may sir, Mr. Chairman,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Now hold up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They are not in support of this, and then I guess my question to you
would be we're increasing it I guess, I've heard 48 cents, $1.06, going
up to $1.27. My county has contacted me and told me that in the first 18
months of implementation of this bill, it cost them 104,000. I'm not
trying to upset you Bill, I'm just trying to get answers to questions as
we move forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You may lose $104,000 initially. What I want to know at the end of the
year, what do you get back, Sen. Tucker? And that's the bottom line. And
the bottom line, is they're coming out way ahead. $100 million extra
will be collected if we pass this bill. If we don't the work still has
to be done, these agents will not do the work, they cannot make a
profit, they close the doors, guess who's going to collect it? That's
why we're where we are. And we're trying to make some equity there,
that's all we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Walters.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
When-
Excuse me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have one more follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
More follow up.
The other question I have, do these tag agencies, Sen. Tillman, don't
they have contracts that expire or is this just ongoing in infinity, or
can they not renegotiate their rates so that they wouldn't be caught in
this pickle of not being able to make enough money?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They have no power to do anything but recommend us the rates. Now we
have 2 state agencies, Sen. Tucker, that you all might need to know that
do this. And guess what they charge per transaction. We're asking for
$1.27. Do you know what they have to do to make a profit? $4 per. If you
do it on the internet with no contact, no questions, it's 48 cents. The
same thing they'll be getting in this bill. This is a very small amount
to pay these people to do this work, and it's fairness.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Sen. Walters?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair, and Sen. Tillman, thank you for bringing this bill
forward. A lot of places in rural communities, we really struggle to get
our DMV offices, get these contract offices to survive because it's just
on the revenue from the operate. But also, it helps to- the public, when
they come to get their license tags, they don't have to drive another
20-25 miles to the courthouse to get a receipt that maybe they've
already paid their license plate fee county taxes and it just didn't
show up on one. So this'll benefit the- our customers, if you will, and
also help as we move forward. And rural counties really have a hard time
getting these contract agents to come and operate, because it's just not
profitable. We're giving additional work to these folks, but we're also
taking work from the counties, so they will- we're collecting the money
for the counties, so I think it's a good bill. Thank you Sen. Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Sen. Walters.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Brown?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That</p>

<p id="25:00">
Representative: Mr. Chairman, first of all, the bill was passed in ’07,
but now it is starting to take place that collects the property tax in
counties, I am not sure that it ties into the bill Senator Tillman, but
hat bill was a  huge win for the counties: the counties were probably
collecting 77% of the property tax on automobiles at that time, now they
collect 100%. I think these agents sure deserve to make a little more
for collecting these monies for the counties. I think it is a good bill.
I think we should move favorably forward, if we have not already done
it.
Representative: Mr. Chairman, one comment. I want to thank all those
agents that are out here that drove down here today. I have been in
their offices and watched the paper load, and it is a good chance for
you to have face to face contact with somebody that is handling your
taxes. It is an extra burden and I thank you all for being here.
Speaker: Thank you. Members I have got… Senator McKissick? I knew you
weren’t going to get off without one….
Representative: [laughter] It’s simply a question Senator Tillman
because I know so many of the counties, I heard from [xx] County, the
manger over there, it is a small county, a rural county, that they are
working on their budgets right now and establishing their tax rates that
will extend into next year. The concern that I have heard is that if
there is going to be change, I can see based upon the numbers you have
presented here why some of the contractor agents may need a little bit
more money, but they tell me, and what I have heard from a number of
groups, is that they negotiate these rates over a five year period. This
beginning rate, I think its 49 cents a transaction, is something
everybody had bought into. Is there any possibility of trying to keep
the rate lower during this year, the transitional period, and going to
the higher rates after the transition? I think with people adopting
their budgets right now, we were at the 19th of June, these counties
have to have a budget in place by the 30th. For some of the smaller
counties it could have a significant impact and I don’t know if they
would be able to handle it. So, giving it some thought as to trying to
help those counties out.
Representative: Senator, no, not in the senate, is my answer to that,
but I will tell you that since this is collected with registrations, you
are going to pick up additional monies, getting to that 100 million
immediately. So this short fall, if they got any balance at all, they
are not going to be affected, especially in those smaller counties. Now
I know they made their budget, Ralph Heist made a good point of that,
but they have made their budget knowing that something had to be done
because their work load is going down. I would suggest getting rid of 2
or 3 employees that collect the tax there, and save that money. They
could do that.
Speaker: Thank you sir. I know we have 2 people from the public that
want to speak. First, we have Joanna Reese. Joanna, if you will step up
please ma’am.
Joanna: Thank you Mr. Chairman. I am Joanna Reese, with the association
of county commissioners, and I spoke several times with Senator Tillman
on this bill. He has made a number of changes due to our concerns, and a
I appreciate that. The way the bill is written now, we have agreed to
the $1.27 increase for the issuance of limited registration plate, and
recognize that is an extra step; however, we have not agreed, nor
opposed, to the increase from the .48 cents to the $1.06, and then the
.71 cents. I would like to address the issue of the extra $100 million
dollars. We never predicted that amount. We are looking at a possible
$50-80 million, not extra revenue coming in, but this is debt owed to
the counties when citizens have not paid their property taxes. So this
is not a new tax or fee. Thank you very much for your time.
Speaker: Thank you. Mr. Palmyer?
Representative: Thank you. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I am
Mr. Palmyer, with the NC legal municipalities. We too are concerned
about this because city governments paid for the computer system upgrade
that has been made to automate this, but we also will be paying for
these fees for the municipal portion of property taxes that will be
collected. Our concern really stems from the fact that the fee amounts
being requested here, we are not sure what they are based on. We know
that when the DMV fees were established, it was based on a number of
people that will be hired, on a number of positions that would be
filled, and their were requirements in the bill that the DMV hire
people. This one does not require any additional hirings. We do not know
what will happen and we are concerned about that. Thank you.
Speaker: Thank you. Yes sir, Senator Tillman?
Representative: Those representing the league and county commissioners,
no one can ask your league, your county commissioners, if this $80
million</p>

Paul,or the way that this bill goes. I guarantee you, none of them want

Senate Bill 328, Senator Wade, solid waste management. This is a PCS. We
need a motion to hear the PCS by Senator Rucho. All in favor please say
aye. Opposed? Motion carries. I believe there is an amendment.Senator
Brown?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, there are two amendments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let's take them one at a time then. I think it's
technical, Jennifer may want to touch on it.  Thank you. Jennifer, would
you please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown's amendment would make two technical
changes to the PCS. The first one would be on page 13, line 50 through
page 14 line 1. Basically it corrects a mistake in one of the effective
dates. The second change would be on page 15, line 45 and it corrects
just a drafting error where a term was struck out that shouldn't have
been struck out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is the committee comfortable with that amendment being
read? If so I hear a motion to approve the amendments - Senator Rucho.
All in favor? Opposed? Amendment carried. Second amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Mr. Chairman, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do the members have copies of that, or will it be read
also?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Jennifer is that going to be passed out? We do have
copies Mr. Chairman, but it is very short.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If you'll read it, then if we have a problem we will
go forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade's amendment would make a change on page
11 line 31 of the PCS to rewrite that line to bring it back to the
existing law, which says, &quot;a wetland, unless the permit&quot;, so
it takes it back to existing law and would remove the change made by the
PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is the committee comfortable with that being read? If
so we'll have a motion to accept the amendment please. By Senator Rabin.
All in favor please say aye. Opposed? Amendment carried. The bill before
us, Senator Wade.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. First let's start with the
reason we're doing this bill. My understanding - it depends on who you
speak with: the industry or with ?? but we have a capacity left as far
as space in landfills of about somewhere between 15 -20 years. We need
to address this problem now, we don't need to wait until we're out of
landfill space and then we haven't decided what we're going to do with
the waste. I think there's a couple things we need to think about when
we're talking about this bill. First, we have about 42 municipal solid
waste landfills, and we have about 7 that are private. The other thing
is we tend to not really treat our landfill friends as something they
provide as infrastructure. Feeling that they really don't provide us a
service; but they provide us a great service.  They don't make the
trash- we do. They provide us a place to put the trash. Part of our
infrastructure.And what I would like to do from this point on - there's
several changes in this bill and I'd like to have staff go through it to
start with. But I do want to tell you that ?? has been involved and they
do support this bill before we start. And Mr. Chairman, if it's OK if
Jennifer could hit the highlights, I'd appreciate it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly, we'd appreciate that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, thank you Mr. Chairman and Senator Wade. Members,
part 1 of the bill would extend the duration of permits for sanitary
landfills and transfer stations to 30 years or up to 30 years for
existing and new landfills. Those landfills are currently at 5 or 10
year duration right now.</p>

...the limitation end under the current, under this provision and the
subsequent provision on the earlier provision that a city can charge
more for collection than you're talking about in the first section that
I read. Am I missing something?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just to be clear, Senator Blue, you are asking about
Section 7C and that language as compared to the language in 7D?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's the language in Section 7D compared to the
language in Section 7C, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Blue, it's my understanding that 7D just
simply allows the cities or counties who are collecting a surcharge on
the waste that's disposed of in their jurisdiction, once those funds
have entered their public enterprise fund and sufficient funds have been
expended to maintain the landfill within their jurisdiction, then they
can use that excess for other purposes. That's my understanding of what
7D does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Then does 7C put a limit on how much the city can
charge, because it says you can only charge the amount necessary to
operate the facility?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It does say that the fee may exceed those costs if the
city enters into a contract with another city or county and by ordinance
they levee a surcharge, so it does say it can exceed that amount if.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Question then to the sponsor? Why do we, if the city
does not accept garbage from anybody else, why do we restrict how much
they can charge the citizens for operating their landfill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think, Senator Blue, that came out of the other bill
that we were currently using and that was the language. It's my
understanding we just transferred that over from the previous bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The previous law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One last question. Also I notice that on page 18,
starting line 18, Section 7E gives a local government the ability to put
a surcharge on garbage or waste collected from other local governments
within the State. Is there any restriction on what they can do about
waste collected from local governments or any other entity outside the
State?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. Senator Blue, I'll let Jennifer answer that,
but we had a large discussion on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Staff, can you answer that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Then we're going to talk trash for two more questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, Senator Blue, no. It just speaks to
local governments inside the State.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Senator ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just ??. So there is no restriction on waste coming
from other places into these, according to this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In the bill in its entirety? Are there any
restrictions on out of State waste?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I understand some commerce clause issues and stuff,
but is there any...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Not to my knowledge. No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Blue. Senator Woodard?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think my questions may
actually better be directed to Mr. Matthews from the solid waste
division. If I could ask a couple questions of him?
You said ?? Senator Wade stated the capacity for our landfills now
you've got 15 to 20 years, is that the department's estimate of what our
current landfill capacity is?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Our estimates a little higher than that. It's closer
to 30 years, but every landfill in the State has a particular service
area, so it's really difficult to put a total number of years of
capacities State-wide because you may have one landfill that's covering
only one county that may have a great deal of capacity. But that
capacity's not available State-wide. So when we look at he capacity, the
only we could calculate it really was to look at total capacity across
the State. We really didn't try to break it out in the way of the
service areas that existed, so you may have...</p>

<p id="55:00">
We have much more of a capacity issue than other areas.  Thank you,
thank you sir.
For municipal solid waste which we have more data on that than for
construction and demolition waste, we’ve increased capacity by about 30%
we have not permitted any new land fills, any new C and D or municipal
solid waste landfills in that period of time, but in an effect of the
legislation that was passed in 2007, existing landfills were exempt from
a number of requirements that new landfills would have to comply with so
the effect really was to have a lot of the existing landfills to ask for
permits to increase capacity.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick last question
[SPEAKER CHANGES] sure and since I had a series of questions what I’ll
do is get with senator Wade later to discuss them but I am deeply
concerned about this legislation because its compromising some very
serious environmental standards that we’ve had for quite some time and
the potential for us to open up our rural counties in this state as a
dumping ground for states up in the northeast gives me great concern.
The things specifically concern me the length of permits being extended,
the height of the landfills being extended, particularly for those
properties that are adjoining or near it, buffers being decreased,
potential to put landfills near what might be called wetlands, there’s a
whole host of things that give me deep concerns.  I hope that this bill
moves forward that we’ll really seriously thing about what we need to do
to protect our environment, not just for today but for the next
generation because we don’t want to put ourselves in a position that we
become an attractive dumping ground and it’s not a price I’m willing to
pay but I hope we can somehow craft this in a way that a lot of the
things this bill is attempting to do can be addressed in a more
meaningful and effective ways without leading to a deterioration of
environmental restrictions dealing with landfills.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Jennifer would you like to address that please
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well Senator Wade may be addressing this while not
changed in the PCS as they are as they are under existing laws
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK so that was removed in the PCS that was before us
today?  Thanks encouraging.  We’ll keep working on it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you. We have two members in the audience that
would like to speak, Brian Plumly City of Chesapeake Virginia.  Brian
are you any kin to the famous, infamous sgt major Plumly?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well since I’m a graduate of the university of
carolina law school I don’t make that claim to be related to that crew,
but I think distantly yes sir, but I did get the height gene.  It is an
honor to be here, I”m Brian Plumly representative for the city of
chesapeake Virginia.  We’re an immediate neighbor of the proposed mega
landfill in camden county north carolina our neighbor.  If this bill is
passed into law then the landfill will move forward.  For chesapeake the
landfill is a drinking water red code, it is a major problem for our
drinking water water shed.  For northeast north carolina the landfill
will be a job prevention act for camden county.  This is designed this
landfill is designed for out of state garbage.  The camden county
landfill will be near a brand new 400 million dollar high rise bridge
that the state of virginia is constructing right now.  It’s going to be
at the entrance of camden county’s brand new commerce park which is
attracting attention from several businesses and in fact a 500 firm
engineering firm is looking at moving there right now, we’re talking
about jobs 70,000 dollars a year going into this area, instead we’re
going to end up with 20 jobs at 10 dollars an hour running a landfill.
So we’re asking this body to reexamine this and study this legislation
carefully, there was a long study before in the previous law.  We should
ask and hold everyone to have a long conversation so everyone has a
chance to participate.  I really do appreciate your time today I know
that everyone has worked hard but I do ask, that we be given the
opportunity for full public debate.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir.
