  The meeting of the joint legislative program evaluation oversight
committee comes to order at 2:05 PM. Almost on time. I&#39;d like to
take, I&#39;d like to begin by introducing our sergeant of arms. First
from the House, Reggie Sills, over here to my right, Marvin Lee behind
me, and Terry McCraw is over there. Thank you, Terry. From the Senate,
Canton Lewis. ?? There you are. How are you Canton? Steve McCague, and
Dave Hoth. Thank you, gentlemen. I don&#39;t think we have pages at this
point. Am I correct? One reminder, please I know you&#39;ve already done
it but please check to make sure your noise making devices are in the
non noise making mode. That includes you too, George. First item on the
agenda. I just, my fountain pen just came loose and I probably have ink
all over my shirt. Yuck. Oh, well. Oh, well. Approval amendment of the
February 23 amendment, minutes. Any corrections? Amendments, changes?
Being none, I&#39;ll entertain a motion to approve. Senator Bingham to
approve. I don&#39;t think that needs a second, or does it? It does not.
All those in favor say aye. Those opposed no. The ayes have it. The
minutes are approved, and before we begin I&#39;m gonna turn to my
cochair Senator Hartsell for any opening remarks. None, terrific. First
thing on the agenda is to amend our 2013 to 15 PED work plan to
authorize and evaluation of county departments of social services
administration of the North Carolina Medicaid program. This is an
amendment at a member&#39;s request. Do you all have copies of the
motion? No. We need to pass out the motion. Here we go. We can make the
motion. I&#39;ll take a motion from the members of the committee.
Senator, oh Senator, I didn&#39;t mean to demote you. Representative
Davis is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. At this time, mister chairman, with your
permission, I&#39;d like to make a motion to amend the 2013-15 work plan
to direct the program evaluation division to evaluate the effectiveness
and efficiency of medicaid eligibility determination in North Carolina.
This evaluation will study the accuracy, consistency, and timeliness of
Medicaid eligibility determinations made by county departments of social
services, including an examination of their processes, management, and
performance. The program evaluation division will make a preliminary
report to the joint legislative program evaluation committee by June 1,
2015 and a final report to this committee, the joint legislative
oversight committee on health and human services and the fiscal research
division by February 1, 2016. Thank you mister chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I&#39;m gonna ask Mr. Turcotte to explain the motion, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman, members. I&#39;m John Turcotte, director of
the Program Evaluation Division. This motion came about at the request
of chairman Horn. The, there is legislation Senate bill 14, and in the
process of considering Senate bill 14 there was an amendment adopted to
the effect to require the state auditor&#39;s office to conduct this
audit, and Representative Horn wanted to know if PED could conduct the
same kind of review, and we can do the review. It is a study of how
counties administer Medicaid eligibility, and as the motion explained,
it has us looking at the, at a sample, a representative sample of the
counties based upon their size and urban, rural

  <p id="005:00">
  and so forth, and within each of the counties that selected, the idea is
to do a random sample so that we can get a statistically reliable
estimate of the numbers that we come up with, be it performance, time to
conduct an initial eligibility determination, time to conduct
re-eligibility determination. And what we will do, as the motion calls
for, we&#39;ll do a preliminary review and give this committee, in June,
a briefing on what we plan on doing in detail in the review. Out of
this, the Legislature should be able to know if there are efficiency
problems out there, and if there are, what is the scale of the problem.
Or you could put it differently, if they&#39;re not, if they are very
efficient, how efficient are they, and if there are any problems that we
come up with relative to variation in procedures or processes in the
counties. They&#39;ll be called--we&#39;ll call attention to that, and
as we usually do, we&#39;ll make recommendations for administrative
consideration and for legislative consideration. Mr. Chairman,
that&#39;s the explanation.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Any questions, comments? Senator Tarte?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Yes, Mr. Chair. One thing--in terms of scope, there&#39;s been things
written, I believe, that state that due to volume we&#39;re not
necessarily checking eligibility, and that people are just being
assigned and enrolled. And will this study enable us to determine if
that&#39;s the case and to the degree?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Yes, Senator Tarte, it will. We will look at any feature, any
characteristic, any variable that affects the workload on Medicaid
eligibility. If there is a workaround, a work-through, a pass-by,
however it&#39;s termed on the county level, we will find it. As you
recall, last year, or it may have been longer than that, there was a
tremendous surge that occurred, and some of the counties were unable to
handle it. This is when the DHHS changed their systems. And this all
came about at a bad time. And at the time, they had--some of the
counties had to staff up and hire additional staff to carry on the
eligibility determinations, but we actually lost--we&#39;re on the verge
of losing our certification on the food stamp side because of some of
this. And I really can&#39;t speak to the policy intent behind this, but
the project would yield that, we would be able to tell you thatm with
some precision. Now, if you would, just bear with me just a second, if
we found it in our sample, this does not mean that every county in North
Carolina did those things. But we can find out the circumstances and
conditions where they did occur and why they occurred.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Further questions or comments? Seeing none, the motion before
the--I&#39;m sorry.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Mr. Chairman--
SPEAKER CHANGES
Mr. Bingham, I apologize.
SPEAKER CHANGES
--may I ask a question.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Yes sir.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Mr. Turcotte, just from--this is the first I&#39;ve heard of this, and
so just from observation it seems like this would be a tremendous
undertaking. And you are in--your feelings are that you&#39;ll have this
done when?
SPEAKER CHANGES
My feelings don&#39;t matter. Pardon me for being flippant, Mr.
Chairman, members. I&#39;ve assigned already a team to do this. Carol
Shaw, who has experience in that. In fact, Carol did a study of social
service public health departments not too long ago. She&#39;s looked at
the Medicaid structures across the country. She&#39;s an expert in
Health and Human Service policy. And Dr. Pam Taylor, who is our
methodologist, will also work on this, as will Dr. Brent Lucas. And who
am I missing? Oh yes, Jim Horne, who&#39;s a CPA. So we have an all-star
team on it. This--I wouldn&#39;t say it comes at a good time, because
there&#39;s never a good time for us, but we had anticipated some
high-priority project like this would come up during the session, and
we&#39;ve already planned for that. And it turns out our contingency
plan is working. So we can handle it, Mr. Chairman and Senator Bingham.
As I often tell you, unfortunately there&#39;s very few things that we
can&#39;t do that relate to audits and reviews and evaluations.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Follow up?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The question following this would be, if in
fact you do

  …find some rather severe discrepancies. What would you expect would be
your next plan to resolve this? I mean this could get into something, I
mean, it just appears to me. But I know you&#39;ve got an extremely
competent staff. I mean I certainly understand that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, if we encounter discrepancies or deficiencies,
we call those findings. And we will describe the condition for you,
where it exists, where we found it, under what circumstances. We also
give you our criteria. If we say there&#39;s discrepancies, I think we
owe you an explanation as to why it&#39;s a discrepancy, what standard,
what law, what procedure we&#39;re applying. Also we will tell you what
the significance of it is. That is, so what? So it happened. Is it
happening often enough, and is that happening across the state or across
the sample significantly so that you should really worry about it
seriously. And then the final part is a recommendation. That is, given
all of that, what would PED recommend? And when we get to the
recommendation phase, we always consult the agencies, stakeholders, and
this case, the county offices, and find out what the conditions were and
the circumstances, and if they have ideas about what to do about it,
we&#39;ll obtain those ideas, and they&#39;ll be reflected in the
recommendation. We also check clearinghouses, best practices, projects
like this that have been done in other states as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just wanted to thank you, Mr. Turcotte. That is very
helpful. You&#39;ve got a lot in front of you, but we appreciate it.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. I wanted to ask a question in
terms of, how will this relate to Medicaid reform, if at all? I know a
lot&#39;s going on in that area, too.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Excuse me, how would it related to Medicaid?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Medicaid reform.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m sure that in looking at ways
to change Medicaid, be it organizationally or if you go from the
provider-based fee-for-service arrangement to something else, I don’t
really don’t think it will affect that. But it certainly would give you
an idea of, since we have a state policy and then we have local
controlled administration of Medicaid, how would that play out in any
reform, if there is such a thing, reform. I don’t know what that means.
It depends on…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I might add as well, we need to know what might
require reforming.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah. It might enhance it or tell us what needs to be
reformed in that respect.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do know, Rep. Buttefield, other states have a
unified system, where the employees are all state employees, and in our
state, we use local social service employees to do it. So there could be
some variation among the counties. All of that, I think, would be
important.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One more question. Sen. Tarte.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, Mr. Chair, thank you. I just now have the motion
in front and we’re looking at it, it says, the evaluation points are
really going to be around effectiveness and efficiency, but given what
we&#39;ve been discussing, would it not be that maybe the most important
point is the ethicacy? If you could speak to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ethicacy in terms of the criteria upon which the
eligibility is made or?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, just clarification.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, are we doing it correctly and in the right way.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. We will do that. If there is a best
practice. And as I said to Sen. Bingham, whatever the basis of
comparison is, what the Bright Line standard is, we will look at the
procedures that are in place, and the findings that we have and compare
them to that. And at this point, I don&#39;t know what we&#39;re going
to find. But yes, sir. We certainly would do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No further…Rep. Dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a couple of quick things. One to partially answer
Rep. Farmer-Butterfield&#39;s question: They were state employees at one
time and then the decision was made a number of years ago to phase that
out and let them be county employees. It sort of took that financial
burden off the state. And I can&#39;t recall whether that was connected
at all with the change of taking the local match requirement for
Medicaid off or not. Or it may have been unrelated to that.

…And then the other thing is it’s my understanding that they are
supposed to have the backlog finish by the end of June I mean obviously
we will see that clearly they are making progress on that and hopefully
that will be case.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, to vote the motion and discussion all those in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Those oppose no, the ayes have it, and the next item on the agenda.
Members today we are considering the affects of a recent Supreme Court
decision, North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners versus a Federal
Trade Commission, we have a presentation by Council about this case and
another by PED on a very timely and recent, on the timely and recent PED
report on Occupational Licensing Board as you all may recall, we are
gonna review that so that things will freshen your mind. We also hear
from the Dental Board to State Bar and from other boards and citizens
requesting to speak about the case, we have some 10 folks signed up to
speak. Finally, we will also show a video of a presentation about this
case, it was made this past week to the Senate Program Evaluation
Committee by the distinguished former Dean of the UNC School of Law
Judith Welch Wegner. So with that we are gonna begin now, I’m gonna give
you one __[01:26], all of you that desire to speak on or not on the
committee, there is an old country phrase that goes, “The bind can only
grass but the??”, we are scheduled for three hours I don’t know about
you and that sounds like a whole lot longer than mine can bear. So I’m
gonna ask you in your presentations to do what you would normally do to
a legislator. A snappy beginning, a strong closing, and keep them really
close together. So with that we will first start with Karen
Cochrane-Brown from the Research Division to present the legal summation
of Supreme Court decision. Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair, with that beginning maybe I should just say are
there any questions? Well, as the Chair indicated that I’m Karen
Cochrane-Brown, I’m a Staff Attorney in the Research Division here, and
I have been asked to give a brief summary overview of the U.S Supreme
Court decision in the case of the North Carolina Dental Board against
the FTC. I will apologize to begin with to some of the Senate members
who heard a much better version of this presentation by Dean Wegner last
week but I hope to point out and focus on some issues that maybe a
particular interest to legislators so with that we can begin. So this
overview is basically gonna have an introduction, I’m gonna focus on
what this specific issue was before the court what they actually were
deciding, to give you a more detailed explanation of the background of
the case what the facts were, how it procedurally got to the Supreme
Court. A very, very brief overview of Federal Anti-Trust Law, an
explanation to the Courts holding and importantly I wanna point out some
of the things that the court did not say in this opinion which I think
are significant. And finally, I will be happy to answer any questions.
So some of you maybe wondering why I’m giving this presentation and
that’s really good question, I think the answer has to do with my role
as Council to the Joint Legislative Administrative Procedure Oversight
Committee which I have staffed since 1996 soon after it was created
along with Pro Chair Hartselle who is also the Co-Chair of APL and has
been on APL since its inception. And since 2009, APL has included within
its charge the over side of Occupational Licensing Boards and every year
APL receives annual reports from the licensing boards and frequently
gets lots of questions and issues raised about the operation of
licensing boards. In 2012, APL made a recommendation that was included
in 2013 regulatory reformat and that recommendation ask PED to conduct a
study of the structure operation of independent occupational licensing
boards and that study was performed and the report was issue this past
December and in few minutes you are gonna hear from Chuck Heffernan who
will go over there and report with you again but the point was that APL
has been looking at this issue of the oversize of occupational licensing
boards for number of years and this is not new and this…

  <p id="020:00">
  This case has bearing on that fact because the bottom line much of the
court&#39;s opinion had to do with the lack of oversight by the State of
this board. So, with that, the important thing to sort of keep in mind
is that the court wasn&#39;t just looking generally at the operation of
the board. The court was looking at a very specific issue and the
specific issue that they were asked to review was whether the North
Carolina dental board, whether their actions in restraining the
non-dentist teeth whiteners were protected from anti-trust regulation
under the doctrine of state-action immunity. In other words, the
question is, is the dental board exempt from from federal anti-trust
laws when taking action against non-dentist teeth whiteners because
it&#39;s a state agency? Just to go over the background of the case, and
this was very important to the court. The court spent a lot of time
talking about the specific facts in this case. Under GS 90-22, our
dental board is created and is composed of 8 members. 6 of them are
dentists, one is a dental hygienist, and one is a consumer.
Interestingly, the statute requires that the dentists and the hygienist
must be both licencees and actively practicing. So, a faculty member in
one of our dental schools could not be a member of our dental board. A
retiree from dentistry who had been licensed in our state could not be a
member of the board. You have to be actively practicing. In addition,
the members are elected by licencees in the state and the elections are
conducted by the board with no involvement or oversight by the state.
Another feature in our statute is that the consumer member is not
allowed to vote on the issuance, renewal, or revocation of a licence for
a dentist or a hygienist under our statute. Article 2 of chapter 9
basically creates a system in which the principle duty of the dental
board is to create, administer, and enforce a licensing system for
dentists. The factual background of this case is also very interesting.
You should keep in mind that the holding does not implicate all of the
actions of the dental board. Our dental board is authorized to do a
number of things and this holding doesn&#39;t affect all of their
activities. This was directed at a specific set of actions that they
took in the early 2000&#39;s. So the record that was before the court
revealed that in the 1990&#39;s, dentists in North Carolina began
providing teeth whitening services. Around 2003, non-dentists entered
the market and started offering these services at lower prices. The
record shows also that dentists in the state began to complain about
this to the board and most of those complaints centered around the fact
that the non-dentists were providing the services at a lower price. The
board then conducted an investigation that was headed by one of the
dentist members. The court then noted that neither the hygienist nor the
consumer member of the board participated in this investigation. In
2006, the board began sending out cease and desist letters and sent 47
of these letters to non-dentist teeth whiteners. The court also noted
that in some of the letters they claimed that even the sale or use of
teeth whitening products bought by non-dentists was a misdemeanor. The
board also contacted the cosmetic arts board since some of the people
providing these services were providing them in spas. They advised the
cosmetic arts board that they should warn their licencees not to offer
these services as this was the practice of dentistry. Finally, the
record shows that the board sent letters to mall operators, advising
them that they might want to rethink their leasing space to teeth
whiteners. These were often being provided by kiosks in malls. The board
attempted to stop the practice by doing that, as well. So the procedural
history of the case is that in 2010, the Federal Trade Commission, which
is the federal agency charged with enforcing the anti-trust laws filed a
complaint against the dental for violation of anti-trust laws.

  <p id="025:00">
  A hearing was held under the Federal Administrative Procedure Act,
before an administrative law judge. That Administrative Law judge issues
findings of facts and conclusions of law, and concluded that the board
unreasonably restrained trade, in violation of antitrust laws, in
connection with the teeth whiteners. The FTC approved the ALJ’s opinion,
and ordered the board to stop sending cease-and-desist letters.
Interestingly in the FTC order, they made it clear that they were in no
way suggesting that the board had to stop its appropriated activities,
that they were still able to in any way enforce the laws of North
Carolina against dentists as the law in North Carolina provides as long
as they were doing consistently with that. They also said they were not
enjoining or suggesting the board should not be able to send letters to
non-dentist teeth whiteners, advising them that it was the board’s
opinion that they were in violation of law, and that the board intended
if they did, to pursue injunctive relief against those teeth whiteners.
So the FTC was clear that they were not attempting to stop the board
from doing what they believe the law of North Carolina authorized the
board to do. I’m just going to very briefly go over a little of federal
antitrust law that’s involved in this case. I will not pretend that I
know anything more than a sort of broad overview of this area of the
law. But the two federal laws that were implicated in this case, Federal
Trade Commission Act, and the Sherman Act. As you can see, they
generally are laws that are intended to prohibit any practices or
activities that undermine the free market in our country. These laws
were enacted by Congress, pursuant to their authority under the Commerce
clause in the US Constitution. And significantly, in 1943, the Supreme
Court recognized that Congress’s authority in enacting these laws, did
not extend to preventing actions by states as sovereign entities. So the
case in which this was decided was Parker v. Brown, and in that case,
the court respected the principle of federalism generally, and they
stated that they recognized and would confer immunity on the
anti-competitive conduct of states, when those states are acting in
their sovereign capacity. So this is known as the State Action Immunity,
and this was the immunity the dental board claimed before the court. So
now to the Court’s holding. The first thing the Court found was that the
dental board was not the state for this purpose, that it was not clear
that the state had blanketed its sovereignty over the dental board for
this purpose. And interestingly, it did not say they were not a state
agency. In no part of the decision does the Court say that the dental
board is not an agency. It just says, for this purpose, for the purpose
of what they did with the teeth whiteners, they were not acting as the
state in that context. Next, the Court noted that for some non-sovereign
actors, it is possible for them to get state action immunity, if they
meet a test that was enunciated in another case. I’m not going to go
through that case, but basically the test that they Court had set out in
the other case for non-sovereign actors, is basically a two prong test,
and the first prong is that whatever the action is, the challenge
restraint must be clearly articulated, and firmly expressed as state
policy. It has to be very clear that the state authorized the actor to
do this. The second prong of the test is that the policy must be
actively supervised by the state. In applying the two pronged test, the
Court acknowledged the board statutory authority potentially could be
broadly read to a policy to prevent the authorized practice of law,
thereby maybe satisfying the first pronged test. However there was no
evidence and the board did not claim that the state had actively
supervised the board. So the Court said while it was clear that North
Carolina prohibits the unauthorized practice of dentistry, the dental
practice act is silent on whether that broad prohibition covers teeth
whitening. The Court also noted an interesting fact that might have
helped the dental board in this case, and that is that--

  <p id="030:00">
  The board could have adopted rules and our law under our law that
presumably is what the board should have done. If they were interpreting
teeth whitening as the practice of dentistry they could have adopted a
rule and that would have brought them under some state supervision.
Because under our rule making process in North Carolina any rule adopted
by the dental board would have had to go the rules review commission
which is an independent body that the members of which are appointed by
the legislature. That review independent of the board might have helped
show some supervision of this policy and some endorsement of this policy
by the state which the court found to be absent. So the dental board
argued in this case that entities designated as state agencies are not
required to be actively supervised by the state in order to receive
state action immunity. And clearly the court disagreed with this. The
board essentially was relying on another case that involved
municipalities. And in that case the court had held that municipalities
were sub-state entities that were only subject to the first part of the
test, that clear articulation prong of the test. And the court talked a
lot about the fact that municipalities sort of have the democratic
component that people actually have to re-elect the people that make
municipal decisions and support that and if they don&#39;t agree their
actions they can get rid of them. That&#39;s not the case with an
independent board like the dental board. The court also and I included a
couple of quotes from the court here. Significantly they said immunity
does not derive from nomenclature alone. So they clearly rejected the
boards argument that because the state had designated it as a state
agency that was sufficient for them to get the immunity. They said the
immunity doesn&#39;t rise from the nomenclature, when a state empowers a
group of active market participants to decide who can participate in the
market and on what terms the need for supervision is manifest. So the
board also argued in denying state action immunity the court would
discourage citizens on state agencies that regulate their occupation and
the potential for money damages would discourage them from participating
in state government. The court noted that this case did not involve
money damages. So that really wasn&#39;t relevant here. And the holding
does not address whether immunity form damages might be available in
another case. So that really wasn&#39;t the point, at issue in this
case. The court also acknowledged that the state can provide for the
defence in indemnification of agency members in the event of litigation.
In North Carolina in chapter ninety three B there is a provision that
authorizes occupational licensing boards to purchase liability insurance
for it&#39;s members. So that is in part covered by our law. So clearly
the reason the dental board was not entitled to the state action
immunity was because they lacked active supervision by the state. The
court declined to go into any detail about what was specifically
required to meet this test. But it did outline some elements of it. And
one is that the supervisor must review the substance of the
anti-competitive action. They basically want some method by which the
state policy makers have actual knowledge of what this non?? is doing
and that they endorse it. The supervisor must have the power to veto or
modify the action. So in the event in the case of rule making had the
board adopted a rule and the rules review commission found that they
lacked statutory authority to adopt that rule the rules review
commission essentially has that veto power a rule cannot go forward if
it&#39;s not approved by the rules review commission. So I think that
might have been the supervision the court might have envisioned. The
court also said the mere potential for the state supervision is not
enough. Clearly our law provided for the potential for supervision. They
could have adopted a rule that could have gotten some oversight by the
state. They could have sought injunctive relief which would also have
resulted in some oversight by the courts of the state. That wasn&#39;t
sufficient because the board obviously found a method to act without
using those means. Finally, the court says that the supervisor may not
be an active market participant.

  <p id="035:00">
  The court made a big point of the fact that in this case, even though
the, the eight, the board is a state agency it is composed entirely of
aftermarket participants who have an economic interest in the decision
that they made in this case, and that&#39;s what I think the court found
troubling. So the, the bottom line, sort of holding of the court is that
if the state wants to rely on aftermarket participants as regulators, it
must provide active supervision if state action immunity under Parker is
to be invoked. So there were three dissenters in the case. Justice Alito
wrote the opinion for the three dissenters, Justice Alito, Scalia, and
Thomas dissented. Their dissent seemed to be premised on thinking that
the board was relying mostly on the, on the composition of the board to,
to reach its decision. I&#39;m not sure that really was the case.
I&#39;m not sure they were focusing so much that the board was composed
entirely of market participants. I think they were more concerned that
there was not active state supervision of what the board did. But the
since basic premise is that under Parker, the anti trust laws do not
apply to state agencies. The dental board is a state agency, therefore,
end of story. The dissent said that the majority went way too far in
this and they should&#39;ve stop once they concluded that this was a
state agency. They also suggested that the majority&#39;s approach would
be difficult to apply because it&#39;s not clear who&#39;s a market
participant and how many are too many to be on the board.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I need to interrupt you for a second. Representative Dollar?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. I&#39;ve got to run out to another
unavoidable meeting. I apologize for that, but if I could just ask a
quick question and maybe this will be a quick answer, maybe not, but
just so I understand, because I had a moment to read the case the other
week. Would it be fair to say, generally fair to say that based on the
majority&#39;s opinion, either one of three things could potentially
happen that would bring teeth whitening under the purview of the dental
board assuming they wanted to pursue that in some way. One would be
taking a look at the composition of the board itself. The other thing
would be if they pursued the matter through the rules review commission
and established rules and therefore checked off the supervision piece of
it, or the third thing would be if the general assembly made a statutory
change with regard to who has jurisdiction over teeth whitening. So any
of those three would, would it be fair to say would likely satisfy the
court on the matter? Because it seemed to me that it was a fairly narrow
decision, just to get your comments on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I may, wouldn&#39;t there would be a fourth one you mentioned, if the
court should intervene. Okay. Please respond.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I hesitate to answer absolutely yes to the three or four
suggestions that you make because I don&#39;t think the court wanted to
say, just do this and that would satisfy it. I think any of those things
would have helped. I think the thing that would have helped most would
have been to come to the general assembly and include in the statute a
prohibition against teeth whitening as, as the practice of dentistry. In
that case it would have been clear that the board had legislative
authority to do this. I think that would have been the strongest
indication of state supervision in this case. Alternatively, I think
probably what the court thought they should have done was to use the
statutory release which is currently in the statute which is to seek
injunctive release. Had they gone to the court and sought injunctions
against the teeth whiteners, instead of sending the cease and desist
letters, which they did not have specific authority in the statute to
do, I think that would have, had been compelling to the court. But I
can&#39;t say with any certainty what the court would have required in
this case. But I agree with you. I think it&#39;s somewhat narrow in
terms of they looked at these facts and decided these case, the case
based on the facts of this case, and different facts might have yielded
a different result.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Please continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. So finally, I think it&#39;s important to think about what
the court did not say in this case

  <p id="040:00">
  And these are just some of the things that I&#39;d noticed the court did
not say and so that we don&#39;t sort of expand this opinion to maybe
meaning more than it actually does. The court did not say,
significantly, that the dental board was not a state agency for any
purpose. I think they would agree that for the purpose of licensing and
disciplining dentists, they clearly are a state agency and they clearly
have statutory authority to do that. The court did not say that the
state may not include aftermarket participants on occupational licensing
boards or other state agencies. The court spent some time talking about
the value of having the expertise of people with knowledge in the
industry involved in the decision making process. The court did not say
that the dental board would be subject to antitrust violation for
performing its clear statutory duties of issuing licenses and
disciplining licensees. The court did not say that the dental board is
powerless to take any action against non dentists as I just, in response
to Representative Dollar&#39;s question, I think that there were clear
things that the board could have done that more likely and most likely
would have fit within the expectation of the court, in this case. And
finally the court did not say what specifically constitutes active state
supervision. And with regard to this, it could be argued that North
Carolina law which requires agencies to adopt rules when they are
interpreting statute, and provides for independent review of those rules
by an agency appointed by the legislature may be exactly the kind of
supervision that the court envisioned in this case. In addition,
statutory authority given to the board in dealing with non dentists
requires that they seek injunctive relief. In this case, the dental
board chose not to use any of the powers available to it which would
have invoked some oversight by the state, and I think that was what the
court was responding to mostly in this case. Mister chair, I think
I&#39;ve stayed within the time you hoped, you asked me to stay within
and I would be very happy to try to answer any questions at this point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any questions from members of the committee? Seeing none, thank you very
much Ms. Brown. Appreciate that a lot. I think we can all see the far
reaching consequences of the action of the court decision in this case.
With that said, let&#39;s bring up Chuck Hefren to review the PED&#39;s
report on occupational licensing that we went over in December. Some of
us were here, some of us were not. Mr. Hefren.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good afternoon mister chairman and members. My name is Chuck Hefren.
I&#39;m the principal evaluator with the program evaluation division.
Today I&#39;m presenting you with the results of our evaluation of
occupational licensing agencies in which we concluded that they should
not be centralized, but stronger oversight is needed. My presentation
will take about fifteen minutes, after which I would be happy to answer
questions at the direction of the chair. You should have in your packets
a copy of the report, the slides for today&#39;s presentation, and three
handouts. As statutorially directed, the program evaluation division
performed an evaluation of the structure, organization, and operation of
the various occupational licensing agencies or OLAs as defined in
chapter 93B of North Carolina&#39;s general statutes. Based on the
statutory definition, the program evaluation division included 55 OLAs
in the evaluation. As identified on the blue handout, each of these OLAs
are fully independent state agencies which do not receive any state
general revenue or operate within legislatively established budget
constraints. In addition, the yellow handout lists the licensed
occupations that are regulated by state level agencies as reported to
the department of commerce. These 151 licensed occupations were not
included in the evaluations because they are not regulated by an
occupational licensing agency. The regulation of occupations is intended
to protect the public by offering some assurance that the

  Individual, is competent to provide certain services, and by providing a
means to discipline individuals who fail to comply with the occupational
standards. Occupational regulation can be achieved in several ways. The
determination of the most appropriate form of regulation is generally
based on the perceived threat to public health, safety, and welfare. As
shown in the exhibit, licensing is the most restrictive form of
regulation, because it requires permission from a state government
agency to be gainfully employed in the occupation. Licensure is most
often used when there is a high risk of harm to the public if the work
is performed by someone lacking the requisite competencies. The
regulation of licensed occupations is performed through the licensure
and enforcement functions. The licensure function establishes minimum
requirements for prospective licensees and continued licensure, and is
usually based on some combination of formal education, experience, and
an examination. The enforcement function helps insure compliance with
applicable laws, rules, and professional standards. All OLAs are
responsible for investigating alleged violations of both licensed and
unlicensed activity. OLAs reported that in fiscal year 2013-14,
disciplinary actions result in the revocation, suspension, or surrender
of 717 licenses, and the issuance of 701 injunctions and
cease-and-desist orders for violations of associated with unlicensed
activity. As shown in the exhibit, and specifically identified on the
green handout, 46 of the 55 OLAs are statutorily required to have more
than half of their board members licensed in the occupation which they
regulate. Concerns have been raised that the effectiveness of an OLA’s
regulatory activities may be compromised when the boards are controlled
by the professionals being regulated. OLA’s justified boards composed
primary of licensed members as being necessary to make competent
decisions regarding the qualifications of individual practitioners and
the validity of alleged violations. Our evaluation identified six
findings. The program evaluation division concluded that transferring
the regulatory authorities of administrative responsibilities OLAs to a
single state agency may not result in an improved performance and would
likely entail high implementation costs to realize potential gains in
efficiency. Finding two determined to provide adequation info the
monitor and evaluate OLA performance. The program evaluation division
identified three deficiencies in the current statutory requirements that
result in state level oversight. First, the regulatory ?? are subject to
statutory reporting requirements are not clearly defined and listed.
Second, these reporting requirements do not provide sufficient
information to monitor and evaluate performance. Third, there’s no
requirement to conduct external reviews to make sure the reported
information is accurate, and key regulatory activities are being
performed as designed. As a result, potential issues that may be
effecting public health safety and welfare may be left unattended. In
finding three, we reported that there is inadequate oversight to insure
the effectiveness of each OLA’s enforcement function. The enforcement
function includes a complaint process, which provides consumers and
other practitioners with the ability to identify potential violations of
applicable laws and regulations. The program evaluation division
identified three areas where--

  <p id="050:00">
  Original statutory requirements can help ensure the effectiveness of
each OLA&#39;s enforcement function. First, there is no established
information requirements and instructions for complaints submission.
Second, there is no requirement to notify a complainant of the final
determination. Finally, there are no uniform information retention
standards for the complaint process. The lack of uniform standards for
each OLA&#39;s complaint process increases the risk of public harm
because there are no assurances that violations can be readily reported
or whether complaints are being investigated and enforced as designed.
Finding four determined that establishment of an occupational licensing
commission can strengthen state level oversight while maintaining the
benefits associated with independent OLAs. An occupational licensing
commission would not function as a centralized licensing authority, but
could assist the general assembly and OLAs in improving the
effectiveness and resolving disputes. As shown in the exhibit, an
occupational licensing commission could help improve the performance of
OLAs in the following four areas. First, an occupational licensing
commission could help OLAs realize operating efficiencies by
facilitating the sharing of services. Second, an occupational licensing
commission can help improve oversight by collecting and maintaining the
necessary information to determine whether each OLA is effectively
protecting the public. Third, establishment of an occupational licensing
commission can help to ensure the effectiveness of the enforcement
function by assisting the public and OLAs in the determination of
jurisdictional authority for submitted complaints. And fourth, an
occupational licensing commission can serve to improve state level
oversight by helping  OLAs resolve scope of practice disputes. Finding
five reported that 12 OLAs did not provide sufficient information to
justify continued licensing authority. Occupational licensing protects
the public from harm by requiring that all practitioners meet the same
set of minimum standards. To meet our statutory requirement, our
assessment evaluated whether the threat of public harm justifies the
societal costs. We determined that licensing authorization should be
continued for 45, excuse me, 43 of the 55 OLAs. Based on the evidence
provided by the OLAs, our assessment also concluded that additional
review should be conducted as a condition of continued licensing
authorization for the other 12 OLAs. Finding six identified ten OLAs
that should be consolidated with another licensing entity. Our
evaluation assessed whether each OLA had the necessary resources to
effectively regulate a licensed occupation. For OLAs with insufficient
financial resources, consolidation with another licensing entity in the
same industry provides the opportunity to limit the administrative
burden on licensees and improve the effectiveness in protecting the
public from harm. For example, many OLAs reported that they did not have
an online complaint intake capability because they lacked the necessary
resources to invest in the appropriate IT upgrades. Other OLAs reported
that due to insufficient staffing, board members are currently utilized
to investigate complaints. Consolidation may allow for the utilization
of staff with specific expertise required to more effectively perform
this process. Based on these findings, we have six recommendations.
Recommendation one, to provide greater transparency and

  <p id="055:00">
  And improve the overall effectiveness of the OLAs, the general assembly
should establish an occupational licensing commission. The occupational
licensing commission should not function as a centralized licensing
authority, but should be responsible for assisting the general assembly
and OLAs to more cost effectively protect the public. The commission
should be task is the single repository of the financial and performance
information necessary to evaluate OLA effectiveness. The commission
should also be responsible for providing non binding mediation services
to address scope of practice disputes and to provide the general
assembly with an annual report which identifies issues that may warrant
their consideration. We recommend that the occupational licensing
commission be administatively housed in a department of commerce and
staffed, with staffing and operations funded from OLA receipts.
Recommendation two is for the general assembly to consider amending
state law to more clearly define and list the licensing entities that
are subject to statutory reporting requirements. Recommendation three is
to amend state law to include OLA complaint processing requirements.
Recommendation four is for the general assembly to consider amending
state law to require that each OLA contract for periodic performance
audits. The program evaluation division also recommends that the general
assembly conduct a review of the 12 identified OLAs to determine if
continued licensing authority is warranted. Finally, the program
evaluation division recommends that the operations of ten occupational
licensing agencies be consolidated with another licensing entity. To
assist the general assembly subsequent to the release of the report, we
accepted written responses to the findings and recommendations from each
of the OLAs. Each of their responses combined in a single document is
available on our website. At the January 21 meeting of the joint program
evaluation oversight committee meeting, committee referred a report to
the joint administrative procedure oversight committee and to the
standing committees with jurisdiction for consideration. Mister
chairman, I am now available to take questions at your direction.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Heffernan. Questions from the committee?
Senator Pate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chair. Mr. Heffernan, if we establish a facility for
providing some guidance to these different boards that you&#39;re
talking about, the 12, could that not be viewed as another layer of
administration instead of an assist to the boards that we want to help?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We recommend establishment of an occupational licensing commission. The
funding would be, we estimate the funding would be less than 1% of their
receipts and would help them improve the efficiencies for many boards
would result in increase, more reduction in costs than an annual charge.
An occupational licensing commission can also facilitate scope of
practice disputes without unnecessary legislative or judicial
involvement and finally an occupational licensing commission can reduce
the administrative burden on occupational licensing commissions because
it would provide a single repository for them to provide the necessary
performance and financial information for the general assembly and other
stakeholders to evaluate whether they are effectively protecting the
public&#39;s health, safety, and welfare.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions? Representative Hurley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chair. Can you tell us about the ten that might be
consolidated?

  Yes, the ten occupational licensing agencies that we identified for
consolidation, they can be found, they&#39;re identified in Appendix B
of our report, and the criteria we used is we basically looked at what
we thought they had the financial wherewithal to effectively regulate
the occupation. So we used two metrics to make that determination. The
first is we looked at the annual revenues generated by the occupational
licensing agencies, and the second criteria we used is we looked at
whether they had sufficient resources as measured by the ratio of net
assets to expenditures to determine whether they had sufficient
resources to invest in necessary equipment upgrades to effectively
provide the services needed to regulate the occupation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bingham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. On the mediation of scope of practice, what
was your, how did you intend on recruiting, or what was your ideas about
being, who you would choose as a team to make those kind of decisions,
because I know this will get into very, very technical and expertise, et
cetera, especially in this mediation. What was your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, what we recommend is the occupational licensing commission would
be responsible for developing that process. How they go about developing
that process would be left up to their expertise and consideration. A
viable alternative, I think, would be to contract for a qualified
mediator in these services to perform that service.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Farmer-Butterfield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chair. I noticed in here that you had something about
the Texas system and how they&#39;re doing it. Can you explain that a
little bit?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In developing our concept for an occupational licensing commission, we
utilized two sources. The first was a, the Texas health professions
council which has been in effect since 1993, and they are, essentially
have the same authority as what we envision for an occupational
licensing commission. Based on their annual reports, they advertise that
they have more than, that their contribution to improvements and
efficiency have more than made up for the cost, and they identify
sharing of services for IT, developed, mutual development of some risk
management practices, relating, say, worker&#39;s compensation and, and
unemployment insurance, et cetera. And development and mutual, and
sharing of training services. We also used a report that was conducted
by the PEW foundation in 1998, and they recommend, this is an
alternative, to ensure that these independent occupational licensing
commissions have adequate oversight to ensure that they are effectively
protecting the public.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further questions? Senator Tarte?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, thank you mister chair. One question if you could maybe give us a
little bit of insight to. How do we, either through the consolidation of
the licensing boards, and or the commission provide the right level of
subject matter expertise to, and avoid the self interest of the
hierarchy of the groups? And as an example, maybe ophthalmologists,
opticians, and then, or ophthalmologists and then opticians. If you roll
it up, the higher group is always going to lean towards supervising or
minimizing scope of service for the lower skilled set.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I hope I&#39;m, I, first of all, the occupational licensing
commission, we have some guidance in its composition to try to ensure
that its primary, it&#39;s controlled by public members, but it has some
level of participation by members of licensed occupations to ensure the
necessary expertise is available for them to make decisions. Again, the
decision on elimination of licensing authority for a given occupation
should be occupation specific

  specific. And it should be focused on whether the threat to public
health safety and welfare justifies the increased cost to society. Those
increased costs are associated with studies have shown the cost to
services increases by about fifteen percent when you have licensed
occupations. It limits a persons ability to work in a given occupation.
It restricts mobility and in some instances limits the level of
innovation in a given occupation. So again using that criteria we
envision that the occupational licensing agency would basically provide
the staffing services to the designated subcommittee so they can make an
informed decision.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
See no further questions. Mr. Hilpern thank you very much for your
presentation. We are now going to recognize Bobby White chief operating
officer of the North Carolina board of dental examiners to explain the
effect of that court decision and potential actions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. I guess I&#39;m here
to answer the question that&#39;s on everyone&#39;s mind. What in the
world were you guys thinkin? And so I&#39;ll attempt to do that and in
order to do that I think that we  first need to give a little overview
of what the FTC order itself is. I&#39;m going to talk about three
things today. The order that the supreme court affirmed that is the
order that came out of the trial that we are ordered now it&#39;s
enforced against us. The dental boards response to that and what we
think we need to do going forward. First of all it&#39;s important to
note the things we can still do. The order from the FTC does not
prohibit the board from investigating teeth whitening. It does not
prevent us form filing a court order to seek injunction against teeth
whitening kiosk operations where we find them. It does not prevent us
from turning evidence over to law enforcement if we think a criminal
action is involved or cooperating with law enforcement. It does not
prevent us from pursing administrative remedies. It does not prevent us
from giving notice of intent of doing any of these things. And it does
not prevent us from sending letters to operators of whitening businesses
to say our opinion they are violating the dental practice act. What we
cannot do is prohibit, impede, restrict or discourage the provision of
teeth whitening services or ordering a teeth whitening provider to
cease. And we cannot communicate that to a third party in any way
either. So, after all this is said and done after an eight year battle
within the FTC realm. The difference comes down to the fact that we can
send a letter saying in our opinion we think your violating state law
and we&#39;re going to sue you. But we cannot send the letter that says
in our opinion we think your violating state law and we think you should
cease. In essence that becomes the difference. One of the things
that&#39;s interesting about going to the FTC is that the facts that you
go in with and the facts that you come out with are two very different
things. Early on in the proceedings the FTC ruled the board was not a
state agency therefore not immunized by the sate action doctrine. And
thus, here&#39;s one of the things that&#39;s surprising this is from
the very holding of the FTC itself. Thus whether non-dentist teeth
whitening constitutes the removal of stains, accretions, and deposits
from human teeth and thereby constitutes the illegal practice of
dentistry is not and will not be addressed. So at the basic level the
FTC never rules whether or not teeth whitening as it&#39;s practiced in
malls and kiosks violates North Carolina state law. It also rules that
the North Carolina state board is prohibited from using public
protection as a means of defending itself in this arena. It says the
specifically respondent boards enforcement of the dental practice act
was necessitated by serious and well know dangers of unsupervised teeth
whitening. However it&#39;s well established that a restraint on
competition cannot be justified on the basis of social welfare concerns.
So early on in the hearings with the board three things the board had,
we thought were just kind of rock bottom principles for us. One that the
board is a state agency and that we have a clearly authorized statute
that creates us. Secondly that we have a clearly articulated statute
that the board has been asked to enforce and that statute says that
removal

  <p id="070:00">
  Stains, deposits, accretions for human teeth is the practice of
dentistry. We were not allowed to argue that, we didn’t even reach that
point. And thirdly, the board went into all of this because of public
protection. While it is true that a lot of our complaints came from
dentists and dental hygienists, a number of them came from the public,
and a number of them came from the public who were harmed by these
practices. But we were never allowed to even consider or produce
evidence with regard to public protection. So the board that’s under
this order, from the FTC, that we must report all activities with regard
to any actions we take with tooth whitening between now and December 11,
2031. So we have begun that process. Now it’s worthy to note, people
have said a lot about these cease and desist letters that we send. Of
course that’s a vehicle that a lot of boards have used down through the
ages. We did send these cease and desist letters, but early on in the
process, when it became apparent to our staff, and to our legal counsel,
that these letters were a problem for the FTC. We changed the letters
completely, and we said, well we will change the letter to make it
absolutely certain that this is not an order, it’s not something that
the board is practicing, or planning on enforcing that you have other
rights and obligations. We went ahead and redesigned the letter, showed
the FTC, “look if the letter’s a problem, then we’re going to stop,
we’re going to send the letter that comports with what you think we
should do.” The FTC said, “well that wonderful, but that won’t work”. We
said, “What do you mean? You said there’s a problem, so we fixed the
problem.” They said, “You fixed the problem, but you have to consent.
You have to consent to the jurisdiction definition of the Federal Trade
Commission. That’s the thing we really want you to do. So you go back
and take this case with a lot of waste where the FTC never even reaches
the idea of teeth whitening is being a practice of dentistry, as defined
by statuted NC, and a potential harm or real harm to the public. And the
fact that we’re not able to present any evidence on that, and the fact
that we changed our policies and our letters to comply with the FTC, but
they said that’s not good enough, you’ve got to consent to the
jurisdiction of the federal government over you in this matter. We did
not think we had the ability or authority to do that kind of consent on
behalf of the state of NC people. Our board members took an oath, they
took it very seriously to uphold the laws of North Carolina. We
considered ourselves a state agency, and for purposes that Ms.
Cochrane-Brown said we still remained a state agency and the FTC
concedes that we are. But we did not think that we could, in fact,
abandon our duty to protect the public in the face of a clearly
articulated statute and say that this board and perhaps all other boards
were under the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission. So that is
when the fireworks started. Once we said that we could not consent to
the FTC’s jurisdiction, that’s the whole administrative lawsuit and
everything else began to come our way. There is in your packet, a press
release that the board approved and sent out after we found the outcome
in the case. Won’t bore you with reading that, but I’ll call it to your
attention, and we believe this as a matter of fact, as a legal matter,
the board entered this case believing that federal antitrust laws were
not intended to second-guess how states structure their boards that are
occupational licensing boards, and as a factual matter, the board has
always considered this to be a matter of public health, but public
health concerns are not allowed to be expressed by the federal trade
commission, and so they were rejected, and so was the board’s evidence
of public harm, real public harm and potential public harm. We’re not
alone in our belief that this is case, if you go to the briefs that were
filed in this case, the Attorneys General of 23 states, the National
Governor’s Association, the National Conference of State Legislators,
the Council of State Government, plus 16 other groups cited and believe
the board had a very valid case. So we weren’t out there tilting at
windmills on our own. We had lots of company with us. But this is a
novel theory that the FTC had been trying to get into the courts for
some time. The winds blew perfectly, it was a perfect storm with what
was going on in North Carolina, and so we decided that it would, rather
than consent to the FTC’s jurisdiction, we simply felt that they would
have to prove in a Court of Law, and of course now, on this side of the
Supreme Court, holding we know that to be the case. But as we go
forward, Ms. Cochrane-Brown--

  We’ve already stated a number of things the board plans to do.  One is,
of course, that we will more frequently consider the rule-making process
when the board interprets the statute.  The board relied on its
expertise in light of the statute.  The statute says if you remove
stains, secretions, deposits from human teeth, you are practicing
dentistry in NC.  That seems almost intuitive.  It seems like common
sense, but we’re not going to make that assumption anymore.  We will
simply goes to the rules review commission when the board is
interpreting statutes to make sure that we have, in fact, presented our
interpretation to a third party, the state supervisory board, in one way
so that we can make sure we’re doing the right thing.
The other thing that we’re going to do is we will no longer send a cease
and desist letter, you can count on that.  That will not be happening.
Instead, the board will apply for injunctive relief with courts and of
course, this may lead to more litigation, but in fact, the courts do
provide, we think, the supervision that’s anticipated by the federal
trade commission in its holding.
One of the things that bothers our board and Dr. Stanley Allen, if I may
introduce him, he’s the president of our board.  Dr. Allen, if you’d
raise your hand, please.  Dr. Allen is president of the board.  He
practices dentistry in Greensboro, NC.
And one of the things that is problematic to our board is the fact that
this has been cast by the FTC as an economic interest case.  Our board
members all came to the board because they were interested in public
service.  And if those of you who are elected members, if you’ve ever
thought about a situation or know one of your colleagues, that you come
here, you put your life out on the line to help people, to help the
people of NC...and then your motives are twisted and next thing you
know, in the papers or in the media somewhere they’re accusing you of
some motivation that was not your own.  That’s certainly
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That doesn’t happen, does it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m thinking that it does, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sorry to interrupt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But no, I think that elected officials can really relate the board at
this point.  We never had any indication, we never had any economic
interest in this case whatsoever.  As a matter of fact, we were
encouraging teeth whitening people who were asking, we’d say look, go
down to the legislature and get an exemption.  Get them to say tooth
whitening is not the practice of dentistry; we would be happy for you to
practice teeth whitening so long as we knew it was not in violation of
state law, but if the board took that oath and also, like I said, at the
very almost gut level, they did so for public protection.
And yet their motives have been misconstrued so that they are now seen
as being only economically interested in these kind of things.  This
puts board members at a psychological quandary because they come to our
board trying to help and to enforce state law to help the citizens and
public of NC, and get accused of other kinds of motives, which really
lessens the interest that people have and may have in serving on these
boards.
And that’s one of the chief outcomes of this case that I think our board
at a very visceral level with what this committee knows about.  Does
that answer any questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I thank you, Mr. White.  Any questions from the members of the
committee?  Seeing none, Mr. White, I appreciate your time.  Next up is
Mark Merritt, Vice President of NC State Bar Association.  Mr. Merritt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good afternoon, thank you Mr. Chairman.  I am Mark Merritt.  I am vice
president of the NC State Bar and for my regular job, I’m an anti trust
lawyer in Charlotte with Robinson, Bradshaw and Hinson.  I know a lot
about the dental board case because my firm, on behalf of the state bar
and some other state bars, filed an amicus brief in support of the
dental board’s position before the US Supreme Court, so our viewpoint is
that the Supreme Court got it wrong.
So what brings us here today is the fact that like the dental board, we
have to deal with this new decision from the United States Supreme
Court.

  <p id="080:00">
  So what is the state bar? The state bar is charged by statute with
regulating the legal profession, and in doing so, we focus on protecting
the public. If you look at the regulatory function of the state bar, it
falls into three major categories. We administer discipline through our
grievance committee for those lawyers who violate the rules of
professional conduct. We provide ethical guidance to attorneys through
our ethics committee, and we’re statutorily charged with preventing the
unauthorized practice of law. We have the right under statute to sue
people who are involved in the unauthorized practice of law, to enjoin
the unauthorized practice of law. We do this, like the dental board,
through volunteers, lawyers who volunteer their time, who are elected by
the peers, from districts around the state. So our structure in terms of
regulation, would be by what the Supreme Court would consider to be
market participance, so we share that characteristic. We do our work
through committees. The ethics committee, which deals with rules,
ethics, they promulgate the rules that govern the conduct for lawyers,
and give advice for how to meet those rules. The grievance committee
which evaluates claims misconduct against lawyers, and ultimately
prosecutes claims for disbarment and suspension before the disciplinary
hearing commission. And then finally, the unauthorized practice of law
committee, which investigates claims of the unauthorized practice of
law, and is statutorily allowed to sue people who are practicing law
without a license. The state bar meets four times a year. We donate our
time, we take our role very seriously, and a role, like those of the
dental board, is to protect the public. How is the state bar different?
We’re not really an OLA, because we don’t issue any licenses, and even
though we are created by statute, we are functionally part of the
judicial branch, and we’re accountable to the North Carolina Supreme
Court. The Supreme Court reviews all of the rules and regulations of the
state bar, and has the right to approve or disapprove of those
regulation. So we have active state supervision by our Supreme Court, as
part of our judicial function, which is really not typical of a lot of
the other agencies who may speak to you today. We also share our
jurisdiction with every judge in the state of North Carolina. Judges
have the ability both in state and federal court to regulate the conduct
of the attorneys who appear in their court. Our ability to regulate
lawyers has always been a shared function with the judiciary. The state
bar does not issue any license, nor do we determine the initial fitness
of lawyers to practice law. The board of law examiners handles that
function. However, once someone becomes an attorney, we do regulate
their conduct. So we’ve been talking about state action immunity and I’m
not going to spend a lot of time on this because it’s already been
covered by the prior speakers, but it’s essentially what courts held
prior to the dental board case, that if you’re a state actor, if you
acting pursuant to statutory authority, to displace competition or
monopoly, that was immune from the federal antitrust laws, it was based
on principles of federalism, that if the state was acting, it wasn’t
something that fell within Sherman act. The thing I want to emphasize
here is that the issue of state action immunity is a defense to the
antitrust laws. I’m an antitrust lawyer, there are a lot of defenses to
the antitrust law. This is a single defense that’s available to a state
agency, and I think the fact that a single defense is now unavailable
doesn’t mean every time and agency is acting without state supervision,
that somehow what it does becomes a violation of the antitrust laws. To
the contrary, I think most state agencies act in close conformance with
their statutory mandates. It’ll be a rare case where they violate the
antitrust laws. There are a number of ways to manage antitrust risk,
apart from the state action immunity, some of which I’ll speak about in
just a minute. So what the dental board case requires, we’ve already
touched on, is that statutory authorization to displace competition with
regulation or monopoly. And then we have for State agencies controlled
by market participance, that there be this meaningful level of active
state supervision, where the deficient decisions are subject to
supervision by some state supervisor that’s not an active market
participant, and they can veto that decision. What’s troubling about the
dental board case is that the Supreme Court didn’t pay any deference
to--

  <p id="085:00">
  The state agency&#39;s definition of its authority. The supreme court
concludes essentially that teeth whitening isn&#39;t the practice of
dentistry, even though the statute in North Carolina said that the
removal of stains, accretions, or deposits from human teeth is the
practice of dentistry. I think what this tells you as legislators is
that when you define an area of professional regulation, you have to
really define it with specificity, because certainly in this case, the
supreme court read the dental board&#39;s authority in a way that was
incredibly narrow and that I personally can&#39;t square with the
statute. I don&#39;t know how teeth whitening does not fall within the
removal of stains, accretions, or deposits from the human teeth. And if
you go back and read the opinion, you won&#39;t see that language quoted
by the majority in their case. They just sort of gloss over that fact.
The courts and the FTC were troubled by the fact that the dental board
sent out cease and desist letters without the statutory authorization to
do so, and so you have the situation where it&#39;s fine to go sue
somebody, but you can&#39;t tell them that you&#39;re gonna sue them and
you really mean it. So that&#39;s one of the distinctions, and I would
urge legislators, if you want state agencies to have the authority to
send cease and desist letters, that you just give that authority
explicitly. For example, the state bar, we have the authority to do that
by virtue of our regulations that have been approved by the supreme
court. The supreme court is a sovereign actor under the state action
immunity doctrine, so that&#39;s an authority we have, but we&#39;d like
to have it put in our statute. The FTC and the courts were also troubled
by evidence that the dental board was motivated by economic self
interest and not by protecting the public health, and finally, the FTC
and the courts were troubled by what they viewed as a lack of
investigation into consumer harm and the lack of reliance on rule making
before the dental board took enforcement action by sending the cease and
desist letters. So what can you do as legislators? The first critical
step is to clearly define those areas in which a state agency or
licensing board has the authority to displace competition with
regulation. The level of specificity the supreme court seems to require
is quite high. For governing statutes for a state agency, we need to
spell out the enforcement authorities with greater particularity and if
the general assembly concludes that we want our state agencies to have
the ability to send out cease and desist letters as well as to file
lawsuits, I think you need to do that with specificity. How about the
state bar? Where do we look at our statutory authorities and have areas
where we may see particular need in order to avail ourselves of state
action immunity and the, the really pretty narrow areas where it may
come into play? As we know, the definition of the practice of law, we
believe it&#39;s now about 80 years old. That was before there was an
internet, and one of the areas where the state bar would like to have
legislative clarity is to deal with what we call internet service
providers of legal documentation. The rocket lawyers, the legal zooms of
the world. The state bar has never contended that providing forms on the
internet or even providing scrivener services constitutes the practice
of law. When we look at the statutes that authorize us and that define
the practice of law, we believe that when you answer questions in a
certain way online, and that as a result of that, serious legal
decisions are made for the person answering the questions that
constitutes giving legal advice, and it&#39;s the practice of law. And
we believe that we should have the ability to regulate, but we would ask
that our authority in that regard be more clearly spelled out. With
respect to active state supervision and the state bar, I struggle with
what active state supervision means, because the dental board
articulated what it means in different ways. I note on this slide three
different places in the supreme court&#39;s opinion where it talks about
active state supervision, and they&#39;re not entirely consistent. There
are times, it seems, that the active state supervision needs to be sort
of flexible and context specific, and then there are other times where
it seems that the supreme court envisions something a little bit more
granular, and this is just an issue we&#39;re gonna have to struggle
with as we have cases interpreting the dental board case. But it

I appreciate your patience and your participation, I’m gonna call Mr.
Steve Stroud from the Locksmith Licensing Board first person to present.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Sir, thank you Mr. Chairman, I had 10 minutes and I got files…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Real quick, I’m Steve Stroud, I’m the current Chairman of the Locksmith
Licensing Board and I’m also Owner and President of Tarheel Safe &amp;
Lock Company in China Grove, North Carolina. I have been a locksmith for
about 30 years now. Quickly, our board is consisted of nine members,
three appointed by the Senate Pro Tempore, three appointed by the
Speaker, and three by the Governor. Six of those nine are licensed
locksmiths, we feel very strongly as the loggers do that we are best
equipped to monitor our profession. One thing I want to mention is when
I say I’m a locksmith most of you are gonna think about yourself or a
family member that had a key locked in a car that is the old time
locksmith who came out with a modified code hanger over your car and all
that kind of stuff, it’s going way beyond that I don’t even touch a car,
I do corporate work mostly, grocery store chains and another things,
mostly commercial work, but it goes down to, “Do you want someone come
into your house to make a re-key your house, the security of our family
does not licensed or your business or whatever the case maybe?” Now, we
are in the access control it’s gotten the whole lot more professional
that it used to be that you go to bicycle shop coming out working on the
chain and door bell. We feel again that we are the professionals that
need to be oversee and the others like us, we do supervision, we do have
Attorney General staff members meets with us and in every meeting we
have a face-to-face or we do some phone call meetings. He’s always on
the phone with his loggers speak and keeping us in line. So I think we
have proper supervision, on PD study I think it hit us on the down
cycle, we have a three year license, every three years we renew so that
means to bulk of the licensed locksmiths are renew in every three years,
they call us on the second, into the second year, we didn’t have as much
many as we like, we didn’t have allow that really gave us the authority
to do what we want to do to regulate these issues. We thank to your
friend Stam Bingham with some proposals he brought through the last
year, they took effect this passed October. So now, we got some laws
that just took effect that we feel that we can better regulate our group
as far as scammers that’s the problem throughout North Carolina but it’s
also a problem throughout the United States. If you go out on your phone
sometime when you didn’t got anything to do I know it’s not during the
day but tonight before you go to bed Google a locksmith when you are at
home or wherever you are at, you will come up with a lot of $15 service
calls and guarantee you if you call them you will spend a lot more than
$15 by the time they get done, that’s one of the things that we are
having a big issue with right now, these companies coming in and
advertising $15 service call and by the time they get done its $400. And
one of our weaknesses about the enforcement most of our…We can enforce
own licensed people, we cannot enforce unlicensed, we don’t have the
statuary authority, we have to refer that to local law enforcement, one
of our big push is right now is educating local law enforcement that
they are actually is a law besides Chapter 20 and Chapter 14 that they
can enforce to stop somebody.

Hill from the interpreters and translators transliteraters licensing
board. Hello Alita.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hello. Good afternoon Chairman Heartso, Chairman Horn, members of the
committee. Thank you for the opportunity to address you today. My name
is Alita Hill and I am an American sign language and toe fitting
practitioner. Fully licensed in both North Carolina and Arizona. I
currently reside in the represented district 104 and senate district 39.
My thirty years of experience as a nationally certified professional
sign language interpreter has included interpreting for the president
and the first lady of the United States. Presidents of student
government organizations, iconic stars on Broadway and Shakespeare
productions, deaf students in high school plays, international
conferences, parent teacher conferences, medical continuing education
classes for deaf physicians, pre-school classes for energetic four year
olds, court ordered psychological competency evaluations and patient
doctor consultations evaluating stage four cancer treatment options. I
have represented colleagues specializing in legal court interpreting
settings in another state doing their licensing rule making process. I
stand before you today in support of the program the evaluation
divisions recommendation. To establish an occupation licensing
commission. With oversight authority over occupational licensing
entities like the North Carolina interpreters transliteraters and
licensing board one of the twelve. Licensing for sign language
interpreters and transliteraters is a crucial mechanism for ensuring
public safety. Over thirty states have or are in process of establishing
interpreter licensing boards. In 2003 the North Carolina legislature
appropriately established one here probably making North Carolina one of
the first states in the nation to do so. It is important that
interpreting services are provided by persons who have attained a
minimum standard of competency so that deaf consumers and the broader
public are protected from those who are unskilled and unqualified. The
Americans with disabilities act the ADA a very significant piece of
federal legislation denotes the right of deaf persons to have
communication access provided via the services of a qualified
interpreter yet the ADA lacks a refined definition of the term
qualified. With license ensured the licensing board helps to more
explicitly define qualified interpreter and thus adding protection for
this vulnerable population and businesses and entities providing the
services. When interpreting services are provided by unskilled
practitioners or relatives of deaf patients for example in
rehabilitation centers or hospitals the consequences frequently are
negative and harmful resulting in severe compromise of health outcomes
for the patient. One example I&#39;ll site, in Florida a deaf patients
son was asked to facilitate communication during discharge. This after
the patient was repeatedly denied his request of a qualified interpreter
during his entire hospital stay. After litigation this patient received
monetary compensation for harmful experiences citing terror,
frustration, emotional anguish while receiving medical treatment without
understanding of much of what was going on. In the state of Florida at
the time there was no state interpreter licensing board to establish
minimum competencies however the Florida licenser is currently looking
at a current bill. The North Carolina interpreter transliterater
licensing board certainly needs oversight so that it performs it&#39;s
duty to ensure that safe interpreting and transliterater services are
provided to the state. To full fill this obligation a board must operate
and perform effectively however this twelve year old board is
ineffective in that it seemingly has no bi laws and lacks basic
understanding of parliamentary  procedure. It has made it easier for
unskilled under qualified
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

persons to provide interpreter services. They have ignored legal
counsels advice to solicit public comment from stakeholders in the deaf
community as well as interpreters and there are others. I just want to
wrap up because I only have a minute. There is

  Currently, Iowa board of interpreters. There is an example where a high
school student petitioned the board. I don’t know the merits of the
case, per se, but the petition was heard, and a decision was rendered
and for a board to effectively promote itself in a way that even a high
school student can access it means that it is possible to have a
functioning performing interpreting board. In closing, the world
witnessed a multi-faceted multi-layered breakdown in safety and security

service in South Africa. Presidents past and present, global business

their presentation. Members of the audience, other members can pick
those up if they would like. Moving on, Becky Garritt, from the board of
recreational therapy licensure. Becky, you’re welcome to speak from back
there if you’d rather.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Thank you for allowing me to have a few
comments today. I’ve presented a view on writings, so I won’t go over
that again, but we’re one of the twelve boards that was identified for
possibly more oversights, so I wanted to talk a little bit about that.
The year that we were reviewed in 2013 was a very unique year for us, so
we wanted to give an honest look at who we are, because that year was a
little different for us. We’re not a typical service in healthcare and
we’re not in private practice, so we’re covered service and often get
blanket, standing orders from physicians, so therefore we did our
complaint services a little different because all our complaints usually
come through our HR departments, through hospitals, and agencies where
we’re employed, so not the general public, so I understand from Mr.
Heffernan that is something that needs to be standardized and we have
done that and will be included on our website to take complaints from
the public, so we hope we have addressed that. To the recommendation to
return us to a certification board, we think would only allow for
increased violations, certification board for many years, and what
happened with that was the state personnel and all other agencies just
merely changed the job title. They were call rehabilitation therapists,
or recreators, and they hired high-school degree people, and we
constantly got complaints and reports of patient abuse and misuse of
that and we did nothing, and could do nothing, because it wasn’t that
they were using the title. So to return back to that would be a real
disservice to the public, and an increase of violations. Recreational
therapy practices frequently with high risk types of activates and
intervention that we use, aquatic therapy, horseback riding, sports,
that allows for a lot of injuries. So if you have a person who was not
trained adequately in those services, you could only see the possibility
of risk being increased even higher. In answer to some of the questions
had to today in terms of the composition of our board, we are appointed
from the Governor, the Speaker of the House, the president Pro Temp.
We’re an eight member board. Two are practicing licensed recreation
therapist, one recreational therapy assistant, a public member, we have
a consumer of recreation therapist member, and a physician, so we have
covered our board in a well-rounded way, and not being just practitioner
and market representative. The bureau of laborers says that rec therapy
is growing by 10-12%. Here in North Carolina, we’re experiencing about
15% annually. For growth, we have nine educational programs, college
programs in North Carolina. North Carolina is the leader in rec therapy
nationwide, so we have most of the schools putting caps on their
attendance, because we have a lot of out-of-state people coming to North
Carolina. Just for the fact that, one, we have licensure, and two, we
have so many good reputations for colleges and universities, so we
certainly see it would be a backstep to return to certification. That’s
all I have. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate that a lot

  Trainer examiners. (SPEAKER CHANGES)
Mr. Chairman and members of the committee my name is Ann Christian I
serve as legal counsel to the North Carolina Board of athletic trainer
examiners. The board wishes to recognize the program evaluation
division&#39;s demonstrated commitment to the tremendous task of
studying many hundreds of governing agencies. It&#39;s important today
to remember that when the P.E.D. began it&#39;s task no clear statutory
list existed defined or setting out the entities that would be the
subject of study, once we appreciate the fact that the P.E.D. first
identified a specific set of 55 independent occupational licensing
boards or agencies for study it then needed to draw upon a comprehension
of all that these O.L.A.&#39;s do and why they exist. This involved
learning their history in purpose, understanding the nature of each
occupation, analyzing each budget, reviewing the membership,
understanding the operation, recognizing the complexity of each
board&#39;s role in North Carolina&#39;s commitment to ensure standards
of competence for providing services and protection of the public from
harm. Finally, the P.E.D. was called on to judge, to categorize, and to
recommend the need to extinguish some boards and to consolidate other
specific boards. The Board of Athletic Trainer Examiners was recommended
to be consolidated with an unnamed other regulating entity. The
N.C.B.A.T.E. received this recommendation with appreciation and concern.
First of all, the board was grateful for the P.E.D.&#39;s endorsement of
the board&#39;s purpose, for it recognized the licensure of the
occupation should continue, and therefore the board does not require to
quote the P.E.D. report further legislative review in order to ensure
there&#39;s a need for licensure. The P.E.D. gets it, many parents have
thought twice about letting their children participate in sport,
allowing them to be tossed high in the air chancing a neck-breaking
landing resulting in spinal core injuries or they have been particularly
worried about their sons playing football with good reason. The sport
comes with risk, most dramatically demonstrated by problems with
concussions. Each year students playing football die from concussions,
including a recent death here in Wake County. However, each year we
submit many do not die, or receive debilitating injuries that these
young people would suffer for the balance of their lives because of the
presence of trained personnel on the field where the ever-present danger
of injury or death exists but the fact is taxpayers cannot afford to
place a neurologist or medical doctor on the field but they can do the
next best thing, they can place a Licensed Athletic Trainer in the
school to teach students how to prevent injury, they can place a
Licensed Athletic Trainer on-site to see the situation and know the
players, to quickly evaluate that particular athlete who appears to be
injured or even near death, that L.A.T. may provide immediate care for
the injured athlete or access immediate care from the medical doctor via
a pre-arranged designated relationship. It&#39;s achieved because L.A.T.
and the medical doctor have entered into a relationship, a protocol for
the doctor to take the L.A.T. call immediately, hear the
professional&#39;s description of the symptoms and proceed to guide on
the field, life-saving or quality of life-saving care and rehabilitation
from injuries, pre-arranged immediate care. But next, with concern the
N.C.B.A.T.E. received the P.E.D.&#39;s recommendation that the board be
consolidated with another regulating entity. While appreciating that the
P.E.D. completed a tremendous amount of work in a short amount of time
to develop the report it made, the recommendation that the board be
consolidated is not a completed recommendation. Essentially the P.E.D.
is proposing a change without providing a description of the
alternative. Faced with this incomplete recommendation there exist no
real way to asses if the change would be better. Without a concrete
proposal of what the new system would be it&#39;s impossible to make a
fair and accurate assessment of the pros and cons of consolidating the
board. The board is hard at work, it&#39;s financially sound, it&#39;s
fully funded by it&#39;s members with no plans to approach the general
assembly for a fee increase, it&#39;s responding to complaints, some
about competence, some about Title nines. With title nine in play. ::END

Ma&#39;am, your time has expired. Thank you very much. Appreciate your

fire sprinkler contractors, John Nick Felton who will also speak on
behalf of the state board of examiners of electrical contractors. Thank
you Mr. Felton.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, mister chairman and members of the committee. We feel, these
two, I&#39;ve been, this is my 43 years representing occupational
licensing boards. I&#39;ve gotten a lot more experience and a lot less
hair since I&#39;ve started. We wanna say a few things quickly to you in
the interest of time. First of all, these two boards feel like
they&#39;re run like a business already, and it&#39;ll be a big mistake
to add additional bureaucracy layers to carry out this task, and the
money that would be necessary to pay for it has to come from some place.
With the due respect to Mark, Mary, and the bar with regard to
preclearing all the injunction cases, we&#39;ve got 50 to 75 cases a
year. Chuck Heffernan reported there are 700 of those cases all told.
It&#39;s not feasible and efficient or timely to try to add another
layer to preclear those things when the court can tend to it. So we
would suggest that that is probably not needed. With respect to Mr.
Heffernan&#39;s report, I&#39;d like to comment briefly that all that
report really involved in an effort to get it done on the timeline that
was provided to him, Mr. Heffernan did four interviews and sent out a
survey to 50 some boards, and that is simply not enough to make an
earthshaking recommendation. But in the name of moving quickly here and
helping this body do the right thing with some of these issues, we have
put together a draft bill, and we have provided that bill to the two
chairs, House, and Senate for your consideration. I wanna talk about
that bill. First of all, we have taken on the task of figuring out who
is a board and who isn&#39;t, because that seemed to be a problem. The
bill would spell out that the injunction power is one of the things that
defines it. Self funded by fee is another criteria and we think that we
can solve the question of who is a, who is a board through this bill. It
should not be that difficult. Secondly is the reports. Right now,
we&#39;re having to do 16 or 18 different reports during the course of
the year, all these boards. It&#39;s just, it&#39;s too many and the
auditor already pointed out that some of these are not getting read
anyway. So what we have proposed in this bill is to consolidate the key
ones into one report, along with our audits, and have that report go
principally to an APO committee of this body. This is the group that
ought to be doing oversight anyway. We can do that without your more
bureaucracy. The others can refer to office management budget, whoever,
can refer to those things, and the bill will address those things in the
process. We&#39;ve also taken on flagging the issue of per diem for
board members. It hasn&#39;t been changed in as long as I can recall.
We&#39;d invite you to provide authority to these boards to set it
anywhere from $200 down to zero as their funds and their board members
would allow. There&#39;s a section in this draft that would clarify on
the ethics training that these board members not have to redo in front
of our board with me leading a discussion the, some of the things that
are already covered in the course that they are required to take for the
ethics commission. We think that can be straightened out. Venue is
another thing that we flagged. Many times we have a licensee that has a
hearing before the board in Raleigh and in the current law, it forces
him to take the appeal to the court back home. Some of them want to go
to court back home, feeling that a local judge would be helpful, but
others don&#39;t want to spend the extra money to hire another lawyer
back there or to pay the one in Raleigh to go back there and they&#39;d
really rather be here, so we think venue should be sorted out so that
the licensee has a choice where he wants to go and have his appeal per.
Likewise, on our injunction cases, we would invite you to change and
clarify that statute to allow all these boards to carry out those cases
either in the county where the offense occurred or where the board has
its office. We think if you can, that&#39;ll simplify things
considerably. So we, in a nutshell, there are a number of things that we
can do here and we&#39;re prepared to help with that with the experience
that we&#39;ve brought to bear, and we think that the other folks that
follow me will tag some of the bases that

  Need to be tagged about the limits on that Federal Trade Commission
decision and put it in its proper perspective. Thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir very much. And that, you said you had a
bill. ?? Yes you did. I just ?? Right. After we have a draft out, then
we&#39;ll share that with members of committee. Next presenter is Maryam
Behr from the real estate commission.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Hello everyone. I am Maryam Behr. I am the executive
director of the North Carolina Real Estate Commission and an I very much
appreciate the opportunity to be here and to speak with all of you
today. I know it&#39;s been a long afternoon for you. The Supreme Court
decision in the Dental Ward was based on a set of facts that do not
reflect how most of your occupational licensing boards operate in the
state. To explain I&#39;d like to briefly discuss the role and structure
of the real estate commission, which is representative of most of your
occupational licensing boards.
The real estate commission happened to have been created in 1957. And it
currently licenses approximately 94,000 real estate brokers. Including
residential and commercial brokers, property managers and vacation
rental managers. The general assembly created the real estate commission
to assure that our citizens are protected in what is typically the
largest financial transaction of their lives. And that is the purchase
or sale of their house and the purchase or sale of a business that they
might own that involves real property.
That transaction and all of those transactions that I&#39;ve discussed
play a huge role in the economy of our state. The economic impact of
real estate transactions is enormous. Brokers handle money from
residential sales transactions where people are buying or selling. They
also play a vital role in commercial transactions. And they receive a
number, millions of dollars actually, from tourists from around the
world who are coming to North Carolina to enjoy our beautiful beaches,
our mountains and our golf courses in the Piedmont.
The commission takes very seriously its responsibility to ensure that
consumers are protected so that North Carolina will continue to be a
destination location. As you consider where to go from here, I&#39;d
like to take a moment to talk about where we already are. The commission
and most of the state&#39;s occupational licensing boards already have
direct and active supervision from the state in a number of ways. First,
the governor and the legislature appoint each of the real estate
commission&#39;s nine members.
This is very typical for most occupational licensing boards. Unlike the
dental board, no real estate commission member is elected. Three of our
nine have to be licensed by law. Two of our nine have to be public
members by law. And the other four are appointed the discretion of the
appointer, whether that&#39;s you all through the legislative
appointments or whether that&#39;s the governor. Real estate commission
members meet in Raleigh every single month. Sometimes twice a month.
And make all of the policy decisions for the board. They review our
financials every time they come. They establish standards and they make
the decisions on consumer complaints. These are not handled by staff.
They are handled by your appointees. Additional oversight of the
legislative and executive branch comes from the dozens of reports that
have been alluded to. Depending on how you count, it ranges from 12 to
22 different reports that I as the director am responsible for filing,
either quarterly or monthly or annually, depending on the nature of that
report.
Those reports currently go all over the place. So I&#39;m filing with
the auditors office, the secretary of state, OSBM, the department of
revenue, the department commerce, the attorney general, and the APO. And
that is not a comprehensive list. So it&#39;s a lot for your boards to
keep up with. And these reports then land on those chairs of those
offices and some folks look at &#39;em and some folks don&#39;t. So we
think that those reports could become a lot more useful tool for all of
you if they were consolidated to the extent that that makes sense.
It doesn&#39;t for all of them, but a number of them could be
consolidated into one fairly comprehensive report. Could come to the
APO, could be posted anywhere, could be sent to all those other boards
and agencies if you want us to send them there. And provide all of the
information you need. Then if you establish standards for what to do
with any ??? [SPEAKER CHANGES] One minute remaining. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
That would give you the tools that you need to respond appropriately
when you have an issue.
I&#39;d like to just tick off the other ways that you have oversight
already existing. Primarily you have rule making oversight through the
rules review commission so that any standard developed by a board.

whether we&#39;re talking about an application case, a disciplinary
case, or a situation where somebody is asking for a ruling of some sort
about what&#39;s appropriate conduct. All of that goes through the
courts system. Likewise, the real estate commission does not send cease
and desist letters, we act through the courts system and have oversight
from the courts to determine whether unlicensed practice is going on or
isn&#39;t. We don&#39;t decide those things, the courts do. So, I&#39;ll
conclude by saying that there is a solid foundation already on the laws
and books -

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I thank you so much for your time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Miss Bear. From the board of pharmacy, Mr. Jay
Campbell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chairman Horn, Chairman Hartsell, members of the committee, thank you
for the opportunity to make a few comments. I have submitted my remarks
in writing and I do thank Mrs. Gilbert for her able and quick assistance
with that submission. The Board of Pharmacy wishes to focus on one
particular question, and it is this: does the United States Supreme
Court&#39;s decision in the Dental Board case compel this general
assembly to add additional bureaucratic layers in order to provide
active supervision of occupational licensing boards in this state? The
answer is no. And you don&#39;t have to read tea leaves to arrive at
that answer. The answer is clearly provided in the Federal Trade
Commission&#39;s own order in the Dental Board case; the very order in
which the FTC imposed a remedy for lack of active supervision at issue
in the case. Put simply, that remedy is for the Dental Board to follow
the procedures already in place in the Dental Practice Act; in the
Administrative Procedures Act. The Dental Practice Act permits the
Dental Board to directly regulate only those licensed to engage in the
practice of dentistry. Where unlicensed practice is concerned, the
Dental Practice Act states that the Dental Board can act to stop such
practices by seeking an injunction from the superior court. The Federal
Trade Commission found that the Dental Board had disregarded that
procedure by issuing its own cease and desist orders to what the Dental
Board believed were unlicensed practitioners rather than by following
the statutorily-mandated procedure to seek an injunction. Although the
Dental Board responded that its letters were not actually orders, it
agreed that only the superior court could issue an order to halt
unlicensed practice. The FTC found that the letters were worded in such
a way as to appear to be orders of the Dental Board. But the FTC&#39;s
order sets forth the procedure that the FTC required the Dental Board to
follow. It prohibited the Dental Board from ordering non-dentist
providers to cease their practices, and instead required the Dental
Board to follow the existing statutory procedures to seek injunctions
against unlicensed practice. Specifically, the FTC ruled that the board
could follow their statutory procedures to investigate non-dentist
providers for suspected violations of the act, file an action for an
injunction against non-dentist providers for suspected violations and
provide prior notice to those non-dentist providers on that board&#39;s
belief that there were violations, and that board&#39;s good faith
intention to see an injunction against the practices. In short, the FTC
endorsed the existing statutory framework as providing adequate active
supervision by neutral third-party state actor, superior court of the
Dental Board&#39;s activities in enforcing the Dental Practice act
against unlicensed practitioners. Therefore that case instructs that the
general assembly already has appropriate procedures for oversight of
occupational licensing agency activities if those procedures are
followed. With respect to suggestions today about Attorney General rules
review commission pre-clearance of unlicensed practice actions, would
submit that in public health context where by board operates, if you
have an unlicensed doctor, an unlicensed pharmacist, unlicensed nurse,
practicing those professions inappropriately, there are real public
health issues that are in play immediately and creating additional
layers beyond what the FTC says is required in court supervision, could
be unsafe. I do want to iterate what Miriam said, this body has already
provided mechanisms for active supervision by neutral third-party state
actors for any other agency action authorized by statute. The Supreme
Court itself recognized that rule-making by occupational licensing
boards in North Carolina is subject to active, substantive supervision
by the Rules Review Commission -

and completely provided for active supervision to ensure that those

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much Mr. Campbell and Choy representing the licensing
board for general contractors, good afternoon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good afternoon Chairman Hartselle, Chairman Horn and members of the
committee, I wanna thank you very much for the opportunity to speak with
you today, I’m an Attorney who represents licensing boards here in North
Carolina, I’m here today on behalf of licensing board for general
contractors, I also in my practice represent individuals and businesses
in front of other licensing boards that I do not represent, and also
there is been a lot of discussion about we are making today I would like
to note that I’m a House Speaker appointee to the Rules Review
Commission and though any opinion that I do express today with regards
to comments made regarding we are making on my own and not that of the
North Carolina Rules Review Commission. I’m not here today to rehash or
repeat what is already been spoken off, the first half of our meeting we
talked about the Dental Board case, the second half of the meeting seems
to be a lot of discussion about the PED report regarding Occupational
Licensing Boards. So I would like to combine my comments combine the
two. I would like to emphasize that active state supervision which you
have heard and mentioned over and over today already exists for every
single licensing board in North Carolina. As I mentioned the licensing
board for general contractors that board was created in 1925, it’s a
nine member board, all of them are appointed by the Governor, there are
approximately 33,000 licensees with this board and the threshold for
licensing where it would require somebody to hold a license is where the
cost of the undertaking is $30,000 or more. The General Assembly and
certainly the board has absolutely no interest in licensing the handy
man or the person that comes to perform minor repairs at a home or
business but if someone is building a home, constructing a building for
people children will go in and out off without that individual being
licensed showing that they can pass an exam, showing they have financial
responsibility and that is where the board can take action and that is
through again, you have heard several times today is through the
authority to seek a court injunction. The FTC itself thought this would
be sufficient oversight and again it’s already in the statue. You have
also heard with regards to oversight numerous comments about the rule
making process in North Carolina, this process is set out by statue and
requires a vast majority of state agencies and to my knowledge every
licensing board to go through rule making if it wishes to implement a
rule that interprets a board statue. At the very end of the rule making
process the 10 member commission half appointed by the Speaker, half
appointed by the Senate which is housed within a state agency, the
Office of Administrative Hearings and that agency…Excuse me! That
commission determines and the statue says, “It must determine whether a
rule needs all of the following criteria.” And there are only four
criteria whether it’s within the authority delegated to the agency clear
and unambiguous, reasonably necessary, and was adopted in accordance
with the rule making process. After that review the Rules Review
Commission must either approve or object to that rule. So I started this
absolutely is another example of active states supervision. So
enclosing, as you consider how the Dental Board case impacts licensing
boards, I would like for you just to consider whether the Occupational
Licensing Commission that was referenced in the PED report…

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very Miss. Choy. And our last schedule presenter is Mike
Toddy. I’m up for that Toddy, Representative the Acupuncture Licensing
Board, Mr. Toddy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, thank you to the members of the committee, thank you as
well and I appreciate that I do stand between all of you and the hot
Toddy. My name is Mike Toddy; I have practice law in North Carolina for
more than 17 years largely representing licensed individuals and
companies before Occupational Licensing Board. I’m also a licensed
entity myself and then I’m subject to the regulations of the state bar
and so that you know that regulation doesn’t end when I go home, my wife
actually works for the state bar. I’m here today on behalf of the North
Carolina Acupuncture Licensing Board and they are more than 500 licensed
acupuncturists, I wish to acknowledge and express appreciation for the
time and commitment and the work that the committee and the staff have
put into researching, writing, and establishing guidelines for accessing
the operation of North Carolina’s occupational licensing boards. The
Acupuncture Board and its licensees are contingent of the concerns that
the committee and the program evaluation division have to ensure that
North Carolina’s occupational licensing boards are working efficiently
and effectively to protect the citizens of North Carolina. After
reviewing the findings and recommendations from the December report, the
Acupuncture Board is concerned regarding the future regulation of
acupuncturist and the potential negative impact on the public. The board
is on the list of occupational licensing boards being recommended for
consolidation, it is the only board regulating independent health care
providers on the consolidation list. On behalf of the Acupunctures Board
I would like to take this opportunity to offer some additional insight
into at least two areas where the board feels that the committee or
staff may not have had sufficient information available regarding the
acupuncture profession. First the Acupuncture Licensing Board regulates
a medical profession; acupuncture is a healthcare system that has
specific diagnostic parameters and treatments. Acupuncture’s diagnostic
parameters and treatments are unique and offer safe and effective
healthcare to the citizens of North Carolina. We feel strongly that
effective regulation and in turn protection of North Carolina citizens
can only come from those who have specific in-depth knowledge of the
profession that is acupuncturist themselves. The University of North
Carolina Board of Governors overseas acupuncture colleges in the state,
acupuncture colleges must meet the same educational standards as the
schools of the University of North Carolina System, Duke University, and
the states other colleges and universities. The four years Masters
Degree Program approved by the Board of Governors is an extensive
training program in Asian Medicine Theory and Western Biomedicine. The
intensive and comprehensive curriculum includes and supervises clinical
internship of more than 800 hours. The recommendation that the
Acupuncture Board should be combined with another board that regulates
occupations in the same industry does not adequately acknowledge this
specific and unique professional skills and training of acupuncturist as
independent medical care providers. By way the example, the North
Carolina Medical Board and the North Carolina Board of Chiropractic
Examiners each regulate the practice of medicine in our state. Just like
in the practice of acupuncture these healthcare systems have their own
distinct diagnostic and treatment parameters, each of these professions
provides healthcare from their unique approach to improving health. We
believe that most people would think it inappropriate and potentially
dangerous for medical doctors to regulate chiropractors and for
chiropractors to regulate medical doctors. For exactly the same reasons,
we believe it would be equally inappropriate and possibly dangerous for
medical doctors or chiropractors to regulate acupuncturist. All three
are medical professions but each profession requires unique and specific
training to be safe and effective for North Carolina citizens. Second,
the Acupuncture Board agrees that the value of independent regulation
must warrant its cost, to that end the board respectfully inserts that
the cost of independent regulation of acupuncture meds as a medical
profession has been carefully considered and approved by the General
Assembly in the past.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One minute remaining.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, more importantly perhaps the North Carolina Acupuncture Board
has consistently demonstrated it’s ability to manage itself as a good
steward of the public’s trust both financially and professionally since…

…In 1993, so in 21 year since the board has not ask for any public
support and there isn’t any reason to believe that need will rise in the
future. The board has no time needed financial assistance from the
state. In summary, the North Carolina Acupuncture Licensing Board
regulates independent medical professionals providing healthcare to
North Carolinians across the state, the Acupuncture Board believe
strongly that consolidation of the regulation of acupuncturist would
provide less protection for our citizens, we believe that if the
regulation of this medical system and it’s providers has transferred to
another board whose members are not educated in acupuncture and age
medicine regulation of this unique and important medical practice would
degrade putting North Carolina…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The time has expired.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, my comments are in writing and can be provided to
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. All the people have signed up ahead of time but
this is a public hearing of sorts and I know that there are, I advice
that there is at least one person or maybe others that from the audience
would like to address this committee, if so would you please step-up to
the microphone, identify yourself by name and if you are representing an
organization please let us know which one that is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, thank you so much to the Chairman of the Committee, my name is
Susan Delaney, Naturopathic Physician and I’m representing the North
Carolina Association of Naturopathic Physicians.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are representing whom?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The North Carolina Association of Naturopathic Physicians.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I can’t spell it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
N-A-T-U-R-O-P-A-T-H-I-C, naturopathic.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, I’m sorry, I’m little hard here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, that’s okay it’s been a long day.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I’m not here like the other speakers to defend the board but I was
asked by the Senator Bingham to come and speak about my experience with
other established licensing boards on this issue of perceive competition
by other established boards. Briefly I wanna talk about who we are and
then these two issues of public health and safety, we have been trying
for 14 years to establish a Naturopathic Licensing Board in the state of
North Carolina. We are being Naturopathic doctors, medically trained
doctors from four year medical schools, five are currently are in the
United States, three in Canada, and these schools are regulated by the
Department of Health and Education. So most of the doctors in the state
they are 45 of them carry a license in another state and the 20 other
states, licensed states and provinces. So the issue for us begin in 1999
with a public health and safety issue when a little child Rosy
Kolitwenzew died in Buncombe County under the hand of, under the care of
an unlicensed provider, he was currently to year and a half in prison
and later we found out he returned to practice in North Carolina until
recently. Then in 2012, another case came for us from Representative
Insko who said that, she sent me the case and Rebecca Richards is the
case who wants to follow complaint by a naturopathic doctor supposedly
practicing in the state and we refer the case to the North Carolina
Medical Board and rightfully said, “We have no jurisdiction over this
case.” So at least two cases of harm and many other complaints are
coming to us and so we feel like we need to establish a board of
naturopathic licensing and unable to do so because of other competition.
And there are also barriers to practice and those are these trained
naturopathers unable to fully practice the extend of their training,
they cannot accept positions at Duke University, Bowman-Gray, or UNC
because we are not legally licensed in the state, the students from
these other universities, from these medical universities who are from
North Carolina cannot return to North Carolina and become citizens and
establish themselves with their family again and finally with the
doctors who have been practicing here myself for 28 years it creates a
sense of insecurity and instability, we do the very best we can but
these are issues that do concern us that we don’t have a Naturopathic
Licensing Board and because of competitions are perceived competition in
the state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. Your last name again, would you spell that for me
as well?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Sir, D-E-L-A-N-E-Y.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you very much, is there anyone else wishing to address the
committee? Seeing none…

  I want to remind everyone that the Senate Oversight Committee on PED
held a meeting last week and there was a video made of a presentation by
Professor Judith Welch Wegner, who&#39;s a former dean of UNC School of
Law. It is excellent. It&#39;s only about ten minutes. I&#39;m gonna ask
you to take ten minutes, go to the website of this committee, and take a
look at that video. I think it will help you-- We&#39;re not gonna show
it. It&#39;ll help you understand some of the nature of this issue. But,
I don&#39;t see any point, really. We can all look at it. We&#39;ve been
here for two and a half hours, pushing three hours. Some of us drove a
number of hours to get here. Some of you all drove a number of hours to
get here. So, go to the committee website. Under the handouts for this
meeting you&#39;re gonna see that video. I strongly encourage you to
look at that video. So, before we close and I tell you when we&#39;re
gonna meet again, are there any comments or questions from members of
the committee? Say none. Co-chair? None. So, therefore we will meet
again on April the thirteenth, or earlier if the urge moves us. So, as
they say, stay tuned with that. Meeting adjourned. Thank you very much
for your patience.
