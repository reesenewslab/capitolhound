<p id="15:00">
Debate on this on second reading. Yes, today I ask for your support on
the third reading of the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Blue, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Senator Brunstetter would yield for a
question or maybe two or three?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brustetter, do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Brunstetter. Contrary to what
Senator Apodaca may have said on Friday, I want to be helpful, and so I
have a couple of questions. Has the funding for the low wealth counties
been reduced in this budget from the amount last year?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Blue, I know there’s been some tinkering with
the funding of the low wealth. I think that there’s a change made at the
end to conform low wealth funding to what there was last year. Yeah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Another question, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brunstetter, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The reason that I ask is that I was involved somewhat
in creating the low wealth of funding although my county is not one of
the recipients of low wealth funding, and what I was concerned about was
some language that was settled on 18, 20 years ago on maintenance of
effort because part of the strategy behind the funding for these 70
counties or school districts that now receive it was that County
Commissioners would not surplant their funding efforts and replace the
money that we were putting in on low wealth counties because it was felt
that it’s a state-wide responsibility, really, to try to bring all these
kids up to a certain level of proficiency. And so in looking at the
bill, and I actually read it again last evening, and looking at it
there’s a provision relating to that maintenance of effort. And it’s
changed from saying ?? be the three year average of what is appropriated
by a county commission to determine whether or not they are maintaining
the effort, keeping funding as it should be rather than simply using
what we are appropriating to replace what they’d been giving to the
school system. And you’ve changed that so that the numerator now becomes
the expenditures in one of these low wealth districts rather than the
appropriations, and so since the expenditures can be much greater in
some instances, especially if you have school districts getting grants
since they are poor school districts. Have you not substantially
increased the amount of money that a county has to appropriate before
they are eligible for the low wealth funding?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Stand by.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, I think that the fairest thing I can tell you
is right now, first of all, the funding itself has not been reduced. I’m
going to send a staff over to tell you about the maintenance of effort
part of it. It’s complicated but a lot to tell you, and if you have
further concerns, please bring them up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman, you up for another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brunstetter yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brunstetter, again, my concern here is we
still help these 70 districts to our best ability. I’m certainly
disappointed in some of the education spending in this budget, but if in
fact it has the effect that I just described to you, then don’t you
think we ought to go back and at least ensure that these counties, which
are really the most needy in the state, whether it’s Hope County where
this originated, or even Cumberland or Onslow County where you have big
military presence, that we ought to ought to before we get out of here
take steps to make sure that we’re not reducing the funding to these
counties?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, what I can tell you is that I’ve been assured
by staff that it is not as you described. I’ll going to send them over
to talk to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One last question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ll yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you concede that if in fact-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I concede nothing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are you willing to consider that if in fact you are
making the amount of money that they have to match substantially greater
because you’re using expenditures as opposed to appropriations then that
it would reduce the amount of state funds that they would receive
because they show that they’ve maintained</p>

[Speaker Changes]
Further discussion or debate?
[Speaker Changes]
Mr. President,
(Speaker Changes]
Senator Rucho, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes]
To debate the bill. And also kinda to respond to Senator Blue's
question..you know that tax reform package that we put through also
provided additional resources above and beyond what the counties and the
municipalities receiving it if there was any decline in any low wealth
has been worked on by this tax reform package so there are some
additional resources that are there to meet those needs.
[Speaker Changes]
Further discussion, further debate?
[Speaker Changes]
Senator Nesbitt
[Speaker Changes]
For what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr. President, to speak on the bill.
[Speaker Changes]
You have the floor.
[Speaker Changes]
Mr. President, members of the senate, I hope that we will take the time,
I'm not going to take a great deal of time here today, but to make sure
that we get this problem solved. The problem with low-wealth counties is
they don't benefit from much of anything. They don't get a lot of taxes
cause they don't have a lot of commerce cause they don't have a lot of
jobs. And it goes on and on. And you can't just assume that they're
going to get their fair share out of anything. That's why created the
low-wealth funding system so I hope we can make sure that we've got this
covered before we start. I want to kind of wrap up today..I mentioned
most of this the other day..this is the middle piece of the Republican
agenda. The tax bill which we passed was step one, cut a half a billion
dollars out of revenue to provide gifts to the wealthiest people in the
state and out of state corporations. Then you're short a half a billion
so we start on everybody else. And in this budget we hurt public
schools..I'm going to list a few of them, teacher and in prior bills
we've attacked women's healthcare rights, we've hurt rural North
Carolina perhaps on school funding but certainly on economic development
and transportation. Those are in the budget Students..
[Speaker changes]
Mr. President!
[Speaker changes]
Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker changes]
Inquiry of the chair please
[Speaker changes]
State your inquiry
[Speaker changes]
What bill are we talking about here? I've heard about ten different
things identified by the Minority Leader and most of those aren't even
included in this bill.
[Speaker changes]
Senator Nesbitt, if you'll please refrain your remarks to Senate Bill
402
[Speaker changes]
Ok Mr. President, I'll start over so he can trace them. You hurt the
public schools in this bill, you cut funding
[Speaker changes]
Mr. President!
[Speaker changes]
Senator Apodaca for what..
[Speaker changes]
Senator Nesbitt yield a question
[Speaker changes]
I am gonna yield one and then I'm going to have what I got to say
Senator Apodaca, you always speak after I do anyhow.
[Speaker changes]
Mr. President, question for Senator Nesbitt is to point out where we
hurt public schools in this bill. Would you give me the line number and
the amount please?
[Speaker changes]
I'll be glad to get that for you and give it to you when I finish my
comments.
[Speaker changes]
I look forward to it.
[Speaker changes]
Ok.
[Speaker changes]
Senator Nesbitt..
[Speaker changes]
Page one! Can I get the line number? I'll get that for you. It's not a
long page, it's just a page. But, I'll get it for you. You cut a half a
billion dollars out of education in this budget in order to make up for
the tax giveaway that you give to the wealthy and the out of state
corporations. You took away teacher tenure, you took away the master's
degree for teacher pay. I didn't want to get into all these. I was gonna
try to give you a list and be gone. Must I tell you what you did to
women's choice in this state in a prior bill? In the rural areas</p>

Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Economic development, you kill this
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Here we go again, down another path of bills we don’t
have in front of us. We’re going to be here all night, wrapping the
session up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt, will you please confine
your remarks to Senate Bill 402. Senator has the floor for discussion of
Senate Bill 402. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, Mr. Chairman. And for the
life of me, I mentioned the tax bill because it relates to this bill
because that’s where the money went. On your adjustments to availability
on the public schools, if you’ll go to page 5, Senator Apodaca, line 47,
I’m sorry that’s not on public schools. This is on the tax act, you
reduced 86 million in the first year. 437 million in the second year.
That’s revenue you took out of this budget. And then the net effect is
those cuts are carried over into education. And if you want me to point
all those out to you, they’re negative numbers appearing in the section
under education. [PAUSE] And if you’ll go to the one with the blue
cover, on elimination of LEA adjustment, I don’t know what page this is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator may I ask, would it be acceptable to you to
see if there’s any other discussion and then come back to yours after
you’ve had a chance to enumerate all of the concerns you have? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I’m answering his question, Mr. President, about where the
budget cuts were in education, before I go on. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President, I’m satisfied. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt has the
floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well if you start, for the rest of the members,
if you start on F2 and just follow it through, you’ll see millions and
hundreds of millions of dollars cut out of education. Students are being
hurt, increasing class size. What difference does it make if there’s one
more child per class, or two or three or four? We’re going to take
teachers’ aides out of the classrooms. Now I know that your mission here
is to teach every child to read by the third grade. At the end of this
year, you will have been in power for three years. And I am pulling for
you with everything in me, that every child in the third grade will be
able to read come January. That’s three years. And we’ll ask for a
report on that, see how we’re coming with that. After we take the help
out of the schools, which was going to help them do it. The unemployed,
we’ve just thrown on the side of the road. We’ve got an 8.8%
unemployment rate, fifth highest in the nation. And the answer is get,
just get out of the way. It’s not, you’re not important. The uninsured,
we’re not going to expand Medicaid. 100% ?? and we’re not putting it in
this budget. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It seems like
we’re wandering the path again, Mr. President. I don’t hear anything
dealing with the budget in this debate. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s what’s
not in here, Senator Apodaca. The unemployed, on the unemployed, you did
not fix the problem of 150,000 people who are not going to be drawing
checks, with 100% federal money. You did not pick up Medicaid expansion,
which is going to disenfranchise a half a million people that will not
have health insurance. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Will somebody please show me where this is in this budget?
Where we knocked that out? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt, can you
respond to his request? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, Senator Apodaca, I
can assure you that those are not in this budget, because you didn’t put
them in and you left them out. They would have been done with 100%
federal money so it would not have required any additional money.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All it would have taken
is a special provision saying that we’re going to do these things. And I
didn’t find it in special provisions. Now maybe you can tell me it’s in
there. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s okay. Never mind. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt, you have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
President. I don’t see, I know we have rhetoric about creating job. I
didn’t see any. We’re going backwards, folks. The national</p>

Averages coming down, we're going up.  And I think to sum it up, this
bill is the second piece of the ?? for your plan.  We now know what your
priorities are, this is all about priorities, we know what they are. Tax
breaks for the wealthy, out of state corporations.  Take it out of the
middle class, take it out of services to the people.  And then pass an
elections bill so they can't get to the polls to get retribution.  And
we will be talking about that bill a little bit later. But that's what
we have here. Its the same thing we have been saying all session long,
except its beginning to come into focus. And the reason you've arrested
800 people down here this year, is because they know what you're doing.
And they're coming.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sir, tell for purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak briefly on the Congress Report
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Its amazing that Senator Nesbitt's talking points were so profound that
he had to go and by whether they had anything to do with this budget or
not, which nine tenths of it did not.  Last budget we spent two hundred
thousand dollars less on education, 7.7 versus 7.9 this budget.  That is
an increase of two hundred million dollars.  And total education
increases of more than half a billion dollars in the total education
budget.  All you can talk about is raising class sizes.  We did not
raise class sizes Senator.  The same class sizes are in effect.  We gave
the flexibility to the school systems to do what they wanted to with
that. And the house didn't agree with the primary grade, so it's back to
the original caps.  Only in the Middle grades through high schools do
they have any flexibility what so ever there.  If anybody cut teachers,
it would be the local systems doing that.  Not us doing that. State
dollars are going to fund every one of the positions that are in the
budget due to growth.  So we're not taking teachers out of the budget.
We are spending more money in this budget than we did last.  And Senator
Brunstetter, bless his heart, asked the question of the year.  Yes, we
will definitely go along and accept resonsibility for this budget, if
you'll accept all of those that put us in the hole 2.5 billion by
funding on going ?? with one time money. Time after time, you had a
structuraly inbalanced budget.  We don't have that anymore.  We've got a
balanced budget that's going to meet the revenue that we expect to come
in.  That's the way we've chosen to the budget.  But I've heard
everything but the school budget talked about today.  And I think you'll
end up liking it.  The schools will not close, they will operate.  And,
yes, tenure we took out. Everybody I know except the teachers, want us
to do away with tenure.  And we're finally doing it. It only polls

for a moment of personal privelage out of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank You Mr. President.  Members, you know one of the great things
about getting the budget passed whether you voted for it or against it,
is that it means that we are going home soon.  But I can tell you that
there is a group of people in this chamber and in the building across
the way, who have gone, who have worked nonstop, week after week after
week.  They work with us to get the original budget prepared.  And they
went and started working with the house around the clock and now they've
come back here and they're working. And I have never ever heard a
complaint.  And I think on behalf of the Senators in this chamber and
particularly Senators Brown, Hunt and myself, I would like to thank our
fiscal staff for the outstanding work that they have put in.</p>

Thank you, Mr. President. House Bill 491 is a local bill that places
responsibility on the Lee County sheriff, rather than on the Board of

cooperative effort between the Lee County Board of Commissioners and the
sheriff's office. They believe this bill is vital to the community and
to the safety of Lee County schoolchildren. The Lee County Board of
Commissioners passed a unanimous resolution in support last September,

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the Senate. House Bill 552 makes
available to our boards of county commissioners a vehicle that is
currently identical to one that our city has already employed. That is,
to be able to remove in a specifically created district, service
district, parcels of land that are either no longer need the service or
the county commissioners were unable to provide the service. It can only
be done after several mandates are met. One that one hundred percent of
the real property owners in that service district petitions to be
removed. As I said the area no longer requires the service, and after a
duly advertized public hearing, are the vehicles used to remove this
deal. At the proper time, Mister President, I'd like to send forth an
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman may send forth his amendment. Is it on the dashboard? Yes, and
so the clerk will read.

Thank you, Mr. President. The amendment is just an additional safeguard
that says if the territory to be removed, or the territory in question,
was included in the county's repayment option of any bond that they may
have incurred when they set this district up, that it would not be able
to remove. I would like to ask for your support on the amendment.

House Bill 675, “Amend Pharmacy Laws.”
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman you are recognized to explain the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Briefly on the Bill, this Bill passed with overwhelming support in the
House. It deals with three areas. Basically, if you’re a pharmacy
technician employed by a pharmacy and go through the training program
you will be certified by the NC Board of Pharmacy.
Pharmacy audits, there’s a section on the audits. The bottom line is if
you have an audit finding that is against you before you have to pay
whatever the damages or the charges may be you have the right to not to
pay that until it is finally adjudicated, then whatever the finding is.
Many of them are charged a huge fee, $20,000 or $30,000 up-front, then
they find out that they didn’t warrant a violation on final adjudication
so this simply says that you wait until it’s settled and then you pay.
Then the third section is on Schedule Two substances such oxycontin and
Percocet. Those now have no expiration date. They will have a six-month
expiration date. You must have a new prescription to get that refilled.
That’s all it does. Be glad to take questions if you have them.

I wanted to say that this is a good bill. I am a bit disappointed
because there’s another institution in our state that is known for its
engineering expertise and it’s not included along with the other two.
Having been on that board of governors for ten years, I certainly know
the expertise of those institutions. North Carolina ANT State University
is one of those and brings in a tremendous amount of resources into our
state. Although there’s not opportunity to do an amendment, I do want to
say that I’ll vote against it. Not against the other two institutions
because they are great institutions, but it’s the fact that North
Carolina ANT is left out of the bill.

our very good bill and stripped out the Safe Harbor provision for 16 and
17 year old girls who are sex trafficked, what we have done is that we
have put that back in. I understand that the House concurred on it
yesterday and it will actually be a true safe haven bill it rewrites the
prostitution laws in our state, it protects women and girls who are sex
trafficked and it will put us on the cutting edge of getting ourselves
off the top 10 list, our state currently ranks number 8 for sex
trafficking in the United States and we believe that this bill will help
take us off that list of shame. I would appreciate your support.[speaker

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sen. Brock, you're recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, this
is something we've looked at before. This is to modify the existing
internal auditing statutes by putting certain members on the board.
There's a couple of amendments which we'll go through, which we'll
change a couple of these. But if you'll look on Page 1 and Page 2, it
looks at some of the changes. Most of them are technical, but also to
make sure that the changes that we do in our internal auditing, that we
have better records and better information flowing back and forth, so
that we know how we're controlling our money. I'll be open for any
questions, but I believe Senator Brown has an amendment. I have one as
well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sen. Brown, you're recognized to send forth an
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] First, I'd like to ask Sen. Brock a question if I
could.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sen. Brock, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sen. Brock, I saw than in Section, the section that
deals with internal auditing that President of the University of North
Carolina has been added to the Council of Internal Auditing. Do you know
what the thought process was there as you look at the list of who's on
that council?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think just, Mr. Chairman, Mr. President --
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, I think the reason why they did that is
because ?? size of the university system to make sure that we have
somebody there. I think it was put in kind of a, I'll say as an
after-thought, but not really thought about when you look at the other
people that make up the board itself. It looks as though those people
that are elected or appointed through the General Administration, and
that's something I think might need a change or take further
investigation into.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sen. Brown, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To send forth an amendment, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Senator may send forth his amendment. The Clerk
will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sen. Brown moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sen. Brown, you are recognized to explain the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sen. Apodaca?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Inquiry to Chair and the Clerk.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] State your inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Did Sen. Brock send forth his amendment – [CUTS OFF]</p>

Amendment first, or has he done that yet?
[Speaker Changes] He had not, I recognize Senator Brown first.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. President. As you look at who's on the
council, I'm not sure why the President of the University of North
Carolina would be added to that list, what the amendment does is take
the president off of that list.
[Speaker Changes] Mr. President
[Speaker Changes] Senator Nesbitt for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes] Would the gentleman yield for a question?
[Speaker Changes] Senator Brown do you yield for a question?
[Speaker Changes] I will
[Speaker Changes] We're all trying to catch up with this bill as we go,
but doesn't this call for internal audits in the University system?
[Speaker Changes] It does Senator Nesbitt. It's my understanding that
the President was added at the last second with very little debate. I
would just like to put it in comfort so I can just get more information
is really what I'd like to do.
[Speaker Changes] So after you amend it then.
[Speaker Changes] Then it will be different from the house, and then we
can have that little debate.
[Speaker Changes] Well then it would go back , excuse me another
question.
[Speaker Changes] You're recognized go ahead sir.
[Speaker Changes] Then it goes back to the hose for concurrence.
[Speaker Changes] Right and I doubt they would concur so we'll take a
look then
[Speaker Changes] Would he yield to another question?
[Speaker Changes] Senator Brown do you yield?
[Speaker Changes] I do.
[Speaker Changes] We got to vote on this thing, I'm trying to, tell me
what this audit committee is for and who its made up of?
[Speaker Changes] The committee now is made up of the State controller,
who is your service chair, the state budget officer, the secretary of
administration, the attorney general, and the secretary of revenue, and
then the President of the University was added, which just doesn't seem
like a good fit for me.
[Speaker Changes] Speak on the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Nesbitt you are recognized to speak on the
amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. President. I fail to understand why that
would not be a good fit. I don't know who put this together or who added
it or who didn't. But if these internal audits are going to apply to
state government and the university system, university system operates
under the board of governors, and they ought to have some say on the
oversight, I guess this is an oversight committee that kind of writes
the rules for how these things occur, and access to documents and so
forth. It appears to me that the president of the university system, and
this is not a local chancellor, its is the president, would be able to
help facilitate getting these things done and getting the board of
governors to go along and getting the universities to go along. I'll
listen to other debates but I don't know why we would take them out, so
I urge you to not vote for the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Further discussion or debate on the amendment?
[Speaker Changes] Senator Brock.
[Speaker Changes] Mr. President, speak to the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] You're recognized go ahead.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Nesbitt, I think one reason why we are going
to take a  look at it to make sure its been truly vetted, some of your
concerns wouldn't be addressed if we did nothing with this bill and send
it on through I'm just afraid it might get caught up in the rush at the
end of the session and get passed through without being fully vetted.
And by changing this amendment make sure we get it through to make sure
this is addressed correctly in the bill. I urge all the members to
support the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Further discussion or debate? Hearing none, all those
in favor of the amendment as presented by Senator Brown will vote Aye,
all opposed will vote no. 5 seconds will be allowed for voting and the
clerk will record the vote. McKissick? No. Stein? No. 34 have voted in
the affirmative, 15 in the negative.
[Speaker Changes] Mr. President, I'd like to change my vote.
[Speaker Changes] Okay. Senator Ford wants to change his vote to No.
Final tally 33 in the affirmative and 16 in the negative. The amendment
passes, the bill is back before you. Senator Brock.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. President. Send forth an amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Jim was recognized to send for his amendment, the
clerk will read.
[Speaker Changes] Did it go through?</p>
