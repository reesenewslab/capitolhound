motion to strike the referral without objection. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Objection. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Objection having been raised. The gentleman
may make a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, House Bill 1139 which
was heard today which was the, I believe the environmental amends bill,
the environmental, I forget what the title was but it originally had a
referral, strike that, it's not the environmental amends, this was the
one that changed the property, it had to do with the act to remove
certain lands from the State Nature and Historic Preserve as recommended
by the Environmental Commission. The bill passed unanimously in the
committee. It originally had a referral to the Committee on Finance
because of the way it was coded. Upon further review and consultation
with staff, it does not need a referral referral. If the gentleman wants
to withdraw, this is totally non-controversial, if the gentleman would
like to withdraw his objection. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hall,

Leadership Scotland Group. Please stand and let us welcome you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A very odd situation for me, let me tell you. This has been on the books
in Durham County since 1935. It says that any gun purchased must be
registered with the clerk of court. And, this was aimed at a problem
they were having with so called liquor houses in Durham at the time
where they were having problems. Laws have changed since then. Gun
registration and everything has been taken to another method. We just
wanted to get this off the books in Durham county. I ask for your
support.

Further discussion? Further debate? If not, the question before the
house is the passage of the Senate Committee substitute to Senate bill
226 on its second reading. All in favor say aye, all opposed no. The
ayes have it. The house committee substitute…the senate committee

special separation allowance for law enforcement officers. General
assembly of North Carolina next.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Collins, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Briefly explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This bill although looks long. And, remember, and pension bill we’re
bringing you looks long because every paragraph gets repeated over and
over again until we’ve covered all the retirement plans. Actually, it
does three things. Section 1 has an anti-pension spiking provision in
it. If you’ll notice on page 1 lines 20 and 21, this will affect less
than ¾ of 1% of state employees. If you’ll look on page 2 of your bill
line 9, it also cannot affect any employee who is making less than
100,000 dollars. So, we’re not talking about the rank and file state
employees here. The benefit cap formula that has been come up with here
is pretty complicated. I don’t think we need to get into it. What you do
need to know is that on page 3, pension spiking is not outlawed by this
bill. It can still be practiced. What happens is this, if you look
starting on about line 12 , section 1C on page 3. If a members is
determined to have, a member and his employer by the way, have decided
to commit pension spiking, then the amount which is owed the pension
plan in order to make the pension plan whole is determined and that
member can offer a lump sum to do that. And, there’s nothing in here
that prevents the employer from doing that. Now, remember to accomplish
pension spiking an employee and his or her employer have to conspire to
do this basically. What the legislation is saying is if you want to do
pension spiking, fine, you can do it but you’ve got to pay for it.
You’re got to make this retirement plan whole in order to do that. And,
in case you’re wondering, the league of municipalities and the county
commissioner’s association are both in favor of this bill. And, they
represent those that could be affected because the cities and counties
could be the employers that are doing the…</p>

<p id="010:00">
Pension spiking. We know of no opposition to this bill and this is
probably the most controversial provision in it. The second thing it
does, if you look at Section 2, is that we used to say if you are in the
state retirement, any of the state retirement plans and if you terminate
employment for any reason you'll get your contributions back and if
you've been with the state more than 5 years you'll also get interest on
those contributions. Section 2 does away with that 5 year provision. We
found out, I think we were the only state, or one of a very few states
that's actually getting an interest free loan from those people who
don't work with us at least 5 years. So we're doing away with that
provision. And then in section 3 if you'll look at that, what we're
doing is, there's a lot of repeats in there, the year 2011 is struck
several times in there and a 10 year mention is struck several times in
there. What that does is take us back to 5 year vesting for pensions
only. Again this is a pension bill, this doesn't have anything to do
with health insurance or anything else. Again, what we found was going
from 5 years to 10 years in pension vesting really didn't save us the
money that we thought it was going to save us. Also it is, and this is a
benefit to our employees by the way, including our teachers, also it
helps our state agencies and probably municipal agencies as well recruit
people when they don't have to wait 10 years to vest in their pension.
Again I know of no organized opposition to this bill and would ask for
your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate.
Representative Lucas, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
see if Representative Collins would yield for a question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd be honored to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Representative Collins. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative Collins,
one of the reasons given when we went to the 10 year plan was we wanted
to curb folk coming from other states and working 5 years and getting
vested. Is that going to be a problem with this? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
don't know that I'm qualified to answer this question. Yeah, it is about
vesting. Would you repeat that, what you said was the premise again? I'm
not sure I caught that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The premise was that we were
having folk coming from other states across state lines, working 5
years, being vested and qualifying for retirement. Would that be a
problem with this scenario that you're presenting to us now? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] It might be. Again if you've worked, this doesn't change any
formulas, if you've worked 5 years you're only going to get that 1.8
multiplier or whatever multiplied by five so I'm not sure. I guess, but
it could, I guess, if before you'd get no pension whatsoever then, you'd
get nothing. If you worked 5 years now under this 5 year vesting, you'd
get 9% of whatever you were making. If you were a legislator you'd get
maybe, what would that be, $100 a month or something like that? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Could I ask another question, Mr. Speaker? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there anything in your provision
that's going to hurt the state financially? [SPEAKER CHANGES] This came
from the treasurer's department as a request from the treasurer's
department so since they're in charge of the retirement plan they don't
believe this will hurt the state retirement plan. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. If not,
the question before the House is the passage of House Bill 1195 on its
second reading. All in favor vote aye, all opposed vote no. The clerk
will open the vote. The clerk will out machine record the vote. 115

<p id="015:00">
Is a companion bill of house bill 735 which passed last year through the
house with every republican vote and some bipartisan support. this body
just passed another bill that clarified to those people that need
clarification that k12 students and their teachers do not leave their
constitutional rights of freedom of speech or religious expression at
the school house gates when they enter. and so the bill before you today
makes the same type of clarification on behalf of the rights of college
students. at least these issues were not controversial, but
unfortunately they are. this bill will clearly affirm that student
organizations on our college campuses maintain the right to determine
their organizations core functions and resolve their own internal
disputes, not the college or university administration. This bill would
prohibit the administration from denying recognition to those
organizations, simply for exercising their rights to determine their own
core functions. There were a few questions and comments that were raised
in the committee that I want to briefly address. We need to make it
clear that just because a student decides to attend one of our public
universities or colleges that does not somehow mean that the student
forfeits his right to administration or of the university of the
college. colleges do have an important role under the law when it comes
to gaining recognition to student groups this bill does not change that
but this bill also recognizes that there is an important difference
between education and indoctrination or coercion. Citizens do have first
amendment rights that protect their freedoms of speech and of religious
expression. Those rights are extended to students in our state
universities and colleges. Some have asked why this is necessary, and
unfortunately it is necessary.
Our society is engaged in an ongoing cultural battle. There's a roar?
against god in the public square, and against Christian expression in
particular. And unfortunately these efforts have extended to our
campuses. There have been reported efforts where religious student
organizations have been threatened with non-recognition, denied access
to university facilities, or otherwise harassed because of their
religious beliefs. There have been efforts to muzzle their speech,
efforts to mandate whom they must accept as their leaders or members,
and efforts to embrace their freedom of association. This bill, and the
house companion bill that we have already passed, protects student
organizations from such improper discrimination by universities and
colleges on the basis of their religious beliefs. As far as any far
fetched examples of what could possibly be allowed, obviously if someone
state or religious beliefs are a threat to the safety of others or
otherwise violate the law, those examples would not be protected by this
bill. But it does stop those that would invoke the power of their office
to impose their beliefs, to stifle others, or to otherwise advance an
agenda of indoctrination or coercion. Members of the house, we have a
very good vote on the house companion bill and I again ask for your
support today. thank you.

family will please stand and let us welcome you and please accept our

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker and members, and I
sent this amendment by email this morning to Representative Jones. We
haven’t had a chance because of all the other committees meeting today
to actually talk about it, but I certainly didn’t want to surprise him
at all on the floor with it. We had some of this debate the other day in
the committee, so I’ll try to set up the background for it and for this
amendment. The bills did pass, I think corresponding bills last year,
there was much debate and discussion over the policy and pretty much on
a partisan line vote, which I’m hoping we can avoid today. As a result
of that, it was my understanding that the university’s board of
governers was getting ready to adopt a policy which would have, I think,
negated the necessity for this bill. I thought there was some agreement
to do that but that’s probably best left for a debate on the bill
itself. Nonetheless, it was clear that the universities and the board
were engaged in discussions, and campuses were passing their own
policies. My concern in the committee the other day was threefold: One
that we’d not be contradicting or passing a statute which was
contradicting board of governers policy that was getting ready to pass,
as well as university policies at different campuses. Second, that we be
consistent in saying at the front end to the extent allowed by state and
federal law, that we also be consistent with the equal opportunity
policies on campuses, and not put universities in a position where we
were likely to set them up for litigation. But most importantly, it was
in the second little “i” in each paragraph. I think it is correct to say
that this bill actually does change the role of the university in
granting recognition, but it’s designed to do that. And so while I know
its sponsors don’t believe that to be true, I believe that ’s exactly
what it does, but I don’t know that there’s anything unconstitutional
about that. That’s a policy matter, it may not be a good policy, it may
be a bad, but what is a problem is this second little subsection. The
argument was made the other day by Senator Tuchek in committee that
although we want leadership in organizations to be faithful to the
mission of that organization, and that’s what subsection litte “i” does,
that we want to have a diversity policy with regard to who can join
clubs and organizations on campus because that’s part of being at a
university, and also allowing those clubs and organizations to function
and grow. Well, subsection two, though, does the opposite. Because what
subsection two does is it says specifically that the organization may
limit themselves with respect to how they govern their organization as
to policies that they adopt in written form. An organization, therefore,
and I’ve talked to university council and I’ve talked to a number of
lawyers since yesterday, and as far as I can tell they’re all in pretty
much agreement. That unless we modify that little subsection, what can
happen is, as a classic example, assume that there’s a group on campus
and we’ll call it, for our purposes, “The Student KKK Club”.  And an
African American or a Jew decides that they want to join that club. And
they agree that despite their status, whether that’s their color or
religion, they agree with the policies of that club, which may well be
true in some cases. What Senator Tuchek said the bill would allow is
that that person would then have the right to be a member of that
organization, and I think that’s a good thing, I think that’s the
correct response. But what the bill’s provision says is if the student
organization’s membership criteria and their written policy says, “but
because of the nature of our club we are not going to allow anyone
Jewish or black to be a member of our group”, then that’s what controls.
And I don’t think that’s what the sponsors intend, but that is in effect
what the words say. And so my amendment isn’t trying to get at the broad
policy issues, it’s not trying to change the role that the</p>

<p id="025:00">
...Majority once for the university and its governances. But it is
trying to get at that one issue. So if you look at what I have drafted
with the help of others and after talking with council at a number of
universities it says, to the extent allowed by state and federal law and
consistent with the institutions EEO policies, a religious or political
student organization may in conformity with their written doctrine.
Their established written doctrine. Not doctrine they create on the spur
of the moment. Not doctrine that's created by amendment to deal with one
specific issue. It's got to be established written doctrine that
expresses their faith or mission. And they can determine the persons who
profess faith their mission to then be the ones who they chose for
leadership. And they may then as a result as well limit membership and
participation in the organization to students who upon inquiry affirm
their faith in that organizations mission. So if someone wants to be, as
Representative Sam said the other day, wants to be a Democrat invading
the Republican club to take it over. Aside from the fact that the
Republican club can pass an attendance policy to stop that from
happening in order to get enough Republicans there to stop it. If they
believe in the organization, if this person's not in effect really
committed. What they're trying to do is infiltrate the organization to
devolve it, to dissolve it. The organization will have the ability to
deal with that. What they may not do under this amendment,that they
apparently do have the right to do under the bill that I'm trying to
stop. Is they can't say to me, in that KKK example, &quot;Well, you may
agree with us but you're Jewish and we don't want any Jews in the
club,&quot; or, &quot;You're Black and you can't be in the club.&quot;
It distinguishes between status and belief. The organization has a right
to make sure that the people who join it have a belief. I think that in
fact is the law and I think that's what the sponsors intend. But, what
they don't have a right to do, and what will put the university in an
instant litigation in my view all across the state, is to declare
someone because of the color of their skin, or their religion, or their
gender, that they may not be a member of this group even if they
actually profess faith and belief to the organization's missions. That's
the problem I'm trying to solve. Forget all the others, we can debate
those. And so with that in mind because I believe it does what it needs
to do to make the distinguish and characteristic between belief and
status what Senator Soucek said the bill was intended to do. I move
adoption of my amendment. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Sam please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The (??) right now survey the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I oppose the amendment for about three reasons. First, if you'll look on
line nine and ten which applies to UNC and it's the same issue at many
colleges. The first little phrase there, &quot;To the extent allowed by
state and federal law,&quot; is just surplus because of course we're
governed by federal law and the state law involved is this law itself.
But the real kicker is the next line, &quot;And consistent with the
constituent institution equal opportunity policies.&quot; That's exactly
the problem. We had all these PC institutions setting up speech codes
and requirements for organizations. And others will speak to the supreme
court decision that necessitated this. That sets the UNC Board of
Governors, which for a moment happens to be Republican majority but who
knows in the far future, sets their decisions up above the
organization's own internal mission. And that is what is wrong. Now we
go down to the bottom here about this scenario about some KKK group. I
remember 30 years ago when we had the Equal Access Act passed by the
Congress, signed by President Reagan, that gives equal access in
secondary education for Bible clubs and things like that on an equal
basis with any other extra-curricular activity during non-instructional
time. At that time we had people talking about, &quot;Oh, there's going
to be witches covens meeting in all the high schools of America. We're
going to have terrorist groups. We're going to have White supremacists
groups claiming this equal access.&quot; It hasn't happened. The same,
now Representative Glazier is claiming that we're going to have people
trying to form KKK groups on UNC campuses. But, then...take away from
the KKK group you could then have the Republicans trying to take over
the Democrats who only have...</p>

give a written statement or a forum that they support their goals. Well
guess what, I bet the goals of the Democratic party are so wonderful
that even with a good conscious I could probably support those goals if
I wink and nod about it. I urge you to defeat this amendment which guts
the bill.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and I'll be brief. So Representative Stam in
response to his comments. If I was seeking to gut the bill I would have
never had sent the amendment this morning to Representative Jones to
read and prepare. I'd just simply sprung it on the House floor which
would've been perfectly my right to do so. I didn't do that because that
wasn't the intent. Secondly, I appreciate the fact that the Board of
Governors can change. In fact the Board of Governors who wanted to pass
a policy today was dominantly appointed by the majority members. His
republican control and this amendment is consistent with the policy they
were attempting to pass that you are now taking away from them today.
Third, this is not an attempt to get at the core issues which is to make
sure that university complies with not a political correctness test but
it actually moves them form a limit public form to a more open public
form which I think is the intent of sub-section A. And it doesn't touch
that. But it very much does touch exactly what the case law touches on
and I'm sort of tired of I guess saying the same thing but there is a
big difference between your status and your belief. And while we can't
solve everything here we can at least make sure that we are not creating
a policy that is in violation of equal opportunity on campuses that
causes more problems than it answers. And in the extent that there's a
problem that he majority has with equal opportunity, we have a bigger
problem than this bill on the floor. I thought we were all committed to
that regardless of where it plays out. And to the extent that
Representative Stam suggests that the problem with this amendment is in
the term &quot;equal opportunity&quot; that's precisely the issue we're
trying to get at. Which is we don't, we may keep people out of
organizations if we choose to do so because we don't believe that
they're faithful to the mission. We don't keep them out because they're
Black. We don't keep them out because they're Hispanic. We don't keep
them out because they're Baptist or Jew and it works all different ways
and that's all that's attempting to do. To the extent that the majority
fills otherwise, well that's a disappointment but that is what this
amendment is attempting to do. I urge it's adoption.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jones please state your purpose.

Thank you Mr. Speaker. I did want to take the opportunity to thank my

I apologize, but I've been in committee meetings all day I didn't see
it. But I appreciate the gesture. I wanted to acknowledge that but
ladies and gentleman we did have this debate in edu...whatever committee
we had then [LAUGHING]. My mind is tired and it failed miserably there
and I do ask for you to oppose the amendment. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brandon please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I am in support of this bill but I'm also in support of this amendment
because it did, we did talk about this in Education Committee and
Represent...I mean Senator Soucek made it very clear that exactly what
we were talking about was not the case but now is the case. There are
lots of us on both sides of the aisle that would love to support this
bill. I am clearly have been in support of all of these bills that come
through because I think it's very important to clarify the rights of
students in the public schools and what they are able to do and what
they are not able to do. But, what we should not be doing in this body
and it's very clear from the Board of Governors who had the policy that
they're trying to implement today and through all the universities, is
that we do not discriminate based of people because of who they are.
Everybody has their rights including the African American that wants to
join the KKK club. That is also a right and so it is just as much of a
right for every single person to be able to exercise their religious
beliefs on campuses. And I think that the bill...</p>

In its broader term does that and I support that but there’s no way
people on our side of the aisle and most people will be able to support
a policy that says because of who you are, you can’t join something. So
yes, we did pass it out of education committee, but we were misled about
where it was. Now that we have clarified that, I think it’s incumbent
upon this group to be able to make the best bill that we can have, make
sure that if we don’t have much litigation and we don’t put our
universities ?? with organizations and litigation that has to go far. So
a very simple amendment. It does not change anything about the broader
base of it, but it does allow us to have broad support and continue to
moving on without litigation. I urge you to support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Robert Brawley, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I think the reason we’re down
here is a very good reason to oppose this amendment. The way I read the
amendment, you have to basically swear to being of one like mind in
order to join the organization. I don’t think any organization is going
to survive very long if everybody in it has to follow one line and one
path. And if you believe in diversity, I don’t think you want that
either. I would ask that you vote down the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the amendment. If not the question
before the House is the passage of the amendment to the Senate Committee
Substitute to Senate Bill 719. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote
no. The clerk will open the vote. [PAUSE] The clerk will let the machine
record the vote. 44 having voted affirmative, 71 in the negative, the
amendment fails. We are now back on the bill. Further discussion,
further debate. Representative Larry Hall, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To send forward an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to send forth an
amendment. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Larry
hall moves to amend the bill on page 1 lines 32 through 33 by rewriting
the lines to read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to
debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies
and gentlemen of the House, during education committee, I had the
opportunity to speak with Representative Jones as we considered the bill
and talk about the amendment concerns that I have that are reflected in
the amendment before you. And what this amendment does is say that there
will be some type of appeal procedure for a member of these groups and
individual that has already met whatever the group criteria is to be a
member and has achieved either through election or whatever process the
group has, a leadership position, that they if they are removed or
accused of somehow not being faithful to the cause, that they will have
some type of appeal procedure within that organization. That is all the
amendment does. It just makes sure we not only assure the rights of the
organization to exist, but also that we assure the rights of the members
of that organization to have an appeal should they be removed from a
position under the rules. This again requires the organization, not the
university. The university has no control over these organizations. This
is for the organization to have a review or appeal process for the
organization’s individual members. So I’d ask your support on the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank you Representative Hall. I appreciate
the discussion that we had in the committee and as we briefly had a
chance to talk about at the end, I would simply say that I would oppose
the amendment. I would really like to see this bill completed. We passed
it in the House. This bill was passed in the Senate. I’d like to see it
completed and moved forward. I really don’t think that it’s necessary,
quite frankly, that the legislature has to make this decision. I think
the way that the way that the bill’s currently written is perfectly
fine. And perhaps this is a measure that we can talk about on another
day. But for this particular bill and this particular form that it is,
I’d like for it to go forward and I would ask that you oppose the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Larry Hall, please state
your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just to speak a second time on the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the
amendment a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, thank you Mr. Speaker.
Thank you Representative Jones. And I do note that there’s really no
objection been expressed to individual members of the organization
having a right to a review or appeal, and so if we’re going to be about
individual’s rights as well as these organizations’ rights it would see
we would want them to have an opportunity to go before their peers in
their organization and get a fair shake if they’re willing to put
themselves forward for leadership. So again I would ask you to support
the amendment. There’s really no objection to it.</p>

Thank you Mr. Speaker and once again I do appreciate my friends
discussion on this. However I think this particular bill seeks to allow
a student organization to determine it's own purpose. I don't fully
understand all the repercussions. But I don't want to allow an
individual to go in, perhaps with the wrong motivation to try and hurt
that organization. And I think that this could have ramifications that
we're not comfortable with.  I'd like more time to look at it perhaps in
another venue, another bill. I just ask that you allow this bill to go
forward as it stands today and please oppose this amendment. Thank you.

CHANGES] To speak on the bill Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is
recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker.
ladies and gentlemen of the House I was in the education committee when
we debated the bill. I had some concerns then I have some now. I know
that there is probably not anyone on this floor who has worked with
students as long as I have on a university, college campus. And who has
as much respect for students and their rights. But I also know that
universities have responsibilities as well. And when I asked the bill
sponsor in the committee if he had spoken to any of the universities he
said he did not. He had spoken to a number of students. This bill is
drafted for students. And I know how important it is to support them.
Because I've had a bill for a number of years to give the students a
vote on the Board of Governors. They could have a vote and be talking
about this issue. I also reached out to a number of universities in my
district and some not in my district and asked their legal folk about
this bill and the impact that it would have. I think that my first
concern about it is that while we are pro ported to protect student's
rights. If a student can get membership into the organization and cannot
serve as a leader in that organization. In my opinion that is
discriminatory on it's face and that is the first problem that I have
with it. In other words you can come in, we will let you come in, you
will pay your dues and all those things. But you cannot be elected as a
leader. So I don't support discrimination in any fashion. So to allow me
as a student to come into an organization but not be able to participate
as a leader. To be elected. I think that is the first thing we are doing
wrong. But as I talked to the universities in my district they indicated
that this bill is not needed. Because if there is a problem on the
campus the Board of Governors or the Board of Trustees should deal with
those matters. But what is interesting to me that the University Board
of Governors that was appointed by this body had a policy that they were
getting ready to vote on today, at least that was the understanding that
I had, that came through the committee on University Governance. Which
would have basically put a policy in place. And I wonder why that policy
is not good enough.</p>

<p id="045:00">
…and I’d sort of like, Mr. Speaker, if I could direct a question to
Representative Jones about that policy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones does gentlemen yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I did.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones I think you probably are aware of
the proposal for the new policy that the Board of Governors was
considering. Why is that policy not good enough?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for your question Representative Adams. Let
me just start by saying that I’ve been working on this issue, along with
Senator Soucek, now for well over a year and I have a very different
understanding from you as far as his consultation with administrators on
universities. I happen to think from my conversations with him that he’s
consulted quite a bit. Quite frankly, after we passed the house version
of this bill last year, I was quite content to move it right through the
Senate but he held it up for some period of time while he was moving
with some of these conversations. I would just kind of reiterate what I
think Representative Stam alluded to earlier, that we don’t have the
same Board of Governors from year to year, decade to decade. We don’t
have the same university presidents. I think we’re a nation of laws and
not of men and frankly, I would rather us clarify that our students do
have first amendment rights and what they are in the law rather than
entrusting them to university administrators or boards of governors or
boards of trustees or whomever. Student organizations, I believe, have a
right to exist and I think that this bill does not keep any colleges or
universities from being what [??] oversight or making decisions if such
organizations should not exist on their campus for reasons of safety or
whatever. I understand your comment earlier where you said you don’t
support discrimination in any fashion and I think everybody in this
chamber would say that we don’t support discrimination because of race,
for instance, or ethnic background or because of the amount of money in
your bank account or anything like that but I would suggest that in our
society that political correctness has gone amuck. There is a such thing
as discrimination in a sense that I think everybody in this chamber that
is married made a discrimination when you chose your spouse among all
the others out there. I’m well aware that there are groups like
republican and democrat men’s groups or women’s groups and they have
specific criteria of what it takes to join those groups. I don’t think
that’s an improper discrimination. I don’t think the Girl Scouts are a
discriminatory group because they don’t allow boys to join. I think we
need to get away from the political correctness gone amuck and we need
to recognize that these students have first amendment rights and it
should not be left up to a fleeting administrator or university
president or a board of directors or Board of Governors or a board of
trustees whomever to make those determinations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for your response. I was thinking more about
the fact that those bodies, the Board of Governors, the board of
trustees, they set pol…and actually our Board of Governors set policy so
we wouldn’t be talking about… just as we set laws here and we change
every two years sometimes. Hopefully we won’t have a complete wipeout.
Sometimes that is possible too. As I was reading about this whole issue,
I came across the Martinez case which speaks to all comers and in fact I
direct a question to Representative Glazier, Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, you familiar with the Martinez
case and the meaning of the all comers and the whole resolution that
came from that case?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Representative Adams. I am aware. I think the case
you refer to is the Christian Legal Society Chapter of the University of
California - Hastings College of Law vs. Martinez.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What does it say about the vision of separation and
state and how does it define all comers and usage of that as it relates
to student organizations?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Adams. The question in that
case that came to the Supreme Court that…</p>

Was decided was whether or not the university's all comer's policy was
allowed there to be distinctions in leadership but did not allow there
to be determinations made on the basis of status with respect to
membership in groups and specifically the question became whether the
university passed first amendment muster or was in some way
discriminatory by making or providing that student groups had to accept
membership from all comers and not based on their status. And the
question in that case came to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled
5-4 that the university's policy, which required open membership in the
organizations, was constitutional, did not violate the students' first
amendment rights, was consistent with California's equal education
opportunity policies and made it clear that one of the things the
university policy was trying to get at was to prohibit and prevent
student organizations from becoming subterfuge if you will for different
partisan political beliefs, for different issues with regard to
organizations that the university thought that student money ought not
be spent all around everywhere if there were real limitations being
placed on who could be members of those organizations and that the
university as a university had a right to want to ensure that all
students had access to student organizations and membership in those
organizations and if an organization chose because of the status of
someone to just decline membership in those organizations that that
didn't fulfil the mission of the University of California's system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Thank you. Just to make one final comment,
I think that we are treading dangerous water. We have a Board of
Governors, I wish it were more diverse, really I do, but it's not, but
it does have, and we've given the Board of Governors the authority to
set policy like this, but greater than that, each university already
has, and I've talked with a number of them, they have it, and I think we
are treading in an area where we are looking at violation between
separation between state and church where these organizations now, the
universities, if this bill is passed, and maybe that's really the
intent, that the university would have to support financially these
organizations and some of the discriminatory practices, and when you
don't allow someone who is a member of the organization to serve in the
capacity of leadership then that's discrimination and I think we really
need to be concerned about that. I think that this bill is really
problematic. It will be problematic for the universities. Every one,
every university that I've spoken to says that. They say that it's not
needed, and I don't know why if we would elect members of the Board of
Governors that we would try to circumvent a policy that we asked them to
put in place in the first place. And I would certainly encourage you to
vote against this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hamilton,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair, I
would like to be recorded as voting aye on the amendment, the Larry Hall

Representative Schaffer, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of
this bill and would urge members to support it. Just last week we spoke
about student's rights and we heard it on the floor today, that students
do have first amendment rights that they do not shed at the schoolhouse
gate. That applies at the K-12 level, it applies also at the
college/university level. This is a policy decision that we want to
make. It supports the constitution that we want to support student's
rights to freely associate, to freely associate around religious
beliefs, other mission based beliefs, and so this is what this bill is
about, and I do want to speak a moment to the Martinez case as well.
There were a few points that were made about the holding in that case
but what's very important is the Martinez case is the very reason why we
need this bill. The Supreme Court in Christian Legal Society vs.
Martinez said that Hastings College of Law</p>

…that the policy was okay. That is was constitutional. It did not say
that schools were required to have such policies. And, so we as a
governing body are making today, if this bill passes, and again I urge
your support of it, we are making the decision that it is not okay for
universities to engage in this kind of conduct. We do want our student
organizations to be free to associate around such beliefs, such
religious beliefs, such mission based beliefs. And, have the authority

To inquiry of the Chair, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I know we're recessing subject to re-referral but just so
we know, since we're all going into caucus, is there going to be in our,
as we exit out, a re-referral of any bills for the calendar for when we
come back after recess? If so, we would request that re-referral-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We will-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There will be, Representative Glazier, more than likely a number of
bills added to the calendar but that will happen after we come back.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Well, since we're all going into caucus and so it would be
helpful, I think, to the process and perhaps speed us along if there
could be information given to both caucuses about what bills are coming
back on so that we can try to find our positions, do our work, and not
have to take up more time on the floor in delayed amendments.</p>

that we heard last session and there was a little debate on sex

When we sent it over to the Senate, it had an effective date of December
1, 2013. Of course we didn't make that deadline so there needed to be an
amendment done to December 1, 2014, however once it got into committee,
a few senators, Senator Randleman in specific, had a problem with
delaying it. She was concerned that if we made it effective December 1,
then that gave people 5 or 6 months to move to where they wanted to move
and then they would be grandfathered in and so she asked me would it be
OK to change it to make it effective upon passage and I told her that
was fine with me, and I do move to concur. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further

..want to rush this when we can wait until tomorrow. When, all the
members can have a chance overnight to read the bill. Why would we not
want to do that? This is a major environmental policy bill. It is a bill
that has bi-partisan support. There are a number of people on our side
of the aisle who support the bill. There is no reason to push it. Why
would you want to vote on a bill that you’re not seeing until right now?
And, that members is why we should vote against the motion to hear the
bill right now. We should hold off until tomorrow, which we can easily
do. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Samuelson please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will be bringing people’s attention to your dashboard. It’s on the
dashboard now. Many of the parts of this bill are bills that have either
already passed through here or already came through ERC and some other
committees so they have been out for awhile and filed for awhile. They
were available for us to read. As Rep. Luebke said, it was bi-partisan
support. I’m willing to go through all the parts of it and to make sure
we all understand it. We can put it off until another day, but I don’t
think it will change the outcome and would recommend that we go ahead
and do it now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Jackson, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman I would ask you to vote
against the motion. I don’t think we should consider this bill today.
I’m going to briefly tell you why. I had the same remarks I was going to
make on the regulatory reform. It was attempted to be added on. It’s
twenty something pages long and I would  like to read it. I would like
to understand it. I’m going to give you a real world example. If you’ll
look at the regulatory reform bill of last year, house bill 74, there’s
an error in it. It pretends at the bottom to say, except as otherwise
provided, this act is effective when it becomes law. However, there was
a clause that was mistakenly left in the bill about four sentences
higher that actually makes most of the regulatory reform bill effective
July 1st, 2015. That’s something that I discovered when I finally got to
the end of the bill while everybody was doing stuff last year when we
asked not to add it all. It was on page 58 or 59. I went and checked
with staff and they told me yes I was right and that was a mistake and
it would mess up the intent of the bill. But, we just rushed it through.
I’m not… I don’t know how I’m going to vote on the bill. I haven’t read
it yet. But, I would ask for the night to consider it. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep.  Collins, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Inquire of the chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse my procedural ignorance here. I know there are such things as
three day bills, and I’ve not yet been able to learn exactly what they
are, what qualifies as that. Is this a bill that we could have second
and third reading both on tomorrow and vote on? Or is this one that has
to stretch over three days? That might determine how I vote on this
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This bill could be. We could take both readings without objection
tomorrow. Otherwise, there will be a Friday session. If there is
objection, we take up second reading tomorrow. Or, if we take it up on
second reading tomorrow. If there is objection, it is the intent of the
chair to have a Friday session. Rep. Larry Hall please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker I think you came up with a good idea in your
discussion with Rep. Collins in that is that we that we do it on second
and third tomorrow. I have the same concerns that Rep. Jackson has, that
not only have we not had a chance to read the bill. I was in finance and
some other meetings regarding bills that we didn’t get a chance to
review. I have a lot of constituents who want to read bills and tell me
from their expertise or personal experience how it effects them. So, I’d
know how to respond to it or make amendments to it. Mr. Speaker I would
certainly on behalf of the democratic caucus agree to second and third
on tomorrow. We would certainly want our constituents to have an
opportunity to read the bill and let us know what they would want to
know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Hall as I understand that if we carry this over until tomorrow
there will not be objection to third reading and we can dispose of it
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s our intention.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Then, the Chair would ask Rep. Moore to be recognized to withdraw his
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker. Based on the agreement to second and third tomorrow, we
withdraw the motion to add this particular bill to today’s counter.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask the Bill Sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Goodman does the gentleman do?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Goodman, the title references an assessment and you have
mentioned a special tax district and assessment is not a tax, is that
correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I talk to bill drafting about that is I think those words can be use to
interchangeably in this case.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ___[01:40] please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Representative Stem would you yell for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stem this is gentleman yell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stem is an assessment a tax?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The label is not determinative a tax is for the general support of the
government, an assessment is something that improves the property. So,
to  confess I really wasn’t paying a whole lot of attention to the
debate but the property sounds to me like an assessment rather than a
tax but you do have to pay it whether you liked it or not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Goodman if the gentleman will yell for a moment as some
chairs understanding that this is a ___[02:33] Bill so that reading it
end today was first reading we cannot take it up until tomorrow anyway.
So, we have got 24 hours to put it in the clock but Representative
___[02:42] knew the answer of your question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to move forward to the public bills
on the second page of the supplemental calendar to give members an
opportunity to look at all of the local bills that are eligible for
second and third reading voice vote and determine whether or not the
chamber is amenable to vote and those as a go. So, if you will please
look at all the middle of the first page of the supplemental calendar
local bills under second and third readings with one additional one on
the top of the second page, I will come back and see if there is
objection to voting any of those as a group. And without objection we
will move forward to…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ___[03:28] please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We are just getting a copy of it, supplemental calendar. So, could you
give me about a minute or two?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Actually, I’m gonna give you more than that what I was wanting to do as
I move to the public calendar so we will discuss the local bill to see
the individual as a group at the end of the public calendar. House Bill
1088, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 1088 in act to direct the state highway control, to study the
feasibility and cost effectiveness of contracting with local businesses
to perform maintenance on the state highway patrol vehicles and

and effective administration of justice. The General Assembly enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Davis, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. This bill would direct AOC to study and develop a case
management system for civil cases in superior court, designed to make
more efficient use of superior court time and resources, including a
more flexible designation of mixed sessions. The studies show ?? system
allowing exception cases to be assigned to a superior court judge to
oversee the case. AOC shall report to the joint legislative oversight
committee on justice and public safety by March 1, 2015. The mixed
sessions, as a lot of you all may know, are when a superior court judge
has a criminal session for a week. It may break down after a couple of
days. And the judges go home. Same thing with civil court. What this
would enable a criminal court judge to do during a criminal court
session if the criminal court ends, then that judge would have the
authority to contact civil lawyers and ask if there are any pre-trial
motions or any other pre-trial matters that might need to be heard, to
keep things moving along. On the other side of the coin, if there was a
civil session and it broke down early, this would allow the judge to
contact the district attorney and lawyers and say if you all have got
any pleas you want me to take or any other pre-trial motions you want me
to hear, then I’ll entertain those, once again making more efficient
time and expense that we pay the judges to do their work. So I would ask
for your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate.
If not, the question before the House is the passage of House Bill 1089
on its second reading. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The
clerk will open the vote. [PAUSE] The clerk will lock the machine and
record the vote. 113 having voted in the affirmative, none in the
negative, House Bill 1089 has passed its second reading and without
objection, will be read a third time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The General
Assembly of North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion,
further debate. If not, the question before the House is the passage of
House Bill 1089 on its third reading. All in favor say aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed say no. The ayes have it.
House Bill 1089 has passed its third reading and will be sent to the
Senate. Ladies and gentlemen again, just as a reminder, if you will
please review the second and third reading bills at the midsection of
the first page of the supplemental calendar and the first bill, House
Bill 1247 on the second page, if we group those, those will be voice
votes. House Bill 1090, the clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] House
Bill 1090, an act to direct the administrative courts to develop a
written, comprehensive policy for the management of information
technology resources, as recommended by the legislative research
committee on judicial efficiency and effective administration of
justice. The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Davis, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
In view of the massive quantity of technological equipment that the AOC
has, what this bill would do, it would require the AOC to develop a
written comprehensive policy for the management of information
technology resources.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Davis, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
This particular bill would require the AOC to study the appointment and
supervision of magistrates. The studies shall consider whether the
supervision of magistrates should be the responsibility of some person
other than the chief district court judge, and shall address whether any
other changes should be made to the process for appointing and
supervising magistrates. AOC shall report to the joint legislative
oversight committee on justice and public safety by March 1, 2015. I
would ask for your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion,

Bill 1031 has passed its third reading, will be sent to the Senate.
House Bill 1094, the clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] House Bill 1094,
an act to provide for mediated settlement conferences and district court
civil actions and to make a technical correction to the rules of civil
procedure, is recommended by the legislative research commissions
committee on judicial efficiency and effective administration of
justice. The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Davis, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
At the present time, the statutes allow for a mediated settlement
conference to be ordered in civil district court in cases involving
family court. And that’s the only area that is required. The
jurisdiction for district court was increased from 10,000 to $25,000.
Prior to that increase, which was $10,000 limit, that extra 15,000 was
in superior court and subject to mandatory mediation. Those cases are
now in district court. So what this bill will do will be to enable
mediation to be done on all civil cases in district court, not only
family law cases but other cases as well. The rationale being the more
cases that you can get settled and keep out of the court, the more cost
efficient and judicial efficiency you will have within our system. So I
would ask that you all please support this, because overall I think this
would be a good thing for the legal system, help us to keep as many
cases as possible out of court so the court can use its time more wisely
for issues that need to be there. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further
discussion, further debate. If not, the question before the House is the
passage of the House Committee Substitute to House Bill 1094 on its
