I'd like to introduce some pages who are with us today, Rayquon
Anderson, Rayquon, good to see you, you're off over to my right, Rayquon
is from Wilson County and his sponsor is Senator Bryant. Odom Williford,
Odom is also off to my right. Odom is from Orange County and his sponsor
is Senator Nesbitt and we're glad to have both of you gentlement with us
today, and hope that this will be informative for you. Our
Sergeant-at-Arms -- Sergeants-at-Arms, Ashley Meckins, Steve Wilson, Ed
Kessler, Donna Blake, Billy Fritcher. And we're glad to have you
gentlemen in  doing your usual fine job with us.  We have five bills on
our agenda today, and the past couple of weeks we have run overtime, but
we're not going to do that today because we do need to be out of here by
11:50. I would encourage the members who have questions or comments on
the bills to keep them as brief as possible and do not try to
fillibuster the bill to death please. First item up that we have today
is Senate bill 557, Senator Hise, amend report date, NC Pre-K Funding
Pilot.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the Committee. Senate bill 557, for
those who were here last term, is, in concept, something that you've all
seen before. This was a budget provision in last year's budget. The
reason I am rerunning it as a bill and changing the dates on it is this
was a study that was never done by the department. In fact, at the time,
the intern used -- the department used interns to model as though the
study had been completed and submitted this results to the secretary to
send to us as though we had done a pilot program, the secretary did not
submit that as their final report, this is still information that we
think is important, we think it's information we need if we're going to
consider doing classroom funding as a whole, so this bill is before us
today to again request that the department, under new management, would
actually do the pilot program they were required to do previously.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You've read for questions, Senator Wade?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At the appropriate time I will move for a favorable response.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis, from the west, did you want to speak first? I thought I
saw your hand first.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[inaudible response]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis of the east?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks, Mr. Chair. My question is, Senator Hise, was there an official
statement or anything shared on behalf of the department? I'm just
trying to understand what took place.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think, and staff might be able to speak to that better, I think that
the report that came from the department stated that the survey had not
been done, at least, that was the communication I had with the secretary
at the time when she discovered what had occurred. So...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that's accurate, Senator Hise, further questions from members of
the Comittee? Senator Rabin?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I have to ask, Senator Hise, what action was taken against
the people who sent the false information or tried to send the false
information forward?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I've been assured by the secretary that action has been taken, and
that's the limits, when you get into personnel, that I would have
received on this matter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis from the east, for a second time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks, Mr. Chair. I'm just curious, were there any indications of
complications with trying to conduct and deliver the report? I mean,
this is just a little odd, it appears.</p>

doesn't happen and it's important to do it at the hospital because
sometimes it does take awhile before that mother gets that baby and for
some of them, they aren't getting directly to a pediatrician and I know
that. So it's important to have that education up front that you outta
have that vaccine because whooping cough can be passed on so I commend
you for that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you and I think that's important to know because
you get what, if I pronounce this correctly but, ?? infections. So the
infections occur within the hospital and they're passed on, it's
contagious, so that's the rationale for doing this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further questions from members of the committee?
Seeing none. Recognized Senator Davis for motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Move for favorable report, Mr. Karen?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You've heard the motion, all those in favor please say
aye. Opposed no. Motion carries the bill, will go to the senate for ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator Tarp.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Next is Senate Bill 488: Amend Nursing Home
Administrator Act Fees, Senator Tucker. And there is a PCS to this bill.
We need motion to consider it a PCS for Senator Wade. All those in favor
say aye. All opposed no. The PCS before you, go ahead Senator Tucker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, there is also an amendment I think that all
the members have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, wait just one second. Yes, an amendment, go
ahead, who's amendment is this? Is this a staff amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mine
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Go ahead and explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Conaird
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I moved this politically correct amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tucker, are you sure this is your amendment?
Senator Conaird has graciously recommended the adoption of the passage
of the amendment. All those in favor, please say aye. All opposed no.
Now the bill is before you, the PCS. Senator Tucker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. I corrected that last night when
I was reading 'cause I knew that Senator Conaird would be here or
Senator Robinson and I did not want the wrath of those two. This is
Amend of Nursing Home Administrator Act and Fees. The statues on the
nursing homes have not been changed since 1969 and there's been no
increase in fees. It does, since 2004, it does increase the fees and
also it requires for a four year degree to manage or be licensed to
manage a nursing home. There are folks that don't have a four year
degree that will be grandfathered and those who are in transitional
periods now training with a two year degree, this won't take affect
until I think January 2015 so they don't get caught up in the bill. I'll
be glad to answer any questions and we have Mr. Chair and Ms. Baker,
representative executive director of the nursing home administrators
here as well, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Members of the committee, are there any
questions? Senator Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Question about the public records provision
confidentiality on page 5 and this is for either Senator Tucker or
staff. But I know that we've done similar provisions as it related to
medical board and state bar and as I recall, that there was some
language having to do with when the matter has been adjudicated and it's
been closed and something was found, then the records would become
public. I didn't know if that was in here or contemplated.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, asked Ms. Raleigh who helped me with the
bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Senator Stein. There is language here that makes a
notice or a statement of the charges, notice the hearing and the
decision. They all do become a public record. This provision, though,
does mirror though, not exactly but is very close to the same provisions
that are for a number of licensure boards, in fact a couple that we've
considered this session, where they do not make the entire, all the
records available once the decision has been rendered if that helps.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What did we do with the medical board and the state
bar before? I haven't focused on this in other licensure</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES].
If you give me a minute, I would have to look at the Medical Board
provision, but I don't believe they have to release the entire record.
It would take me a minute to look...
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
How about this? I like the bill, why don't we talk after this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yes, sir. I'll be amenable to discuss it and if there needs to be a
change we'll do so.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you.

Further questions from members of the Committee?
Senator Tucker, you said that someone was here from the public that
would like to have a comment on this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Mr. Chair, Mrs. Baker is here just in case we had questions from the
Nursing Home Administrators, she's Executive Director. She doesn't
really need to speak to unless there are some difficult questions I
could not answer for the Committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Simply, at an appropriate time, I just move for a favorable report. I
think it's a good bill and I think it moves in the right direction, I
like the grandfathering provisions, but...
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
You know, it gives those people transition if they're in the pipeline
right now, but I think it's the right way to professionalize this group
of individuals.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Wade.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Tucker, I just wanted to commend you for bringing this bill
forward. I think we need to take a lot of looks at nursing homes and the
care that's being given, and make sure we can do everything possible
here at the state level to make sure that care is excellent.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Well thank you, ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Further questions from members of the Committee?
Seeing none. Senator McKissick, you are recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Move for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
To the Committee Substitute as amended?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
That is exactly correct, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
And unfavorable to the original bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
That is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
And re-referral to Finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Re-referral to Finance is included in that motion. I like the way you
put it. Very succinctly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Excellent motion, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
You're most welcome.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
All those in favor of the motion, please say aye. All opposed, no. The
motion carries. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, members of Committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Hise, recognized for Senate Bill 553, LME/MCO Enrollee
Grievances &amp; Appeals. This bill also has a PCS, is there a motion to
consider the PCS? Senator Randleman.
All in favor say aye. All opposed, no. The PCS is before you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee, and I will begin to
say that I have some staff who can come at much more on the legal side
of this bill. Again, I don't play an attorney and allege such, that's
coming over. The purpose of this bill is really twofold. It is one, to
clarify and streamline the appeal processes dealing specifically with
LME/MCO's as we have the state. And to create an appeal process that
recognizes that they are LME/MCO's. We kind of got into a position where
we took our appeal process that existed under current fee for service
models and ported it in to the LME/MCO's. It's led to some very
interesting complications that we are dealing with now all across the
state and we're really trying to adjudicate those and move them forward
at a more consistent rate and looking more at the standings and medical
necessities that are made by third party and how those are appealed.
This bill is looking specifically at the individual side. I know some in
the House kind of got into the provider side, but we've kind of narrowed
this focus down in this particular bill. So, I'd be happy to take any
questions that you may have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Good Morning. It's kind of a long bill as you can tell, so I will go
quickly through it and then be happy to answer any more specific
questions that you have. So, starting on the first page is the
definitions section, and I'll say there are two sort of guiding
principles that I believe the bill sponsor used in this. One is the code
of Federal Regulations that pertain to a grievance system for managed
care. If you look at the background of the summary, this last paragraph
under the background sort of explains that. So that was one of the
things and you'll see continuous references in here to the code to try
and make sure we're in compliance and consistent with that. The other
guiding principle was to, and Senator Hise, I don't want to put words in
your mouth so if you disagree this, was to mirror the current appeal
process in place for Medicaid to the extent that it was practical and
possible</p>

<p id="20:00">
Representative: in the preference of the sponsor. So, essentially, this
sets up a new chapter, 108D, for LMEMCO agreements and repeals, page 1
is all of the definitions and, again, as I said earlier, you will see
references to federal code in that. Section 2, which is 108D too, sets
out the scope of applicability of the chapter to apply to every LMEMCO,
to every applicant enrollee provider of emergency services and network
provider of a LMEMCO. Section 3 of the article establishes the conflict
and severability, provides of the big picture for the enrollee,
grievance and repeal procedures. I am not sure how much detail you want
me to go into with that. Summary will provide you with an outline of
that process. Moving on along, 108D5, provides for grievances which are
set out as the filing of the grievance, the notice of the grievance, and
the appeal of the grievance disposition. Then moving down to 108D6, you
have the standard enrollee appeals. So, 5 has to do with grievances; 6,
you move into the repeal process. On the notice of managed care action,
one thing I will point out, which I mentioned before, this is one of
those cases where it mirrors the language providing for notice of
Medicaid recipient appeals. Then, if you look on page 2, under the
summary of LMEMCO standard appeals, it will give you a short paragraph
that summarizes, essentially, what is included in the request of the
appeal, the continuation of notice of benefits, notice of resolution,
right to request a contest the case hearing, and request a form for the
contest a case hearing. With regard to the continuation of benefits, the
LMEMCO shall continue the enrollee’s benefits during the dependency of
the appeal to the same extent required by federal law, and you will see
the code reference there. 108D7 provides for expedited enrollee level
appeals and this is when time limits for completing a standard appeal
could jeopardize an enrollee’s life or health, or ability to attain,
maintain or regain maximum function. So, there is a process of that, for
denial of expedited appeal, for continuation of benefits, notices to the
resolution, right to request a contested case hearing. Moving down to
the bottom of page 4, 108D8, is the contested case hearing on the
disputed managed care actions. Again, there are a number of sections in
here that mirror or are substantially similar to the current law for
Medicaid contested cases. So, I have not summarized those but have
pointed them out so that if you are comfortable with the current
Medicaid contested cases, you should be fairly comfortable with the ones
in this. That is subsection 8, simple procedures, mediation or burden of
proof, I or J, K is new evidence and L, issue for new hearing. One thing
I will point out is maybe an improvement to some extent, and certainly
works better with the LMEMCO process, you will see a footnote on page 3
of the summary that indicates one of the differences in the simple
procedures in this bill is that it allows in person hearings to be
conducted in the county that contains the NC headquarters of the LMEMCO
as opposed to the current law which provides that Medicaid cases be
heard in Wade County unless certain situations exist. So that is one
thing that may be a little bit different, I guess, more relevant to
similar situation. Then, moving to 108D9, you have the notice of final
decision and the right to seek judicial review. Section 2 amends the
definition of LMEMCO in 128C3 and I think this is a definition that you
have seen before and</p>

...and other bills. Section 3 amends 122C 151.3, to provide that the
section doesn't apply to enrollee grievances or appeals subject to
Chapter 108D,  which is what this bill enacts. 122C 151.4.  Again,
provides a similar amendment that enrollee grievances are appealed
subject to 108D are not applicable to that section. Section 5 adds a new
section to 150B, to provide that a Medicaid enrollee or network provider
acting on behalf of an enrollee who appeals a notice of resolution
issued my a LMACA?? may commence a contested case in the same manner as
any other petitioner and the case shall be conducted in the same manner
as other contested cases. Section 6 requires DHAS to submit to CMS,
Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a Medicaid state plan
amendment necessary to implement the act and section 6 provides your
effective date which specifies that the act becomes effective June 1st
of 2014. Upon approval from CMS, of the Medicaid state plan amendment
required section 6, and DHAS is required to report to the reviser of
statue when approval is obtained and the date of the approval.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird. Thank you very much, Miss Matula??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. That was a good overview. I just have one question because
I'm not familiar with this, but on page 5, line 1. Is this a change
where the Office of Administrative Hearings does not have jurisdiction?
What has been the past role of the OAH and administrative law judges?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It would be in staff messages as well. The concept of grievance, which
is under here, is the new concept thats added in the from the
application of the federal statutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Quick follow-up here because it says its the exclusive method. Now, is
that a change or has that been that way all along on the grievance
process? [brief silence]  On page 5.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are you referring to subsection A jurisdiction of OAH?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. I'm just wondering is that a change.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Consistent with what Sen. High said, OAH does not have jurisdiction over
the dispute concerning a grievance. So, there is a process set up for
grievances but it does not move beyond the process that's contemplated
in the previous section of the bill and then the second sentences
provides that OAH does not have jurisdiction over a dispute involving a
managed care action except as expressly set forth in the chapter; and
yes that is new and different because it pertains to managed care
actions in the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, one last question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It seems to me that's a narrowing of options and it does say somewhere
that you do have  judicial at the very end somewhere --you can then also
– on page 7, line 38.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will speak. I'd staff like to follow-up especially if I'm stepping out
on this. The entire concept of following a grievance is a new process
allowed by this bill did not exist. So, the fact that were not putting
it under OAH is not a narrowing; it didn't exist at all prior to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnard. I'm not an expert on the current process for Medicaid
repeals. Jennifer Hillman is new to the research staff and works with
the fiscal staff in appropriations and she has relevant experience in
this area and if your question is more to how this process may differ
from the current process, then she may be able to respond better to your
question. She is sitting over there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird will get with her later.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I know a little bit about some of that current process and that's one of
my concern here. To what extent-- I understand grievances are new. I
have no problem with grievances and they are clearly defined as to what
they are or aren't.  The second line does cause me some pause having to
do with OAH does not have a dispute over involving a managed care action
except as expressed.</p>

...this chapter. My first question is who does have jurisdiction over a
management care action that is otherwise not dealt with? To what extent
does that differ from current process or law consistent with the MOU
that OAH and the department have already established with, I guess it's
DMA or somebody?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think Jennifer may be able to answer that question
for you, Senator Hartsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms. Hillman, would you like to comment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure, I'll comment on if OAH does not have
jurisdiction, then a complaint could be filed in Superior Court.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hartsell? Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Why would we want that? That's my question. I mean, we
set up a standard process throughout for appeals from administrative
matters or determinations consistently across State government and State
agencies to go to OAH. I understand the grievance piece, but why
wouldn't we want to continue to have, as long as we have defined a
managed care action as consistent with the federal definition and we
have adopted our underlying law such that it is also consistent with the
federal definitions, why would we not want to continue to have managed
care action appeals going to the body that has some express expertise in
dealing with these kinds of appeals? That's what I'm trying to figure
out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's my understanding that this bill will allow
managed care actions to be heard by OAH. It's just only as set forth in
this bill. It doesn't extend any additional jurisdiction to OAH outside
of what's expressly set forth in the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But you'd have to do a summary of what is set forth, I
mean I think that would make...I know it's medical decisions...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I know I'm being fairly technical here, Mr. Chairman,
but there is some reason behind this technicality, because we adopted
some provisions last year to authorize, and in fact it was one of the
reasons that we could do some things. Overcoming some regulatory reform
that we got an awful lot of people to buy into it and I'm just trying to
figure out why we would want to change that now. Or are we? That's the
question. On a managed care action.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, do you want to try to work with staff in
between and see where we're at on this kind of particular matter?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure. I'd be glad to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We believe that the areas in which an LME, I believe
it's the alias which an LME MCO action are very broad that this is what
it's going through, this kind of says some outside of those, if we're
missing something that's outside of that, I'd be glad to get it a part
of it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My understanding is much of that is taken care of by
defining grievances as one thing and managed care actions as another. If
it's a grievance and you've got a new process all that, that's not a big
deal. But if it's a managed care action and we have modified our
underlying law to reflect what the federal law is in managed care
actions, why wouldn't we, because that's been the problem because the
underlying State law has been inconsistent with federal process and
procedure. What we're trying to do is to marry the two up, but if the
State is going to apply the federal law as it applies in a managed care
action, which we I think have defined that they is, why would we not
want to have a consistency associated with that process. That's, I'm
probably talking around in circles again, too, but that's a concern.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hartsell, this bill is supposed to go to J2?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That answers that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe that your question...</p>

<p id="40:00">
So we’re establishing whether that request for an expedited appeal is
granted.
[TALKING IN BACKGROUND]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] On Page 4, I don't know if this will answer your
question, Sen. McKissick, if you desire a more specific answer. But Page
4, line 22, provides that when time limits for completing a standard
appeal seriously jeopardize the enrollee's life or health or ability to
attain, maintain or regain maximum function, an enrollee or network
provider authorized in writing on behalf of an enrollee has the right to
file a request an expedited appeal of a managed care action no later
than 30 days after the mailing date of the notice of the managed care
action.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me ask you this, then. I'm assuming, and maybe I
should not assume this, but under prior provisions for an appeal, the
enrollee continues receiving the benefits in the interim. This does
allow for that to continue as the practice. Is that -- ?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For the expedited appeal.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] How about under the regular process? In regular
process, if it -- and let's make the distinction. In the past,
continuation of benefits pending some final decision being made, whether
it would be expedited, whether it would be regular, is that benefit,
since it is an entitlement, continued. It's always been my understanding
that as the result of being an entitlement, we were required to continue
it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Under the managed care rules that exist in Medicaid
and the federal that exist under the entitlement program, when you have
made the medically-necessary decision that someone does not need this
service going forward, they do not continue to receive those services
under a standard appeal under the federal regulations while the standard
appeal is going on. We have provided for the expedited appeal for those
? if someone's live or health or other things were in danger, that they
would continue to receive those while we go through the expedited appeal
process. The problem is, the reason that's inconsistent in a
managed-cared model, we are not paying for a fee for service from every
one of those providers coming up. They're paid under capitated rate that
assumes they only provide medically-necessary services that are going
forward, so that you can't merely extend by just having an appeal. That
you would go through an expedited if you were saying that this was
detrimental to your health by not receiving these. That's why we have
the expedited appeal, and you would continue to receive during those.
But for standard appeals, we do not make it under a managed care system
that you automatically -- the federal law does not make it automatically
that you receive those moving forward under a standard appeal process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Quick follow-up: That's dealing with the grievance
process we're now dealing with, or is this separate apart from that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is the individual enrollee --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Individual enrollee. Okay. Well, perhaps we can look
at this a little bit more closely as it comes to J2, since I understand
it's going there, and get some of these issues resolved. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Sen. McKissick. This bill does go to J2 if
it receives a favorable report from here. Is there a motion? Sen.
Hartsell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll move to give, I guess it's PCS favorable report,
unfavorable to the original and with a serial referral to J2.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You've heard the motion. All those in favor, please
say Aye. All opposed No. The ayes have it, and the bill will be referred
to J2. We have one final bill that we're not going to be able to do
justice to today, but Sen. Goolsby, if you'd like to come up for the
remaining time, we have a PCS to Senate Bill 530: Prohibit e-cigarette
sales to minors. Is there a motion to consider? Sen. Wade has a motion
to consider the PCS. I would like to remind everyone that an
incarceration report will be required before this bill can receive a
favorable report, but, in the time remaining, Sen. Goolsby, go ahead
with your bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is a pretty simple bill.
Basically what is does is it takes the smokeless, the e-type cigarettes
that you see, and it puts them and makes them subject to the laws right
now as they pertain to people under 18, and that's pretty much what it
does [CUTS OFF]</p>

Across the board as you can see throughout the bill were it goes through
the different statutes as far as regulating products that have tobacco
and it ends up putting in vapor products like this and other tobacco
derived products. Basically nicotine delivery devices other than a
cigarette. I don’t know of any electronic chewing tobacco at this point.
I would appreciate your support on it and would be happy to try to
answer any questions you might have. It seems like something we need to
do for the children. I’m sorry…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was originally in favor of this bill until I heard from my public
health people who are very concerned because it creates another product
and gives them sort of authority. I have a lot of concern over this
bill. Obviously, we should not be selling these to minors. If there was
some way we could separate that out in response to what the public
health people are concerned over, and the heart people, and the lung
people, and everbody. There are some problems that if we could work out.
It would be protection for those children but not create a new product
which is under the auspices of the health people.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is a product ma’am, if I may answer Mr. Chairman. It’s sold online.
It’s sold in stores. It’s currently unregulated. This bill you could
look at as a first step if need be in order to start regulating this
product and protect the children.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I think one way to address…this is a great bill.
I wholeheartedly agree that we should keep these e-vapor, because it
contains nicotine, and you just don’t want to get kids on a path towards
eventually smoking. Thank you for bringing the bill. I think Senator
Goolsby and I talked about a way to address some confusion in North
Carolina law and actually a distinction with federal law. Federal law
defines tobacco product to include these vapor products. He and I are
amendable to an amendment when the next time this comes up in committee
or on the floor. I think it would address your points Senator Kinnaird.
It would keep consistency of the definition of tobacco product by
including vapor product as a sub-set of it. That way, wherever Senator
Roucho is, it won’t create confusion in North Carolina law as it relates
to tax. Because all our tax codes refer to tobacco products and these
shouldn’t be tax favored since their are tobacco products. Senator
Gooslby said he would work with us on that and we appreciate that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would be happy to look at that. I also understand that these products,
and I don’t smoke occasionally a cigar. I understand these are also
cessation products. I’m not quite sure they would fall under an actual
tobacco product. I will be happy to talk with you about that. I did not
understand you were talking about putting them under the federal
definition and what that all entailed. I will be happy to speak with the
members further on that. I do know that we tax cessation products
differently than we tax full fledged tobacco products.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Gooslby, pardon me. I was mistaken about the incarceration
reported. It is not required at this time for us to have a favorable
report. With that I recognize Sen. Hise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. To address that as well…I would move that we
give this bill a favorable report. Serial referring to J-2. As to the
PCS, unfavorable as referral to the original bill, favorable as referral
to J-2. That was (??) hand. Give you a chance to work these out in
between.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
J-1?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That would be to J-1. I don’t have any objections. Here and now we can
go ahead and get these addressed in between.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’ve heard the motion. All those in favor of the motion please say
aye, all opposed may say no. Thank you very much. I’m sorry for the time
restraints we’ve had. Thank you. The meeting is adjourned.</p>
