[0:00:00.0]
Good morning everyone, I would like to welcome you to the Education
Committee and let me start off by just thanking all the Senators and
attendants here. This is an exciting committee to be and we look at the
scope of what we are gonna be doing this session, the impact we are
gonna have on our children for now and to generations, thank you for
your willingness to serve and the contributions make us we strive to get
every child of North Carolina the best possible educational
opportunities for the future. Let me start by recognizing our Sergeants
arms, we have Charles Marcellus, Kent Curby, Ed Caseller and Steve
Wilson, thank you for your service gentlemen and we have some pages
here, we have Healy Cable for us from Senator Newton’s Office, Emma
Levitz if I got that right, McLaurin, Senator McLaurin we have Daniel
Folger, Senator Gunn and Robert Fleming, Senator Gunn thank you for
being here and helping us out today. Well, we will get right to business
as we have Senator ___[01:07] in front of us. First we need a motion to
accept the PCS. We have a motion all in favor…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All oppose, the ayes have it the PCS before us I’m asking Senator
Tillman to come up and explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And still this…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would like to recognize one of my School Board Chairman ___[01:46]
raise your hands, stand up and be recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
___[01:50], the Chairman of the School Board. We had a few
superintendents that are not here and they got called back to the job
and I hate they are not here but I know we have got other interested
folks and education and typically in this bill that I see right there
and a lot of folks who have helped me to work on this bill, a lot of
time was spend on it in the interim with the Joint LRC Committee.
Harriett Brown has been a big factor in all of this and he’s got some
other ideas once we find some money that we want to do that’s not in
this bill, we couldn’t cover all the bases, Governor McCrory is very
interested in this and has offered some input and advice as we are
talking about jobs related, coordinated efforts between the high schools
and the community colleges and course alignments specifically aligned to
those 9,000 technical jobs that are out there unfilled right now. It
will also avoid kids going to college just because mom and dad went and
___[02:58] and have that interest and end up some of them with a degree
that they can’t put into a job, they got well around the education but a
lot of times they don’t transfer, they does transfer an authority 40,50,
60,000 dollar sometime. We wanna avoid that for these kids that have
___[03:18] and the skills and the technical skills to take advantage of
a beefed up coordinated vocational program with the community college.
Community colleges onboard, the VPI onboard, School Superintendents are
onboard in fact unlike most bills I have not found a lot of opposition
to the idea that we are trying to do here. And you will see in this bill
a three track, I’m going to shut up because I have a motion, I wanted to
make my speech you know, on the Senate floor I don’t do that to you but
Senator Stein…
[Laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman I stop.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Senator Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think the bill sponsor just spoken untruth. I have seen that on many
occasion at floor…
[Laughter]
[Background Conversation]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I love Senator Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman. I have a question for the member, Senator Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Senator Pate Mayor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And this thing doesn’t work.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sir, does the ___[04:34] category apply to committee meetings?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Payton the hall of resembles that remark.
[Laughter]
Look we have got one bill today and we are having a good time so I want
raise this thing Senator…
[Laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator ___[04:57] is a freshman in fact we had not even…

motion I'm sure you will take.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister chairman I do have a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? flip away, I've talked myself out of two good bills since I've been
here. This is a true story. John Carr, big John Carr, finance chairman
was here for years. Tony Rand was sitting right there, and I was allowed
to sit beside him one time. And John was explaining his bill and he went
on and on and Tony said back to me, I liked that bill until I heard
John's explanation. I said what are you gonna do. He said I'm gonna kill
it. And he did. Now it came back to life because I think Tony was
playing a game with him, but you didn't mess with Tony. I found that
out. I tried several times. I, mister chairman, with the blessings of
the chair, my former superintendent when I was young, didn't know much
and wanted to share it with everybody. Is here today. ?? you've been
around as long as time immemorial. And James Cosby, I believe he's ??
father, he's back there. I think Senator Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right, Senator Brown, do you have a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman, I do.</p>

<p id="10:00">
[Speaker changes.]...The PCS deletes the...in section one, deletes
including freshman and sophomores...and I know that's a concern at
community college, excepting freshmen and sophomore to some of those
classes.  I have a concern tho' that that's the time that we lose a lot
of kids is when they're freshmen and sophomores...and just to create
that kind of debate a little bit, I'd like to hear some reasoning behind
that.  If there's anything we can do about it. I just think in my
business and all the technology, if I don't get those kids involved
at...when they're freshmen and sophomores, I'm afraid they're not gonna
be around when they're juniors and seniors. And the equipment needs are
at the community college that are needed to train these individuals so
I'd just like to get some explanation why we need to take that out.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Tillman?
[Speaker changes.] INAUDIBLE 1:01 to 1:14
[Speaker changes.] Senator Tillman, could you turn your mike on just to
make sure everyone can hear well?
[Speaker changes.] OK...I think that the guidance counselors at both the
middle and high school will let these kids that have this interest be
really well-informed about what's out there. We can probably take care
of some of that and hopefully keep their interest. And, I'm told that we
hafta change a law...but Patsy, I understand that we hafta change the
law dealing with this in order to put freshmen and sophomores in
there...am I...
[Speaker changes.] Staff?
[Speaker changes.] Yes, sir, Senator Tillman.  Section 7.1A of Session
Law 2011-145 created &quot;career and college promise&quot; and the
career and college promise pathways only include juniors and seniors to
qualify for dual-enrollment programs with the community colleges so in
Section 3 of the PCS of Senate Bill 14, Senator Brown is correct.
Inclusion of freshmen and sophomores was deleted but Section 3 of the
PCS is directing the State Board of Education to work with the State
Board of Community College to develop strategies to increase enrollment
of students in career and technical education so if the State Board of
Community Colleges and the State Board of Education come back when they
report to the General Assembly in 2014...January 15, 2014...that they
would like to amend the career and college promise program to include
freshmen and sophomores, they could recommend that to this body and this
body could determine if they wanted to change career and college promise
to include freshmen and sophomores...so it's really just a process that
the General Assembly would need to go through.
[Speaker changes.] INAUDIBLE...I would simply say that if they don't do
that and we feel strongly, we can do that ourselves.  Let's give them a
chance, Senator Brown, if you don't mind and we'll see what they come up
with.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Chair??
[Speaker changes.] Follow up?
[Speaker changes.] Just a follow up on that...part of the reason we're
tryin' to tie some of this to the community college is the equipment
needs that the high schools just aren't able to provide and that's been,
in my opinion, one of the things that have held back the advancement of
CTE in the past few years is the high schools are just struggling to
find those equipment needs and the community colleges as well so it's a
struggle in both areas so if we limit freshmen and sophomores from being
able to go to community college to take advantage of maybe some better
equipment that they could provide over what the high schools could, then
I'm afraid we're gonna lose some of these kids early. So anything that
we can do to address that issue I think would be important and I think
it would surely save some kids from maybe droppin' out of school at an
early age.
[Speaker changes.] Senator ??????????
[Speaker changes.] I think that's very wise comments. I think we should
keep that in mind as we move forward.  Thank you. Senator Bryant. Let's
go with Senator Robinson and then we'll come back to Senator Bryant.
[Speaker changes.] Well, I don't mind Senator Bryant goin' first, I just
wanted to ask Staff a question.  In the early college and middle college
programs in a lot of the counties...and I know we don't have a lot of
them in Guilford and it speaks directly to some of this Senator Brown
and I agree with you.  What is the age tho'?  Do they have to wait til
junior and senior? Is that a part of the career and college enrollment?
[Speaker changes.] Staff?</p>

<p id="15:00">
There’s actually an exception in the career and college that students
that are in early college high schools may take those courses all the
way through. There’s three tracks, one is career, one is college, one is
early middle college high schools.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator Bryant.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just wanted to mention in response to Senator Brown’s concern, which I
share, one model that I found out about this week in meeting with
community college and visiting my high school in Nash County, Nash
Community College, for example, in the automotive program actually
operates, has a joint agreement with the high school and actually
operates the automotive program at the high school and equips the garage
or the lab area, whatever, and the high school students use it for part
of the day and then the community college students use it in the
afternoon and they have a joint facility, but it’s located at the high
school precisely to avoid the problem that you are describing. That’s
one way around it and I don’t know if want to incentivise those kind of
partnerships or encourage that as a way to cover all these student and
avoid those kind of bureaucratic hoops.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Do we have any other question from members? Senator Curtis,
you have a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If the Statesville High School has what they call an early college
program where they take 9th graders and put them through a five year
program with Mitchell Community College. They come out after five years
with an associates degree. They’re starting in the 9th grade, is that
illegal for them to start in the 9th grade or is there some exception?
Or how can they do that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s the extension under the career and college promise program.
Students who are in high schools that are not early college high schools
are limited to Juniors and Seniors, but there is an exception to career
and college promise students in early emerald and early college high
schools can take dual enrollment classes throughout their high school
career.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What is an early college high school?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff do you have a definition for that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There is a special part in article 16 of the statutes that sets up
cooperative innovative high schools and early college high schools are a
type of these. They are small high schools, typically located on
community college class’ campuses, in some cases higher ed campuses have
to partner with an institution of higher ed and their goal is to have
the student graduate with either two years of college credit or an
associates degree and we have somewhere between 70 and 80 of these now
operating in the state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Any other questions from members? Senator Rabin and then
Senator Wade.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
First to come, with regards to what Senator Bryant said. My high school
also had what they called at that time a spent hugh shop where the
automotives were conducted and high school students, they took a track
which way they were going to do it. I think it’s a great idea to do
that. My question is in much of what I’ve seen so far in my newness to
this body, I believe that the criteria should be jointly established by
the school board and by members of the General Assembly, either the
joint committee that supervises it or by this committee. The aggregation
of the responsibility to set standards to another body may not be the
best way to go, I just don’t know if it’s legal, but I do think we
should have input directly to the criteria that are established in this
and a bunch of areas that we get into.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for your comment. Senator Wade.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I just wondered if on the diploma, if we had any
word from the state board of education on how they’re going to designate
the courses they’ve taken, what technical field. How will that work?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s a good question, Senator.We are coordinating everything we do
with the community colleges and the high school. June Atkinson has been
a big player in helping put this together as well as Scott Rawls. Those
courses will be outlined and they’re going to be tailored to the needs
that are out there, to the jobs that are out there.</p>

<p id="20:00">
And then we will beef up the vocational program. This has got to get a
little transition period to get it going, so you'll see it moving
slowly, the first few months, maybe the first year, but after that,
several things will be involved. You see, there's no money attached to
this bill so we've got to get the equipment established and the exact
courses that are outlined, and they will change from time to time, and
that's why you have to be very flexible. And we've got a great community
college system that does that. And our high schools will have to be more
flexible in the vocational offerings. That all will be done as we get
into this. The mechanics are in place to do it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. Mister chairman, but how do you envision seeing that on the
diploma? I mean obviously you can't list all the criteria they've taken,
so will there be like special seals, special wording?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead, Senator Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, there will be three diplomas now. You'll have the, the high school
diploma that will be designated either college prep, college vocational,
or both. They'll have three seals on there. That will be the signifying
thing when you graduate that you've got one of those seals. A lot of
kids will go with both, they'll have to take an extra course or two,
because they can go either way. Their mind might not be made up. Others
will have the regular high school diploma and then they'll have the
vocational high school diploma. The seals are already been ordered and
ready to go with that. Good question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think we might have some clarification from staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Senator Wade. By February 2014, so about a year from now, the state
board of education with input from the state board of community colleges
will report back to this body to talk about what these criteria are.
Currently in the PCS for Senate bill 14 it just talks about the courses
that are completed in an overall grade point average in those courses.
And the courses would reflect really the area of concentration as
Senator Tillman was saying. For a high school graduate now, to get their
diploma they have up to six elective credits, and these endorsements
will show a concentration of those electives. For example if they get a
career endorsement, then most likely those electives would be all in CTE
courses. The state department of education reported to us that they also
may require some sort of industry certification, or they may also
require certain internships in different businesses. So, as Senator
Tillman was saying, those kind of criteria will be developed and then
reported back for the endorsements on the, on one single high school
diploma.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well great, thank you. We do have a, we've got three more people on the
list of questions. I want to give the audience a, some public comment or
question if we've got that, so. I'm gonna, we've got, Senator Woodard,
Bryant, and Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. Just a minor point. I noticed from the
original bill to the PCS that the date in section 1A was missing, that
the state board would report back, was there? I don't understand the
rationale for removing the date, the deadline.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Was that a question Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. I just wanted to understand the rationale why the date of reporting
back September 1st, 2016 was removed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff has got a, it's a technical matter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, it's a technical sort of bill drafting error on our part. We try
not to put dates in the statutes because the statutes stand forever, so
it would be odd to then look back, say 20 years from now, and see that
date September 1st, 2016. So on the PCS if you look at the last
statement on section 1B, which is page 1, line 28, that's where you will
see the reporting date. It's just in uncodified language. So the state
board still has to report by September 1st, 2016 and annually
thereafter. It's just not gonna be in the statute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for that explanation. And Senator Bryant.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just was noticing that we all seem to have different levels of
familiarity with these career  and technical education programs, and
since this may be a focus this session it might be good if we could
have, at some point, an overview of early college dual enrollment,
career and college promise, all of these different</p>

<p id="25:00">
Special high schools et cetera. So that as a committee, we were familiar
with all the different approaches that's depending on what your plan of
work is. I'm just throwing that out there as a request.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's a, thank you for that request. We'll also be in the appropriation
subcommittee be going through an awful lot of those things as we look at
how the money's appropriated, we'll give a lot of background as to that
exact thing. But thank you. Senator Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, I want to thank you and Senator Brown for finally
getting some light on this issue, and I guess my question is there are a
lot of us have been very interested in this, taking an active role in
trying to find another avenue for our students rather than dropping out
but to get in some kind of career or vocational technical training. It
may have been discussed earlier and I apologize for being late, but the
real question I have is when do we see something actually work where
we're getting our third and fourth year students trained to be able to
get some kind of a certificate when they leave with their diploma? How
long do we wait?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We're not gonna have that long to wait because this opens up the whole
area for these programs to be implemented quickly. And it is job
related, and if you have kids that are in this program, they're not
gonna drop out. Our vocational center schools where we have them here,
the drop out rate is like almost nothing. Those kids, once they get in
these programs, seeing it leading to a well paying job, better than the
marketplace, better than teachers make after 20 or 30 years, a lot of
them, will finally reach the level these kids will start. So they'll
stay in school, it'll be job related, and I, the appeal will be there
once we get this thing advertised through our guidance counselors we're
gonna start that immediately. So it won't be long.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Great, thank you. Do we have anyone from the, let's get Senator Robinson
real quick, then we'll see if anyone from the public has any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, just a response, partial response to Senator Rucho, I want you to
know that in the early college program in Guilford county, we had 100%
graduation. So if that's any indication of how these particular programs
that focus on career readiness, training in specific vocational areas,
Senator Brown is, the little, the little evaluation that we have so far
shows that they are very successful.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Do we have anyone from the public that has any questions or
comments regarding this? I see no one moving towards the microphone. We
do have a motion on the floor, favorable report to the PCS, unfavorable
to the original bill. Do we have a second, do we have a, someone moved.
And a second. All in favor? Opposed? The ayes have it and the motion
passes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, we would like a closing remark.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One comment in closing. I recognize former head chairman, A. B. Swindell
back there in the back. A.B did a lot of this type thing when he was
chairing this and did wonderful work while he was chairing this
committee, and chairing the head oversight committee and many other
things, and I appreciate him being here and all of the rest of you, and
thank you for your attention and help with this bill. Nothing is done in
isolation. It takes a lot of people to put it together. Especially
Senator Brown, who's helped me and had ideas on this a long time ago.
Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you members, and meeting is adjourned.</p>
