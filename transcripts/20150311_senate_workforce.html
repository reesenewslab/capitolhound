  In the audience it’s time to start. I’m Senator Ron Rabin. I’m the chair
for today and the Workforce and Economic Development Committee. I think
we need to stay on focus with the workforce and economic because the two
will have a synergistic effect on each other. I’m hoping that the
committee will look at it this way and with your input to affect all
parts of the issue. [??] I bet you can hear me better now. I don’t have
to say it again. Anytime when you see a good idea what you really ought
to do is steal it and I sat in an earlier committee meeting where, I
give full credit to Senator Wade for this idea cause I thought it was
really nice. You know, traditionally we introduce the pages and I’m
going to have them introduce themselves and tell you who they are and
what they’ve done and who they represent so you get a better view of
what these great young kids are all about. Ladies, you’re on. You are
the pages. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Hi, my name is Marcy Bishop and I’m from
Apex, NC and my sponsor is Senator Barefoot. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m Erin
Olo and I’m from Holly Springs and my senator is [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m Carson Honeycutt, I’m from [??] and my senator is Senator [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you ladies and thanks for being here and, yes
sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman I noticed one of them is wearing the
badges of a girl scout and a lot of girl scouts are in the building
today and needless to say that is a wonderful organization. I’m very
proud that she’s wearing her uniform to let us know that she is a girl
scout. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Not only that, my legislative assistant’s here
doing this for the first time and she has two sons that are eagle
scouts, so we’re into the scouting game right away. Moving right along,
we also have Sergeant of Arms who are making sure that bad people do not
get in the door and as long as it’s a full room, we’ve got standing room
only. We’ve got Donna Blake and we’ve got Steve McCabe in the back. So
you can get out these other doors but you can’t get out these two doors.
The purpose is trying to figure out how we can do a better job, you
know, with working on the economy the way we are, trying to get the jobs
created by the businesses who really create them. Workforce and economic
development has a strong case to play in there and what we wanna do also
is make sure that we have the people and the talent and the skills
locally in the state that we have state residents filling those jobs.
Today’s presentations will focus mostly on the community colleges and
what they do and they do a really terrific job of filling the near term
needs of the local communities because they’re right there working hand
in glove with them and then we will see how we can do other sorts of
things later on. I have two co-chairs, Senator Barefoot and Senator
Curtis, would you guys like to say anything. That’s the best of all
worlds, you only have to listen to one of us. Without further ado then
I’ll introduce, the first speaker will be Dr. Marshon who is the
president of the Central Carolina Community College and he is
accompanied by Commissioner Jim Bergen who is the Chairman of the Board
of Commissioners in Harnett County and they’re working together on the
issues of how do we fill the workforce needs in local communities. Yeah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, senator. We appreciate the opportunity to
be here. I also have to say that Mr. Bergen not only serves as Chairman
of the Harnett County Commissioners but he also serves as Vice-Chair of
my board so I have to behave while I’m up here. We have some programs
that we’d like to discuss with you, some of which you may have heard
from before, and then I’m gonna allow Mr. Bergen to talk about the way
that we do the workforce investment act, the Triangle South Workforce
Development Board. The first program I wanna talk to you about is the
Caterpillar Apprenticeship Program and you should have in your folder a
brochure on the Caterpillar Apprenticeship Program. We’re very proud of
this program. this program is now in its 4th year. This is the largest
youth apprenticeship program in the state of North Carolina and it is a
partnership between the Department of Labor, Central Carolina Community
College, the Lee County Schools and Caterpillar and it grew

  <p id="05:00">
  out of the need for Caterpillar to know how, when they decided to expand
a plant in Sanford, North Carolina, how we were going to be able to
create for them a pipeline of welders that they would know would be
continuous and trained to their specific standards.  This program
started off with a selection of 12 students, we graduated out of that
12, we graduated about seven.  Now, we select 16 students a year,
it&#39;s become highly competitive.  This past year we have 16 that we
have selected out of almost 90 students that have applied for the
program.  The program is unique in that they begin their training in the
11th grade.  In between the 11th and 12th grade they actually work with
Caterpillar on the floor for $10 an hour, they complete their training
during their 12th grade year, and at the end of their 12th grade year
they come out with a high school diploma and a welding certificate and a
job at Caterpillar that starts upwards of $40,000 a year.  This program
has been lauded all over in the state, and actually we&#39;ve been very
fortunate that the US Chamber of Commerce in Washington wrote an article
saying this is a program worthy of being copied, so we are quite proud
of the program.  As you can see from the picture inside, the Governor
was kind enough to come down last year and congratulate these young
apprentices on the work they had done.
From the very beginning, the founding philosophy on this program was to
make those students who were selected for this program feel special, and
we have worked with Caterpillar to do that.  We have hot dog suppers
with them, we meet with their parents, we introduce them to the County
Commissioners, we take them to chamber meetings, Caterpillar&#39;s great
and they provide them hats and shirts and whatever.  You know, we
celebrate sports teams in high school as we should, but we celebrate
this group just like we celebrate a sports team and they appreciate it
and they&#39;re very proud to be walking down the halls in the high
schools in Lee County with their Caterpillar shirts on.  There is an
opportunity if they wish to go on, once they finish this, they can go on
and receive a diploma in the Caterpillar program, in the welding
program, if they so wish.
That&#39;s one program, like I said it&#39;s in its fourth year.  The
next program that I&#39;ve been asked to talk about is Central Carolina
Works, and this is a program that came about because we were finding
that many high school students simply did not understand career in tech.
 They did not understand what it meant to be on a shop floor, they did
not know what a career in tech career was.  They know from guidance
councilors, and believe me, guidance counselors do a great job, but many
guidance counselors have never been on a shop floor themselves, so we
decided on a program that privately raised money to allow us to put a
college employee, a college counselor in each of the nine high schools
in our area for two years.  That&#39;s how much private funds, combined
with grants and other things that we raised, that would allow them to go
into those schools and talk to students about career in tech programs,
along with transfer programs.  And we have seen in our first year, the
counselors just went in in August, the number of students actually now
entering dual enrollment take a dramatic increase, and I can tell you
the numbers for next Fall are looking absolutely incredible, and the
majority of these students, because it&#39;s near and dear to my heart,
and I know it&#39;s near and dear to Scott Rall&#39;s heart, the
majority of these students that are starting in this program are going
into career in tech fields, about a third are going into transfer, but
two-thirds are going into career in tech fields.
You can look at this, I won&#39;t bother to go all over it, but I would
like to draw your attention, this is how the funds were raise, if you
flip all the way over, you can see each of the three counties put in a
certain amount of money, we then had grants and we had a lot of private
donations.  We had a private champion by the name of Kurt Bradley who is
an incredible supporter of the community college system but also
understands work force development, and he headed up the campaign for us
and help us raise the money.  Commissioner Burgin was on the Harnett
County Commissioners when we were able to put this together and we do
appreciate their supports.
That&#39;s briefly what I had to talk to you about, I&#39;d be more than
happy to answer any questions or, believe me, I can talk about Central
Carolina Community College for a long time, probably a lot longer than
you want me to, but are there any questions about  either of these two
programs or anything else that we do?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Dr. Ralls

  I wanna go back to the Caterpillar. I have a Caterpillar in my district
in Winston-Salem, and I believe it&#39;s somewhat the same program,
maybe not to the capacity that Harnett County is doing, but it is a
wonderful, wonderful program. I have enjoyed going out there, so thank
you for the work that you&#39;re doing on that behalf. Community college
at its best.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, thank you and we do appreciate your support. And if you want to
see something, come and sit with these students. Come and, because they
found something. They found something in their lives that now means so
much to them. We, when Secretary Decker was in charge of commerce, she
came down one day and literally sat in the middle of them, and listened
to these 16 and 17 year olds talk about the wonderful experiences, and
what they were gonna do career wise at Caterpillars. Truly, truly an
inspirational activity.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McInnis?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman and Dr. Moore, appreciate you being here. I am
a big proponent of the community college program and system in North
Carolina as a eight year alumni of the North Carolina public school
board in my county of Richmond, so I know the value of it, especially to
the rural counties of North Carolina. My question is on your CAT
program, is it limited only to Lee County? I know your footprint is
bigger than just Lee County.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, that, the CAT program, now we are in the process with Mr.
Bergen&#39;s help, we will be initiating a machining youth
apprenticeship program in the Fall, but it will not be based at one
company, which is, Caterpillar&#39;s a large company. We are actually
going to engage eight different machine shops that will allow us to
probably put 12 Harnett County students into a similar program, but they
will be studying machining as opposed to welding.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. Follow up, mister chair. On your college counselors going
into the high schools, and is that just one county that that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, that&#39;s all three.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So that&#39;s the total footprint.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We, we did that a region. We did nine high schools in our three county
area and each high school has an individual college employee counselor
in the high schools, and they&#39;ve been graciously accepted. Our three
superintendents are all on board, and they are already making contacts
with students and parents, and one of the criteria we used to hire them
was that they understand what it means to be involved in career and
tech. They&#39;ve been on a shop floor. They know what these types of
programs and these types of skills are, and they&#39;re able to convey
to the parents and the students what type of jobs, what type of careers,
and quite frankly, what type of money.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, mister chairman. Final. Is, are they, do they lend themselves
to be having more allegiance to the community college system or to the
four year college system?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They are our employees. They&#39;re gonna be for the community college
system, yes. We wanted them to be community college employees. We
respect and understand the role of guidance counselors and principals,
and we understand they have a rough job, a full time 24/7 job, but we
wanted these people to be college employees so they were, their first
allegiance is to the college.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Alexander.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, and thank you for your presentation, sir. A couple
three days ago, we had a presentation where, I think there&#39;s six
different state agencies that have to do with trying to develop jobs,
and there was like conversation about maybe turning more of this over to
the community college system. Would you have appetite for that, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m gonna defer to Scott Rolls back there. He can answer that
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Listen, I have the best job in the world. I am the president of central
Carolina community college, which is a phenomenal institution and a
phenomenal part of this state that does, goes about the business of
changing lives every single day. I couldn&#39;t be happier. I honestly
don&#39;t know about the six agencies, although, although you&#39;re
gonna hear about one that we do run in, in our area, but community
colleges are all about changing lives. They&#39;re all about giving
people opportunity, in many chances a second opportunity. So I think
that whatever you can do to support that and to increase the awareness
and the level of the general population of what community colleges can
do, the better off you&#39;ll be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions? I do have a quick one, sir. And it sort of follows
onto what Senator Alexander talked about. It&#39;s quite clear that for
the jobs today and the jobs tomorrow and for the next couple of years
that community colleges have the premium role to play in getting the
jobs filled and taking the students in

  <p id="15:00">
  And is it fair to say that beyond that, there&#39;s another, let&#39;s
look ahead and look ahead, into a mid and a far term, what the needs are
going to be. And with a definite role for the UNC system to be in the
workforce development business as well. It&#39;s easy to get focused on
the jobs now, because we need them now, kind of an idea. I have an idea
in my mind that it sort of transcends that, if you will, and moves on
beyond, so we have a structure in place that helps get workforce
development on a longer track than that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Anecdotally
I&#39;ll give you one quick answer to that. There&#39;s a young man in
our service area who spent two years getting a degree in auto mechanics.
He went to work for one of the larger dealerships in Sanford. He has now
been able to move into the management of the entire auto repair business
within that dealership, and he was able through a partnership we have
with Franklin University to get his bachelors degree and he is actually
been kind of groomed for management even higher than that within that
auto dealership and he&#39;s actually begun a masters degree program. So
yes, I think there always needs to be the path forward for those people
that want to move forward in terms of having additional training and
education, and I do think that, I&#39;ve worked in other community
college systems, and unlike them this system is truly aligned in many
ways that I think gives us a head start in allowing people to pursue
additional education. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Colonel, you can see, better than I thought. He wasn&#39;t
looking at me and he saw my hand up. Thank you Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It makes me feel good. You&#39;re at least
as old as I am. Colonel is looking down the road and I don&#39;t, and I
mean I think that&#39;s good. What I like about the community colleges
system is you focus on these jobs as the need arises, you can quickly
adapt. The Universities are not quick at doing anything. They&#39;re
not. They&#39;re not geared for that. They&#39;ve got their programs and
their curriculum that they&#39;re in love with and they have a certain
purpose to serve. I don&#39;t know if they can retool and re-gear to
make kids job-ready, as much as just education-ready, for various
fields, and a lot of them being liberal arts and some of them do a great
job in business in finance and some of those areas. But [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator McGinnis I only served 29 years and 7 months ?? for 7
so I know a little bit about what they do. That ain&#39;t bragging,
that&#39;s on the record. I&#39;m just wanting to say that I want
y&#39;all to continue doing what you want. I don&#39;t want you to be a
University system and some of you all tried that and we put that down as
quick as we heard it, that you&#39;re trying to be a four year and
wanted that. I like what you&#39;re doing because you can quickly adapt
to whatever moves into town, that the need is to train these workers.
Caterpillar is a great company. You&#39;re doing a tremendous job.
You&#39;ve been paying these kids ten dollars an hour while they&#39;re
still in high school to work there. That I want you to keep your focus
on, because if we start scattering your purpose, you&#39;re going to
pretty soon be so scattered you can&#39;t do it. I filed that bill,
Senator Alexander, to put all the workforce development people under the
community colleges. That&#39;s not something that can be done right
away, number one. And number two, we&#39;ve got to flesh out some things
on that, to make workable. That is a down the road thing. Thank you,
Colonel. I took a lot of time to say that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You took a
lot of time to say you sort of disagree with what I&#39;ve said but I
think there&#39;s a slight misunderstanding. Yeah, I know. I&#39;m not
looking at saying to do anything different because I understand, and I
think the committee as a whole understands, as to where the whole
decision has to come from, that they do a great job. I said that at the
start. I think just before you came in the room, as a matter of fact.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Of course. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And somewhere along the
line I think there&#39;s room for the committee to look at things that
are more proactive rather than reactive. Right now, we&#39;ll sit there
with them, with the community colleges doing a great job, but we&#39;re
reacting to current needs. Somewhere we&#39;ve got to get together the
workforce and the economic development team so that they look down the
road and say, “These kinds of industries are coming.” I would ask one
more question then. Under that sort of a paradigm where you would say,
“If we could figure out a way to do strategic planning in a sense it
could save Dr. Marchon, in three years or four years or five or even
further out, we&#39;re going to have this kind of a requirement where
you can start thinking ahead rather than being reactive” it might be a
little bit more cost-effective and a little bit easier on your system as
well. You don&#39;t have to be in

  <p id="20:00">
  Both camps.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right, and I do think Dr. Ralls will be up here in just a minute to kind
of go through with that. My board has made it quite clear that our focus
is career and tech, and we&#39;re not opposed, and we&#39;re not,
certainly not gonna stop doing college transfer, but we&#39;re in this
for career and tech, and quite frankly, that&#39;s where the jobs are,
and that&#39;s where the future is, so that&#39;s our focus.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barefoot.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You may have already answered this but, so the question that I have
about the career coach program. How successful has that program been
with, how successful has that program been with getting students into
the career tech programs of the community colleges versus preparing them
to transfer?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, as anecdotally and number wise, we&#39;ve been in the high school
since August, and what we are seeing is a large increase in the number
of people who are interested in taking dual enrollment courses, and then
following up with community college or four year college after that. And
currently, the breakdown is basically two thirds are going into some
sort of career and tech field, one third is going into college transfer.
We&#39;re very pleased with that, because before this time, we actually
believed that a lot of students, and perhaps a lot of parents did not
understand what exactly was meant by career and tech, and that&#39;s
something these coaches were hired and trained and we look for
backgrounds in order for them to be able to do that. We want somebody
who knows about welding explaining welding to a student, or machining or
any of these other types of programs that we have. And that&#39;s when,
when I&#39;m sitting here talking to you as a parent, I need to
understand what welding is, what welding does, how much money welding
will eventually pay my son and daughter, and that&#39;s what these
people are there for. And I&#39;m not casting aspersions on guidance
counselors. I am not. I understand their role and God bless them.
They&#39;ve got a lot to do, but many of them simply don&#39;t
understand career and tech.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, mister chairman? Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, so for this committee, you would say that a lot of community college
struggle, they struggle filling those career tech seats for a myriad of
reasons and so you would say that this program that you guys have been
piloting for the past year is giving you a.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Past couple months.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Past couple months, is starting to give you a good indication that there
is something the state can do to build that bridge.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If our preliminary data holds true, and we are in the process of
registering for next Fall in the high schools right now, you will see a
large increase in the number of high school students one, taking dual
enrollment courses and if our numbers hold to be correct, two thirds of
those students will be entering a career and tech path. One third will
be going, and so the answer to your question is yes. We are able to do
that, we think because of the knowledgeable people we have boots on the
ground in the high schools.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions? Any other questions? If not, the next, Commissioner
Bergen will make his presentation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman, and thank you members for allowing us to be
here. I&#39;m gonna talk a minute about workforce, triangle workforce
development board, but before I do that I do wanna say you can see, I
think, why central Carolina is doing so well. The president is
passionate about that. His board is 100% behind him and we&#39;re in
rural North Carolina. What we wanna do is create jobs, help create jobs,
help prepare people for jobs in our counties. So that&#39;s the emphasis
on everything we&#39;re doing at the community college, helping these
folks reach their potential. Wanna give you just a, and I&#39;ll just,
I&#39;m not gonna read all this to you, I&#39;m just gonna hit some of
the highlights of it. In 2009 the Triangle South Workforce Development
was moved under the college. It was not under there before. It was under
a cog. It was moved over there. The advantages of having it are
coordination, elimination of all duplicate services, better use of time
and better representation in the community. The transition happened. The
community college is administering the whole program, so first community
college to do it in North Carolina, I am the chief elected official for
the North Carolina Workforce Development Board and there are 23
Workforce Development Boards out there. Central Carolina is the primary
one that has one I think. ?? had one, but I think they&#39;re
transitioning back out of that. So the money comes from the Workforce
Development Act of 1998. The programs that we do is really comprised of
private sector and public sector members. There is a large board that
looks after it. The primary programs are the youth program, the adult

  Program, dislocated worker, incumbent workforce development program and
on the job training. Last year we had $2.2 million of programming funds
and served 725 clients. Now the beauty of I think of having it all there
together is that we can expose those folks to a lot of the programs that
the community college offers, so it’s kind of a one stop place. They can
come, all of us know what’s going on at the community college, we’re
involved in the community college and we can help do that. Now I wanna
share one thing that has really brought my attention to something and
that’s what’s going on at Fort Bragg and I was with [??] yesterday,
Colonel Samford, and we were talking about this. On average they’re
releasing 156 soldiers a week, that’s approximately 8,000 a year. Of
those only 1% use their veteran benefits at North Carolina Community
Colleges or in the State University System. The benefit under the
Montgomery Bill is approximately $61,812 over 36 months, so that’s
$1,717 a month. That’s a potential of $164 million of education benefits
that we are not capturing. Now I know all 8,000 of those people are not
gonna stay in the state, but we need to do a much better job of
capturing those folks, getting them into the community college system
and/or getting them into the college system. Something that I’ve heard
from taking to a lot of them, talking to our representatives is a lot of
the money that they’re using for education they’re using for online
degrees and from talking to employers, a lot of the employers do not
recognize those online degrees. So I think we have a real opportunity to
reach out to our military, to bring those folks in and we as a community
college, in fact we’ve been talking about it sitting in the back this
morning about what we’re gonna try to do to grab those folks, get them
into the system, capture that money for the state and to help those
folks get good jobs. I’ll be happy to answer any questions. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Any questions for Commissioner Bergen. Yes, sir, Senator
McInnis. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Commissioner, appreciate your service to your
county and our state. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I’ve had some folks that have shared with me that there’s a
high cost of administering the workforce development programs. Have you
found that in the system that you’re working in or is that specific to
some others or is it across the board? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Anything, follow up. Anything
we can do about that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, it’s federal money. It has
to be handled a certain way. I think this group and other groups in the
state need to talk to the federal folks about how to handle it. I think
and I’m not gonna pretend to say how all of it needs to be put together
but we have, it’s like shooting a shotgun at something. It goes a lot of
different directions. We need to be much more targeted on jobs in this
state. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir, anyone else? Yes ma’am, Senator
Smith. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for your comments. Did I understand
you just say you’re the only workforce development board that’s
operating out of a community college? That Fayetteville had it but then
they went back to? [SPEAKER CHANGES] My understanding is we were the
first and I understood that we were the only one. In talking to Scott he
was telling me that Fayetteville was doing it but they are transitioning
back out of it. I don’t know those details but I can tell you that we
are and we are not planning  transitioning back out of it. We want to
make it more inclusive and use those funds to better the participants.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very. Any more questions? If not, thank you
gentlemen for the presentation. Thanks for the interesting questions. We
have Dr. Rose now who’s the president of the North Carolina Community
College System. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Good afternoon to
everyone. Good to see you. I know you’re in the early parts of these
meetings and so I thought what I would do is talk a little bit about the
community college role with workforce development. Pretty much workforce
development is all our role, so I have to talk about, just about all
aspects of the community colleges and hearing your questions and I know
many of you well that you are well versed in community colleges so I
apologize if I’m telling you things you already know, but sometimes it’s
often good to revisit and see how we started and how we formed and what
we do and in terms of the scale that we have so with your permission
that’s where I will start, but first what I will tell you that while we
started based on workforce development, it continues to be our primary
focus and since I was last with you in the last session

  Or with many of you in the last session. We&#39;ve been very busy in the
community colleges working with our partners under the NCWorks
collaborative, with the department of commerce, workforce boards, but
within the community colleges as well. Going around the state, to
understand what&#39;s the challenges that are there and what are some of
the best things that we&#39;ve seen, and before he gets out of the room,
I will tell you Bud Marchen is one of the best in our system. We have, I
have 58 favorite presidents, but he is absolutely one of my favorites,
and we are very philosophically aligned around technical education. But
we, we visited, what we&#39;ve done over the last part of last year is
working with our colleagues in Department of Commerce and the workforce
boards. We sponsored the largest on site employer survey in the history
of North Carolina. So with workforce boards and community college local
folks leading this effort locally in every one of the 100 counties,
visited over 10 companies, and you see here the map shows some where we
visited over 20, some between 10 and 15, but at least 10 in every one of
our counties to find out what are the challenges, what are the
opportunities, what can we do better and to try to address this
collectively and not from a silo perspective. Another thing that
we&#39;ve done within the community college system and that I
participated in in every one of these is 21 workforce learning summits.
And you see the dots there, and so we did that over the latter part of
last year. Many of you participated and were at some of those events,
and so we heard the best innovations, particularly collaborative
innovations with our, our industry partners, our public school partners,
our workforce board partners, and also we talked about the challenges
and that, and barriers for us to do more and to do better. Here are some
of the general things. Nothing&#39;s going to surprise you. The first,
first bullet&#39;s very good news. We&#39;re, we&#39;re moving out of
the recession, as you well know and this coming year, the employers tell
us 90% are either going to be adding jobs next year, or they&#39;re
going to be at least stable in their employment, and so that&#39;s very
good news for our state. Main barriers to feeling qualified, for finding
qualified employees though remain the same, and going back to, you heard
Dr. Marchen talk over and over about technical, technical, technical and
job related skills, but the more technical those skills, the more
challenging they&#39;re finding in filling those careers. Soft skills
continues to be the second issue that they mentioned. Interest gap, and
I&#39;m gonna come back and talk about that a little later, but
that&#39;s what Dr. Marchen was referring to. The interest gap with
younger students is a big challenge for us. We&#39;ve kind of coined
this phrase interest gap. I&#39;ll come back and talk about that a
little bit at the end, and the number one workforce service that was
identified as a need is additional workforce training and education for
employees and for folks coming through community colleges. Now, we play
a very unique role in the workforce system. We are that training and
education arm of the community college system, and actually in the state
statutes you have, you have described what our role is and the community
college, and our system office being the agency, if you will, that
represents the 58 colleges is designated as the primary lead agency for
delivering workforce development training, adult literacy training, and
adult education programs. That notion of doing adult literacy is unique
for us. There&#39;s only about 14 other states where community colleges
play the lead role in adult literacy programs, and we&#39;ll talk a
little bit about that. So some things that make us unique, particularly
from a workforce development perspective. First thing, and I think this
is core to us, is this is how we started, and why that is unique is that
community colleges in the United States emerged post World War II and in
that period, most of them developed in other states based on more of a
junior college model, more of an academic model in the context of junior
colleges often linked with universities. More what you were hearing
about the college transfer type role. Our state was different. So in the
1950s we were very much the part of an economic development goal for our
state. We were two thirds per capita income, one of the poorest states
in the nation, goal of then Governor Luther Hodges was to diversity our
state&#39;s income beyond just textiles, furniture, and tobacco, and the
way to do that was through what we used to call vocational education at
that time. And so one of, he had two, I would say two crazy goals. One
was to create a research park in the middle of a pine forest. The other
was to create a network of industrial education centers across the
state, first start in Eden, North Carolina, and that&#39;s where that
sign is. There were eventually 20 industrial education centers and so
when the community college movement came along in the 1960s, it was
based on those 20 industrial education centers combined with four public
junior colleges in our state, and that became the community college
system. What is unique about that though is how our roots began. Our
roots began based on workforce training and we grew more comprehensive
like other community colleges, but we started from a completely
different place, and I think that starting point is, is core to us,
because workforce

  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Development is always what we have been about. Now, we
continue in our role and I actually had a slide here which didn&#39;t
get included in this part. But 30 years later, one of the things
that&#39;s very unique to us is our role with economic development. And
that was where we started in 1950, the slide that didn&#39;t make it to
this version. But 30 years later, about 20 years ago, it was November of
1996 there was a front page article in the Wall Street Journal and it
essentially said, that while in the war between the states over economic
development, in North Carolina the secret weapon is, is job training at
community colleges. And that was 20 years ago, and that&#39;s still core
to our role. We&#39;re very, much more connected to economic development
than any other community college system in the state. And you see that
play out. So when you&#39;re talking about the Caterpillar, senator,
Caterpillar, when Caterpillar came to Forsyth County, they made a very
big point. It was in all the newspapers that their number one factor was
the community-was the training they could get at Forsyth Tech. And so
that connection with economic development is important for economic
development, it&#39;s also very important for us because that keeps us
grounded in terms of where we are. Now, we&#39;re also unique in our
access and our scale. We&#39;re the most comprehensive form of community
colleges in the United States. The reason for that is because we do so
much workforce development that others do not do. We&#39;re the, I
believe this, and I don&#39;t think anybody can refute this, but
we&#39;re the most accessible community college system in both cost and
location. So we have the fourth lowest tution, which allows it to be
accessible for working, our working class families, our low income
families. But we&#39;re also within 30 miles of everyone within North
Carolina. Unless at the top of Lake-Mount Mitchell or at Lake
Mattamuskeet. I one time had the unfortunate economic develpment
presentation at Mattamuskeet where I said we&#39;re within 30 miles and
someone quickly pointed out, &quot;We&#39;re not within 30 miles of
anywhere&quot; at that point. So there  are just a couple of places in
North Carolina where that&#39;s not true. Here&#39;s a very unique
statistic, I think, is that over 40% of all the wage earners in North
Carolina, this was Department of Commerce statistic, have attended a
North Carolina community college within the past 10 years. I think
that&#39;s a remarkable statistic, particularly given the in-migration
that we know we have as-in our state, in North Carolina. Community
colleges, based on the latest economic impact statements that we did
across higher ed-we account for almost 50%, 46% of all of the alumni
wage impact. And that&#39;s primarily because we have a jobs-focused
form of education, but most of our students stay within North Carolina.
So a good example is outside of the doctors, we educate and train most
of the folks that will work at a hospital. We-over 50% of all the nurses
in our state who receive some form of education, do that through
community colleges. And 90% of them will stay in state. Over 50% will
stay within 13 miles of the location in which they received that
education. And one in nine adults in North Carolina participate in a
community college program each year. Here&#39;s another thing that makes
us unique in terms of workforce development. And this our mix of
programs, and this makes us different from other community colleges. So
61% of our students-we have about 830,000 total students each year.
About 61% are in non-degree programs. In most other states, you&#39;re
going to find a very small percentage that are in non-degree programs.
So most of our students are in job skills, training, or the literacy
programs as well, which are non-degree. 52% of our students-about the
320,000 that are seeking a degree-52% are pursuing career technical,
meaning their goal is to come to us and get to a job. Healthcare,
business and IT, public service, law enforcement, those are our big
areas as well as technical education. So that mix of programming for us
is very different compared to other community colleges in other states.
Real quickly, you can split it up into the degree-related and
non-degree. So our degree programs are applied associate programs,
diplomas and certificates. Students gaining degrees for the purpose of
getting a job and going into the workplace. Our-a big focus with us
recently with those programs is to build in industry certifications.
What we call alternative credential, because the more they can gain an
industry certification and a degree, that helps them out. Transfer
programs to universies, also, though I will say have a very big-and we
need to consider that in our workforce development mission. Just two
weeks ago we signed new articulation agreements, UNC Board of Governors,
the State Board of Community Colleges that will allow two things. One is
in nursing, so you can now have a-essentially a 3+1 degree in nursing.
Spend three years at a community college, get an additional one year at
a university and get a bachelor&#39;s degree in nursing. That is brand
new as of two weeks ago and we just signed a unique agreement to create

  ...a new Associate in Engineering program that will seamlessly transfer
from any of our 58 colleges who offer the program to all 5 of the
Engineering schools in our state. Non-degree, workforce continuing
education, that&#39;s the big area. That&#39;s the area, and this is
what makes us probably the most unique, is that you fund us to provide
short-term skills training to folks who are either looking to get a job,
to increase their jobs skills, or in the work place. They pay fees for
that, but it is a subsidized fee so the company&#39;s, the
individual&#39;s, do not have to...it&#39;s much more cost effective
here in North Carolina than you will find in any other state. Basic
skills and high school equivalencies so that is our, we used to call GED
programs (we now have to call it Adult High School Equivalency because
it&#39;s not just the GED anymore) our Adult High School Programs with
public schools and also our adult basic education which is basic
numeracy and literacy and our English as a Second Language. New thing
with us with work force development is to not just wait for students to
get through those programs, and hope that they get to a work force
program, is to blend occupational skills training with those programs so
that the students have a skill and a high school equivalency at the same
time. NC Works Customized training, that is the unique program that was
created in the 1950s, that is not unique to us anymore. All the states
do this. Recently I was in Germany, well a few years ago I was in
Germany with the Secretary of Commerce and the Governor, we were
recruiting Seimens to Charlotte. I turned on the television there and
saw the United Arab Emirates recruiting German companies using a
television commercial in Germany targeting based on customized training.
Everybody does it. It&#39;s part of the economic development - the
toolkit if you will - it&#39;s a very big part of the toolkit, and so we
work with about 300 companies a year in terms of customized training
programs to support job growth or technology investment. And then,
finally, we have specialized centers. Our small business centers, which
are our largest at each of our colleges. Bio-network which we have the
best bio-tech programs in the country. Textile Center and the
Manufacturing Solutions Center in Hickory. Very unique and very powerful
centers to support that industry, and then the Military Business Center
which is based in Fayetteville. Here are the numbers, just so you can
see the numbers, and this shows the scale so we have about 150,000
students in our degree based career programs. 129,000 in our transfer.
Career and College Promise, that is our very unique - and thanks to you
- make opportunities for us to offer college courses to high school
students as Dr. Marshall was talking about, about 30,000 a year. 334,000
thousand individuals in our state in the short-term skills training,
work force continuing education. We get 30,000 folks a year through
customized job training. 105,000 in our basic skills programs.
Bio-network 6,000, but a key part of our bio-network is propping up
customized training to give us the best customized training and life
sciences. And in small business centers we have about 50,000 folks who
attend specialized workshops and about 6,000 who get job counseling to
start new businesses in our state. If I may, I&#39;d just like to end on
a couple of innovations real quickly, just so you are aware that this is
some of the things based on our recent tour around the state, but it
also shows things that are happening across state wide. But one of those
and it is Forsyth Tech. A very unique thing that they&#39;ve been
involved with, but we&#39;ve developed throughout the state now, where
you embed industry certification so if you are offering a manufacturing
program, you are getting a college degree in manufacturing, but you are
also getting certifications from the National Institute of Metalworking
Skills, and the Manufacturing Skills Standards Coalition so you get
those industry recognized credentials that are embedded. That is
something that we&#39;ve developed across our technical programs...

Dr. Ross.

Yes, Sir. Sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It&#39;s a great presentation, but just to give a little time for
questions We might want to...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I think Senator Tillman has one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Scott, thank you for the good work that you&#39;re doing at the
community college system. You&#39;ve got probably the number one in the
nation. You read any study on community colleges and we do it right.
What I want to know is if you are at a 2 year technical, career
technical graduate, and you go out into the world of work, maybe into
the technology field or something related to that, and you have a four
year degree program say at Carolina State, say Carolina, what would be
the average starting pay for the 2 year graduate vs the 4 year? Do you
have any clue?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I can tell you some national numbers, and what I do know this is
that we on average, on average if you have a bachelor&#39;s degree you
earn more than an associates, an associate&#39;s certificate. What you
have to be careful for with is averages and...

  <p id="45:00">
  When I went to UNC Chapel Hill, the, the number one major in terms of
salaries the year I graduated was geography. There were four geography
graduates, and one of them was Michael Jordan, so that, averages kind of
get thrown out the window a little bit. What actually matters the most
though is what you actually major in now. That&#39;s the biggest thing,
and so when you look at two year degree areas, there are certain
programs, and the Brookings institution has called it the hidden stem
economy. They will say 50% of all the stem jobs in the United States are
in programs that you can get at a sub bachelor level. If all the lights
go off in this building, it&#39;s gonna take a community college trained
technician to come and fix that problem. So using technology, using
science to diagnose a problem. If you look at those technical, those,
what are the technician programs and the healthcare programs that they
refer to, they, on average, earn $53,000 a year, which is the same
average for the average of bachelor degrees. Certain certificates, even
shorter, about 23% of all certificate holders earn more than the average
for bachelors, but it depends on what it is. If you get a welding
degree, and I&#39;ve seen this multiple times, if you get a welding
degree and you&#39;re willing to travel around the world, you can make
over $100,000.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One follow up, mister chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, go ahead sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That sounds like it&#39;s comparable to a four year degree. Now, if you
will take a four year degree and see what it costs you per year and
divide that into the average starting salary and do that for community
college, you&#39;ll see what a great deal that we have in a community
college system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And it also depends for us, so if you&#39;re, in certain areas, early
childhood, cosmetology does not make nearly as much as the maintenance,
technician areas or the, the healthcare areas.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma&#39;am. Senator Smith.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Dr. Ralls, I just want to commend the community college
system for one thing in their help in economic development. When I
chaired the North Carolina Southeast Commission for economic
development, the community colleges in the region were an absolutely,
extremely important part in recruiting business, and they were always
helpful and it always made a huge difference in getting companies to
come to North Carolina, and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s true across the
state. I do have a, a question. I had heard a rumor that because of the
2% cut, thinking about eliminating all the workforce, excuse me, all the
small business centers around the state, and coming from representing
two very rural, poor counties, the small business centers just are
vitally important to us, and I would certainly hate to have to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, if I may, I can explain that. When the governor&#39;s, and
we&#39;ve been through this every year. Every year, we have to identify,
and this year it was 2% cuts as we go into the budget process. The
challenges for us in community college is two things. One is, and I
will, if this were a different meeting I&#39;d be talking about a
different thing, but I&#39;d be talking about it over and over because
it&#39;s fundamental to workforce development. While I do believe we
have the greatest work, the greatest community college system in the
country, we also pay our instructors, those people who train the future
workforce, among the worst in the United States. We rank in the bottom
third of states, below Mississippi, and so here&#39;s the problem is if
we&#39;re to cut those formula areas, we&#39;re making that awful
situation worse. In our system, we have very few, what are called
categorical programs, non, those programs that are outside of that
formula that supports those instructors. You can see that on that list
right there. That&#39;s what&#39;s left in this system. Those comprise,
you take out, those comprise, that&#39;s about $20 million right there.
And so if you&#39;re gonna get to 2% for us, you&#39;re gonna eliminate
every one of those centers or make our faculty&#39;s salaries, which are
the worst, even worse than they are. So that&#39;s the, the predicament
we&#39;re in, so when we had to write the letter and come up with 2% we
followed through with that, but our point is we don&#39;t wanna step
back anymore on equipment or salaries, and we&#39;ve got nothing left in
our system beyond what you see on that page to be able to address that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have time for one more question. Senator McInnis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much Mister chairman, and Doc Ralls I thank you, and I
wanna thank you for working with me to get the early college high school
kids treated as transfers in the UNC system. I&#39;ve heard a vicious
rumor that there are several or two or three or four of the larger
community college systems that are working to get a four year degree of
their own internally. And I&#39;d love for you to comment, and also
wanna let you know that I&#39;m vehemently against that. We&#39;ve got
some great four year colleges in this state. We don&#39;t need to
reinvent any wheels. We need to do what the mission statement of the
community college, which you have expanded on today, and I&#39;d love to
hear your comment on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, what, in I think is now 23 states across the country where

  <p id="50:00">
  community colleges have been approved to offer four year degrees. And so
that kind of momentum state to state has also prompted some and this is
a place that we truly to be quite honest with you there&#39;s
differences of opinions within our own systems. So you have some that
are in favor of what other states do and some who are very concerned
about that I&#39;m someone who I say if this is going to be looked at
and talked at we need to be cautious for a couple of reasons one is that
we don&#39;t need to jump into an issue and one of the challenges is you
have many students right now that are under employed. So I don&#39;t
think we need to create, you&#39;ve got lawyers now who are being
employed as paralegals you&#39;ve got four year students who are being
employed as paralegals because there&#39;s not any law jobs. I think
we&#39;ve got to be careful not to jump and crate a four year para legal
program. That&#39;s just making the situation worse. I also we have to,
one of the things that&#39;s unique about our state is we have a unique
collaborative relationship with in higher ed with UNC system and you
fund a lot of higher ed. I mean we&#39;ve got a lot of community
colleges a lot and so I think the first efforts need to be made to make
sure that is as tight as possible trough our articulation agreement. So
I think we need to, having the discussions are valid but we need to be
very, very deliberate in how those occur.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wells who says he has a very short question for a short answer
then I have to pound the gavel okay?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman and it&#39;s really more of a comment. Dr. Oz
thank you for being here as I recall about a month ago you released a
study in conjunction with the University system given effectively a cost
benefit analysis of the dollars that were spend. When we&#39;re talking
about expending state tax dollars on workforce expansion, next time you
do one of those studies I would be interested in seeing a comparison
that includes the cash incentives program that we do in the state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It&#39;s about economic development programs?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The JDIG JMAC those kinds of programs. To see on a dollar return basis
how do our workforce efforts stack up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much everyone for being here there were great comments
and great questions at least most of them were Senator Tillman is
already gone so I can comment like that. But thank you for being here
and we&#39;re going to keep on trying to find the best solution. Thank
you very much, we&#39;re done.
