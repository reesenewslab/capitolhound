<p id="00:00">
We’re ready to start. So the meeting will come to order. We’re happy to
have House Sergeant-at-arms people today, ?? Bill Blast, Bob Rossy and
Reggie Seals helping us.  You should have on your desk a copy of the
bill and a copy of the, did we send out a copy of the summary?  This is
a conference report and the reason that Jim and I wanted to have this
meeting, we wanted to the House Agriculture Committee to actually look
at the conference report until comfortable with that and we’ll have a
simple motion to accept that at the end.  And it does go to Finance
after it leaves the Ag. Committee.  Jimmy, if you’re ready.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Got it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the Committee, thanks for being here.
As Representative Langdon indicated we had all the possibility in the
world the other day when this came on the floor of the House to just
vote to concur.  As I made a brief statement on the floor of the House
the other day, we felt like that at least this committee needed time to
take a look at it and so we appreciate your attendance here.  Mr. Chair,
I think it might be helpful and might be beneficial to the procedure if
we recognize a couple of people in the audience from some of the
agencies in addition to I think I know of a couple who wants to make
public comment and so it might be beneficial to us, Mr. Chair if we
recognize these individuals up front for about two minutes.  Does that
meet with the approval of the chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It does.  And what we have is Joy Hicks from Department of Ag, Joy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Joy Hicks, Legislative liaison with the
Department of Agriculture.  We, the Department of Agriculture certainly
appreciate your support and would urge your concurrence with this
conference report. The conference report does a lot to help the
department continue to provide the regulatory and consumer services that
you expect from us. The specifics it allows us to efficiently work with
our law enforcement officers both with the North Carolina forest service
and at the state fairs to make sure that we can enforce our agriculture
laws that you have put in the statute efficiently by using those law
enforcement officers across their various jurisdictions.  It allows us
to aid our farmers and our pesticide laws better by classifying our
pesticide applicators and providing specific training for them, not one
size fits all training that they currently get through their EPA
certification.  It allows us to recognize our marketing program as a
state wide agricultural ?? bnc marketing program further promote if you
don’t know this month is actually ?? bnc products month and were proud
of that proud and this would  help promote that marketing program
further.  There are also several land owner protections here in this
bill but the Department of Agriculture in their support of farmers and
their support of land owners greatly would like to see enacted.  So Mr.
Chairman and Representative Dixon, we have with us various staff today
if there are questions that you have. But We greatly support this ??
agriculture bill that’s before you  in this House of Ag I believe this
is our first agriculture bill this session and we are proud of it and
we’re here to fully support it
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Joy.   Jake Parker, Farm Bureau.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman I’m Jake Parker State Legislative Director and
Legislative council for the North Carolina Farm Bureau.  I appreciate
this committee taking the time to look at this conference report which
the North Carolina Farm Bureau supports. I want to point out several
provisions that we have policies supporting and that we would commend to
you first.  The confidentiality.</p>

<p id="05:00">
Speaker 2:  . . . section number one we think is a reasonable approach
to dealing with environmental complaints that are filed against farmers.
We don’t think it hinders the ability of ?? to investigate those
complaints. It’s a . . . as I said at the beginning it’s a reasonable
approach to dealing with that issue our farmers are concerned about.
Second, the fertilizer language that you see in section two represents a
compromise from a version of the bill that was introduced through the
ENC process earlier this year. The League of Municipalities, North
Carolina Farm Bureau, the Department of Agriculture and several industry
groups support that provision. I’d also like to point out section tens
and eleven which relate to trespass on farms and the use of ATVs on
farms. Farmers are as you know are very interested in protecting their
private property rights and these provisions are a way to help do that.
In particular with the first three trespass issue you could have a
situation with metal theft that could fall under these positions, or
this provision and it’s something we think is a good bill, a good
provision in the bill. There are also other provisions relating to the
department that Joy spoke about, in particular the ?? provision that we
think are important.
With that, Mr. Chairman, we commend you, commend the bill to you and
urge your support. Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Jake. Jim, we have a couple people, some other
people that want to speak. Do you want to let them speak now?
Speaker 3: Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 3: It’s my recommendation, Mr. Chair, that we do hear for those
who’d like to make public comment now. My understanding from the Chair
is that you’re going to allow them two-minutes and Sergeant at Arms is
going to control that for us.  Is that correct, Mr. Chair?
Speaker 1: That is correct. Scott Mackey, Chair of the Landscape . . . I
can’t read the writing there.
Speaker 4: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Yes, Scott Mackey, Chair of the
Landscape Contractors Registration Board. We’ve been in existence since
1975 as a voluntary landscape contractor’s registration board. We
support the entire bill but especially the landscape part of this bill.
I can give you a personal example of a small business owner, I don’t
know, a small company in Newton Grove, North Carolina. The DOT Rest Area
Project that was undertaken, the planting project undertaken about six
or eight months ago in the Benson area. It’s about eight miles away from
my farm where we produce plants, trees and shrubs and flowers. We have
an interest in bidding on that planting project part of that
construction at the DOT Rest Area as a company but the number one item
on their specification sheet was a requirement to be a licensed general
contractor for the planting part of that project. We consider that a
serious barrier to entry as landscape contractors. The pork portion of
this bill has the limit for planting projects at $30,000 so small
outfits, small operators, companies much like myself wouldn’t very often
be affected by this. We totally support every part of this bill and as
the registration board we find, since it’s completely voluntary it
doesn’t supersede the need for a general contractor’s license. This bill
fixes that for us. We like the entire bill. As small business owners, as
farmers and as growers of plant material in the green industry and the
registration board is already in place and would transfer over toward
the licensing board. So we don’t really create a new board here. We just
transfer one over. We’d ask for your support. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you. We also have Michael Curran, which is a business
owner in North Carolina Green Industry Council.
Speaker 5: Yes, I’m Michael Curran. I’m the owner of Greenscape
Incorporated based here in The Triangle and also a member of the Green
Industry Council. I really appreciate this time just to communicate with
you a couple of important features. The green industry in the most
recent economic survey was a 8.6 billion industry. So, it is huge. It’s
one of the top four commodity groups in agriculture. The emphasis on
environmental and water safety is very much an important part of what we
in the landscape industry deal with. One of the things that’s very
important is for us to have the ability to enforce the best practices
within the landscape industry. As Scott said, we do have a registration
act that exists since 1975-76 this . . .</p>

<p id="10:00">
Makes that legislation a practice act and it gives the board the ability
to have some teeth in holding people accountable if there is a violation
of the law. I serve on the North Carolina Irrigation Contractors
Licensing Board and I would just share with you, every time we have had
a hearing with someone who has violated that law, I've come out of the
hearing saying it is very appropriate that we in those cases hold those
people accountable because the damage that they are doing to the
consumer and to the environment by not the understanding the
professional practices in the industry is very important. So, I urge
your support of this bill and believe that it does offer very valuable
consumer report. Many of the complaints that we get come directly form
the consumer and that has been true on the Registration Board where I
have severed in the past and on the Irrigation Board. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Dixon. I believe that is the person i
had listed that wanted to speak. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright, very good
thank for your comments. Mr. Chairman, I would also believe that it
would serve purposes here and smooth out the process if you would be
willing to recognize Chris Saunders, who will cover I think its either 3
or 4 just absolutely technical parts of this deal, so we can alleviate
them from any further discussion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Chris. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. There were some changes made in the
Conference Report, i believe those are what Representative Dixon was
referring to, I guess just in the interest of being comprehensive I’ll
cover all the changes that were made in the Conference Report between
the 5th edition which is what passed the Senate and the Conference
Report changes. Section 3-D concerning the Landscape Contract Licensing
Board, if you look on page 5 of the bill line 15 there’s an exemption
from Licensure for any landscaping work for price of all contracts, for
labor, material and all other items for a given job site during a
consecutive 12 month period is less than $30,000. Previously that number
was $25,000 this was raised to $30,000 to bring it in line with the
general contractor number. Section 4 refers to the due date of the DPS
report on the Commercial Safety Vehicle Alliance North American
Standard. Sorry, that is Section 4 on page 12 of the Bill. The date is
on line 28. The Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance North American
Standard Inspection Program is a roadside inspection program where if a
commercial vehicle is pulled over and given a safety inspection it can
receive a decal that’s good for 3 months does essentially says you don’t
have to get another comprehensive safety inspection for the duration of
that decal. DPS is studying this program, previously they were directed
to report back to the Agricultural and Forestry Awareness Study
Commission on or before November 1st 2014 that date has been extended to
February 1st 2015. Section 6 would amend the chairmanship of the
Agricultural and Forestry Awareness Study Commission by keeping the
Hells Agricultural and Senate Agricultural Environment and Natural
Resources chairs, as the chairs of the Study Commission, as they are
now, though it will also allow the President [inaudible] of the Senate
and Speaker of the House to each appoint an additional member to serve
as co-chair. That is on page 12 and goes on to page 13, the new language
is on page 13 lines 19 through 22. Then, as far as purely technical
changes, on page 17 a severability clause was added, Section 17-A.  And
then, there are 4 sections that are new to the Conference Report, 3 of
which came out of different versions of the budget. Section 8 is a
entirely new section which amends the Horse Industry Promotion Act. That
is on page 13 going on to page 14</p>

<p id="15:00">
And that expands the definition of commercial horse feed for the
purposes of the horse industry promotion checkoff program for the horse
industry to include any commercial feed labelled or marketed for equine
use. Previously it was just commercial horse feed meaning any commercial
feed labelled for equine use. So the only changes that it adds the words
“are marketed”. Section 15 was in the house version of the budget that’s
on page, page 16. That section would add to the list of products
promoted by the Got to be and sea program seafood and would designate
the Got to be and sea campaign as the official agricultural and
marketing campaign for the state. Section 16 which is on page 17 was in
both versions of the budget. I believe, the House budget had some
additional lines along with it but this Section would allow the
Pesticide Board to adopt rules to classify private pesticide applicators
and I believe, ?? referred to that in her comments. And then Section 17
which is also on page 17 was in both the House and Senate Budgets and it
would exempt the Board of Agriculture for room making for the purposes
of setting annual admission fees to the State fare and that includes the
changes that are in the conference report from the senate version.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dixon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr Chair. Thank you a lot. Request that, I think that this
facilitated the discussion a great deal. Mr Chair, I think; unless you
feel differently, that on those sections that have not received mention,
that I’ll make a brief comment and then will, would, would take
sections. Let’s, let’s, I suggest you open it up to the members of the
committee for questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The poll is now open for the members of the committee to make comments
or ask questions. You get, you got it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr Chairman. Several of us were a little puzzled about Section
9 on page 14 that use pesticides on moles except for the star nosed mole
and I’m wondering, how you know what kind you have?” I mean, I usually
only see the mounds they make unless catches one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr Chair, we have an expert in the audience that I will suggest that you
call on for the answer to that question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you would please come straight.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have an expert ?? Like an analyst.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr John. James Burnette, what am I? I am the Director of the
Structural Pest Control and Pesticides Division North Carolina
Department of Agriculture. According to the Wildlife Resources
Commission, there are three species of moles that we have in North
Carolina; the eastern mole, the hairy-tailed mole and the star-nosed
mole. This amendment would classify two of them as pests not the
star-nosed mole. The star-nosed mole is generally found in more aquatic,
more riparian, more wet environments. So it is not generally the one
that causes damage to lawns and gardens and ornamental plantings in the
state. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Brody.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr Chairman. I wanted to ask a question on Section number 7.
And the Bill pretty much merits the, the summary here. It said the
Commissioner is authorized to appoint as many ?? agriculture law
enforcement officers as he or she deems necessary. Are there any
restrictions on to how many they appoint, is it a budgetary restriction
or is, is there another formula for how they’re going to determine how
many law enforcement officers? Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dixon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Two important, two important things about this provision. In the event
that this takes place, these officers will receive exactly the same
training as other folks. The ?? Association has signed off on this and
the number, it’s my understanding that the Commissioner would determine
the number.</p>

...that he feels would be appropriate for help to help him in his
responsiblities in certain events like the state fair and other events
like that. To my knowledge there is no set number that will take place
it will be at the discretion of the commissioner. And there are no
budget implications, it will be people already on the payroll.
[Speaker changes] Representative Luebke
[Speaker changes] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My concern Chair Dickson is
in on section one. And
[Speaker changes] I sort of thought that might be where you had a
[Speaker changes] Well, it's concerning what's stated on line twelve as
the introductory feature, the agriculture operation investigation shall
be confidential. And question is why would these kinds of complaints
made by citizens be confidential records? As opposed to everything else
that we think of in our public life as open records.
[Speaker changes] The, thank you Representative Luebke and that is a
very important question. Further down the actual complaint, I come in
with a complaint against Luebke farms, at that point, my claim against
Luebke Farms is not public record. Deaner or the appropriate
organization receives that complaint, investigates, at the point that
there is a violation it then becomes public record according to all of
the statutes that are on the books now.  One of the reasons that I think
that that's an important provision, and we actually, I can provide you
later with the actual number of complaints and stuff, sensationalism can
be a problem. The public display of a complaint in many instances rings
a bell that it ought not to ring if it's not true. Once the bell is
rung, the bell is rung. But later down when you go down further once the
investigating organization determines that indeed there has been a
violation it then is public record according to the statutes that we
have now.
[Speaker changes] Representative Luebke
[Speaker changes] I understand the point you're making about perhaps the
complaint is not a valid one or is made in a very outspoken manner that
people might not like, but I think about a lot of public situations that
public meet and events well interactions between citizens and the
government where citizens might not like something that city council has
done. And they might write a letter to the mayor and to the city council
members and be quite strong in the language the rhetoric of the letter.
That is, nevertheless, a public record. This seems to be similar and so
I ask you again, why should this one be confidential when it is parallel
to what I said an unhappy citizen with the city council which is a
public record?
[Speaker changes] Representative Blust, you...
[Speaker changes] Mr. Chairman, if I could speak to that point
[Speaker changes] You may
[Speaker changes] Thank you. It's very important to point out the
language the gentleman from Durham is taken verbatim from the state
ethics act. This is the way that we police ourselves. It's very
important also to point out that unlike the scenerio the gentleman is
describing in which a citizen may complain about the action of a public
body, we are talking about a private enterprise here, that has received
a complaint lodged for something they are alleged to have done. This is
in large way no different than if you or I are accused of a crime or of
having broken some law. This clearly says that the department will take
the steps it needs to figure out if the complaint or if the charge is
valid. And</p>

1st speaker.  .. And if they determine it is, it does become part of a
public  record along with all of the worksheets and the work product
that they produce but again  i would point out that this language comes
???
from the state ethics statue that governs how complaints against
legislators are dealt with.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Richardson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May i Mr. Chairman
[SPEAKER CHANGES] yes
[SPEAKER CHANGES] may I continue on that, i would say that for its worth
Representative Louis what we setup necessarily for the legislative
process. It's not the same as the example i gave where citizens might be
upset with something involving a private business where the city council
should have done  something another words it is not a public private
distinction i was drawing, i was just drawing attention to the fact
that's going to public agency just as Department of Agriculture is a
public agency. but i you followed ??? Mr. Chairman with a specific point
has been drawn under my attention which is having to do with when the
information does become private, public rather and that is the meaning
of the term warning. If a there is action challenging complaint is made
is the finding of the warning sufficient t tom make the record a public
record.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] what line are you referring to
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I am referring tot the fact that on line sixteen there
is the statement of a violation without the definition of the violation
so i know one of the  possible  findings of the department is that is to
give a warning to the farm and is giving a warning sufficient definition
that does meet the definition of violation so that the information
become public information.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Dickson
[SPEAKER CHANGES] From my experience Representative Luebke being a swan
produces and coming under very strict rules and regulations being in
compliance or out of compliance, the language here indicates that
anything that the department determines that would put any other out of
compliance situation it would be a violation and that is defined.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK, Thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman if i could stop now and maybe have a
comment at the end if i could.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] i got you
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative ????
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr chairman. On a point of protecting the
confidentiality of the complain i can understand the desire  of a
private enterprise to protect itself from frivolous complains. But i do
wonder lets say that Leubke farms have been making complaints against
??? farms repeatedly that have been found frivolous and
some of start to get trough  and i have the desire to defend myself
legally from serious of frivolous complains form my neighbor would it be
in my interest to have legal access to all of the complains that he has
filed under the public documents statues so i can show a pattern of
frivolous complains to knock down his current complain against me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dickson
[SPEAKER CHANGES] and with the ??? which you just presented that
hypothetical i think you  would have the skill and court of law to make
your case and actually receive those.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative harry
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mine is a different question if there is anything else
on this same thing, mine is on the different part of the deal .Is it OK
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I didn't understand what she said
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, is this from the same section,
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes
[SPEAKER CHANGES]OK
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,  i apologize ???????? joined no name tag
club but i am supposed to be here today, but i would say on that, I
actually think representative Meyer point if i can address his, I think
is a court order if i am not mistaken. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End OF Audio</p>

<p id="30:00">
Ways be found, sought to get all of that information out. So, I don't
think, I think that does help protect in that sense. My question is, it
kind of goes back to what Representative Luebke was saying, I just
wanted for a point of clarification. If I'm understanding correctly, I
think you have to go to DENR's regulations, that it's possible that a
violation, that a warning, does not fit the definition of violation for
purpose of public records. And I think that could potentially be a
concern. For instance, if I'm not mistaken DENR can always make the
decision that yes, there's been a violation, we're going to give them a
warning. And if that doesn't fit into public records, then I think some
concerns within the, okay well this Luebke forms has gotten 10 warnings,
but that's never made public record, even though violations have been
found. So, I was wondering if I could ask staff to clarify if that would
in fact be the situation.
SPEAKER CHANGES: The term violation isn't defined in the bill. It isn't
defined in the statutes. But it is used hundreds of times in the
environmental statutes. And it means purely a violation of the statute,
or the rules adopted thereunder. So, I don't think the issue of whether
it's a warning, or notice of no violation, it doesn't matter. If there
has been a violation of the statutes, or the rules, it constitutes a
violation for purposes of this provision.
SPEAKER CHANGES: Representative Dixon.
SPEAKER CHANGES: Thank you. And that's a very good point. And we did
something in the last, we're beginning to make adjustments in the way we
handle situations like that, so that the departments don't always have
to be punitive on the first visit. And we did some stuff in regulatory
form I think that actually addressed that to where we gave them
flexibility to educate, to help, rather than just going out and being
punitive from the very beginning.
SPEAKER CHANGES: If I may follow up?
SPEAKER CHANGES: Yes, you may.
SPEAKER CHANGES: And that was my point, is that that way DENR can go and
not be punitive, but then it still can fit into what we've got policy
wise for public records exceptions. So, if I'm hearing that correctly,
even if it's a warning, it goes on the public records.
SPEAKER CHANGES: Mr. Chairman.
SPEAKER CHANGES: Yes.
SPEAKER CHANGES: That's the way I would interpret the provision. It says
a violation, so if there is a violation in the statutes, or the rules,
it fits the criteria to be released.
SPEAKER CHANGES: Representative Hurley, another section.
SPEAKER CHANGES: Thank you, yes. So in section, it's on page 13, section
7, about the law enforcement responsibility. And my question is are
these new officers, or are these officers already in the department? And
it appears that they will be sworn officers that may be not sworn
officers now?
SPEAKER CHANGES: Representative Dixon.
SPEAKER CHANGES: Representative Hurley, they will be current employees.
They will be sworn officers. The criteria for qualifying for that is
identical to how all other sworn officers are sworn in.
SPEAKER CHANGES: My concern is the sworn and the unsworn does make a big
difference. So, I'm just checking for budgetary problems, situation.
Thank you.
SPEAKER CHANGES: Anyone else?
SPEAKER CHANGES: Representative Lewis. Representative ??
SPEAKER CHANGES: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I thought I was in the queue.
Thank you Representative Dixon. I just wanted to note that all the
public folks that we've heard today have been supportive of the bill.
And as I was looking through section by section, I suppose that people
might be opposed to the bill if they believe that there should not be a
Contractors Licensing Board. I assume that the moles would be opposed to
the bill, if they don't like the pesticide portion. Who else are we
aware of that would be opposed to the bill? Notwithstanding some of the
concerns that we've heard debated so far. We've not heard anybody from
the public come forward against. Are you aware of other groups, or
concerns, that people have against the bill?
SPEAKER CHANGES: Representative Dixon.
SPEAKER CHANGES: Representative Jones, if</p>

<p id="35:00">
if they are they have not approached me and that was one of the reasons
that, though we had the votes to concur and never have this meeting,
Representative Langdon and I felt that we needed this meeting. And so, I
think from my comments, when I said that on the floor and with the
postings we've heard, or at least I'm assuming that I've heard from
anybody, and I even, on the floor when we put the meeting off, offered
to stand at the desk and be chastised for not having this meeting last
Friday afternoon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McGrady.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank the Chairs for holding the
meeting and the process being used her and I guess I respond to
Representative Jones. I'm pretty comfortable with this bill with the
exception of the section 1 provisions and I'm really not sure whether we
need an exempt records of investigations of agricultural operations from
the state Open Records Laws. That, for me, is the key issue in this
bill. There's already a criminal statute that makes it a misdemeanor to
file a false report so if somebody files a false report they're just,
fight going on between neighbors. There's a way to sort that out and I
just, philosophically I think that's the only portion of this bill that
is problematical and I really have, the rest of the bill I'm pretty
comfortable with. I just wish section 1 wasn't written the way it was.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dixon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative McGrady, and not having experience as a
farmer, which you do not have, and not having the experience of having
numerous faults, complaints levied against him I can understand that
position. I can show you documentation of where folks flew in airplanes
and came back to DENR and accused folks of having poultry litter piled
up behind their farms and it was [??]. I can show you a photo that
people, very critically and it made the headlines in newspapers widely,
that the poor decision that a school the LEA made by allowing their
school students to be on ground within a couple of hundred yards of
dangerous agriculture, livestock waste and it was not that. So I can't
express my support for this principle in this bill any more vigorously
than that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, if I could just-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I, Representative Dixon, I hear you loud and strong. The only thing I
was going to quibble on is my family's been a Christmas tree farmer for
a pretty good, long time but not of the same nature that you're
reflecting here and I understand that. I'm not, I'm struggling with it.
It's not that I'm firm either way. That's the only part of the bill that
gives me some hesitation, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, may I be recognized for a motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke wanted to make a comment then you can make the
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I did and my comment is first that, Representative Dixon, I appreciated
your answers to my concerns. You haven't persuaded me but that's okay.
We don't always vote the same way on House floor, I don't think. But I
did want to say to you and to Chair Langdon that I very much appreciate
that you have brought this bill back to us for consideration. As you
know, a lot of process concerns that I have talked about on the House
floor and so I'm deeply grateful to the both of you for bringing the
bill here so that we could have a committee discussion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I move that the committee recommend the House
do adopt the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You've heard the motion, all in favor of the motion say aye. All opposed
no. The Aye's have it and the motion</p>
