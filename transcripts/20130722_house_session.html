Members, there's a lot of times within this body that the two sides of
this chamber is not able to agree upon things. And this issue, when it

just clarified the transfer of assets with respect to deferred
depreciation and a second change was identifying the responsible person
in the business entity for the principal amount of taxes and then the
Senate also added an amendment on the third read that did some
corrections to House Bill 998, clarifying state attractions and secondly
also exempting from sales tax a service contract provided for any item

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
The Senate changes were so minor and technical I just won't talk about
those. This passed the House with the good vote a few weeks ago, and our
precedent from 2 years ago when it came back from the Senate it even had
a greater vote. And real strong in the Senate, this is a opportunity for
children with special needs to get some educational help where they're
not  currently receiving it, and the key thing to remember is the big
change, 99% of the bill is that it makes parents who are too poor to pay
income tax eligible for the same program that those who do pay income
tax are currently eligible for. I would encourage your positive vote on
this. Thank you.

Rep. Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To briefly debate the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, I apologize.
I supported 269 when it came through and I support it today on
concurrence, and my reason for supporting it is simple. My beef is with
the underlying bill that it seeks to fix. That's law. And we deal with
the law as it is not as we wish it to be. The underlying bill I
disagreed with, but this bill may actually make it a touch better. And I
think that's the intent, it may actually allow some economically
disadvantaged kids to cobble together some scholarship capacities with
the grant in circumstances where perhaps the public school is simply not
able to provide that seriously disabled child with all the services they
need. While again I disagreed with the underlying bill, I don't think
this bill does any harm, and I think it may fix it slightly to the
better. And for that reason only I support it, and encourage my
colleagues to vote for it.

Rep. McManus, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
I want to partially agree with Rep. Glazier, we didn't agree on the
initial bill that passed in previous session, I thought it was a great
bill, and I got people from all over the state that thought it was a
great bill, but I do agree with them in this, if you are- most of what
we heard in the debate against this bill earlier was against the law
that's already passed. And as Rep. Stam has already aptly said, this
just takes that provision and makes it better, and extends it to the
lowest income folks in the state. And for that reason I ask you- we had
a good vote on this bill before, and I ask you to vote yes to concur.

Ladies and gentlemen, this is the wildlife poacher reward fund that we
had debate on, I believe it was last week. In this bill it has two
provisions. One, it has to do with the poaching of wildlife. Two, it has
to deal with vessel safety standards for boating. And if you remember
the main piece was put in here, the Senate did take that out and send it
back to us and I'd ask that you concur with us today. Thank you.

Representative: I would like to be recorded as voting no on house bill
269.
Speaker: The lady will be recorded as having voted no on house bill 269,
the concurrence vote. Senate bill 76, the clerk will read.
Clerk: To the president, the senate, the speaker of house
representatives, [xx] to resolve the difference between the senate and
house representatives on senate bill 76, a bill and act to authorize
department environment resources permits on or after March 1, 2015 for
oil and gas expiration and development activities in the state. The
senate and house of representative recommend that - the conferies
recommend that the senate and house of representatives stop this report.
Conferies for the senate: Senators Newton, Cheriton, Bracko, McClauren
and Harrington. Conferies for the house of representatives:
Representatives Stone, chair, Samuelson and Hagar.
Speaker: Representative Stone, please state your purpose.
Representative: To debate the bill and make a motion.
Speaker: The gentleman is recognized to debate and make a motion.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chair. Ladies and gentleman, we did some
remarkable work with senate bill 76. For those that do not know, we took
the date out and also made it where we have no permits being issued by
the general assembly without affirmative action being taken. No
conditional permits. We took the land man put it back in a study. We
also seen the service tax put into a study as well so we could see what
the other states around the country are doing. So when we start up the
operation we can make sure it pays for itself. There was one item added
– we added no fiscal note on the rules. So with that, I ask that you
concur on the bill.
Speaker: Representative Time, please state your purpose.
Representative: To debate the bill and make a motion.
Speaker: The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman, I rise
today because I am for energy independence and least energy security in
this county. I think it can be done if we put our mind to it, but only
if it is done responsibly and reasonably. This bill, there are some
issues with the off shore provisions of it. $1.2 billion is the economy
of just [xx] and for our tourism economy. We are being asked to take a
risk of $1.2 billion for what, in the changes that have been made, is
about 8% would go to ports and also towards environmental activities on
the coast. I hardly see how those revenues share can really offset that
type of a risk to our economy in this type of an area. Furthermore, just
so we all understand it, because in the public and in the news there is
a lot of discussion as to what this bill is about and what revenues
sharing is available: there is no revenue sharing available to any state
– to NC rather, under the current congressional rules. So it will
literally take an act of congress. So we are asking the governor to go
forward and say we want you to actively solicit into the program right
now without any guarantee of any revenue sharing, let alone local
revenue sharing – which is what I am particularly concerned with.
Furthermore, the jobs are most likely going to come out of Norfolk, not
out of NC. The MS study that was done by the department of interior
indicates that, most likely, the jobs will come out of Norfolk because
that port has the infrastructure that is able to support the massive
amount of people that will be needed to build the offshore roads. So for
that reason I will be voting no and I ask that you do the same. Thank
you.
Speaker: Representative Harris, please state your purpose.
Representative: To briefly debate the motion.
Speaker: The lady is recognized to debate the motion.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman and house I
cannot really add to much to Representative Time’s comments. I do want
to thank Representatives Stone, Samuelson and Hagar for making vast
improvements to this bill because the bill that the senate sent over had
some problematic provisions in it that would have fast tracked fracking.
I still agree with those short comings related to the offshore drilling.
We have got a strong economy that is built on a clean coast, and
exploiting our coast oil supply that may reduce gas prices by a penny 10
years down the road, I think is hardly worth it. So, if we are focusing
on energy independence, I think we focus more on the clean energy
economy which is has been the fastest growth in the energy sector: for
every million dollars we invest in clean energy creates three and a half
more times more jobs than one million dollars in fossil fuel based
industries. For those reasons, I urge you to vote no on the report.
Thank you.
Speaker: Representative Stone, please state your purpose.
Representative: To debate a bill.
Speaker: The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion a second time.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman, I will just
remind you that</p>

One small step in a long process that we have so that we can make sure
North Carolina is energy independent and I will tell you that we've made
some great progress. We want to send a strong message to the industry
that North Carolina is moving in the right direction and this bill will
be a step forward so we can send that message. So, I'd ask you to to
concur with the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hager, please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGE]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank
you, Mr. Speaker. Guys, this bill is a good bill. It does two things, it
gets us back closer to what we agreed on with the public and Senate Bill
820 and some of the bills we've passed in previous sessions, on the
fracking side, and I'd like to commend Representative Stone for his,
some call it hardheadedness, I say steadfastness in what he's done. The
second part though, actually tries, it moves forward and takes a step,
as Representative Stone said, in a long journey of setting up our off
shore drilling process, and it is a process. If you look at the bill it
starts setting up, asks the Governor to set up a compact with Virginia
and some of the other states. That's the first step, and Representative
Tine is correct in what he says abut the revenue sharing, but that's
down the road. We have to take these steps to get be able to get down
the road. I think we have a good plan in place. I think if you read the
bill it shows what our intentions are, once we do have revenue sharing
and how we will protect the coast and the people of the coast. So, I ask
you to vote for this bill and allow us to take that first step. Vote for
this motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The question for the House is the motion
to adopt the conference report for Senate Bill 76. All in favor vote
aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will
let the machine record the vote. 70 having voting affirmative. 40 in the
negative. The conference report for Senate Bill 76 has been adopted. The
Senate will be so notified. Representative Collins is the gentleman
prepared to move forward with 359. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would like to
make a motion regarding to that House Bill 359. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman has been recognized to state his motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It
appears to me that the, the motion is that we would take this off the
calendar tonight and today, and re-calendar it for tomorrow. The reason
is that there appear to be substantial changes that have been made by
the Senate and I'm not sure I understand what all of them are. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Without objection. The motion is to re-calendar House Bill 359
until tomorrow, without objection. So ordered. Senate Bill 547, the
clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] House committee sub two for Senate
Bill 547. The bill to be entitled An Act of Men. The statues governing

Representative North Carolina 99. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Hager,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. If you, as you remember last week, guys. This
bill deals with how we, the process of our accused RFB's, and how we've
used energy audits and how we save energy in our major universities and
our major buildings, the government buildings. Last week, in session, in
committee we added NC State and UNC Charlotte to be able to do their own
energy auditing, and the question was brought to the floor of should we
add other universities? Once we thought about that, this is kind of a
trial test. NC State's been doing it for a while, we wanted to add UNC
Charlotte also, and to be able get that and have good conformance for
the bill. We suggested that maybe we just stop at Charlotte and use this
test case, and add more as we need later. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would the gentleman yield for a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager, does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So the
consideration for A&amp;T as a school of engineering was not, you all
decided not to do that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Michaux, what I
had talked with Senator Hunt about was to add a couple schools at a
time. Go ahead and get these started, get the process developed. State
had been the only one doing it here to ?? So, we wanted to add one
college and one university which was an engineering university and I
think A&amp;T would probably be the next one we would add. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Need a follow up, could I follow? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the
gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One of the problems I'm having is that
these produced energy saving, particularly for the institutions in mind
here, and since there having been some major cuts, particularly in
HBCU's. Why could you not go ahead on and add that, A&amp;T to that
group now? So that they can take advantage of those savings that are
done in order to help</p>

Them, particularly in the cuts that they've already - that they are [??]
suffering now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for that question Representative Michaux. If
you want to offer an amendment you're certainly welcome to. I would
oppose that amendment because of the issue and the deal. We had talked
with Senator Hunt in trying to add just a few universities at a time,
use those as test cases, get the process down pat and then look and see
if we want to move forward without the universities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Michaux please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker I'd like to speak on the bill and make a
request.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Ladies and gentleman I don' have any problems
basically with the bill other than the fact that the A&amp;T state
university is one of the premier schools of engineering, one of the
premier schools of engineering in this state, and they have not been
added and been able to take advantage of these savings. I would ask that
Mr. Speaker that we carry this bill over to tomorrow because I would
like to have an opportunity to try to add them into this and get an
amendment to do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Michaux moves that Senate bill 547 be
removed from today's calendar and re-calendared for tomorrow. Is there
objection?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Objection.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Objection having been raised does the gentleman wish
to put the vote?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentleman the motion which was in order by
Representative Michaux was to re-calender senate bill 547, remove it
form today's calendar and re-calendar it for tomorrow. All in favor vote
aye, all opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk allot
machine record the vote, 53 having voted affirmative and 57 in the

discussion, further debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brandon please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ask the bill sponsor a question please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hager does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hager, going along with what
Representative Michaux was asking about, would you be opposed to having
language that says - because you say that we're going to add these, that
North Carolina A&amp;T would be the next one to have that language in
there. So part of the problem that I have is just that looking at the
way APCU's have been funded historically, it's particularly in this
particular area where North Carolina A&amp;T is the leading engineering
school for African Americans all over the country, but certainly our
state doesn't respect that in terms of funding. I would love for us to
be able to put the language in, if you're opposed to doing it right now
and you say that you're serious about doing it in the future that we
would have some type of language, that we put that in that North
Carolina A&amp;T the second largest engineering school in this state
will be the next person to be able to take advantage of this. And would
you oppose that amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Brandon and I'll say A&amp;T
is one of the three or four accredited schools, engineering accredited
schools we have in the state also. What I want to do representative
Brandon is move this bill now and then let's add that - we can add that
later on. That's certainly something we can do in the short station but
I'd like to see this bill going ahead and moved out now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Catlin please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a point of clarification, this bill is to make it
more affordable, more efficient for performance based contracting. These
are private contracting companies that guarantee their performance, and
if they don't meet the energy savings then we don't have to pay them, so
it protects tax payer dollars. Letting a university do this is dangerous
and so the university, well, NC State they know how to do it, they've
done it in the past so they've proven it. Adding one more university is
an experiment, to add any more I think would be dangerous so it's
something that we need to look at in the future.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Floyd please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the bill sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hager does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hager you indicated and we voted not to
carry the bill over until tomorrow, will you be meaningful to displace
this and let it be to the end of the agenda so representative Michaux
can get his amendment today?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Floyd this bill was a second reading
last week, I think we've had ample time to get an amendment together if
we want to run an amendment. I would want to go ahead and move this bill
now.

Michaux please state your purpose.

Glazier today and although I know he still doesn't support the bill, I
believe even he likes this amendment because it, they think that, folks
think this clears up any issues, so I know of no objection of the
amendment. I would urge the body's adoption.

To explain the effect of the amendment. I want to thank you, Mister
Speaker. Members, the third reading was delayed on this bill simply
because the title was to have been changed in the amendment that passed
last week. And, there was simply a drafting error in it. So the fact
that what's been changed today is simply, at this point, is simply
technical in nature in conforming to the subsequent change that was
already made. It was my position that it should not delay the third
reading, because it's not a material change. That's why we didn't do
third reading last time, was for that very change.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The chair would rule the strictest interpretation of
the rule that if any member object, we will carry it over to third
reading.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I object.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman objects. The bill will be carried over to
tomorrow. Send Bill 18 to ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We accept for Bill 18. The bill's been titled ??, the
Locksmith Licensing Act, expanding the authority of the Locksmith
Licensing Board to regulate institutional locksmiths in raising the
ceiling on certain fees. General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Robert Brawley, please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Senate is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, this
was requested by the locksmiths. It strengthens the licenser for
locksmiths. It makes it against the law to have tools that are normally
possessed by locksmiths. Requires any locksmith who's working on a
boating facility, mechanical, educational, criminal tax, or personal
facility where there's locking required, to be licensed as a locksmith.
Increases the penalty from a Class III to a Class I. And it authorizes
the board to increase the fees up to 300. The stated intent of the board
was to move up to 125. I know of no opposition and ask for your support
for the Senate bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bill  Brawley, please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I wonder if the gentleman from ?? would yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Robert of Brawley, this is gentleman
??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Did I understand you to say that the mere possession
of locksmith tools without a locksmith's license would now be a crime?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If it's for keying, yes sir. Keying, coating, the
things that a locksmith has to have to do his job.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative ??, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have to oppose this bill, and I'll tell you why.
Because I've been trained as a locksmith, though I don't have my
license. And I have locksmith tools, and I have keying machines and all
those things necessary to assist people. And I do help unlock locks for
people, I've helped unlock their cars, and I just don't see where that
should be illegal. If you have it for illegal purposes, you're caught
breaking into a house of something, then there's already laws for that.
But I just don't see where we need to make simple possession of tools
that have been legal up to this point, illegal. And I'd ask that you
would vote against this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Robert Brawley, please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill a
second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't think you'll have a problem unless you're
charging or you're working on one of the institutions I provided. I
mentioned there's not a charge of practicing locksmith. And, I was also
asked, how does this effect Walmart, institutions like that. Already
exempted in the law, let me make sure I get it correct here, already
exempted in the law are retail merchants who provide keys or keying or
keep those tools and equipment on their premises.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stone, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Speaker. He just answered my
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion to debate the motion.

admit this is the first time I've given a detailed reading to the bill
was here, and I do think there may be some potential issues. But instead
of taking up limited time for debate, it's something we can look at in
Rules. And with respect from me, the bill be sent to the Rules

Senator 182 the ?? query. The house community receptive for senator 182
of built entirely and actively eliminate appeals for infractions to
modify appeals through the superior court in probation of revocation in
which the defendant has waved a hearing and to amend the law pertaining
to recent ?? reversal of sentence on a pallet review and to reclassify
certain misdemeanor as infractions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Stan please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ?? amendment after
Representative Glazier explains the bill if I could be delayed on my
recognition.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Glazier please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.[SPEAKER CHANGES] The
general has recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you
mister speaker members this is a bill from senator Brunstead that the
judiciary comity worked on quite a bit. I will explain a couple of
provisions. There is two caviots. There is an amendment coming by
Representative Stan which I agree to and senator Brunstead does as well
but there is also an error we have caught in the bill that we are going
to need to object to a third reading on to fix and I will explain that
as we go through it. There are really three portions  of the bill and i
will sort of do it in reverse. Sections 4,5,and 6 of the bill are really
ones that reduce some misdemeanors to infractions and these are all sort
of cost saving measures agreed to through the conference of district
attorneys and some others. Section 3 of the bill has also been worked on
and has been agreed to by all parties and this does some limitation on
re sentencing  after someone is successful on a pallet review. And where
they have a plea of guilty that is vacated and so it is very limited and
only applies in that circumstance and trial lawyers are signed off on
that part as well. On section 2 of the bill which is where the error is
there is a limitation and again for time for someone who is in a
district court on a district court criminal judgement has their
probation revoked and in that case  right now they have the opportunity
to appeal to NOVO the superior court. this says no we are going to end
that and your appeal is directly to the court of appeal. well the error
is we had confined it in judiciary b and what is not contained in this
draft to only those cases where the probation are in district court were
waved the hearing so he says i am admitting it i am waving my hearing he
shouldn't have two more shots at it this gives him his right to appeal
to the court of appeals if there is a real error but doesn't take up
superior court time on that change has to be made on third reading. The
first section of the bill eliminates appeals directly for infractions
but still keeps the right of someone who is found guilty or responsible
of an infraction. If they claim any constitutional issues they still
have the right to file a petition for discretionary view of those issues
before the court of appeal or the supreme court. Hopefully this will
save some court time and will allow judicial resources to be focused on
all of the appeals from really serious criminal cases that we are not
having the resources to do. E really don't know of no opposition and i
think that everyone has pretty well signed off on most of this bill.
Representative Stan does have an amendment and i apologize for not
catching the correction which we will do on third reading on section 2.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stan was recognized to to import that
an amendment ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stan moves to amend the
bill on pay on line six by inserting after the comma the following
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Jones is recognized to debate the amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you mister speaker the theme of this bill is
speed up the procedures in the trial courts not to have a rush the
justice but to not have duplicative appeals and unnecessary time. We
want to get to the truth of the verdict sooner rather than later. And it
over laps the bill 217 that this house passed about three months ago.
And basically some of the provisions from that are here well this
amendment removes something we did two years ago that gummed up the
works a little bit for those of you that said we outta repeal laws
before we pass them hey we are going to repeal two pages of statue all
at one foul swoop and i think i actually voted for these two pages maybe
even wrote them so it is even good to repeal your own bills but what
they are they deal with motions for approtriate relief and what we did a
couple years ago it have such a tight proceedure for superior court
judges that it actually takes up more time for them to have to put them
on a case than reading them with their feet up in their leisure with
their feet up to get them done a lot quicker just at the request of the
conference of the DA's just ends that micromanaging</p>

[Speaker Change]
Energy of what Superior Court Judges do. I urge you to pass the
amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Further discussion, further debate on the amendment.  If not, the
request before the House is passage of the amendment set forth by
Representative STTT for the House Committee Substitute of Senate Bill
one eight two. All in favor vote aye. All those opposed vote no. The
clerk will now open the vote. The clerk [???] machine will now record
the vote. One hundred and eleven having voted affirmative. None in the
negative. The amendment passes. Now we’re back on the Bill. Further
discussion, further debate.  Representative Michaux, please state your
purpose.
[Speaker Change]
I’d like to ask Representative Galzier a question.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Glazier, does the gentlemen yield?
[Speaker Change]
Certainly.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman yields.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Glazier, you and I were both in JB when this Bill and
parts of it, sort of.
[Speaker Change]
Mix and match.
[Speaker Change]
Mix and match, yeah maybe. Let me ask you this, does the carry the
portion in there where a person whose probation is revoked in district
court has to appeal directly to the Court of Appeals?
[Speaker Change]
If, I’ll answer it this way. That’s the change that has to change
tomorrow on third reading. It does say that but, what I think agreement
was in committee was if the probationer waives his revocation hearing
the appeal would directly to the Court of Appeals. If there’s not a
waiver then it remains as is. And what we didn’t capture in the language
was the waiver of revocation proceeding.
[Speaker Change]
Follow up.
[Speaker Change]
The gentlemen yield? Gentlemen yields.
[Speaker Change]
So I want to be, I want to be clear, that that the amendment that we are
passing now simply allows that person who waives the hearing on his
probation revocation in District Court, he cannot, his appeal is
directed to the Court of Appeals and not to Superior Court. Is that
correct?
[Speaker Change]
That’s correct. Yes, if a title is actually correct the provision is
not. It’s sort of the reverse. Title’s fine, the provision is not fine
and so what it should say is that if in fact you waive your probation
revocation hearing in District Court, your appeal would then lie in the
Court of Appeals. You don’t have the right to any de novo proceeding.
If, if you don’t waive then it hadn’t changed and I think that’s what we
didn’t capture and I talked to Representative Stam and he agrees with
that.
[Speaker Change]
Okay, thank you.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Ramsey, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Change]
Question for Representative Glazier.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Glazier, does the gentlemen yield?
[Speaker Change]
I do.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman yields.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Glazier, and perhaps I am slow like I am most days, but
wouldn’t that not encourage the defendants to try these probation
revocation cases in District Court because then they would get a second
bite at the apple? And so this would actually encourage more hearings at
the District Court level which we already have a tremendous volume of
cases as it stands now.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Ramsey, I don’t think so because the current law provides
that if you’re charged and sentenced in District Court your probation
violation will be in District Court. And then you would, if you lost it,
you could do de novo to Superior and then if you lost it you could go to
the Court of Appeals. What this would say is, you still start out in
District Court if you’re a District Court violation but if you’ve waived
your hearing and you said, you know I’m guilty, you don’t get to say,
well I really don’t like the fact you would then revoke my probation so
I’m going to delay time and I’m going to appeal to Superior Court and
that will give me a couple of months until that is scheduled and then go
to the Court of Appeals. This would say, no if you waive it, you have
given up your right to a second shot and you only get your appeal to the
Court of Appeals which you would have accordingly now. So it really
eliminates one step for the person who has waived their rights. They
don’t get to reconsider their waiver.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Michaux, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Change]
To speak on the Bill.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the Bill as amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Yes. Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House, the Bill is now
probably in the best shape it’s going to be in. There was a concern that
the District Court not being a court of record is going to be difficult
to go from there to the Court of Appeals in a situation where probation
was revoked without a waiver. With the waiver in there, with that in
there and with the matter remaining the same as it is now, the Bill
seems to be in fairly decent shape. I suggest you support it.
[Speaker Change]
Further discussion, further debate. If not, the request before the House
is the passage of the House Committee Substitute, the Senate Bill one
eighty two as it’s amended on its second reading. All in favor vote aye.
All…</p>
