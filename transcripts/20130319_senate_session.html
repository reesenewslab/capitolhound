Senate will come to order, the Sergeant-at-Arms will close the doors,
members will go to their seats, members and guests in the gallery will
please silence all electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer is
Rabbi Lucy Dinner of Temple Beth Or in Raleigh. Rabbi Dinner is the
guest of Senator Stein, all members and guests in the gallery will
please stand.
Senators, it is an honor to be here before you in this gallery. It is an
honor to be here before you in the service that you provide for our
great state, and so I ask that God's presence be in service, God's
presence be here with you, that we pray that we are not here for our own
riches, but the riches that are ours lead us to generosity in sharing
with others, that we are not here for our own beauty, but the fairness
that is ours lead us in modesty in the way that we face our community,
that we are not here for our own power, but the power that is ours shall
lead us to influence others with greatness, with wisdom, lest arrogance
take over our nature. We pray that we are here for honor, so that our
honor shall come to us with understanding, lest esteem cause us to
forget those who need a helping hand. We pray that we understand our
talent, lest we forget that our gifts are only leant to us, that our
gifts are a mark that we should not lose our humility, knowing full well
that our talent comes only from another. We pray that we stay far from
trouble, so that we shall understand that the troubles that others face
shall be put before us as a challenge, so that we shall stand with them
in their time of need, and not stand in blame. We pray in times of
sorrow, that when grief enters our life, we will have the fortitude to
bear the trials that are ahead with patience, to be a comfort to those
who are around us. We pray, most of all, that we are here with modesty,
wisdom, understanding, humility, and courage; with fortitude, with the
leadership that the position demands, that in Your presence, o Great
Wonder and Creator, we will bring goodness to this land, to this place,
to this great state, Amen.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick, you have the floor to explain the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's just a simple amendment that would exempt those
developments where they have private utilities with 100 and fewer users.
My understanding is Senator Meredith does not have any objections.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, I did
talk to Senator McKissick after our committee meeting and he had brought
up that some of the smaller utility and water companies may not have the
ability to do this within the time frames that were allowed. So we
thought that we'd exempt them. We talked to the surveyors and the
engineers and they said that they did not have any trouble with this. I
called both associations. I would ask for your support of this amendment
and the bill. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 168, Clarify Education Reporting
Requirements.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We have various reporting requirements that we put on
the State Board of Education and DPI. These are some of the few reports
that either lay on the shelf or go nowhere. Senator Tucker has been
looking into that as part of our regulatory reform. And this an example
of two or three of these reports that we're not eliminating from the
requirement of having these reports. They just don't have to come back
and report to us until such time that we would ask for that
specifically. Otherwise, we don't have to have these made annually from
the State board. That's all that does, clarifies the law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate? Senator Davis, for what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask Senator Tillman a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, question is we put a lot of work in at least
looking at drop out prevention and so forth. In part of Section, part 2
here, what the bill does is in a case that a student is getting behind
in terms of they're at risk of academic failure, as well as they're
getting behind in terms of graduation and promotion, it triggers then
the ability for a personal education plan to be put in place working
with teachers, parents and so forth. My question would be if we are
interested in tracking academic success, why would we strike here a
provision that allows DPI to at least help us understand if this is
working or not?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I am not sure, at least my computer don't show that so
let me go to the hard copy here.</p>

<p id="20:00">
Talking about trying to understand data centered around helping students
to be academically successful. This is, in my opinion, an ability for us
to connect the dots. I mean, at some point there was a decision made to
actually pass the legislation, to allow the personal educational plan.
So we authorized a plan, the PP, but we're saying today, well, oh, we
don't even care about the data. Well, if we don't care about the data,
why do we authorize the plan? We did it because the personal education
plans allow in this situation for parents to sit down with teachers to
chart the course for students who are already academically behind. This
is an opportunity for us, on a broad based effort to even see, one: does
the process work? Okay? I would want to know, I would be interested in
how many students in the state are on PPs because they're academically
behind, and now, let's give it some time and see the progress, how many
come off PPs. I mean, there's some valuable data here that we can
capture and actually benefit, and this is simply a simple oversight, or
a report that would go to the oversight committee. So I would ask for us
to, if it's possible, I still have just a few questions, I'm really,
would ask of Senator Tupper, who's originating this, we realize he's not
available, otherwise I would ask for us to either, you know, I would
hate to defeat the whole bill, or ask for that, I just have concern
about this provision, and I would ask if we couldn't do something, maybe
object to the third reading today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman? You're authorized...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President? Senator you had every opportunity to put forth...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you had every opportunity to do an amendment and I don't see
one, and if you believe that DPI can help a kid in the classroom, then
you've got more faith than I do. I have asked you to vote for this bill
or if you like Senator Davis' motion, vote against it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President? Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask the bill drafter a question, please, I mean the bill's sponsor,
Senator Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm not sure what version you have of this, I have that piece of paper,
but on the last page, part six, it says repeal child nutrition state
standards, end report. Are you repealing all nutrition state standards?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, ma'am, we're not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just the report?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just the report. We have Federal standards, state standards, we're still
obligated to go by just the report, it's not needed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I simply, since Senator Tucker isn't here, certainly, and Senator
Tillman, I do agree on some of the educational issues, and I know that
Senator Tucker's the sponsor, but I do want to say that maybe we should
object to third reading, I will, but that little piece in there, Senator
Tillman, if you look at what even the Excellent Schools Act does, it
does include the personal education plan, identifying those children,
okay, early on, if they have problems, there's a plan to address those
problems, whoever's included in that plan, counsellors, teachers,
parents, et cetera. Then there are reporting requirements, and all the
way through there has to be some accountability at the end. Now,
certainly, maybe DPI hasn't done it, or whoever, but at the end of the
day, we need to know if what the folk have done to help those children
to achieve, to improve, there are deficiencies in those areas, is really
working, if they've done due dilligence in making sure that those kids,
by grade three, are going to be able to read. And those reports are
going to come to us. So I would say that at least the part in there that
says that there has to be a report to DPI in terms of</p>

<p id="25:00">
…what has happened with those kids in terms of that personal education
plan, what has taken place, what the outcomes have been so that there is
some accountability to make sure they’ve done what they should and then
that we finally get the information that we’re assured that before a
child is retained or whatever that process is going to be, some summer
school, et cetera, that those LEAs are doing their responsibility.
So, I’m not objecting to the overall reporting pieces because some of
the reports are unnecessary. But this one, those that help to ensure
that the folk who take care of the education of our children are
accountable are very critical. This is one because it says,
“Kindergarten all the way through,” and we’re looking at making sure
that every child by grade three is reading. Those children are
proficient.
So, for those kids who come to school not ready, there has to be a
personal education plan in place, there have to be certain student
tutorials, additional resources. People have to make sure they’re doing
what they should to make sure those kids in every grade are moving up.
So, I would say that Senator Tillman, and I know that you and I agree on
some of the reports are a little bit unnecessary, but this one is
critical. This one is critical and we need to make sure there is
accountability here. So, I’d like to object to third reading. You may
vote for the bill, or whatever, but I certainly will object to third
reading.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?

Senator Tillman yield to a question please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, in this bill, I know it’s not your bill but it’s
Senator Tucker’s bill, are we getting rid of PEPs?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We don’t need PEPs down here. PEPs can be done in the schools and
they’re required on certain students, handicapped learning students,
they are required for a certain number, and schools now have gone to
doing a PEP on every student. Folks, if you can’t cure it at the school
level, we surely don’t need to be tampering with it down here. I don’t
see it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, when you do that PEP in the classroom does the teacher
not send it to the principal and then the principal send it to the
superintendent, the superintendent to the local school board who
measures the effect of these PEPs and how these children are performing?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes they do, and that’s the only place of accountability we have is at
the local school and the school district level, yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.

Senator Pate, for what purpose do you rise?

To inquire if the gentleman from Randolph would yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, would you say that with this bill the DPI is not doing
anything with these reports that are coming into them as important as
the information might be so therefore, if they’re not going to do
anything with the reports we should not compel them to even receive the
report? Is that the genesis of this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Pate, they are doing nothing with these. If we need them then we
can once again call them back up and call them before the Education
Oversight Committee. They don’t do anything with them at all and we have
not done anything with them in my memory, no sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A question of Senator Tillman, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Happy to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Related to this, Senator Tillman, in the Excellent Schools Act that
these children, and they are certainly included in there, where will the
reports come from, where will the data come from in terms of if children
are performing and are proficient, and able to read by grade three and
meet all the other requirements? Where will that data come from?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson, I don’t know where it will end up. But I know the
people that will make a decision on whether you can read or not by
fourth grade will be made at the school level between teacher and parent
and that’s always the way it’s been. I do not know that we need that
information. I’m not sure what the fine points of that bill call for,
but I don’t see a need for that to come down here either. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Senator Tillman a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

research, how would they get this data? Would they have to go to each
school?
