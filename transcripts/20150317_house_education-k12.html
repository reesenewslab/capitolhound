  Be suspended
[Speaker Changes] for the proper terminology Mr Chairman , of the staff.
 But they would be treated exactly like they are currently treated, if a
child would have entered the Kindergarten today and not have a proper
health assessment done .
[Speaker Changes] so follow up is they would be sent home because of non
compliance
[Speaker Changes] That would be my understanding
[Speaker Changes] So that&#39;s a suspension
[Speaker Changes] I have to go to staff for the exact terminology on
that
[Speaker Changes] Mr Chair, I think some of them DPI may be able to
answer that question. I am not sure it would be a suspension because
it&#39;s not related to any disciplinary action . But DPI may be able to
weigh in further on the technicalities.
[Speaker Changes] would  please identify yourself and respond to the
questions
[Speaker Changes] Yes, Tracy Weeks from the North Carolina Department of
Public instructions. If a student has not yet entered school they
haven&#39;t been counted present for the first time until the first day
they actually  walk through the door. if they are not going to be
allowed to enter the school until they have this health assessment, they
are not considered present until the school hasn&#39;t even started. so
they are not suspended. They just don&#39;t exist in the school until
they walk in for the first time.
[Speaker Changes] Okay so follow up
[Speaker Changes] Follow up
[Speaker Changes] So I guess I had some confusion then. So they
wouldn&#39;t even  be able to enter school and be enrolled at all and
they could have and they would not be able to start school until this
assessment is completed or are they given a 30 day grace period, where
they can still enter school
[Speaker Changes] Mr Chairman, I yield to the lady from the DPI again
for clarification
[Speaker Changes] you may answer the  direct question. Representative
Cotham, would you please, Wait a minute. You want to take that question.
[Speaker Changes] Sure they could come for 30 days
[Speaker Changes] First identify yourself again for the record
[Speaker Changes] Track Weeks, Department of public instructions. They
could come for the first 30 days, if they so chose
[Speaker Changes] So Follow ups . So then what you have just said if
they are already a student and  they are enrolled then , yes, they would
be suspended for lack of compliance, college behavior issue or not but
that. And that&#39;s how we do in Charlotte.
[Speaker Changes] I don&#39;t know that it would be labeled as an
suspension. They would be absent from school.
[Speaker Changes] They would not be suspended. Do we know as a fact
whether it would be a suspension or  a suspension.
[Speaker Changes] It would be an Absence
[Speaker Changes] IT would be an absence. I see. So would not be
considered as a  in school suspension. It would be considered an
absence.
[Speaker Changes] Okay I m sorry Mr Chairman
[Speaker Changes] No that&#39;s all right.
[Speaker Changes] A small clarification. I can speak from personal
experience with immunization record when students were not in compliance
and they had 20 days to get their records their shots, they were
suspended until they were in compliance . so it was a suspension and yes
it was out of school and yes it counted against them. And that&#39;s
where my thought process is going
[Speaker Changes] Do we have, can we have that clarified, now , Ms Weeks
[Speaker Changes] I would have to go back and look
[Speaker Changes] Okay I was looking at something else
[Speaker Changes] May I make some comments
[Speaker Changes] Can anyone staff anyone in the audience clarify this
particular point so that we know whether this would be a suspension or
an absence whether the child can come to school can&#39;t come to
school, there seems to be a more than a little bit of confusion on this
issue, at least for me. Please [?? inaudible]
[Speaker Changes] So the statute is not clarify or speak to whether
suspension or it in terms of a disciplinary proceeding. Representative
Cotham is speaking to what the policy is or the  practice is in
Charlotte, Mecklenburg . Clarifications would really be needed from
individual board to see how they interpret it.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Cotham
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr Chairman. And I realize the bill really
has good intentions and Emailed you my comments and concerns last week .
Representative I just really worry as just a  real world and how this is
really going to work and more importantly when you are working with
students of poverty.

  For me especially. And, I hate for a child to miss school and be even
further behind because their parents, maybe can&#39;t get an appointment
at the health department. Because, in our county there&#39;s over a 60
day wait. That&#39;s were my process is and where I&#39;m very
concerned. And, how are parents going to be notified? I see that the
immunization record is to be attached with it but that&#39;s still a
separate process for a principle. It doesn&#39;t seem to of been
streamlined and I&#39;m just very concerned about, especially our very,
very poor schools and access. Even though its good intentions and we
want for them to be healthy of course, but I do have some concerns.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Torbett, I think you wanted to respond.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I have spoken, or via email with Representative
Cotham, and similar things came up in health, where this issue seems to
be drug into the weeds so we had to pretty much lasso it and bring it
back onto the clear path. There is reason for concern, but I can tell
you the law currently provides that you can enter kindergarten today
without this. So, you either have concern for the kids that are not
being able to come into kindergarten, all the kids, or just the ones
from grade one through. What this is is an equal concern for the people
that are currently in the schools that may enter at whatever level, that
has not had a physical done that could prove to be an issue or a concern
for the parents and the ones that are currently in school that did have
the physical done. So, the concern is on both sides and I&#39;d like to
see this bill moved very much. Thank you representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Chairman, may I follow up on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t hear you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Chairman, may I follow up to his comments?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Please.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes, the concern is for children who are already there and also
extremely true when you&#39;re working schools of high poverty, its a
very transient population and on the first day of school you could have
100 students who are walking through your school for the first time
ever. They are new to North Carolina, they are here to register, and
then I guess I&#39;m just concerned what happens to them so that they
are registered and then have a 30 day grace period to do this. We all
want them to be successful. Will they be able to get this assessment
done by a doctor, or by a health county, or a nurse practitioner? Its a
pretty big assessment, its not just the typical physical.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Representative Hurley, you are next on my list. I have Meyer,
Luebke, Glazier, and Pittman.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Hurley.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I was concerned about the ??, but she answered
my question on that. And, I do think its important that they do have
this and I think it could save lives. I think they have five years,
unless they are new to North Carolina, and certainly they&#39;ll know to
check to see what they need to come into the schools before then. At the
appropriate time I&#39;d like to do the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Meyer.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Representative Torbett or possibly the staff,
is there any exception available to students who are immigrants to the
United States and hoping to enroll upon immediate arrival into North
Carolina?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Torbett.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
May I continue, Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
??.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
May I add a comment? So, I&#39;ve worked with a large number of
immigrant students who arrive here and one of the first things the
families are recommended to do is enroll their child in school to help
them ?? to their new living environment. For a new immigrant, especially
refugees that don&#39;t speak English getting into the health care
system, finding out how to be insured, even having the English language
ability to participate in a physical those are all extremely daunting
tasks. I&#39;m afraid that this type of environment would make it very
difficult for those kids to be able to have a good ?? to school impart
because of the 30 day limit and impart just because of the fear this
would place on these families of how do I navigate this part of our
health care system in such a short period of time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Chairman, can I respond briefly?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Briefly.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I think here again its a balance of concerns, if your concern is
weighted on the people who do go about the process and are in the school
on any given day.

  I suppose people coming in to school, and I just refer you back to that
currently is law that you have to have this done before when you enter
Kindergarten. So it&#39;s out there and all we&#39;re doing is taking
that same philosophy and same degree of concern and spreading it over
the rest of the school years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is a question for staff. Since is an
adjustment to existing statute can you tell me how children who&#39;s
parents don&#39;t know how to navigate the healthcare system, regardless
of their background, how are they doing it now? How are they getting
their health assessment? Who provides the health assessment? I&#39;m
really asking about children who&#39;s parents might not be able to
afford the situation What&#39;s happening right now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe that many families are going to the local health department.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Glazier. Did you have a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You say you believe they&#39;re going to the health department. Ho would
they know to go to the health department? Would the school say, is it
policy that this school say, &quot;You need to go to the health
department and get this assessment?&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. I believe this is usually information given out at
kindergarten orientation. If a child is not in compliance the principal
has to notify the parent as well. So they would have 30 days from when
the principal notifies the parent.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And if I may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One more.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do we have any idea how many children are data collected and how many
children are not able to attend school for a while because this process
has not been included. I understand completely, Representative Torbett,
your intent but having children not in school because their parents have
not been able to navigate this process to get to the Department of
Public Health, go through the situation, the children are being hurt.
They&#39;re not in school because of the way it is in existing law or in
your proposed alteration to the law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Torbett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I don&#39;t have an exact number for Representative Luebke
but what I can tell you is that people that may be entering the system,
one thing, they want to get their child out in the system. It&#39;s very
important, it&#39;s very crucial to them and so they will go to pretty
much whatever means necessary to meet the rules that are currently in
place as well as these in the future to get their child in school.
It&#39;s that critical to them. So I don&#39;t see that as a, I see that
as, once again, as just perhaps trying to drag a very simple issue a
little bit further out into the weeds.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I also, I understand, as well, that the principals are required to file
a report with HHS on this activity.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, that&#39;s just my question. Do we have any idea statewide how
many children are not able to attend school because their guard parents
or guardians have not worked on this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
DHHS would have that information.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And they will provide that to...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will ask them to provide it,  yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can we do that? Ask them provide it and get it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Before the bill hits the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Say again?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Before the bill hits the floor, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We&#39;ll ask and tell them we need it promptly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier, you&#39;re next on the list.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I agree completely that the bill is needed and a
good bill for purposes of the policy behind it but I do have some
logistics concerns that I think the questions have raised, particularly
Representative Cotham&#39;s, because I don&#39;t think the, although
we&#39;re trying, I don&#39;t think the language of the initial issued
on the entering Kindergarten transfers as easily, logistically, to all
the other grades. I think it gets back to the suspension issue. So we
don&#39;t have the, even if you&#39;re in Kindergarten and you don&#39;t
have it in the 30 days under the old law, we didn&#39;t really suspend
kindergartners and even if we did, the consequences were not severe. But
an eighth-grader, a third-grader in Read to Achieve, a Twelfth-Grader,
those are real severe consequences. So I wonder if you would be willing,
whether it&#39;s in committee or before it hits the floor for our floor
amendment, be willing to add in that this shall not be deemed a
suspension so that we don&#39;t trigger absences would end their year or
they don&#39;t get to make up their work or all those things that the
suspension would trigger as a way to protect the student while their
trying to get their parents to get them to public health. Would that be
something you&#39;d be willing to consider?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would entertain that because we shouldn&#39;t put a mark, unjust mark
or blemish on a child when actually a child had no control of that. So I
think that&#39;d be a

Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would you prefer we try to come up with language here, Mr. Chair or bill
sponsor, or would you want us to move the bill but agree to have that
language on the floor? Whatever works.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;d be overcome with joy if we address that on the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I&#39;m not sure about the overcome with joy part but that&#39;s
fine with me. Representative Pittman, you&#39;re next.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I apologize, this is something I&#39;ve
overlooked in the bill. I just didn&#39;t see it. I was wondering if a
child moves in from another state during the middle of the school year,
they&#39;ve already had an assessment in another state, does that take
care of it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Farmer-Butterfield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank was my question, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cotham for our last question, I hope.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Would you be willing to consider 30 days to 60
or 90 days time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, ma&#39;am, 30 is adequate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up. Do you know the average wait time for a public county health
department to get this type of assessment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do not know that current time period.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Seeing no further questions, Representative Hurley, you&#39;re
recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, may I make one comment before?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just looked, and this was in Health before here and it was reported
favorable out of Health. So I don&#39;t know what they did but anyway, I
want to make a favorable report for the proposed committee substitute,
unfavorable to the bill and I guess to the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Everyone having heard the motion, all those in favor say aye, all those
opposed no. The aye&#39;s have it, next bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Next bill is House Bill 29, technical changes to course of study
statute, presented by Representative Johnson, Chairman Johnson.
Representative Holloway is going to handle this bill, great. And
Representative Glazier, welcome, up to the front of the class.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. This is House Bill 29. It is just intended to be a
technical cleanup of the statutes and something that-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hold on just a second, Representative Holloway. This is a PCS, so we
have to have the PCS before us. Representative Pittman moves to place
the PCS before us and it is before us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Again, this is just a technical cleanup of the
statutes. Rather than go through that myself, I&#39;m just going to, if
I may, Mr. Chair, defer to staff and let staff just run through the bill
real quickly and we&#39;ll take it from there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And we do have an amendment to the bill but we can take that after. Do
you want to take that after?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, if we can do the amendment after would be great.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Kara McCraw is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 29 primarily re-codifies a number of current statutes in
order to improve the readability of those statutes and also repeals
references to the basic education plan. The basic education plan was
something that was enacted in 1985, in the 1985 budget, by the General
Assembly and was an overall plan for public education with course of
study as well as funding. Over the years, in the past 30 years, the
General Assembly has enacted additional programs since that time and
that terminology has become somewhat outdated. So references to the
basic education plan are removed and instead standard course of study is
substituted, which is what was used prior to the basic education plan.
And the remainder of the bill, although there is a lot of redlining, is
re-codifying sections that already exist in current law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have an amendment. Representative Glazier. Does everyone have a copy
of the amendment? I think it was distributed.

  <p id="25:00">
  Okay, I do. Please, go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair, members. The one area of concern that the
department had and that we looked at, because we&#39;ve eliminated on
BEP, which doesn&#39;t exist anymore, there&#39;s also a sentence that
was, or two sentences in there that made it clear it was the intent of
the General Assembly to fund, and it used different words than the sound
basic education because it was referring to the BEP. This substitutes
this sentence and it&#39;s really the only change in language but
it&#39;s an attempt to get back at making sure that we didn&#39;t remove
the function. So this amendment says it&#39;s the intent of the General
Assembly that the focus of state educational funding be to ensure that
each student receives a sound basic education, which is now the
constitutional standard. So it&#39;s really substituting the language
but it&#39;s doing it in a way to make it still what it was but not
using the term BEP, since we don&#39;t have the BEP, and I know of no
opposition to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any questions or discussion about the amendment? Seeing none, all those
in favor say aye, those opposed no, the amendment passes and is added to
the bill. We have one more amendment, Representative Stam, H29-ATC8
Version 3.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, may I just real quick-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Holloway.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, and Representative Stam, we looked at your amendment, the
bill sponsors up here, we realize that it is very simple. We did want to
just talk with you to have a quick discussion. Would you be amenable if
we let it move out of the committee and let us talk and then maybe run
this on the floor again? It&#39;s just, the chairs up here amongst us
just wanted to talk and rather than have that conversation here in
committee, take 20 minutes or so. Would you be willing to do that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I like to be amenable but I&#39;m really, doing committee work on the
floor is not real productive of the floor time. Let me explain it and
then you tell me what you want.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
These two amendments could easily be separated, and this is not the
first time I&#39;ve read this bill but when you read a long bill
sometimes things don&#39;t pop out at you and what&#39;s there looks
like, anyway, it begins &quot;The General Assembly believes that,&quot;
and the first amendment strikes the &quot;The General Assembly believes
that.&quot; Well, the way that the General Assembly believes things is
by putting it in a law. It would be sort of like a certain person I know
who telephones me and says &quot;this is what I&#39;m going to tell
you,&quot; then he/she tells me what she&#39;s going to tell me and then
she tells me what she&#39;s going to tell me. So I just believe in
striking unnecessary language. We wouldn&#39;t put &quot;all children
can learn&quot; if we didn&#39;t believe it. So that&#39;s a very simple
thing. Then the second thing, on page seven where it talks about
teaching about individual rights as described in the Bill of Rights.
Everybody knows, claims to believe in state&#39;s rights and that kind
of thing, well the reason that North Carolina refused to ratify the
constitution was because of a lack of Bill of Rights and the reason was
North Carolina had had a declaration of rights for a decade before that.
So why would we not be teaching our own Declaration of Rights along with
the Bill of Rights? You may consider this technical, I just consider it
perfecting or fixing something which has been left out before.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, thank you, and Representative Stam, and certainly I don&#39;t
have a problem with either part of your amendment and have certainly no
problem with the Bill of Rights, but amongst some of the chairs, they
were concerned that the second part your amendment, feared that that was
somewhat of a policy or substantive than we were trying to make this
just a statutory cleanup and, like I said, all the bill sponsors just
are not in agreement with that. That&#39;s why I was wanting to just see
if we could talk about that a little further.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I make a proposal?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I propose that we go ahead and take the first part of the amendment on
page one, line 12, and I&#39;ll save the other one for the floor if that
would be agreeable to the sponsors.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We just wanted to talk with you about it and just have a discussion,
like I said, and all the sponsors just aren&#39;t in agreement on that
one. So, rather than divide us, we&#39;d all rather continue to hold
hands.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, is that proposal OK? That we do the first part now and
save the second for discussion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It&#39;s OK. So we&#39;re striking everything from line five down, am I
correct?

  from line five down, so we&#39;re taking lines one through three, one
through four?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, lines one through four of the amendment, correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Is that understood and agreeable to the, it is? Any further
discussion? All those in favor say aye, those opposed no, the aye&#39;s
have it and H29-ATC-8 which will end up being version 4, I assume, is
added to the bill. Further discussion, further debate on the bill?
Seeing none, is there, I had reason to believe that someone in the
audience wanted to speak to the bill? Seeing no hands, all those in
favor say aye, those opposed no, whoops, we need a correct motion,
sorry. I got ahead of myself. Who&#39;s surprised? So, Representative
Fisher.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I move that we give the proposed committee substitute for
House Bill 29 a favorable report with the amendment rolled in to a new
proposed committee substitute and give an unfavorable report as to the
original PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excellent.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would have screwed that up in a flash. Any further discussion, all
those in favor say aye, those opposed no, and thank you very much. House
Bill 138, whoops.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just want to say thanks to the committee. We&#39;re trying very hard
to keep it just a technical bill. We do not want it content. We
appreciate your considerations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 138, Arts Education Requirement. Representative Carney,
Johnson, Elmore, and Glazier. Representative Carney, welcome. Turn on
your mic, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair and members of the committee. I&#39;m not sure
I&#39;ll get this quite right but Mr Chair-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I move that we have the PCS before us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We need a motion for a PCS before us, made by Representative Langdon.
All those in favor say aye, the aye&#39;s have it and the PCS is now
before us for House Bill 138.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;ll start over, thank you Mr. Chairman and members of the committee
and I&#39;m not sure if I have the quote exactly right but, Mr.
Chairman, you like to quote Winston Churchill a lot, so he said that you
should never, never, ever quit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, that&#39;s not exactly, that&#39;s close enough for me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, that&#39;s what I mean, you know the quote, so you can correct me
but this group you see before you, we have not quit, we&#39;re back
again. Last year the House passed, in long session we passed House Bill
127 with 98-19 and we sent it to the Senate and for whatever reason it
did not come before their committee over there. In discussion in moving
this ahead again this year, we feel confident that this is the year for
us to begin. I know all of you support the arts but having it required
ensures that every student in the state has that opportunity for the
arts exposure. You all know, and I have booklets over there that
I&#39;ll have available for you if you want them from the National Arts
Association, and the proof is there. We have done the research in this
state. In 2010, we had appointed a Comprehensive Arts Education
Commission and the recommendations that came back, it was an amazing
work between the private sector, the executive branch, the public
sector. It was a cross sector collaboration and out of that they
recommended several things and one which we have enacted into law and
that&#39;s in your bill backup that has our universities teaching our
students how to integrate the arts into the core curriculum. So our bill
states that we will require one arts education requirement between the
grades of six and twelve, one, one course that they have to take. The
beauty of our bill this year says that the state board, with all the
tools and the research that have been provided,

  <p id="35:00">
  that they will develop and create this requirement, and I&#39;m sure
that they will work closely with all of the stakeholders that have
already been involved through this whole process of the comprehensive
three-legged stool of the arts education. There&#39;s already been a
movement to work with our principals in supporting the arts integration
component. I just ask today if you will consider letting this move
forward and letting the state board develop this requirement and report
back on its implementation by December, 2018, and I don&#39;t know if my
colleagues would like to make comments or not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, we-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh, we have an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We do have an amendment, so Representative Stam, you&#39;re recognized
to send forth amendment number H138-ATW-4 version 2.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, and I will, there&#39;s a slight change that, staff, Representative
McGraw is working on but I can explain it with this but then by the time
we come to vote it doesn&#39;t change the meaning of it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We are in the process of having it redrafted and then you&#39;re going
to go ahead and explain it with the redraft?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was, first of all, I have a little expertise on this. I may be the
only member who has actually earned my living as a government-funded
artist. I wasn&#39;t very good at it but it did-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It didn&#39;t earn much of a living, I bet.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But it did save my life and provide an income for a couple years. I was
concerned that if somebody transferred into the system after, say, ninth
grade that it might throw them off from being able to graduate at the
same time. It would be too complicated to say exactly how that should
happen, so this just asks the state board to include an exemption and
phrases it the right way but the amendment will say that instead, during
the prescribed semester, it will say-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You&#39;re going to read it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
From graduating with the graduation cohort to which the student was
assigned when transferring. If that&#39;s still OK with the sponsors,
I&#39;ll offer that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay with the sponsors, the amendment is presented. Any discussion on
the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The sponsors do not have a problem with this amendment from
Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The amendment is therefore before us, all those in favor say aye, those
opposed no, the aye&#39;s have it. The bill is now before us as amended.
Representative Fisher.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I would just like to submit a motion at the
appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Great. Any further questions, comments, discussion. Representative Iler.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I&#39;m somewhat familiar with this but mostly
I&#39;m in contact with the folks back home, you might say, in the
school system and staffing may be a problem in some counties, possibly
not in ours but in some counties they didn&#39;t have an arts program,
even grade six through twelve. So, is there any idea that appropriations
are going to be required to fulfill this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Carney? Representative Johnson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for that question, Representative Iler, but we asked that
question, the bill is the same as it was last year and we asked that
question of DPI last year. They said with starting at the sixth grade
that would not be necessary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further comments or questions? Representative Pittman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yeah, and I still object to it the same as I
did last year, making a requirement of this does not enhance opportunity
if the opportunity is already there, an elective can be taken. I do not
believe that it is right for us to add this as a requirement because
then you&#39;re going to have students such as I was, I didn&#39;t take
art classes in high school, and I&#39;ve done just fine without it. If
you got no interest and no propensity toward that, I don&#39;t see it to
be fair to require you to have to take that course. It&#39;s available,
nothing with that, I think the arts are great, I wish I had some more
talent than I do but I just don&#39;t have it and was not interested in
taking it, didn&#39;t have to, and I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t have to. I
don&#39;t think we should be forcing this on students who have no
interest in it

  and so I object and will have to be voting no on this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Elmore is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just want to comment, true, as an art teacher, but also I&#39;m not a
professional athlete today but I had to take physical education in high
school. I think you have to think about that and statistics show that
our economy is ever-changing and right now there&#39;s currently almost
two million people in the workforce just in creative industries and the
Federal Government is saying there could be 1.3 million more jobs added
in those type fields. So I think, when you look for a well-rounded
student and the change in economy that we see, this is a good move even
though we&#39;re not all professional athletes here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further comments or questions? Representative Glazier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is actually getting back to Representative Iler&#39;s comment
because Cumberland had the exact experience, we actually imposed this
for a number of years and just to say that because it was done on grade
six through twelve, we were able to, they were able to, I was gone by
that time, but they were able to accomplish it without any additional
cost. It just takes some flexible scheduling and some work and with a
system our size I think your generally able to do it and even small
systems, I think can accommodate this based on that experience. So I
think there&#39;s some districts that have done this and found that,
although they feared there were going to be costs, they turned out to
not be there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cotham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just a question out of curiosity about access
to the arts education, we know from other committees that we, Sampson
County for example, went all year without a math teacher because they
could not find someone to teach algebra. Do we know that we will have
enough teachers to teach these courses or to make this selection
available or is that where virtual schools will come into play?
What&#39;s the plan for that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, thank you Representative Cotham. I want to tell you a
little bit in answering your question, and again, I go back to we&#39;re
instructing the state board to design the requirement in what they see
the best way to implement it. It could be a high school elective that
they would, that&#39;s already being offered, that could be used. It
could be a middle school arts ed course that&#39;s already being taught,
that they could use that towards the requirement. It could be an art
appreciation course taken online that some students have already taken
between sixth and twelfth grade. It could be through, and this is what
the state board will have and we&#39;re giving them that great
flexibility to work with, but it could be, there are a lot of students
that in the summer, they take specified courses in the arts. They take,
they&#39;ll be at a four week music camp, so the state board has what I
like about our rewrite this year is that it does have an
all-encompassing effect and also, and the piece about the arts
integration, they will be taking a look at that, too. So I think
we&#39;ve opened the door here for them to craft a requirement that is
not a burden on anyone and when you look at what the statistics across
the state, and we do have Christy Ebert here with DPI, but she knows all
of these. This year, 185.14% all across the state are enrolled in one or
more arts education courses in grades six through twelve. The difference
in that, the problem with that number is that a lot of these students
that are captured in that percentage are taking several, multiple arts
courses. But when you break it down to certain counties, and one that I
do want to brag on is Onslow County, and I don&#39;t want to go on and
on. I am passionate about this-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I can see.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I want to just let you know Onslow County has been doing, they&#39;ve
gone above and beyond in this county that is a low wealth county. That
they have reached to the arts to help lift these students up. Thank you
and we ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for your comments. The PCS is ready to be voted on,
Representative Fisher.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As a former member of that Arts and Education
Commission I&#39;ve been cheering you all on from the sidelines here and
I appreciate your passion. This is something I&#39;m very passionate
about as well and in that light I would like to give the
