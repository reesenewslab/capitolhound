In the summer months, the church I attend explores other faiths and
various expressions of the Christian faith. The version of the Lord's
prayer that I offer today is a translation by the Maori tribe in New
Zealand. Let us pray. Eternal spirit, Earth-maker, pain-bearer,
life-giver, source of all that is and that shall be. Father and mother
of us all, loving God and whom is Heaven, the hallowing of Your name
echoes through the universe. The way of Your justice be followed by the
peoples of the world, Your heavenly will be done by all created beings.
Your commonwealth of peace and freedom sustain our hope and come on
Earth, with the bread we need for today feed us, in the hurts we absorb
from one another, forgive us. In times of temptation and testing
strengthen us, from trials too great to endure spare us. From the grip
of all that is evil free us. For You reign in the glory of the power
that is love, now and forever, amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Amen.
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to

Speaker Changes:Thank you Mr. speaker, yes i would move that we add
senate bill 786 to today's calender,
Speaker Changes:further discussion further debate for what purpose this
gentlemen from ?? representative ??,
Speaker Changes:to speak on the motion,
Speaker Changes:The gentlemen is recognized to debate the motion,
Speaker Changes: Speaking on the member's of the house we have the
senate bill 786 the wracking bill is one of the important bills  we had
in the last couple of years we certainly have moved through the
extraordinary speed of the senate  and also is before us also a very
speedy fashion the bill those many many things that will not go into the
many issues and ways that you all know from the correspondence brings
out a lot of people in favor of the bill many many people's concerned
about contamination's of our environment particularly n the areas off
course where the wracking is likely to happen it is simply inappropriate
for us to move forward on a bill that was heard this morning in 11 a.m
and prior to that in the finance committee and prior to that it was
heard on 6 o clock in public utilities committee there was no comment in
the public in public utilities committee and in finance committee there
was only time for one 3 minute comment on the bill it was inappropriate
and indefensible for us and bodies to move forward on the bill so
quickly when the publicizes have absolutely no opportunity even though
the bill is gonna be on today's calender we should oppose this motion in
order to get the public at least overnight to contact all of us and let
us know that how they the public feel us towards the bill please ?? no
on the motion,
Speaker Changes: representative ?? please state your purpose,
Speaker Changes:to speak on the debate motion,
Speaker Changes:the gentlemen is recognized to debate the motion ,
Speaker Changes:i m glad ?? that this is one important bill to three
years and in fact this is been on going for four years since i have been
in general assembly so ?? think us a little bit  ?? what idea that this
general public utilities on Tuesday when i got here is i what i want
every office in occupying somebody in Tuesday morning to let them know
we were gonna have a public utilities meeting and this bill gonna be on
calender that was about to  fall ten  hours before we actually have the
committee i did that because i want the folks to know,i want the folks
to know that what we talk about and i want to be transparent ,didn't get
any response that we have hour and hour of meeting in public utilities
it could have gone three in three hours from the members we had a good
and finance today and this is a good bill we have added this bill and we
need you o move forward so i would need you to vote yes,
Speaker Changes: representative Larry D. Hall please state your purpose,
Speaker Changes: to speak on the motion,
Speaker Changes: The general is recognized to debate the motion,
Speaker Changes: Thank you Mr.speaker and members of house i rise t
oppose the motion i think even then representative ?? said that many of
you may have notice from him who are the committee that this bill was
coming up we representative citizens of Carolina from all over the state
affected by so is not enough to say that we gave yo ten hours notice the
question is  that how much time did the constituents use ?? to represent
how the hear about improvised on information on this bill and their
response their lives are gonna  affected i don't think there is any
wracking and to go on enroll so that's the no question that you have
notice for you individually the question is did you have time to notice
your constituents that who are gonna be affective by this did they have
to be response so you can represent them as you promise and swore to do
i think that's the issue you afford and we appreciate the fact that
there be noticed their embers but we have a job to do and that is to
make sure.</p>

Represent our constituency and that is to give them this notice and let
them be heard so I’d ask that you oppose the motion. Let’s give it one
more day. Let’s go through the regular procedure and give us a chance to
get input from our constituents. Thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jackson, please state your purpose
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For question of Chairman Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hager, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Chairman Hager, thank you for yielding. Were there any
amendments passed in public utilities?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker. As the chairman of finance,
Representative Howard. If I could ask her a question? She would yield
for question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard yields
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Chairman Howard, were there any amendments passed this
morning in finance?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No sir, there were no amendments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Mr. Speaker, if I could speak on the
motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You know a lot of times that ?? refer to the
affordable care act, I hear my friends on the other side of the aisle
say if people voted for bill that hadn’t even read and I’d ask you how
many of you have actually read the bill as currently amended, the whole
entire bill, I personally hadn’t had a chance to do that and I generally
don’t do it until after the bill goes through committee because you
can’t ever remember or did you read the original version, the one that
was amended three times, the next one? And so what I do is that I read
the bill the night before and I think that’s a reasonable approach.
Chairman Howard last year, we had a big tax bill and everybody voted for
it except me and she came up to me asked me after session, why did you
vote against my bill. I said it was 50 pages long and I hadn’t had a
chance to read it and anybody who in the law school knows that that’s a
reasonable response and I think we all noted that it’s a reasonable
thought. I have heard nobody say why we are in a rush. I’d ask you to
give us time to actually read the bill, ask tough questions and then if
you want to vote on it, tomorrow we can do that. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and Gentlemen, the Chair would just mention as
a point of information that this is a 2 day bill. So the question of
this motion also determines whether this is a Wednesday and Thursday
vote or a Thursday and Friday vote. Representative Glazier, please state
your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, to briefly speak to the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I have just two
points and then some ways to reiteration but I think they’re important.
Representative Jackson made the point about the time in reading the bill
but I make a second time point and that is that when this calendar goes
out, it’s not only noticed to us and it is noticed to the public. That’s
the purpose of the calendar. And we defeat that purpose by putting on
the floor, bills that have no exigency. This hardly has one and so no
one makes that claim. And so, while it’s important that notice was given
and I agree with Representative Hager. The notice was given to the
members even though very quickly but I appreciate what he did. And I
appreciate Representative Hall’s point that it created difficulties and
all of us giving notice to our constituencies through newsletters and
otherwise. But that’s the purpose of the calendar. It’s for all those
people we can’t reach by our newsletters or by our calls. It’s for the
press to pick up and to notify the public. It’s for people to see it
online so that they know that this bill that’s gonna affect their lives
is on the calendar and we at least have given them an opportunity should
they choose to exercise it. To write or to call in. We defeat that
purpose here today on a most controversial bill and I think unfairly do
that. And I’m going to vote against the motion because I think it’s
unnecessary what we do today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, members. This is a simple motion. This is
not a suspension of the rules. The rules fully anticipate that a
committee may report a bill out and have it heard the same day. This is
not something out of the ordinary at all. It is something that has
happened regularly both when the democrats were in charge, the
republicans were in charge. There’s nothing absolutely nefarious about
it then and nothing nefarious about it now. It’s simply a mechanism to
move this bill. This bill would then be eligible to be debated and
amended, whatever the body wishes to do today. And guess what, it’s back
again tomorrow for the third reading. Where the process goes all over
again. The only purpose that would be achieved by delaying the bill
being heard today is that we would be here on Friday. So, members I
would advise the body to support the motion and as far as debating the
merits of the bill, to save that for when the bill is actually before us
and I would remind folks that this is only the motion to have the bill
heard.</p>

Representative Larry Hall, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, I speak a second time on the
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill. The
motion is second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the
house, again the question is getting information and notice through our
constituents and so again we do understand we could waste a day today on
this bill. Amendments aren’t ready for those people who weren't aware of
what exactly came out in the final form of this bill and so to say we’re
having an actual debate on this bill today when you haven't read it.
People back home haven't heard about the provisions of it and we haven't
had time to read it and then make any amendment or be prepared for
discussion to explain why we even voted for. Does a disservice not just
to integrity of this institution but a disservice to your constituency
and so, again rather than go through a farce of saying we debated this
bill today or we worked on this bill today when we don't even know
what’s in it. Why not go ahead and give public some confidence that what
we did, whether they agree with it or not, was done appropriately and
transparently. So, again I’d ask you to think about that as you vote no
on this motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Carney, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak to the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I rise to ask you to think of
this in a different way. We can put this on the calendar today have it
read in we have and start with the debate tomorrow and then if you
really believe in this bill and you really support it, which might have
a few questions left; the people that you need to ask these questions
have them think about, are your constituents back home. So we could, the
bill is being read in, let's take it through the regular process, read
it tomorrow, debate it tomorrow on the floor. Take the weekend and stand
up for this bill if you support it, talk to your constituents back home
over the weekend, I have been here 12 years and we have done that over
and over and over on many bills. It doesn’t mean that we have to come
back on Friday unless that’s; our speaker who has every right to
determine that we come back on Friday. But this bill does not have to be
heard today. Of all the bills that we have before us, this is a bill
that is extremely long impacting on the state. We’ve never been down
this road before. I, for one wanna make sure that of the 120 rules that
are in place, don’t talk about the bill if you’ve read it or not. How
many of you have read all those rules? You are going to ?? the bill as
it is right now, only have this chance to vote on this bill. Unless and
then this is brought forth and then it gets come back to us again next
year. I’m asking you to take the time; I don’t know why there’s a rush.
I ?? you down unless there are people lined up outside of this building
waiting to get a permit and then start drilling the minute we pass this.
So I don’t know what the rush is. It’s extremely important, is it a good
move for us to take? I’m not sure. But you make up your mind, you wanna
rush it through or would you like to have the weekend for your
constituents to respond to all of that and then come back and make a
better informed decision based on what our citizens want. Thank You
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on the motion. If
not, the question before the house is the motion for ?? the house that
house committee substitute to send the bill 786 to today’s calendar. All
in favor, vote Aye. All oppose, vote No. The clerk will open the vote.
The clerk will let the machine record the vote. 66 having voted in
affirmative, 50 in the negative, the motion passes. Senate bill 786 will

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I made my comments yesterday regarding this
matter and would briefly restate to the body that again we appreciate
the fact that Mr. Allen has offered him for service and he appears to
have the qualifications to be a representative from the business
community but the position that he is being nominated for on the board
is one to be an employees advocate and representative and his
qualifications do not appear and his statements do not appear to support
that and qualify him for that and so, again, I'd ask that you vote
against this resolution.

Please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  To debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members, we had a good vote on
this resolution yesterday and wanted to simply again affirm the support
the rules committee has had for Mr. Alan and this appointment. I don’t
know what’s happened and what the motivations are for my friends on the
other side, I don’t understand it. Mr. Alan has been a plaintiff’s
attorney all these years, he perfectly fits the bill of this
appointment. As best I can tell from piecing together, I don’t know, my
good friend from Durham simply makes the statements but hasn’t said what
the statement is that has him so concerned, has not done so on the floor
nor did so in the committee. Mr. Alan was at our committee, was there,
there were no questions propounded to Mr. Alan at all, not one from
anyone and we were there as long as we needed to be. Yet we have these
kinds of arguments being made that just appear to be political in nature
for some reason. The only thing that I’ve been able to piece together is
a civitas questionnaire like a lot of us filled out when Mr. Alan was
running for state house where he asked if he defended the state’s right
to work law and he said he did. I said the same thing, I submit a lot of
folks sitting in this chamber on both sides of the aisles said that. I
agree with Mr. Alan, I’m glad he has that position, but at the end of
the day as an industrial commissioner or a commissioner of the
industrial commission that’s not within their purview. It really doesn’t
matter what his position is on that. His position on tax reform may be a
good solid conservative position but as a member of the industrial
commission it does not matter. The question is, does Mr. Alan have the
qualifications, the education, and the experience to be a member of the
industrial committee? To act impartially in a quasi-judicial role when
individual cases come before that body? The industrial committee is not
out there setting policy, the industrial commission hears an appeal. A
person gets hurt on the job, they go before an industrial commissioner
whose like a trial judge and they disagree with that opinion and they
appeal that to the industrial commission which sits in panels and
decides was the evidence fairly heard, was the worker treated fairly,
was the employer fairly treated, and at the end of that process make a
decision to determine what compensation if any that employee should
receive. These notions about people’s political views don’t matter and I
was sitting here trying to remember, and I’ll say I agree with Mr.
Alan’s political views, but it’s honestly for this purpose irrelevant,
but I was trying to think about when the other folks were in charge and
when the governor sent nominations down, I can’t think of a time when
any of us when we were in the minority started trying to get into ‘well
where does this person stand on tax reform or the minimum wage?’ We
didn’t do that, we simply looked at the individual’s merits and we made
a decision so I hope that this is not a foretelling of what I think is a
hyper-partisan politicization that does not need to happen in this short
session and I would those folks in these kinds of appointments that we
should continue these kinds of matters in the bipartisan tradition that
has been the tradition of this house for many years and not go down the
road that my good friend from Durham is going down. I just don’t see the
reason or the wisdom in doing so. Members I would ask for your yes vote
again today.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Hall please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution a
second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Thank you Mr. Speaker. I just want to clarify, many of
you sat in the chamber yesterday and had the governor’s nominee which
you participated in a unanimous vote for and I believe this is the third
governor’s nominee and I think the first two had unanimous votes so I
don’t think we’ve entered a hyper-partisan environment unless voting
unanimously two thirds of the time would constitute hyper-partisan.
Second of all, the position that he has been nominated for is one that’s
supposed to be an employee’s advocate. The governor has three of those
positions that he has the nominations for, we have the duty to examine
them and to approve them or not approve them and so, again, I would ask
that you oppose this nomination not on the basis of something unknown
but on the basis of what his statements have been in the past in
opposition to employee’s rights..</p>

...and his oppositions to employees' benefits, both sick leave, paid
sick leave, and other opportunities for fair treatment at work and in
the workplace. So again, this is not a personal attack. Again, anyone
who believes as Mr. Moore believes, that's their right, there're three
positions reserved on the commission for people who specifically avow
and express those views. There are three spots on the commission
reserved for that. And the chairman. But we don't want a commission that
is, at it's very outset, viewed by the public to be a commission where
they cannot get justice or a fair hearing. And so, to have it stacked
where you have four, or five representatives of business and only two at
best who would represent employees - I don't think that's the message
you want to send to employers who would come into this state, or
employees who would come into this state and work. So I would ask you
again to oppose the resolution.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and Gentlemen, this bill comes before us
actually at the recommendation of a representative from the Department
of Defense. Here in North Carolina, we have frequently talked about us
being a military friendly state, we know that we are actually one of the
largest states in the nation for military personnel. With military
personnel come military dependents and those include the kids. Now
having been in the military, and many of you as well know what it's like
to have to move around the world. Sometimes you have to leave your
family and we know what that does - can do to the kids. They need a
little extra, maybe, attention just - we need to be aware of where these
kids are and how they're doing and how we can respond to their needs.
Not only because of the frequent moves, and the pressure on them being
in the military but sometimes the result of the pressure that comes from
a deployed parents. It's kinda tough for some of these kids. Sometimes,
you know, you just get moved with the PCS and that's a Permanent Change
of Station not a Proposed Committee Substitute, and then you get
deployed, sent either temporary duty or maybe not so temporary and kids
get confused at &quot;What's happening here with my parents, or my
brother, or my uncle?&quot; if they happen to live in the same
household, that they're very close. We want to make sure that these kids
are being looked after, cared for, and supported appropriately without
being intruded upon. And that's the purpose of this bill, Ladies and
Gentlemen I ask for your support.
(pause)
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Direct the State Board to come up with a statewide way to collect all
this data so that we can a statewide look. Both in districts like in
Onslow and Cumberland with a heavy military presence, but also districts
like Wake County where my daughter's teacher may not know that she's a
military child, also. So that's one of the best things that it will do
but one other important thing that it will also do will-

Thank you very much. I rise today to inform this House that we have lost
a wonderful person in the citizenship of Dr. Maya Angelou, who was the
world’s most famous woman in ??. She moved to Winston-Salem, North
Carolina as the R.J.R. Professor of American Studies at Wake Forest
University and resided there until this day, when she passed away there.
I would like to say that we should send our prayers and our thoughts to
her personal family but also to the world, because the world was indeed
her family. I happened to meet Dr. Angelou before she actually moved to
Winston-Salem.</p>

because she was a very dear friend of a very dear friend of mine, who
was the spouse of the Provost at Wake Forest University, Dr. Edwin
Wilson. From that moment until this ,I always considered Dr. Angelou as
a very dear friend because during the time that I met her, she reminded
me that all of God's people in the world are more alike than they are
unalike. I just commend you to remember her family in your prayers and
all the people in the world who admired and adored this woman, who

Senate Bill 786 is a culmination of about a year's worth of work.
Representative Stone, Representative Boles, folks from this area,
myself, senators that worked on this bill since we left the legislature
last session. It is an inclusive bill that gets us a step closer,
certainly doesn't put us into energy exploration, energy research right
away. We still have the year to wait. We still have about a year and a
half before the first drill could go in the ground. But it is a
culmination of getting us there. It helps define some of the issues that
we've all been talking about. What I would like to do is go over what I
would consider the pertinent parts of the bill and then see what
questions you guys have. I'm sure there will be many. So, Mr. Speaker I
will do a brief explanation of the bill. It is a simple bill as you guys
know. Not complex. I think Representative Hall could understand that. So
we'll go through just a few of the sections real quick and see what
questions we all have and try to get this bill passed out today. Section
1. If you guys have a copy it does extend the rule completion from the
Mining Commission from October to January 1st of 2015. We were doing
that to allow more time for some of these more complex rules that we're
running into. To really look and let some of the studies come to
fruition before we head the rules to the General Assembly. Section 2
really modifies the APA process and I'm trying to read my chicken
scratch here. Basically, it does about three things. It really does away
with the 25 day requirement of rules being adopted before they come to
us. And part of that reason that you'll see some of these APA exemptions
and modifications are if the rules process goes longer. If we don't get
them on January 1st, if we get them on March 1st or April 1st. The APA
process would not allow us to take some of these issues up this session.
That's what you'll see in Section 2. Section 3 was originally the
section that said a date certain from the Senate of July 1st of 2015. We
modified that in public utilities to guarantee that the rules would be
in place before the moratorium is lifted. If you guys remember in Senate
Bill 76 , if you go back and read your Senate 76 Bill from last session
or 2012 it says basically that the rules will be in place and the
positive action by the General Assembly would include lifting the
moratorium. And that's basically what the Stone amendment in the public
utilities did. Section 4, 5 and 6 deal with reinstating, before the 9
year commission was established there was just a Mining Commission. And
what this does is it bifurcates those two commissions once again,
because the mining folks wanted their commission back, and establishes
the enrollment of that and establishes the Oil and Gas Commission. And I
haven't got kicked by staff yet so I must be doing pretty good on this.
Section 7 just removes some antiquated language that we need to do to
move forward with the issues. Section 8 is really about the trade secret
issue. You guys have probably have heard a lot about that. It directs
the MEC and Dener to keep these trade secrets and let me make sure
everybody understands the difference between trade secrets and
chemicals.</p>

If you've got a beverage can sitting on your desk or a water bottle, you
can flip around and you can see what's in that beverage can, that Coke,
or that Pepsi, or whatever you have on on your list. But what you can't
see is what percentage of each one of those things are, how they're
mixed, what they're mixed with and all the details. A lot of these
fluids are proprietary issues on how they're mixed. Not really what's in
them but the sizes of each commodity and how they're mixed in there. Now
if any of you guys have worked in a utility area, in an area that has
equipment, you'll notice that there is what's called MSDS sheets,
Material Safety Data Sheets which are mandated by health and safety
folks. So when you arrive on that site, let's say a first responder
arrives on that site, that commercial site, industrial site. If there's
an issue they can go straight to the safety area right today and get the
MSDS sheet. Those MSDS sheets say here are the chemicals that are on
site. Here's how they react to humans. Here's how they react to fire.
Here's how they react to explosives. It's no different on a mining site.
You'll have the same issues. The MSDS sheets will be there, which says
here are the chemicals we have on site. But what won't be there are the
issues that say here's how you mix them to make the fluid we're we're
working with. But they will be available in emergency issues to all
first responders. Because remember now, the trade secrets are handled by
?? and MEC and I think the state geologist will be the receptor of
those. Nine and ten are not as important as eleven. Eleven reduces the
application to drill from 3000 dollars per drill on the pad to 3000
dollars for the first application on the same pad and then 15 dollars
for every application on that same well pad after that. The reason being
is the first drill is the one that's the most expensive. That's the one
we have to do a lot of due diligence on. That's the one that has to have
all the permitting on.  The second ones are just multiples of the first
one. So there's less, if there is a fee for service, that's what it's
for. Moving on, twelve is not as important as we'd like to discuss here.
13 is talks about the presumptive liability of contamination of water of
a well for drilling. And basically, originally it was 5000 feet and
tended at, and Representative Stone and everybody worked on this
originally it was 5000 feet diameter. It was easier if we moved it to a
radius. It made more sense. We moved it to a half a mile radius because
everybody can understand a half a mile radius. ?? requires five well
tests and the first one of course is a pre-test. And 6 12 18 and 24
months after the production of the well starts. It does require a third
party well testing. And the well testing are going to be on public. So
the public can see them. Also in 13 it talks about the require the bonds
of no less than a million dollars per well driller. And moving on to 14.
14 is the prohibit all in natural gas development. 17 through 19 deals
with the severance tax. We can get into the exact numbers and questions
you have on those. There's reasons we did that. Most of the states, take
Arkansas and Texas, have what they call initial rates, incentive rates,
to get folks to come in and drill. Now since they are mature in their
gas play, they have default rates, I believe Miss Finell told me that.
Default rates. We will get to those default rates. But it'll take us a
few years. We're still in the initial high production, high cost well
state right now. 20 28 are basically studies you will see out there. 29
is energy policy council can use legal support from ?? And 30
establishes what's called a GGE, a gallon gas equivalent for compressed
natural gas and diesel gallon equivalent for liquified natural gas. And
Mr. Speaker I would be happy to answer questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stone, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate

we have been working a long time with the Senate on this 786. For most
of you, you may think it's been the last year but it's really been the
last 3 and a half years to get to this point on arriving to where we've
came. This bill may say Senate bill but it's got a lot of House work in
it. It's as much as the House as it is the Senate's. We cover some very
important sections in this bill to make drilling better in North
Carolina. You go back and you look at what we did for injection wells.
That was a very controversial issue last year. We took injection wells
out for North Carolina. You go look at the bad actors</p>

laws and how we made it better, how we made it fit for North Carolina.
That was a great addition. The biggest one of all is look at the trade
secrets. It's 180 degrees opposite of what we had last year that was
recommended to the House. So those were important issues when it comes
to land, protecting our land, our water, and our air. Look at the
testing for water, we went from three times to five times since this
came to the House. We've done a lot of great things to make sure the
quality of life is better in these areas while pushing forward to make
sure we drill safe in North Carolina. It has been a lot of hard work. A
lot of long nights and a lot of late nights of trying to get this bill
together. We have 120 rules coming online here shortly and it's been an
honor to work on this bill. We understand, or I understand, Lee County's
in the heart of this so I very much appreciate, I've had the preview of
being at the table the whole time. I can tell you that if I had to do it
over again there's a lot of things I'd do different because I've been
frustrated since 2012 on how to get input at the table. I open my office
doors up to talk to the people that supported drilling in North Carolina
and the people that opposed it. I even encouraged the people that came
in my office that opposed this bill to not give me recommendations on
how to shut it down but how to make a better bill and I told them that
time and time and time again. Give me a better bill. And I can tell you
that if any other state was wanting to move forward with natural gas
exploration I would encourage you to put a four year limit and lift the
moratorium 'cause then you would get input on how to make a better bill
versus how to shut down the process time and time again in North
Carolina. North Carolina is ready to be energy independent. This bill
gets us one step closer to the process. The rules that we'll have will
be ongoing and changing for a decade. Technology will get better, things
will change in the economy and that will help us drive even a better
bill. So I can tell you today that I stand up here proudly to support
this bill and I ask you to support it and if you have any questions. But
it's been a long, long rode but we still have a ways to go. I thank you.

Mr. Speaker, members of the House, all three of these amendments have
something in common. They were brought to me by the Representative of
the Administrative Offices of the Courts as what I would call technical
amendments. I've cleared them with people that appear to know something
about the bill and just so I'll be very brief on each explanation.
Apparently in writing, page 18, line 22-40 there was a section where
they copied over a section from a 1987 Administrative Procedure Act when
we had amended it in 2000 so this just puts the 2000 version back in to
be more consistent with our normal administrative procedure. I move the
adoption of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager, please state your purpose.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative Stam did bring this to me and I

The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, members of the House, apparently there was some ambiguity
in the underlying bill whether it was a Class 1 or Class 3 misdemeanor,

Mr. Speaker, members of the House, the Business Court is not actually a

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This amendment simply brings some alignment to this bill. I ask you to
look at section 13 on page 15, lines 44-49, and you’ll see that, when a
well is initially drilled, there’s a requirement of a bond of $1,000,000
as Representative Hager stated when he described the bill. My amendment
goes to the section where a well would be closed and there’s vague
language there currently, that simply says that sufficient funds are
available, and I believe that having that type of vague language would
end up with drillers and landowners in lawsuits because of the vague
language. If we had alignment between the drilling of the well and the
closure of the well it would work well for everyone involved, so I ask
for your support for the amendment.

Representative Hager, please state your purpose.

What we would love to do is allow the mining and energy commission there
in the crux of this issue now. We’ve spoken with them on this issue and
they’re going to have their language come forth ??? so we’ll be able to
see that language instead of locking them down right now. They may
require now, we don’t know that yet so I would advise everybody to vote
no on this amendment and let’s let the mining and energy commission do
what they need to do in this area.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Representative Larry Hall please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Thank you Mr. Speaker. I would just ask that people
vote in favor of the amendment. Again, this is an opportunity for us to
put a baseline in this bill, provide the same protection that’s supposed
to be there when the well is open. There’s no reason that protection
should not be maintained. Certainly it’ll ensure that our environment is
taken care of for cleanup cost or whatever else that may result, and
again if we’re going to force this on the citizens they should have some
assurance that they will be protected in the case of a closure of one of
these facilities.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Glazier please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I rise to support the amendment
for three reasons. One, as far as I can tell the US government
accountability office notes the cost of reclamation on a single well
site can range from $500,000 and above, that’s the first thing. Second,
which means that the bond that’s being set by Representative Meyer is
well within range of what the cost may be. Second the MEC has had plenty
of time to put the number in, but chose for some reason not whereas they
did put the previous number. Third, I think that it’s fine to let the
rules work their way out, but if we’re going to be proceeding as we are
today to vote we ought to know at least that the reclamation and costs
are secure. That ought to be a baseline piece of information that’s
available for the whole scheme and not something that’s going to be
decided at the last minute, and for that reason since we’re pushing this
bill forward as opposed to waiting for the full rules to come out then I
think that we ought to have a number in there which can be changed by
future legislation before the permitting occurs if that’s a wrong
number, but to put in what the MEC or what’s in there now is just next
to useless. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Representative Hager please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Debate the amendment a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment a
second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Thank you Mr. Speaker. What we have is basically
trying to bring the folks, the mining energy and commission the reason
it’s vague now is because they haven’t developed that rule yet. There’s
also a bond of reclamation that goes to the surface owner that they’re
working on now that says how they will be closing and reclaiming the
land so all these issues are there. So if we let the mining and energy
commission do their job and look at the bond of reclamation, look at
this bond we’re talking about now, and determine what’s the right levels
for both of them. I doubt anybody on this floor has the depth of
knowledge that folks sitting on that mining and energy commission does.
We’ve been to three or four states, we don’t have that depth of
knowledge myself, Representative Stone, Representative Boles. Those
folks do, they know what it costs to close a well, they know what it
costs to reclaim the land, they’re the ones that should be deciding this
issue, not folks on this floor that really don’t know the specifics
about how to do energy exploration, what it costs to do it, how to
reclaim the land, how to put it back, how to fix any issues that we
have. I ask you guys to vote no on this and let the folks who have been
working for over two years now do their job.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Representative Meyer please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  To debate the amendment a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment a
second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Thank you Mr. Speaker. I would just point out that as
written the bill does not allow the general assembly to review the rules
again after being passed by the mining commission and when land owners
get into disputes with drilling companies over the cost of cleanup after
a well is closed, they won’t complain about the mining commission,
they’ll complain about the general assembly. I would like to have
assurance that we’ve done our best to protect both parties. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Ladies and gentlemen, just as a point of clarification
that is the last amendment we’ll be taken up today. Representative
Collins has indicated that that may be taken up tomorrow and by
clarification, when I said five o’clock, I meant only for amendments
today. You have until tomorrow, we’re trying to work out the session
time for tomorrow, once we determine that if it’s eleven the Chair would
like to have all amendments into the Clerk’s office before 10:30, thirty
minutes before session we’ll determine whether that’s 11AM or not before
we finish the debate and the vote today. Now we’re back on the bill as
amended. Representative Harrison please state your purpose.</p>

to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentleman of the House. I appreciate
the improvements that Representative Stone highlighted in the bill. I
think it's important that we added that that act or provision and the
disclosure was toned down a bit and the maintaining the line on the
injecting fracking waste water fluid into our aquifers would be a
dangerous path for us to go down but I think a lot about this bill is
very troubling. I don't really understand why we're rushing to
fast-track this fracking bill. The House had always taken a very
deliberative approach. I always appreciated the leadership of
Representative Stone and Samuelson and Gillespie, when he was here, that
the, we were gonna study it and make sure we had it right. We promised
the public that we were gonna have the rules in place before the House
lifted the moratorium but that's not what this bill does. It's too
rushed and no state's gotten it right. I've heard a lot of references to
Arkansas. I guarantee you that's one state we do not want to emulate in
the regulation of fracking. The price is extremely low, it's so low that
there's a lot of pressure to export it which is manifested in the study
provision to perhaps set up a terminal and quarter at county to export
the liquefied natural gas. The geology of North Carolina is such that
it's gonna make it difficult to extract the gas. It's located close to
our drinking water aquifers. In fact, it intersects Jordan Lake at one
point. That's extremely troubling to me. The bill did not get the review
of a substantive environmental committee in the House or the Senate and
as we noted earlier it never got noticed to the public during the House
debate. When I asked the sponsors why we were rushing this bill it was
said it was because NorthConn needs the jobs and America needs the
energy. Well the commerce department study that came out two years ago
said that this would produce 387 jobs in North Carolina and as far as
the energy it, we've been told it's a 12 day supply when it gets into
the national market. So that's a lot of risk for not a lot of reward.
There have been public health and environmental issues all over the
country. I've got a stack of studies I've been looking at because I know
that comes up every year that it's not been, there's been no documented
contamination but there has been. A Texas court ruled, issued the first
ruling last month that issued damages for a family who's health was
significantly compromised by exposure to fracking contaminants,
primarily through the air. We have studies of methane contamination, we
have a decline in dairy production in Pennsylvania. We have birth
defects in rural Colorado. We've got EPA studies in Pennsylvania and
Wyoming demonstrating contamination. The Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection indicates hundreds of cases of contamination.
We've got social calls associated with fracking that have been
documented. So there are a lot of problems associated with fracking and
I just think that we should slow it down here. And also if we're really
talking about jobs we'd be talking about clean energy jobs. We have
nearly 20,000 clean energy jobs in North Carolina. These are gonna go to
North Carolinians unlike the fracking jobs that will go to fracking
folks who come in from out of state and we're #3 in solar installed last
year. We're #2 in energy, clean energy manufacturing in the country and
we're #1 in wind potential offshore, off the North Carolina coast. These
are good, clean jobs that can't be outsourced. For every dollar we
invest in clean energy we create three and half times more jobs than
that invested in fossil fuels. Now, I'll just highlight quickly some of
the problems with the bill. I think the fact that we're lifting the
moratorium after promising the public that we weren't going to is a big
problem. That violates a promise. We're amending the EPA to limit the
General Assembly's future on the ability to oversee these roles. It
doesn't deal with the forced pulling issue which is gonna be a real
problem for private property rights. It' criminalizes disclosure of the
toxic chemicals. Now, while I hear different stories about it the way I
understand it trade secrets could include just one individual chemical
so you may be exposed to a toxin and you may not be able to know what
toxin that is. It cuts the presumptive liability for contamination in
half. It doesn't deal with long term contamination. Representative Meyer
tried to do that in his amendment. It doesn't protect surface areas
where the mineral rights have been sold to another property, to another
owner. There's significant industry infrastructure that are not dealt
with in this bill and that's gonna be a big problem. I've been reading
up on this, our imminent domain laws are quite weak in this area and
this could be a problem for property owners. It limits local government
control. It doesn't deal with the ?? issue. This is a huge issue in
other states. No other options of recycling, yes that will take care of
part of it but this is talking about potentially sending it to treatment
plants and we are not equipped in North Carolina to treat the toxins and
the contaminants that are contained in fracking waste water and we
certainly don't wanna be putting it in the surface water. Cities like
Pittsburgh, ?? Pennsylvania, others around the country have had</p>

Provide bottled water for their citizens because of documented
contamination from fracking fluids. It doesn’t deal with air pollution
issue, this is a significant public health hazard, and this is a huge
problem. It provides a perverse tax incentive where  that gives you an
incentive to come drill now when we’re not really prepared to deal with
drilling and we’re giving away our resources at a very cheap rate. This
is a really bad and irresponsible bill. I think it’s bad for North
Carolina, I think it’s bad for it’s citizens, it’s going to be a problem
for our natural resources, I urge you to vote no. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Representative Grier Martin please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as
amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Thank you very much Mr. Speaker. Members, the lady
from Guilford has talked about just a few of the problems with this
bill, they’re numerous and if advocates or the folks involved in these
issues had the appropriate amount of time to look at it we would have no
problem in coming up with an even longer list and more detailed. If you
want to give us more time to do that, have no doubt that we will come
back to you with even more facts and figures to show you why this bill
is bad, but given the rush to do this we’re left in many cases with just
emotional arguments. So let me give you an emotional argument that’s
based in fact and it’s what the lady from Guilford talked about, the
provision of this bill that makes absolutely secret so many of the ????
that are going to be pumped and chemicals that are going to be pumped
into our drinking water. As a father, the main reason I was put on this
Earth is to protect my daughter, and you want me to vote for a bill
that’s going to pump unnamed chemicals into her drinking water and the
only recourse you give me is that after she gets sick you can release it
to a doctor? Never.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Representative Cleveland please state your purpose.
Representative Larry Hall please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  The gentleman has recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, this bill
is just not ready. We know we haven’t gotten the input from people that
would help make it be ready. We have a current environmental catastrophe
going right now regarding our power industry, our utilities industry in
the state, and it’s caused by the waste created by energy production and
now we’re entering into another phase where we’re going to have an
industry, after we’ve learned this lesson from our utility companies, to
say we’re going to create this industry without having a real plan, a
vetted plan, to deal with the waste that’s going to result from it.
Whether it’s the disclosure of the chemicals and their content or how
we’re actually going to dispose of it and police that disposition,
monitor it, and ensure it’s done properly, we don’t have it, it’s not
ready now and this bill is not ready for your approval so I’d ask that
you vote against it.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Representative Pierce please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Ask Representative Rieves a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Representative Rieves does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Representative, just to ask you a question. It appears
from all that I have observed over the last couple of years with this
bill that Lee County seems to be the area where it’s going to be
affected, your county is going to be affected quite a bit. Is that
correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  It’s actually both counties. My district will probably
be disproportionately affected.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Another question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  The gentleman yields?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  What has been the conversation in your community from
local folks? Does your county still have local control? Would the local
government have any right, responsibility? Would they be able to have
any comments on this once it gets to your community? The local
government.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Well I think that’s one of the issues that we’ve got,
well one of the many issues that we’ve got, is the fact that we don’t
have a lot of local control at this point and time as this bill is
proposed and we want to make sure we’ve got more local control, we want
to make sure we’ve got more local involvement with anything that’s going
to be coming in because that’s what these elected officials are tasked
to do.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  The gentleman yields?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Yes I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Representative I know that you’re new, we’re glad to
have you in the general assembly. Have you had any conversation with
anybody in your community about this bill? Regardless of what party,
democrats, republicans, independents, have you had any comments from
anybody in your community about this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Because of the fact that the district is composed of
two different counties, both Chatham and Lee County, I can tell you that
there is no division in Chatham county whatsoever about their position
about this bill.</p>

And they don’t wanna see a go through at this point of time and I think
and that’s my part that’s not one of the other actually had republic and
democratic commission is up to date. Now, that’s their concern we got
hundreds of emails that concern about this position I have got and I can
tell you exactly one email in favor hundreds not in favor and I think
the ___[00:21] County that you see names similar training Steve voting
public but he want the elected officials there is a concern about the
speed of the bill at this point of time without there being any kind of
rules in place with Mining and Energy Commission and you will find
people that may say that they are comfortable with the speed but I think
most of I have talked to and again all I can attribute or those that I
have spoken to would say that they are uncomfortable with the speed at
this time and we just like to have the rules in place before this bill
is proposed.

I do, I know you too a lot of this but with any contract signed and
those contracts still in place for folks who are ___[01:02] in contracts
I thank you and I talked about that.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker just comment on bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you speaker, I just wanna to share those and ask few questions
from the gentleman but I come from Scotland County a very prestigious
part of the state and there are many folks that might just think as you
know cannot be here today to speak for themselves. So, I thought it was
my job today to speak on this field and frankly I can tell you nobody
down my way is really in favor of this bill at all because we are
concerned about for places like the Lee County a very wonderful place,
ones the gas is gone then the local government stuck with the rails and
the infrastructure they put in place, the state has probably worked on
roads and improve roads to get the truck there or whatever and then the
state is stuck with Lee because eventually when all drags up there is
nothing left and the state is gonna be stuck with infrastructure they
put in place. So, I just wanna say from my standpoint that I think we
are moving little bit too quick, I wanna thank to members who have
worked on it but I just think we headed in a wrong direction with this
bill and I just thought members will take that in consideration and vote
against it, thank you Mr. Speaker.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, Ladies and gentlemen we have set here and we have
hear a lot of the arguments back &amp; forth, the local control we have
talked about, I want you to know that I think 39 states already have
this process working currently, 39 states the process has taken the best
rules from the other states and apply here in North Carolina. Lee
County, we need the jobs, North Carolina needs energy independence and
to move forward our nation needs to move forward with this. We talk
about a six day supply, the good news if you write the free markets will
work they will close up in their home. But the same thing was said in
Pennsylvania when I said they had a very conservative number and I think
it was 10 to 20 times what they came back with. We want the several
communities and we didn’t just meet with pro drillers, we sit down and
met with the people in the community that didn’t like it. We said, “What
you don’t like about it? How did it make your life inconvenient? What
can we do in North Carolina to do it right?” All of them came back to
our community and applied it even things that we thought that need to be
addressed and we turned into study committee because there were several
issues when you talk about taxation where you wonder what you are gonna
do with fall of revenue? That was a huge issue in our concern, we
thought it was little controversial, we turn into a study committee. So,
we do a lot to reach out all around all sides and find best way to make
a bill to move forward. We have to send the message because for four
years we have been debating on how we move forward with a bunch of
everyone coming to our office and saying, “No, no, no.” But never anyone
saying, “How can you do it better?”

[SPEAKER CHANGE] Sure, thank you for the question Representative Pierce
and I think that we’re always concerned. We always move looking at all
the opportunities or the mishaps that could happen, but I’ll go back.
Thirty-nine states have already looked at it and we’re looking at how to
do it better than those other states. You spoke of Pennsylvania,
remember Pennsylvania’s the only state that said let’s go do it and
we’ll figure out the years ten years from now. We’re not doing that,
we’ve been very cautious in doing it right and I also speak, when you go
back to the letters of concern that I receive over the water, the land,
and the air, and I receive tons of them. Maybe a hundred, maybe two
hundred. Lee County is sixty thousand people so two hundred don’t speak
for the majority.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Resume on the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Just going back, there has been
a lot of hard work put in this bill as we move forward, and this is not
the end. I will reference that again. There will be more language coming
in the coming years to fine tune this, to make it even better, but we
have to have a starting point to move forward and hopefully more people
will come on board with how to make this bill better. So I ask you today
to vote for this bill and support, vote for this bill and support the
jobs of North Carolina, vote for this bill and support jobs for Lee
County, and help make ??? energy independent.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Larry Hall please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Ask the gentleman a question please.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Stone the gentleman should keep in mind
that he has a minute left and an answer to the question counts against
your time. Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank you Representative Stone.
I just have a question, I heard you make a reference to the number of
jobs your county was ready for and would ask how many jobs are going to
be created in Lee County and what types of jobs are those going to be
that you so surely express will be created immediately as a result of
this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I think as we travel amongst the states to look at it
there’s two different kinds of jobs. You’ve got the direct jobs and the
indirect jobs and I don’t know if anyone ever counts the indirect jobs
but look at North Dakota, they’re having to truck people in there to
find help so I think this is going to bring a great opportunity for jobs
in Lee County and the state of North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Just a quick follow up Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman’s time has expired so if the gentleman is
seated, the gentleman may be recognized to direct a question, the
gentleman may come back up. It will not count against his time. So now,
Representative Stone does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Thank you Mr. Speaker and Representative Stone I
appreciate your answer but I was looking for an answer to the number of
jobs that would be created in Lee County. I understand Montana has their
own job force and their own resources and their own commission, but I
was saying the number of jobs, if you say direct and indirect, the
number of jobs that would be created in Lee County where this drilling
and pollution is going to take place.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Well I think that all depends on the number of wells we
drill and how big. You said six day earlier that was quoted in here and
we’ve heard estimates that may be twenty-five years, all that depends on
the number of jobs.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you. Representative Stone, speak on the bill a
second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman has recognized to debate the bill a
second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker and I think therein lies the
problem. We have this promise, some illusory promise of moving fast and
not having the public involved, not addressing health concerns and there
are jobs out there. We’ve been here before on a bill that we had last
session where Representative ?? said all these jobs were going to get
created and there would be all this economic benefit and I can report to
you the last time we did this, that zero jobs have been created. That
progress has not happened and I asked these same questions that time so
this whole speculation about jobs and how there is no number, there’s no
estimate, there’s just jobs out there in the ether somewhere and that’s
why we should proceed without fully vetting this bill so again I’d ask
you to vote against it. Let’s do the job correctly, if we’re going to
create jobs let’s make sure that’s the reason we’re doing this. Let’s
find out what they are and make sure the people are protected in the
process. Again I’d ask you to vote against this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Representative Glazier please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To see if Representative Stone would yield for one
purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Stone does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker, thank you Representative. I just
wanted to make sure I understood something. I know there was a
suggestion about six days..</p>

Representative Harrison said there’s some data to indicate that the
amount of gas that’s available, if you looked at the development of the
shale is about twelve days total for assuming a national consumption
rate. I understood you to just say that you think there’s a study out
there that suggests there could be as much as a range of twenty-five
years. Are you saying that there’s twenty-five years worth of national
consumption rate of natural gas in North Carolina and if so can you
please cite me a study that supports that?
[SPEKAER CHANGE] Representative Glazier thank you for the question. I
don’t know it’s our responsibility. I think our responsibility is to put
good rules and regulations in place and let the free markets decide if
they want to spend the money to find out what’s down there to begin
with. Then they drill a test well and decide they don’t want to drill
anymore, that’s the free markets. They’ll get that information and
decide more, but other states went through the same process we’re going
through. They estimated very conservatively only to find out that it was
a hundred times more than they originally thought, and the reason is
because government usually doesn’t spend the money to find out what
industry will find out.
[SPEKAER CHANGE] One follow up Mr. Speaker.
[SPEKAER CHANGE] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEKAER CHANGE] I yield.
[SPEKAER CHANGE] The gentleman yields.
[SPEKAER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank you Representative. I just
want to again make sure, and I understand the argument, but you asserted
a fact and because I think it’s important in the argument of what’s the
cost benefit, what’s the risk benefit that’s potential here. You made a
statement that there’s a study that would indicate up to twenty-five
years of consumption. I want to know what study that is or are you just
making that as an extrapolation in your own opinion from what happened
in other states without any study or scientific evidence?
[SPEKAER CHANGE] I don’t know that we could determine if there’s six
days nationally or twelve days nationally or thirty years until there’s
been a well drilled and more information. I don’t think we can gather
that information to make a correct quote.
[SPEKAER CHANGE] Last follow up.
[SPEKAER CHANGE] The gentleman yields.
[SPEKAER CHANGE] Thank you. Representative Stone, is there a study,
anywhere, that supports or says twenty-five years?
[SPEKAER CHANGE] I’m not aware of a study that says twelve days or
twenty years.
[SPEKAER CHANGE] Representative Hager please state your purpose.
[SPEKAER CHANGE] Speak on the bill a second time.
[SPEKAER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as
amended a second time.
[SPEKAER CHANGE] Mr. Speaker may I ask Representative Stone a question?
[SPEKAER CHANGE] Why not? Everybody else is.
[SPEKAER CHANGE] I yield.
[SPEKAER CHANGE] The gentleman yields.
[SPEKAER CHANGE] Representative Stone could you tell me who Jim Womack
is?
[SPEKAER CHANGE] Jim Womack is the chair of the Mining and Energy
Commission. He’s also a county commissioner from Lee County.
[SPEKAER CHANGE] Follow up Mr. Speaker.
[SPEKAER CHANGE] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEKAER CHANGE] I do.
[SPEKAER CHANGE] The gentleman yields.
[SPEKAER CHANGE] So would you say that he has been Lee County’s
representative in the body that actually makes the rules for what Lee
County will have to see in the future?
[SPEKAER CHANGE] I would say Jim has been at the head of that Mining and
Energy Commission along with many other individuals that are talented
and I can tell you that there’s been a lot of hard work on that
commission  that I’ve been very supportive of with many different
opposing ideas at the table.
[SPEKAER CHANGE] Speak on the bill.
[SPEKAER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEKAER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Two numbers I need to give you
guys: first one is twenty-four. Twenty-four months so far the Mining and
Energy Commission has been working around that time. They’ve worked
tirelessly, I’ve been in their meetings, Representative Stone,
Representative Boles have been in their meetings. These guys have went
through with a fine tooth comb. The next number is eight. Eight more
months they’ll continue to work on this process until we get the rules,
bringing almost three years they’ve worked at this process. Now me as a
little ADD and engineer thought we could probably do it in three or four
months so I’m glad they got in there and said listen it’s going to take
a while, we’re going to have the best rules, we’re going to protect the
public. So all these things they said we don’t have yet, you’re right we
don’t have them because we’re letting the folks that study this
determine what we need, not Representative Hall, not Representative
Glazier, not Representative Martin determine what we need. These are the
folks who have studied it for almost three years now. They’re going to
come with the best rules in the nation and we’re going to approve them
and we’re going to move forward in this process. So what we need to do
guys is vote yes on this bill, let the Mining and Energy Commission do
their job and then let’s move on and create the jobs. Thank you.
[SPEKAER CHANGE] Further discussion, further debate? If not the question
before the House is the passage the House Committee Substitute to Senate
Bill 786 as amended on its second reading. All in favor vote aye. All
opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. We have talked many times this week about the
wonderful celebration of Memorial Day Weekend last week and many
references have been made to our veterans across the state of North
Carolina and in our country. I wanted to make you aware that this
weekend the Carolina Field of Honor, which is an absolutely beautiful
new structure in Guilford County, at the border of Guilford County and
Forsyth County, and it is being paid for by citizens who care about the
150,000 veterans there are in the triad area of the state. Beautiful
obelisks there that would remind you of Washington D.C. It will be
dedicated this Saturday at 7:00 P.M. It is located in Kernersville on
East Mountain Street. The park sits right on the Forsyth and Guilford
line. You can’t miss it. There are signs there. If you could make it, it
will be something you will treasure. If you have folks that live in the
area, please make them aware of it. We would love to have a good turnout
and it’s a tribute to our veterans. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, if the House would come to order. The Chair would
like to make a note, and I hope that no members object. The Chair
actually allowed an exception for the rule that doesn’t allow placards
in the chamber because we thought these young people went to a lot of
work to come out and communicate something that I think is important to
all of us. The Chair would also, again, ladies and gentlemen up there,
it’s actually not within the rules to come into the chamber so you’ve
got a rare exception up there to have your signs. We appreciate you
advocating for teachers. We’re trying to do our best as well. Ladies and
gentlemen we are going to adjourn in memory of Maya Angelou. The Chair
would ask everybody to return to their seats and if we could possibly,
before we adjourn, have a moment of silence in memory of Maya Angelou.
Representative Moore is recognized.
