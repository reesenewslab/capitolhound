    announced in an email my office sent out today. We are not gonna
    have any House operations tomorrow. All committees are canceled.
    House session is canceled. Everything that we're seeing so far
    indicates that the weather is gonna be a little dicey up here. And I
    think the governor's issued a state of emergency, and I think the
    precipitation is already, Representative Hall, I think your area is
    already getting it right now. So it's on the way. So we just want to
    encourage all the, we can't, I believe the Senate will not be
    operating tomorrow, but that is their discretion. But I've advised
    our staff that they, on the House side, that they don't need to be
    here tomorrow. It's just not a safe thing for folks to be out on the
    roads, and it just sounds like it's gonna be pretty tough getting
    around. So the plan this week, just going forward, is that we will,
    we're gonna, we're gonna have session, I believe we decided three
    o'clock on Wednesday, and we'll be playing a lot of that by ear. The
    thought is if we, if the roads are clear and things are looking
    good, some of the committees may in fact meet Wednesday. We don't
    know that yet. I don't believe there, there are no bills that would
    actually be voted on in session on Wednesday. There's nothing that's
    coming out of a committee that would be done. But, so I would just
    encourage members to watch and see if there's any notice that goes
    out on Wednesday for committee activity. It's, it's probably
    doubtful, but it's possible. Notices and announcements? The
    gentleman from Gaston, Representative Torbett is recognized for a
    motion.
    
    [SPEAKER CHANGES]
    
    Mister speaker, I move that the House now adjourn to reconvene
    Wednesday, February 18 at 3 PM.
    
    [SPEAKER CHANGES]
    
    Representative Torbett moves, seconded by Representative Speciale
    that the House adjourn to reconvene Wednesday, February 18 at 3 PM.
    Those in favor will say aye. Opposed no. The ayes have it. The House
    stands adjourned.
