The Senate Resolution.
[speaker change]
Mr. President.
[speaker change]
Senator Apodoca for what purpose do you rise?
[speaker change]
Move the roles be suspended to the end of the resolution brought forth
to be read in its entirety and debated by the body.

State ?? Resolution 796. The joint resolution expressing gratitude and
appreciation to the men and women of the United States Armed Forces.
We're in the month of May, its National Military Appreciation month and
honors, remembers, recognizes, and appreciates all military personnel.
These men and women who have served throughout our history and all who
now serve in uniform and their families as well as those Americans who
have given their lives in defense of our freedoms, we all enjoy today.
Whereas, North Carolina is the home of six major Department of Defense
(DOD) Department of Homeland Security (DHS) installations. Coast Guard
Station Elizabeth City, Fort Bragg, Marine Corp Air Station Cherry
Point, Marine Corp Air Station New River, Marine Corp Base Camp Lejeune,
and Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, as well as the North Carolina
National Guard and other DOD, DHS activities and organizations.
And, whereas North Carolina is home to nearly 800,000 veterans and has
the third largest military force in the nation. With nearly 120,000
active duty personnel and another 12,000 members of the North Carolina
National Guard. And whereas the United States military is the second
largest sector of North Carolina's economy accounting for 10% of North
Carolina's gross state product worth $48 billion and whereas more than
540,000 individuals are either directly employed by the military or work
in jobs providing goods or services that support the military's presence
in North Carolina. And, whereas business with defense related contracts
operate in 87 of North Carolina's 100 counties contributing to an excess
of $3.4 billion in defense procurement contracts in North Carolina due
in 2012.
And, whereas the observance of events recognize in the contributions of
your armed forces is a tangible and highly effective way of sustaining
morale and improving quality of life for service members and their
families. And, whereas North Carolina prides itself as being the
nation’s most military friendly state and whereas Veterans, service
members, their families, and their communities have shouldered the heavy
burden exemplified by repeated combat performance for their nation. And,
whereas the support of the family of service member enhances the
effectiveness and capabilities of the armed forces.
And, whereas North Carolina is committed to supporting and promoting the
military within the state. And, whereas the continued long term military
presence in North Carolina is directly dependent on DOD, DHS's ability
to operate not only it's installations but also its training and other
readiness functions critical to national defense. And, whereas it is
therefore a fair amount of importance to the future of North Carolina to
maintain the best possible relationship with all branches of the United
States military and promote practices that maintain North Carolina's
prominent position as the best location for military bases and training
installations.
And, whereas to those ends, it is critical for all North Carolina, North
Carolinians, all North Carolina businesses, all sectors of North
Carolina economy, and especially all branches and agencies of North
Carolina's state and local governments, to be knowledgeable about not
only about the military's presence and contributions to our state but
also the military's special and unique requirements that are critical to
carrying out its national defense mission.
And, whereas North Carolina also seeks to promote the economic
development, growth, and expansion of other industries in the state such
as agriculture, agribusiness industry, renewable energy industry,
tourism, outdoor recreation industry, and the fisheries industry.
Whereas, North Carolina has the best interest in the preservation and
enhancement of land uses that are compatible with military activities.
Now, therefore be it resolved by the Senate, the House of
Representatives concurring, Section 1 is dealing with</p>

of the United States Armed Forces for their selfless service and pays
tribute to those who paid the ultimate sacrifice. Section 2. This
resolution is effective upon ratification.
[speaker change]
Senator Brown is recognized.
[speaker change]
Thank you Mr. President. I think the resolution actually speaks for
itself. I thank the gentlemen we have in the balcony today. Today, is an
opportunity for us to thank them. What the military presence in this
state means to the state, I think can never be overstated. It's huge for
our economy, it's huge for our workforce and, really just what these
individuals do in each of our communities, I think is huge. I know in
Oslo County, where I live, it's just a huge part of our community. The
volunteerism that comes form the military. Just the extras that they do
to provide for our community is extraordinary in my opinion. And, today
is all about them and I just hope everyone understands exactly what it
means to this state and just an opportunity for us to thank them for
being here today and all that they do. Thanks so much.
[speaker change]
Thank you Senators. Any further discussion or debate? Senator Pate for
what purpose do you rise?
[speaker change]
To speak on the resolution Mr. President.
[speaker change]
Senator Pate, you have the floor.
[speaker change]
Thank you very much. Ladies and gentleman, we should be honored to have
these men and women in our midst. Those who wear the uniform of the
armed forces of the United States. North Carolina is exceedingly lucky
and proud to be home to so many military service women and service men.
It's a delight to have you here today. You mean more to us than you'll
ever know. I was fortunate enough to serve 20 years in the military
myself and there's several other veterans in this body and the body
across the way. These are years that we will never forget. The
camaraderie, the dangers, all of the proud feelings that we had when we
had on our uniforms. You're looking at someone who cannot get his own
anymore but it's very honorable to be in your presence and we thank you
for being here today.
[speaker change]
Thank you Senator. Senator Soucek, for what purpose do you rise?
[speaker change]
To speak on the resolution.
[speaker change]
Senator Soucek, you have the floor.
[speaker change]
Thank you Mr. President. Ladies and gentleman, I don't think we could
have a resolution that could in any way justify what all of you mean to
this state, to this community, to this country. But, I hope this is a
small token to your value that we see you as. Same as Senator Pate, the
lessons that I learned in my military service are invaluable, character
building and leadership and discipline. And, when I look around the
room, I know I'm not alone as someone who's served. Not only among the
members of the Senate but I look even in our staff and it's a testimony
to what kind of people this creates for our country and even beyond
their military service what they go on and how they go on to serve in
such dignified and wonderful ways. While I, as a member of the National
Guard, I consider it a deep honor to be counted among you. To steal a
line from Band of Brothers, when I look around this room, I'm not a hero
but I'm honored to serve in the National Guard full of them. Thank You.
[speaker change]
Thank you Senator. Senator Jackson for what purpose do you rise?
[speaker change]
To speak to the motion.
[speaker change]
Senator you have the floor.
[speaker change]
I thank Senator Brown for sponsoring this joint resolution because
sometimes you just have to put the breaks on and remind everybody what
it really means to commit to military service in this country. In camps,
sports, and armories all across the state, tens of thousands of our
citizens today got up before the sun. They were sweating while we were
still sleeping. By the time we were finishing our breakfast they had
already been up for hours. If it's raining, their training. If it's
snowing, they're still going. Some folks think we have it hard here. We
don't. This is the most comfortable chair I have ever sat in in my
entire life. This room has air conditioning. None of us are wearing body
armor. No one was worried about IEDs going off on I-40 on the way here.
I carried an M-203 grenade launcher when I served in Afghanistan. Nobody
here feels the need to carry a grenade launcher to feel safe except
maybe Senator Goolsby who seems like a grenade launcher kind of guy.</p>

My point is that we forget what they're going through, we forget how
hard they have it, and we forget that we can only do what we do here
because they do what they do there and I urge unanimous for this joint
resolution, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brock, for a purpose of your eyes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak to the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Many of you know that last couple days of session last year I had to
leave a little bit early for the birth of my child, which was, got there
just in time, but a lot of times in the waning hours we have, we pass
along different comments and things about the session and one thing I
was gonna mention that night, that in 2013 we were remembering the, some
of us remembered the anniversary of the Beirut bombing and the 20th
anniversary of the Battle of Mogadishu. North Carolina's license plate,
before we changed to &quot;first in flight,&quot; was &quot;first in
freedom.&quot; We sent so many over as peacekeepers to those two war
torn areas for security and in that we are North Carolina's most
friendliest state to the military. But more than that they're our
neighbors and for those that were in those two issues, they were friends
and family as well. I urge you to vote for the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator. Colonel Rabin for what purpose hereas[?]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak to the resolution and to the folks here assembled.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As a veteran of the Vietnam war, actually, I agree with everything
that's been said about supporting the resolution and thanking the folks
who are on active duty but I beseech everyone in the room to contact the
folks up there in Washington, wherever you know where to contact them,
to take care of the veterans who deserve what they have earned. They
have to get it. They won't get it because they don't tend to vote as a
block. They don't speak as a block, I'm here to speak for them. What is
going on right now in Washington with regard to our veterans is an
absolute abomination. Shinseki should resign, he should be forced out of
office and the whole thing should be dismantled and started again based
on what's happening. I can't say enough about it. I tend to get a little
bit emotional about it but it is the truth. If all of you will just
write, send to your congressman, all you folks in the gallery, please
stand up and speak for those folks who gave the ultimate sacrifice and a
lot of sacrifices and will continue to do so unless we take care of
them. I'm paraphrasing General Washington right now. That long ago this
nation knew that if we didn't take care of our veterans we would soon
run out of veterans and in a day of an all volunteer force we better
take care of them, thank you.
[APPLAUSE]
Senator Bilsby[?], for what purpose hereas?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bilsby you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm hesitant to rise after a great war hero like Colonel Rabin. Colonel,
we appreciate all of your service, a Silver Star winner and numerous
other awards, it's an honor to sit with you in this chamber,
particularly on a day where we honor our military. I would like to point
out something that we've talked about just a little bit, Mr. President,
but not really touched. All the men and women that we see up in the
Chamber and the folks that are serving today are not conscripts. They
are not forced to join the military and they join the military at a time
of war. We're fighting the global war on terrorism and all these people
who join, that we see in these uniforms, knew when they signed the line,
going in to harm's way and giving their lives for their country was a
definite possibility. That makes them stand out as a special group in my
mind. They're all volunteers, they're willing to give their all. They
care that much for this country. I just wanted to make sure we recognize
that as we appreciate them on Military Appreciation Day. God bless you,
you are the backbone of our country, we could not do what we do in this
chamber without you, thank you for protecting our constitution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson, for what purpose hereas?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the resolution
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly I have not served in the military but I want to recognize the
fact that, a few months ago, had the opportunity to speak to</p>

The 133rd forces brigade in Winston-Salem.  About 300 men and women who
had been deployed two and three times to keep our country safe.  And I
was very proud of the fact as well that probably a third of them were
women.  And they had sacrificed time from their families, from their
husbands, from their homes and their loved ones to go and serve their
country.  And so I was proud to be on the stage to award plaques and
little certificates to men and women, over three hundred who had
sacrificed their time from their families to go and to protect us.  And
I extended our gratitude on your behalf to say how proud we are of them,
and how much we appreciate the sacrifices.  So to the men and women in
the gallery I too support the resolution and I extend my appreciation,
my brother was a purple heart veteran.  And another brother served as
well too, so I appreciate what you’ve done to continue to keep our
country safe.
[speaker changes]
I think it’s very fitting and appropriate that we’re here today, before
Memorial Day to really pay homage and tribute to all of you in our armed
forces.  Regardless of whether you’re in the Air Force, the Marines,
Coast Guard or the Army, you’re always there in the forefront.
Regardless of who our Commander-In-Chief may be in Washington, our
President, our military is always there, steadfast.  Strong, with
courage and honor and dignity.  Always first to put your lives on the
line to protect our very cherished freedoms.  All those things that
allow us to have a [???] assembly and a senate, a house, and more
importantly, security to live within our homes without fear of tyranny
or invasion by others.  It’s you in our armed forces that we tribute,
pay this very significant tribute to, not just on Memorial Day, not just
on Veteran’s Day, but for what you do EVERY day for us.  We thank you,
we thank your families, but more importantly, we thank you for being
willing to put your lives on the line for our freedoms, our interests,
and for those values that we all cherish.  You’re in the forefront.
You’re our leaders.  Moreso than many of those who are elected here
today, because if it were not for you, we would not have the priveledge
of living in this civil society with the freedoms that we all cherish
and hold near and dear.  Thank you all.  Thank you for your sacrifices.
And thank you even for those that do not make it back from the
battlefield from time to time.  Whose lives are sacrificed, because they
too are an important part of what allows us to thrive, to grow, and to
be the great country that we are, the United States of America.
[speaker changes]
Members of the Senate.  I have a two-fold reason for standing.  I have a
great appreciation for the military, I was able to serve.  I was a young
boy out of the high school, and I thought I knew everything about
everything.  And when I got in to the military, they taught me how to
not be an individual, but to work as a team.  And because of the
military I’m a different man today, professionally, personally, and my
family is treated differently because of the military.  I am the man I
am today because I served in the military.  And I want to thank the
military for that first, but most importantly, I want to thank the
military for what they do every day.  When I stand up and look at the
flag and say the pledge of alegance, it means a lot to me emotionally
and personally, because I know the people that go to war and stand on
the front line every day to protect our freedom so that we can assemble
as we are right now at this moment, at this time, and at this place.  So
thank you for everything the men and women of the armed forces do for us
every day, and I want to also thank their families, because they are
sacrificing also every day that their loved ones are overseas, and they
have to be deployed.  So thank you so much for everything you do, and I
strongly urge everyone’s support on this resolution.  Thank you, thank
you Mr. President.</p>

resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Davis you have the floor. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]Mr. President and members especially to those who are here who
continue to wear the uniform. We truly don't know how special you are
because it takes a very special person to place the call to service
above self. As been mentioned in all of these comments today to go into
a profession a career field that we know that  you may not make it back
you may  have friends that may not make it back but yet we're willing to
serve and it's just not matter of carrying our weapons in very
undesirable circumstances, but hear this to do so and not at times fully
understand why you're there why you were sent, but yet to continue to be
brave and diligent in your service. To me that says a whole lot and if
there's any one thing that I think we still need to continue to give
attention to realizing that maybe we don't understand how special
individuals are and the stressors that they deal with as we in
particularly look for those who that may be dealing with post traumatic
stress. We need to continue to be mindful of those as well as those who
were not make it back were not able to make it back and their family
members, but I join my colleagues today in saying to each and every one
that's here and those who are not here who wears the uniform and even
those who've never worn the uniform thank you from the bottom of my
heart and may God continue to bless you and your families and I actually
support this resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion or

… day of 2014. Respectfully submitted, Mister President. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you very much, Senator. And upon the motion of Senator
Jerry Tillman of Randolph County, the Chair is happy to extend
courtesies to the gallery. To the King, Richard Petty, his daughter
Rebecca and family, thank you for being with us. Please stand and be
recognized. It’s one of the few times you’ll ever see Richard Petty
without his cowboy hat. Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A motion, Mister President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Apodaca has the floor for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister
President. Members, earlier Senate Joint Resolution 809 was filed. I
move that it be placed on tomorrow’s calendar. We’re going to call it
the Zeb Alley Veterans Day Appreciation. I think that would be
appropriate. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Objections ??. We do have a doctor and
nurse with us today. We have Doctor John ?? of Raleigh, North Carolina
with us and we also have Nurse… let me see… this is different than what
I have here but our nurse of the day, please stand and be recognized as
well. Thank you for your service to the Senate. Do we have any notices
or announcements? Is there any further business to come before the
Senate? If not, the Chair recognizes Senator Berger for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Shall we try this again? That’s a little bit better.
Mister President, I move that the Senate do now adjourn, subject to the
receipt and re-referral of messages from the House and the Governor, the
introduction of bills and receipt and re-referral of committee reports,
and the referral and re-referral of bills, to reconvene on Wednesday May
21st 2014 at 2 pm. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The motion that the senate do now
adjourn, subject to the stipulations stated by Senator Berger, to
reconvene Wednesday May 21st 2014 at 2 pm, seconded by Senator Apodaca.
All in favor, say “Aye”. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oppose, “No”. The Ayes have it. The Senate stands adjourned.</p>
