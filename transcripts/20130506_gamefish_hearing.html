<p id="000:00">
Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank everybody for being here today.
Just to give you an idea of how things are going to work today, I was
waiting for Representative Tom Murry to get here, I do not see him yet,
but he was going to go through the bill in its entirety to give you a
summary of everything that is inside the bill.
Once we do that we will start with four speakers. Our first four
speakers will have up to 10 minutes to speak. We have two in opposition
of the bill, two in favor of the bill and all four of those gentlemen
are sitting over here.
After that, if you’ll listen for your name to be read you will have up
to two minutes to speak after that and to address the members of the
General Assembly that are here and also to address the public. Everyone
will be speaking from the front here. We would like to do our best to
have everything accomplished by four o’clock today. With your patience I
believe we can do that.
Just a couple of House rules that you need to know. One, I know there’s
a lot of passion behind this issue whether it be from the commercial
side or from the sportsman’s side. We’re all aware of the emails and
we’re all aware this has been an ongoing issue for many years.
I would ask that everyone that addresses the group today be polite and
respectful and listen. If at any time the debate gets out of control or
if people are being disrespectful we will close the debate and we will
be done for today. With that said, I would like to ask our first speaker
to come forward. When you reach the podium, if you would, identify
yourself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Bell and members of the General Assembly and
the public. My name is Jerry Schill of Perfection, North Carolina. It’s
a crossroads near Cove City in Craven County. I’ll give you a little
background so you may understand my strong opposition to this bill,
particularly the game fish status part of it.
Although I represented North Carolina’s commercial fishing industry for
18 years from 1987 until ’05, I currently have no economic interest in
fishing either commercially or recreationally. I have never held a
commercial fishing license, have never sold a fish and I do not fish for
recreation. I have a son-in-law that owns Etheridge Fishing Supply in
Wanchese, North Carolina and his customers are primarily commercial
fishermen.
I currently work, well, employee is a better word for Mackilwean Turf
Company in Craven County but next week will begin a ministry as program
director for the STAFF House Maternity Home in New Bern. In a voluntary
role I was a founding member of the Craven-Pamlico Christian Coalition
in 1994 and currently serve as its chairman.
Since I’m not involved personally in either recreational or commercial
fishing, why am I here to talk about game fish? First, to provide a
little bit of historical background to you regarding fisheries
management in general and the game-fish issue specifically. More
importantly because I’m a seafood consumer.
Allow me to begin with a parable. Some young men who have a very
physical farm job were on their way to work one day from New Bern to
Goldsboro. Their gray-haired supervisor was listening to their
conversations about certain lifestyle choices and he began to minister
to them about responsibility, being married as opposed to shacking up.
One of them asked, “How long have you been married?” The supervisor
said, “Almost 45 years.” “Wow,” the workers said, “How can you do that?”
The supervisor told the crew that he wanted to buy a milk cow about a
year ago but the idea was quickly vetoed by his wife. Being quick on his
feet the man remembered that an Amish man had told him to consider a
milk goat rather than a milk cow, “They’re easier to take care of,
they’re cheaper and the milk is better for you.” So he tried that
approach with his wife. That didn’t work either. He ended up with a male
neutered beagle, “And that my brothers his how you stay married for 45
years.”
It’s called compromise. And we certainly know the meaning of that word
in fisheries management. I served as a fisheries regulator as a member
of the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council for two three-year
terms, appointed from 1989 to ’92, then reappointed from ’92 to ’95.
I was appointed by the US Secretary of Commerce upon nomination of
Governor Jim Martin. I know what it’s like to participate in contentious
debate on fish issues and have done my share in this building.
Especially in the ‘90s on the discussions on the Fisheries Reform Act
which was signed by Governor Jim Hunt in 1997 using a pen that I still
have.
It was not one of my happiest days as there were some commercial
fishermen who wondered what side I was on when we made some hard-fought
compromises.</p>

<p id="005:00">
…to keep the peace. Prior to that debate, however, there were a couple
of notable battles here in the general assembly. The first began with a
press conference in the legislative building by former Representative
Billy Richardson. Members of the Coastal Conservation Association walk
in with him. He introduced a bill that would have allowed for a
non-binding ballot referendum on a net ban. The bill died in the rules
committee but I mention it to you so you understand why there is some
earned paranoia by commercial fishermen.  In other words, there’s been
talk of a net ban in this general assembly prompted by the CCA. Even a
few years earlier, 1988, I received the newspaper article from Florida
written by a sportswriter with the headline “Good News, Redfish is Now
Game Fish.” Along with this comment by the sportswriter, “Yes friends,
let’s continue to make commercial fisherman the endangered species and
you can bet your last dollar that no one will rally around to save that
species.” Game fish in Florida was supported by the Florida Conservation
Association and fully supported a net ban a few years later. Point
being, paranoia is justified. Back to North Carolina in the 90s, Senator
Marc Basnight introduced a bill that would have banned menhaden fishing
off the beaches in Dare County. When trying to reason with Senator
Basnight, then Senate Pro Tem, he told me he would introduce the bill he
would push it and he would pass it and pass it did, easily, in the
senate in the house committees. However it was defeated on the house
floor with the coalition of house republicans then in the minority in
the black caucus. It’s important to note that this bill was not
introduced for any biological concern but only because certain
well-heeled residents of Dare County didn’t like the looks of menhaden
boats fishing off the beach and the concern about a possible fish bill
on the beach. The Fisheries Reform Act was passed with the support of
recreational, commercial and environmental interests. From our
perspective, the positives outweighed the negatives with a primary plus
being the forum for fisheries discussions could be at newly revised
Marine Fisheries Commission. It seemed to us that making our argument
before a board of less than a dozen with interest and knowledge of
coastal issues would be superior than coming to Raleigh and bog down the
system here. I would like to address the issue of financial support for
commercial fishermen in this bill but I do so cautiously as I am not
currently affiliated in any way and did not offer these comments as a
representative of any group but my personal observations. I was a
participant many years in a Washington DC forum where there were many
government bureaucrats and PhD type economists from academia. It was an
honest and sincere discussion about the economic plight of commercial
fishermen in the United States and one of the professors asked me if a
guaranteed minimum wage would be a help to fishing families. I answered
that question with a resounding “no” and said that such policy would
destroy them. As much as fishermen themselves complain about the prices
they get paid for fish, it’s the thrill of the hunt and the unknown that
drives them. They have no idea when they leave the dock what their
payout for that trip will be or if they will have a payout at all. Add
to that the uncertain weather conditions that may threaten the success
of the trip or even their safety and you have individuals that have a
love-hate relationship with this unusual way of life. It’s the unknown
that seems to drive them and in my opinion, in the last true bastion of
free enterprise that we have. They love it when prices are high and hate
it when they aren’t. Again, I cannot speak currently for fishermen but
when I was approached with a suggestion like payments to fishermen if
the state bans a particular gear, bans nets or any other scheme, it was
simply this. The commercial fishing families are not for sale. In
summation I have strong thoughts as a seafood consumer. This is a public
trust resource and as such, belongs to everyone. I have some news for
both commercial and recreational fishermen. I do not fish at all and I
am part of the vast majority in this state, as well as our nation. As
part owner of an excellent source of protein, I object to making any
food source available to a very small segment of our population and
taking it away from the majority of its owners. It’s really simple
really. In 1997, we were told emphatically that the greatest benefit to
fishermen for the Fisheries Reform Act would be that the general
assembly would delegate rule making authority to the Marine Fisheries
Commission and allow the rules and regulations to be set by deliberative
body that knew fishing so that we didn’t have to run to Raleigh to fight
the battles. So here we are running to Raleigh. One could say I have no
dog in this fight since I am neither…</p>

…for recreation or commercial fishermen, and that is true. I can’t or
won’t eat my beagle. But I do have a cow in this fight and don’t really
want or need another needy beagle. So I’ll respectfully suggest that you
scuttle this bill.
I’ll leave you with this note. I’ve had many conversations over the
years about what it was like to be a lobbyist with the frequently held
notion that politics stinks, so how can you stand it. I answer with
this. Several years ago I was headed to this building for a committee
meeting and stopped for fuel for my diesel pickup in Kinston. It was a
very hot, humid day and I pulled under the truck canopy to fuel up.
Shortly after I started to fuel a garbage truck pulled up at the pump
next to me. It was quite smelly with some liquidy gunk dripping from the
back. My Quarter Pounder with cheese that I had just eaten suddenly got
sour. Then I thought, “This garbage truck smells like Limburger cheese.
I like Limburger cheese,” and then all was right with the world again.
In these discussions let’s all learn to like Limburger cheese so that
this process won’t make us sick. I have some Limburger cheese, Mr.
Chairman. Thanks and God bless.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for the opportunity to provide some comments. Before I provide
my comments it is my prayer that the facts and concerns of the citizens
of our great state will help you folks discern the truth and do what is
right, just and fair for the people that you all have the honor to
represent.
My name is Jess Hawkins, I was born, raised and currently live in
Eastern North Carolina. I worked my 30-year professional career as a
public servant with the North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries as a
fisheries biologist and a manager. Recreational fishing is my main hobby
and I love to consume seafood.
I am speaking as a North Carolinian and I am not a paid representative
of any group. While I’m proud to be called a North Carolinian, I’m
deeply disturbed and even angry that my state is considering allocating
a public trust natural resource to a small proportion of North
Carolina’s population when there is no scientific or conservation reason
and questionable economic benefit to do so and in the thoughts of many
people is unjust and unfair.
North Carolina is not like other coastal states. It is unique. It has
more estuary water than any other state in the US, hundreds of miles of
barrier islands, thousands of miles of coastline. These waters have
supported and continue to support valuable commercial and recreational
fisheries through the history of our state. Its commercial fisheries are
still primarily small, family-owned businesses that are renowned for the
harvest of different types of seafood.
Its recreational fisheries are some of the best in the nation. Ranking
number three in our country in 2011 in number of anglers and also number
three for the number of fish caught in 2011. Our state is also number
two in the number of angler trips along the Atlantic Coast. These data
do exclude Texas, California and Alaska because they do not use the same
type surveys as the rest of our states in our nation do.
Reallocation of speckled trout, red drums and striped bass is not about
protecting resources or about conservation. The striped bass population
in Albemarle Sound is healthy and has been since 1997. The population
situations of striped bass in the Neuse and Pamlico are unknown but
restrictions have been put in place to make those populations
sustainable.
Fishermen are not overfishing our red drum population. It is a world
class fishery. Measures have been put in place to restore the health of
the speckled trout resource. In fact recreational catches this past fall
and spring were some of the highest seen by anglers in many years.
The commercial fisheries for these species occur up and down our coast
and have many restrictions such as strict harvest limits, gear
restrictions, these are mainly on gill nets, on where and how those nets
can be placed. In fact red drum can only be commercially landed as
incidental catch when fishing for other fish as is also the case for
striped bass in Albemarle Sound.
By reallocating these species totally to recreational fishermen, the
result will be in many instances, dead drum, dead trout or dead striped
bass that will be caught in commercial fishermen’s gear. These fish
could be sold and eaten by consumers but now must be thrown overboard.
That would make no sense.
These fisheries’ resources are conserved through a process established
by Republicans and Democrats in the General Assembly called the Fishery
Reform Act 1997. The Act required the state and requires the state to
develop fishery management plans with the advice of scientists,
recreational and commercial fishermen, have public input and meetings on
those plans, and to have those plans reviewed by the General Assembly.</p>

<p id="015:00">
Before the Marine Fishery Commission passes it all these species have
fishery management plans and non recommended allocating these resources
to a sole user group neither promotional or recreational to establish
that these fish belong solely to recreational fisherman would be
inconsistent with the general assembly's own fishery reform act in terms
of process and in terms of providing balance access to its public trust
resources. These species are held and managed by the state as a public
trust resource for the benefit of all North Carolina citizens.  Our
general statutes and constitution convey unlike some other states that
they are natural resources that are held in trust by the state for the
benefit of its people in common.  I am proud that our state adheres to
the public trust doctrine which came from our English founders in common
law to keep vital fishing navigation and commercial rights from the
greed and corruption of that era.  To reallocate this public trust
resource to a user group that represents only 3 to 5% of the states
population when there is no conservation need is unfair and wrong it
would be like restricting our beaches and sounds to only a small
minority group of a certain social economic class.  Reallocating these
resources for recreational fisherman only deny consumers and people that
do not own a boat or can get to the water access to the public trust
resource there seems to be no reason to take such an action besides
selfishness and greed.  Instead I envision a state that will continue to
allow its citizens access to these fish resources as long as those
resources are not endangered whether it be through hook and line fishing
being caught by commercial fisherman being bought at a retail fish
market or eaten at a restaurant thank you for the opportunity to speak
to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank You.   Good afternoon my name is Chuck Lockridge I am a resident
of Parker's Island a CCA State Board Member, I'm a past coach head of
the first stripped bass advisory committee to the state of North
Carolina saw fit to do and Terry Pratt and I which I don't know if
Terry's here we basically both pretty much saved the stripped bass for
all the rest of y'all that's Terry's line and he asked me to say that
wherever I am.  I'd like to address one thing and that is that the state
of North Carolina by default  has to manage  all of our public trust
resources whether their human, natural or physical all of our resources
that are there for the state to manage we've got to manage them
properly. You can sit back all day long and talk to folks about how to
manage a public trust resource but the bottom line is the state by
default must must manage these public trust resources to provide the
highest total economic return to the state of North Carolina and the tax
payers there in if we do not do that we have provided either a direct or
an indirect subsidy to which ever user group is not providing that
highest total economic return. That said I'd like to move on to address
what the fisheries reform act has been referred to as basically
everything that we can imagine to manage fisheries in North Carolina.
The fisheries reform act was an outstanding piece of law making that was
done by outstanding folks in very contentious times much like these.
But I'll also remind you that the fisheries reform act has been
superseded by legislation almost every year since it was enforced some
of the latest of those would be the Midhaven fishing bill that was
passed into law that was basically supported by senator Raven and the
rest of the senate and the house its now law. We also have a super
majority vote of the marine fisheries commission to over ride the
division of the marine fisheries on any on any piece of management that
involves fish that are over fished or experiencing over-fishing so while
the fisheries reform act is there and this bill maybe HB983 may be
inconsistent with that as soon as its passed into law the position of
the North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries and the Marine Fisheries
commission will be to support that just as strongly as they have
supported the fisheries reform act of 97. They support state statutes
that's their job and I believe the Marine Fisheries Commission takes an
oath to do so.  We have seen in the last week an initial review done by
the fine folks at NCBMF and Dr. Daniels but basically we're looking at a
review that was requested by a legislator I think Representative George
Cleveland asked some questions and he got a tremendous response I know
Lewis well occasionally I see him in church whenever I go he attends
much more regularly than I do I usually go Mother's Day, Christmas and a
day to be named later but Lewis is there quite a bit and i think if
you'll sit back and</p>

<p id="020:00">
Ask him the questions about inconsistent with FRA 97 and going to be
supportive once it becomes state statute. I think you’ll see that. So
let’s get onto the Game Fish Portion of 983. There is no biological
evidence that supports game fish.  There is absolutely no data to oppose
it.  This is not a biological bill. So all of the biological data, all
of the biological pie chats and bar graphs do not apply to this bill.
This is an economic bill. The Marine Economic Development Act. It will
be heard in Commerce and the House, and mostly likely will pass to the
Senate and be heard in Commerce there.  This is not an economic, I mean
this is an economic bill. So it’s not biology that’s driving this. It’s
not having units taken out of the water, it’s not having efforts reduced
by commercial fishermen. That all deals with biology.  There is not one
biological piece in HB 983.  Not one.  There is also no net ban
mentioned in HB 983. So whether you’re thinking about today, if that
comes 5 or 10 years down the road, keep those arguments because you
might need them again. But it won’t come from CCA anytime soon.  CCA’s
Executive Board actually offered a more touring in a meeting called by
Senator Tillman in ??.  Some of you here might have sat in on that. It
was mentioned and basically just shot down immediately so we could go
back to talk about bridges, bridging inlets and paving Highway 12.  We
sent about 4 hours doing that. ??’s an important number because we’d ask
for a meeting with commercial fishermen to negotiate and compromise and
see what we could find as common ground for 4 years and that’s as close
as we ever got. So hopefully we’ll have some time after the public
comments sessesion to talk to folks and take advantage of being able to
talk with reasonable, calm, cool, collected minds. I want to remind you
now that there are seven states, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama,
Florida, Georgia and South Carolina that have all already gone down the
path that we are on today. As we go down this path we get to see any one
of those 7 states who are led by good, fiscally conservative, Christian
Republican Governors. If you think any of one of those Governors, the
likes of Rick Perry and Bobby Jindal would basically do something that
would hurt their state economically, I think you’re wrong. Absolutely
wrong. They know the economics of what game fish can do. They know the
economics of what’s good for their state. So it’s no doubt that this is
the way that North Carolina should go and we should be the 8th state to
embrace this. I’ll leave you now with a written statement. So while I’m
not here to debate the biological data, the proud heritage of commercial
fishing, consumption of seafood, or even the emotional rhetoric
surrounding HB 983. And we can debate and refute all of it if you like.
HB 983 is an economic development bill that will be passed and made into
law because it its irrefutable the best choice for the state and all of
its citizens. The morning after HB 983 passes, and is signed into law by
Governor McCrory, the state of North Carolina will be on a road already
traveled by every state from Texas to South Carolina, to creating 6.5
times more jobs, 12. 5 times more income than the state realized without
game fish status for red?? Spotted sea trout and estuary ranged trout
bass. We’ll add at a minimum an additional 12 million dollars of total
economic return to the state and every commercial fisherman, whether a
4th generation fisherman or one brand spanking new to the industry will
be able to catch and sell to consumers both in and outside North
Carolina’s borders, 99.1% of the salt water public trust resources as
they did the day before this bill was passed . There is no question
about that. We’re talking about having commercial fisherman maintain the
heritage that you’re so proud of.  We’re talking about doing what’s best
for the state of north Carolina and we’re talking about what’s best for
the tax payers f the state. Again I’ll repeat, the day after HB 983 is
passed into law, signed by the Governor, every commercial fisherman that
fished the day before will be able to fish for 99.1% of those fish the
day after. Consumers will be able to consume 99.1% of the same fish they
consumed the day.</p>

Before this bill becomes law. North Carolina must, must, manage all of
our resources. Human, fiscal and natural to the best of their ability to
provide the highest total economic return to the state of North
Carolina. If they do not they are remiss in their duties and handing out
subsidies directly or indirectly to a user group that does not do that.
I thank you very much. Good day.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Before our next presenter I would like to
remind everybody that please keep your facial gestures to yourself and
be respectful to speakers that are speaking in front of you. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My name is Ray Brown, I'm a native of Bartick [SP]
county and I currently live in Goldsborough. I have friends on both
sides of this argument so my views and comments today will be limited to
my personal beliefs. And those friends include as I thought about it,
the three gentlemen who spoke before me. All three I consider and have
called friends for a long period of time. If the average North Carolina
citizen go to the coast and without too much trouble catch a mess of
adult spot, [??], trout, flounder, red fish or whatever, like they did
40 years ago, we wouldn't be here today. But they aren't able to do that
now and haven't been able to do that for a long time. And if you're not
one that fishes recreationally for those of you who are not on either
side of the argument, then I encourage you to talk to someone who does
and talk to someone who's old enough to remember what those waters once
were.
Game fish is not about taking fish from one user group and giving it to
another. If that was the case, and I've been in favor of game fish at
least three species for over 30 years, if that was the case I would be
against it. Game fish is about changing the way we manage these fish
completely. It is as former governor of Louisiana Edwin Edwards said
when asked if his state was going to reopen red drum for wild harvest,
and I quote, &quot;Why? Our waters have been brimming with wild red drum
that drive Anglos [??] from not only throughout Louisiana but other
states. At night we feed them black and red fish grown in our own fish
farms. never have we utilized our fish stocks economically as well as we
do today.&quot; I'm a native of Eastern Northern Carolina. I grew up
eating salt herring and collards and washed away my troubles in and on
the Chowan river. She's a partial provider of food in my youth, a
babysitter in my teenage years, and I still turn to her sometimes when I
just need to get away.
But we should not allow history to be rewritten today. we know that
right now only 149 people caught and sold more than $2000 dollars worth
of these three fish and in the waters in North Carolina last year from
DMF trip tickets. If they're not true then it brings up the whole
validity of the DMF trip ticket system which is a path I'm sure most of
you don't want to go down. But that's not an aberration. In other words
it's not because of rules, regulation or whatervrt that this is a small
number of people. In 1976 an individual named Connie Pervis wrote for
the DMS a report on the Pamlico Sound, and when it go to red drum it
said the following, red drum are not considered to be of great
importance as a commercial fish but are highly regarded as a
recreational fish. That was written 40 years ago. I am glad this bill
compensates those individuals who may have to give up income. It reminds
me of what my family received when we had to give up raising tobacco.
If you as a legislature came to Raleigh because you felt compelled to
reverse overspending by state government then you should embrace game
fish. It is to overfishing what a true balanced budget is to
overspending. And that I'm sure you understand. But you also understand
to balance a budget you must stay on task and not be sidetracked by
objections that are constantly raised to keep you from staying focused.
If you...</p>

get called up into side arguments, those that would have the state
continue to live in the deficit world would have won.  We are once again
left with deficit spending.  With a fishery, it's termed overfishing,
and if you look at these fish stocks today, the DMF website, speckled
trout's depleted, red drum is recovering, striped bass is listed as
recovering, but then, if you go to the WRC website, you will see that
they are now concerned that the striped bass population in the Albemarle
system is perhaps the lowest it's been in ten years.  It's not about
taking fish from one user group to the other.  It's about re-managing
the way we do this, so that our fish will be more numerous in the water,
bigger fish.  We're not taking fish away from anyone.  We're putting it
on the same level as the view from the top- the Cape Hatteras light.
It's always there.  It's protected, but to use it, you've gotta go see
it yourself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  Next we have Representative Tom Murray come to actually go
through the bill with everybody.  While he's getting started, I'd like
for everyone to give special recognition to our sergeant at arms: Mike
Clampett, Charles Goodwin, B.H. Powell, Carl Morello, Doug Harris, and
Barry Moore.  Thank you for your service today.  Representative Moore.
I mean Murray; excuse me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Bell.  I appreciate your willingness to chair
this, and I appreciate the attendance of everybody.  I think we
generated a fair amount of interest in this legislation, as it does
every time it gets brought up, and that is the primary reason why I
decided to engage in the negotiation in this legislation.  It's an issue
that continually presents itself before the legislature, and,
eventually, recreational fisherman will get game fish status.  It's
going to happen in the state of North Carolina, and so my goal was to
try to represent a negotiation and get a balanced solution to issues
that present itself to the fisheries, not just as one user group as an
interest in game fish status, but what can we do to make sure that we
have a vibrant commercial industry in North Carolina, as well, and, as
one legislator told me who's interested in this issue, he said, Tom, if
you'll just ten years.  If you just wait ten years, there won't be a
commercial fishing industry, and this issue will just go away, and that
bothers me.  That bothers me because of the history of our state with
your industry, and so I wanted to try to address this in a way that
seemed fair and balanced.  So, in part one, we have the designation of
coastal game fish, we have the three species that we are designating in
addition to mitigation payments for anyone who experiences any losses.
The recreational fishing license increases were recommended directly
from the Wildlife resources Commission.  There is an additional bill
that has been filed that deals with increased license fees across the
board that were recommended by Wildlife Resources.  I'm a primary
sponsor of that legislation as well, but this addresses simply the
recreational fishing license specific to coastal fishing, recreational
fishing licenses.  In part two, we address an issue that has come to my
attention that there is a lack of observers for commercial fishing to be
able to prosper in our state, and, while that's not a state regulation,
I'm willing to fund observer programs with state dollars to help make
sure that we have a robust observer program so you can continue to fish.
 Part three of the legislation deals with funding for dredging of
shallow draft navigation channels.  The payment mechanism comes from
boat gas taxes.  There is a identifiable portion of gas taxes collected
in our state that are directly attributable to boats, and so this would
reallocate a portion.  One half of one percent of the amount is used to
fund shallow draft dredging funds, so, those are the four major pieces
of the legislation, isn't by far perfect, but it is what I want to hear
from especially the commercial fishing industry</p>

our state specific issues that can be mitigated through this type of
legislation to keep your industry vibrant with the full knowledge that
game fish is on the table and eventually you could get a game fish
status with no commercial input and that would bother me as a legislator
if it wasn't about this piece of legislation. So, I’m hearing Wake
County, I  think I’m trying to bring a balanced approach, a way to
address both sides of the equation with the full knowledge that
eventually, at some point in our state that we will have game fish
designation and I think you need to take that as a given, because it's
going to happen. All the other states that have game fish status they
preceded game fish status with a net ban.  That's not the right way to
go about it either. So every other state that has game fish status they
started with a net ban then they went to game fish status that’s not,
that’s not the right way to go about it and so I’m trying to bring a
balanced approach this. I appreciate your interest and I appreciate your
willingness to come to Raleigh and let us hear from you it doesn't
happen a lot down here especially with this kind of robust participation
and I sincerely appreciate your attendance and I’m hopeful that will
have a productive discussion, with all the givens that we have in place
to help make sure that we have balanced legislation that benefits all
parties.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Ladies and gentlemen next we’re going to get into the
public comments.  Everyone will have up to two minutes.   Please keep
your comments in that time frame.  We do have a number of people that
would like to address the group.  We’re going to go ahead and get
started.  Ladies and gentlemen please remember to respect the speakers
and also please hold your applause.  We’re going to try to get through
this is as quick as possible. Due to the large number of people that
would like to speak.  So we’ll go ahead and get started.  Once we get
through the first sheet I’ll read the next list of names.  Once your
name is read whether you’re in this room or if you’re in the conference
room below please come up we’ll line up on the side here and each person
will have two minutes to address a group.  Thank you.  Sammy Corbet
we’ll start with you and then we’ll go right down the line.  And we’ll
have ??  good.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I’d like to thank everybody for giving me this chance
to speak today.  My name’s Sammy Corbet.  I represent Hampstead ?? Beach
area and the commercial fisherman, thirty eight years.  I sit on the
Southern advisory committee.  It used to be the southeast.  On there for
ten terms now I’ve also been on the ??, sea mullet, blue crab,
definition of commercial fisherman and sea turtle committees.  There’s
people from recreational sector that would like to have you believe
there is no benefit to commercial fisherman, from catching speckled
trout, red drum.  I personally 12 to 15 percent of my income just from
them.  At 12 percent, 15 percent I can pay my mortgage with that for the
whole year.  So I don’t think there’s anybody in this crowd that thinks
they could have part of their income that pays their mortgage for a year
taken away from them and still make it.    I don’t care what you make or
where you live.  In 38 years of commercial fishing I’ve never sat in on
a meeting or a group of guys talking where they said you know what we
need to get those guys with the rod and reels out of here.  Their
catching too many fish.  Their hooking fish and killing them.  They got
to be gone.  But every time I get around recreational fishermen, time to
get rid of the commercial fisherman catching our speckled trout and our
red drum.  I think that the marine fisheries does a fantastic  job with
what  they, I mean with the size limits, the bag limits I don’t know how
you can  get a fairer system than what they’ve got. I see a lot of
people in the recreation side that I sit in committees with.  We all sit
down; we hash out the problems to go before the commission.  They hash
out problems they have.  We come up with a great plan.  Every fish we’ve
had a plan on is better off now than it was the day the plan was put
into effect.  I respect all of you.  Thank you for your time and I
really think you need to leave it to the marine fishermen.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Once again when your name’s called if you’d just
start lining up here so we can go through it a bit faster and I once
again I ask that there be no applause at the end.  Thank you and when
you do approach the podium, please notify yourself</p>

on Ocracoke Island the fishing tradition is directly related to the
tourism industry producing seafood for restaurants and retail purchases
bait for tackle shops, as well as promoting the fishing village image.
Many tourist say Ocracoke would not be the same without the fish house.
Tourists come to the Outer Banks, not only from natural beauty but also
for the fishing to catch and eat seafood from Corolla to calabash,
access to fresh seafood is essential to tourism industry and to the
local economy of fishing communities.  Game fish status threatens the
very core of our fishing economy even though landings may be low in
volume these fish provide essential income during the late fall and
winter and early spring months when options for income are the hardest
to find.  During summer our retail staff is constantly asked when you'll
have red drum, and when we can reserve some.  Most fishermen on Ocracoke
are also seafood dealers.  They supply every restaurant Ocracoke with
fresh fish, and red drum speckled trout and striped bass are perennial
favorites.  These fish have high name recognition and the restaurants
that have them on their menu are more profitable. Thank you for your
opportunity to speak.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen ?? , president of the North
Carolina Watermen United.  Got a little something I want to read from
you.  Wherever we need to start from then God said let us make man in
our image, according to our likeness and let them rule over the fish of
the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle, and over all
the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.   God
created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him, male
and female he created them. God blessed them, and God said to them, be
fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and rule over the
fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living
thing that moves on the earth, Now when to juxtapose that with a meeting
that I attended with a couple of your speakers here today,
Representative Murray and Representative Moffitt.   Representative
Murray we will not have game fish status in the state of North Carolina.
 We will not subjugate our working-class people to second class
citizenship. I was overcome like a nauseous wave of bile that Rose in my
throat after the meeting in which I attended with these two gentlemen
who try to tell us that we needed to reinvent ourselves.  I  looked at a
man whose fish that he had eaten previously and said you need to
reinvent yourself and I got up that morning and I read instruct those
who are rich in this present world not to be conceited or fix their hope
on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly supplies us with
all things to enjoy instruct them to do good to be rich in good works,
to be generous, and ready to share storing up for themselves treasures
of a great foundation for the future so that they may take hold of that
which is life indeed.  Guard what has been entrusted to you, avoiding
worldly and empty chatter, and the opposing argument of what is falsely
called knowledge.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  If we have any more applause I’ll clear the room and
only allow speakers in please be respectful thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I’m Dan Odin I’m a  fourth generation owner,
operator of Odin’s dock  in Hatteras Village and without doing
complicated math equation I feel like I can safely say that 50 percent
of my sales at Odin’s dock  come from commercial fishing.  Therefore,
fifty percent of my sales come from recreational fishing as well many of
my customers spend half of their doing each a lot of the guys in this
room, a lot of recreational guys are not here, but taking a portion of
income from commercial activity from the fisherman and from my business
will also take a substantial amount of tax revenue from the state of
North Carolina. I'm afraid that Hatteras Village could be one of the
first coastal</p>

Communities to tally fall a part from the impact. The impact of some
thing like the game fish bill. North Carolina is a very unique state,
whit its own unique residents. I don't think that there is any body in
this room that could deny, that this is a stepping stone for net ban. I
feel very strong about it, this is not Florida, the residents in this
room are not from Florida. And what has worked for Florida will not work
for coastal North Carolina. The coastal and sea towns simply can not
stand game fish bill or a net ban. I don't really do the science side, I
listen to it, and I feel like the division of marine fisheries does a
decent job regulating stock. And I appreciate you guys giving me a
minute of your time. Thank you.

I am Lily Eden the co-owner of the of The Vista by the Sea in More Head
city, since may 1993. we had built our reputation on fresh and local sea
food. I'm a founding board member of caught rate catch and a member of
the sea food program, promoted through the department of North Carolina
department of agriculture. In 2006 our restaurant earn the best dish of
North Carolina for a caught rate grouper, and sea ?? with dose souse. We
track our selves thought the contest and I was amazed at our selves,
increase over 200%. with the growing demand of our cough rate dishes we
have tried to educate our selves and our clientèle about about the
seasonality of sea food. We have tried to contact law makers directly. I
included there names and information in our feature sheet. For the past
winter months we were thank full. We were able to serve red drum and
stripe bass. Since there were restriction on groupers and other sea food
until may first. In 2011 tourist spent 18 billion dollars in North
Carolina. At the North Carolina sea food festival, cough rate catch did
a survey to find out what brought them to the coast. The highest
percentage said they came to eat our local fresh sea food. Thus, the
development of the Cristal Cost culinary campaign by the DTDA. According
to the national restaurant association, on of the biggest trend in food
industry is locally source products. Our customers whan to, what
conditions and who cought and raised their food, they are consuming. I
need to ask you two questions. Number one why would you possibly pass a
bill eliminating the majority of the public access to red drum stripe
bass and spotted sea-trout when the North Carolina department of acg has
done such a fantastic job to promote North Carolina sea food. Number two
if you vote in favor of this bill are you ready to take full
responsibility, for actions and consequences surrounding your vote.
Possibly the sinking North Carolina commercial fishing industry. Thus,
grooving the dependence of imported sea food. In closing I restate my
name. My name is Lilly Eton. A cretin American adopty, an American
citizen and grateful of the opportunities that this great nation and
state has given me. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good afternoon representative. I thank you for the opportunity to speak
on behalf of the sea food industry today. My name is Alison Thomson
Willis, I ma a native of Rayleigh but live on harkers island North
Carolina. My husband Edy Willis is a forth generation commercial fisher
man. We own and operate mister big sea food maker and and courts town
sea food. A community supported sea food program that delivers fresh
local sea food to customers, restaurants and specialty markets in durum,
tapo hill, Carrboro and Boon. Red drum, sparkle trout, and stripped
bass, are three of our most requested fin fish. All tree are high demand
item in restaurant, specialty markets and our CSS program. The demand
for this species far out wights the supply. The landings might be low
per fisherman, but the product is vital to our fisherman year round
income. All tree fin fish are high dollar item for local fisherman. The
high dollar item flows trough the supply chain to the consumer. For
example a fisherman receives two dollars per pound for red drum at the
fish house. As compared to fifty cents per pound for blue fish. By the
time the drum is sold, in a specialty market in Topal hill. Those red
drum files are worth 14 to 15 dollars per pound. The proposed game fish
designation comes at a time when the public desire for healthy local
food is at an all time high. Our customer care deeply where there food
comes from, and how their sea food got from the water to their plate.
Our customers want fresh wild cough sea food. They do not want to
consume farm raised sea food.</p>

instead of imported from the other side of the world under questionable
conditions. They want and deserve to know that the red drum they are
eating tonight was caught yesterday by Aaron ?? of Cedar Island. If HB
983 passes, speckled trout, red drum, and striped bass will be forever
off the menu at restaurants on the coast and inland. These select, wild
caught fish will be forever off the dinner plates of our customers and
seafood consumers statewide, who enjoy the culinary treasures our
fishermen provide all North Carolinians. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you for this opportunity to speak on this very important matter.
I'm John Day, and while I live in Saxapahaw, my family settled on Cedar
Island in the 1790's. Many of them are still there today, some of them
preserving the legacy of ancestors by making a living on the water as
fisherman. I'm a retired county manager, so I know firsthand of the
importance of economic development, retaining and creating jobs,
strengthening communities, and perhaps most importantly, honoring and
supporting heritage and culture. Now I work for North Carolina State
University on a USDA funded project with a goal of bringing more North
Carolina grown and caught foods into mainstream retail grocery stores
and food service industry's supply chains that serve Fort Bragg. If the
project succeeds, it'll improve food security by increasing access to
North Carolina foods and it will strengthen the economic viability of
small and mid-sized farm and fishing operations. I'm also involved in
other North Carolina State efforts to grow and strengthen community food
systems, and by extension, the state food system. These efforts are
largely driven by the burgeoning market for local foods. More and more
consumers want to buy food from outlets where they can see who grew or
who caught their food, and the want to spend their food dollars in a way
that supports their local and their state economies. They want the
freedom to buy local food from people that they know. HB 983 runs
counter to these values and efforts. By designating red drum, speckled
trout, and striped bass as game fish, families will be hurt because
their incomes will be reduced, jobs may be lost, communities weakened,
and the heritage and culture of our proud coastal fishing communities
will be diminished. Less, not more, North Carolina food will be
available to move into the supply chains that feed grocery store
customers and soldiers at Fort Bragg. Finally, and most importantly, a
precedent will be set, where one class of citizens is given favor and
privilege over another. One having access to a food that is strictly
managed, publicly owned resource, another denied it. I respectfully ask
for the removal of game fish provisions from HB 983. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES].
My name is Ashley Blue. I come as a representative from Greenville,
North Carolina. I'm the owner of Shore to Door Seafood. I've spent the
last 4 years of my life promoting Carteret and Pamlico County seafood.
I'm here to speak to you based on the myth of aqua culture being a clear
substitute for this fishery and this bill. In speaking with several
people down in Louisiana as fish farmers themselves, and asking them
point blank, are they able to counter this measure and are able to
obtain the necessary means to be able to overcome on a supply chain's
shock of this nature. Right out of their mouths, point blank, they are
regulated to the hilt, just like we are. They're being pointed out as
being fishermen, but they're really farmers. As being farmers, they're
dealing with regulation based on point-source discharge of their ponds
these fish are raised in. Anybody's not sure what point-source
discharge, we can go back to the hog lagoons. Their water that they
raise these fish in are being classified as the same classification as
toxic water in hog lagoons. They're not able to dump this water into
blue line ditches. I asked many places around North Carolina, as The
Fish Connection, and other striped bass farmers, they're experiencing
the same issues. They do not have the infrastructure that is needed to
sustain this supply shock, which in turn will make striped bass and red
drum</p>

On your plates, at your restaurants, more expensive that what beef or
pork could ever cost. So with that, the substitutes being too high, I do
urge you very much to kill this bill. Thank you very much for your time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good afternoon. I’m Jamie Rival. I live in Derrick
County, and I’d like to let you know who regulates North Carolina
fisheries. The department’s council’s acts compacts administrations and
services that manage, rule, write, regulate, permit and enforce North
Carolina’s fisheries management plans. Plans that must be in place
before any fish of significance is kept, sold or eaten. These
bureaucracies are the United States Congress, the US Department of
Commerce, the US Secretary of Commerce, the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service, the
Office of Protected Resources, Highly Migratory Species, the Northeast
Fisheries Science Center, Department of Homeland Security, Department of
Transportation, US Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Coast Guard,
Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council, South Atlantic Fishery
Management Council, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. Our
own state also makes rules and regulations that are under the Department
of Environment and Natural Resources and North Carolina Division of
Marine Fisheries. Some examples of state regulation are gear
restriction, net attendance time closures and area closures. Many state
regulations are put in place to comply with federal FMPs, Endangered
Species Act, and the Office of Protected Resources rules. I would like
to sum up by reiterating the fact that no one in North Carolina can
legally keep or eat a fish until tens of thousands of biologists,
scientists, lawyers, bureaucrats, government appointees, advisors,
elected officials, marine fishery staff, statisticians, the general
public on agencies, commissions, compacts, advisory boards, department
services rules advisory teams, stock assessment rules committees,
scoping meeting councils, stock assessment workshops, stock assessment
committees, biological studies to prove sustainable committees,
technical committees, monitoring committees, FMP development and review
teams approve the FMP. The state and federal entities listed in this
report all have the same goal. To include conservation and management
measures that will provide the greatest overall benefit to the state,
particularly with respect to food production. And finally, the General
Assembly of North Carolina sends [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] citizens from our state [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] to represent North Carolina on these federal councils. Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman and Representatives, thank
you. My name is Warren Judge. I’m chairman of the Derrick County Board
of Commissioners. We’re blessed in Derrick County to have an abundant
fishing industry. Three segments. All three segments are alive and well
in our county. Our commercial fishermen, hundreds. Hundreds, thousands
of jobs from the boats to the men and women on the boats to the docks to
the fish houses to cut rooms, to the tractor trailers that leave,
carrying our catch north to Richmond and Washington, D.C., Baltimore,
and New York City. Taking good, local, fresh seafood and spreading it
across the great country of ours. This is an economic question, and
being on the ground in Derrick County, it smacks of taking fish from one
sector to another. It’s about jobs. In this legislature, we’ve heard for
the last several years about economic stimulus and creating jobs. Let’s
not lose the jobs we have. All of our people work hard at fishing. Our
recreational fishing provides jobs. Our charter boat industry provides
jobs. But let’s not decide to pick on the commercial fishing industry
and take those jobs from us. We appreciate everybody that fishes in the
sea. They’re our farmers, and we need to keep them working. And we need
to, these are the backbone of America. These are hardworking men and
women, families, children to raise. You can’t take a public trust
resource, take it from somebody, give it to somebody else. We look for
y’all to oppose this legislation and if there’s negotiation on the
table, let’s open it up. I would put myself forward as someone to
negotiate. But let’s not be unilateral in this. Let’s not take one
resource from one group and give it to another. Thank you. [SPEAKER

I'd like to ask our legislators a question as I open, do the proponents
of this bill that is before us know what is best for our state in these
circumstances even better than the North Carolina division of Marine
Fisheries, the state agency that our state has tasked with studying,
managing and regulating these public trust resources.
You see, what the advocates of House Bill 983 are failing to tell us
about is their support of state wide net bands. The reality is if any,
or all three of these species are designated as game fish, the division
of Marine Fisheries explains, and I quote, &quot;it will result in
increased discards because these fish will still be inadvertently caught
in commercial gear used to catch other species of fish. Any game fish
taken as by catch by commercial fisherman will have to be discarded
resulting in waste. Additionally the discards will likely create new
conflicts between the recreational and commercial user groups.&quot; And
I think we need to highlight that last sentence. The CCA's website list
their achievements in other states. We've printed these out, so that all
of us have access to something that they boast about. I want you to
understand that there is a direct correlation between game fish status
and net bands. Nationally the CCA boast that they've already helped to
establish net bands in four other states.
Now pause for a moment and consider this, the same group that is asking
today for game fish status, will return tomorrow and demand that you do
something about all the game fish that are inadvertently being caught in
gill nets resulting in unnecessary waste. A year from now observer data
will support their claim and you'll be faced with a greater dilemma. I
urge you to defeat it such passion and enthusiasm and never bears
repeating again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would ask that you would stay within the time limit to be fair to
everybody else that wants to speak.
The sergeant at arms will hold up when you have one minute left and then
when you stop would you just finish your sentence. Thank You.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning legislators, my name is Adam Tyler from Carteret County
North Carolina. I would like to give you a little bit of facts behind
making this game fish go through. According to the population of North
Carolina 2010 there were 9,535,483 people. According to the license data
collected by DMF, there are a total of 439,251 in and out of state
licenses issued. This is roughly about three to four percent of our
state population.
In essence, if Phil's bill passes less than five percent of the people
will have access to these wild caught species of fish, so can a
legislator allow a group of individuals to push for making these fish
game fish and take them from all the consumers in North Carolina?
I thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for your time. My name is Kenny Rustic and I'm a resident of
Carteret County. I make my living as a full time commercial fisherman
since 1985. House Bill 983 is being introduced under the disguise of
economics. The Coastal Conservation Association is saying that
recreational fishing generates more revenue than commercial fishing.
This may be true, but I cannot understand why one group, one user group
thinks they deserve sole use of a public trust resource. Not all
recreational fisherman support House Bill 983, it is a small percentage.
I am a licensed recreational fisherman along with my wife and stepson.
We all oppose House Bill 983.
The North Carolina Constitution states in Article 1, Section 1, The
Equality and Rights of Persons, &quot;We hold it self-evident that all
persons are created equal with certain inalienable rights and among
these are life, liberty and the enjoyment of the fruits of their own
labor and the pursuit of happiness.&quot;
Article 14, Section 5, Conservation of Natural Resources, &quot;It shall
be the policy of this state to conserve and protect its lands and waters
for the benefits of all its citizenry.&quot;
The definition of inalienable rights on Dictionary.com says, &quot;a
right that cannot be taken away, denied or transferred.&quot; The
preamble to the 1997 fisheries reformat, section 1997-400 states,
&quot;The general assembly recognizes the need to protect our coastal
fishery resource</p>

hello, my name is karen patrick. i'm a recreational fisherman. a small
business owner, a consumer of north Carolina seafood purchased from
north carolina seafood dealers and restaurants and a supporter of
commercial fisherman. i strongly oppose house bill 983 because i believe
that a public resource as the three fish considered in this bill are
should be available to the public and not a select few. im not in favor
of the social engineering that this bill would mandate in the name of
fisheries management. i dont believe in big government and the
impediments it can place on a small business owner i believe the
positive economic impact the supports of this bill espouse are an ill
conceived pipe dream. there is no evidence to support the statement that
there will influx of new recreational from north carolina just because
these fish receive game fish status. there is a negative economic
impactto those that make their living from our waters and that should
weigh more heavily on your minds especially on these challenging times.
i urge you to join me and stand up for our public resource, our coastal
communities, consumers of north carolina seafood, and the hard working
men and women along our coast and oppose house bill 983.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
are we having fun yet. im willy Phillips, owner and operator of full
circle crab company in Tyrrell county. we wholesale, retail, value add,
cook and serve wild cuaght north carolina seafood. i fish pound nets and
hoop nets during the winter in which we catch striped bass, speckled
trout, and red drum. this time of year we fish peeler and crab pots
(????) my first commercial trip was in 1970 i cannot speak to the
biological discussion of this bill. it would seem logical to pay
attention to the 25 million dollar agency that you fund, that provides
you with the objective data needed to make the right decision. i can
speak as a small business that employs 15 to 20 people and buys from a
hundred fisherman a year. the impacts of house bill 983, should it be
past, are devastating. Tyrrell county, where i live, is one of the
poorest in the state. with an unemployment rate twice the state average.
the economic multiplier that is so often used has an inversion factor as
well that is a negative economic impact is multiplied many times in a
community is already the most vulnerable. i write the checks every week.
i know the consequences. passage of this bill kills commercial fishing
in this state, kills the independent and entrepreneurial businesses
which are the foundation of our coastal economy. and turns of proud
industry into a sad legacy. this is no game. please defeat this bill.

??...the recreational sector says they're worth 93 million dollars.
They're worth 93 million dollars 'cause they want to be worth 93 million
dollars. I've got two small boys at home, they can catch a limit's stack
of trout with a cane pole and a bucket of minnows. It didn't cost them
10 dollars to go fishing, and they catch the same amount of fish as
somebody with a 60,000 dollar bait boat and 500 dollars worth of tackle
bought that day. I packed seafood for local fellas, I've got one man, a
commercial fisherman, is going to do enough to feed his family, support
his people. This boy, he's had a tough time of it all winter. Hadn't
caught a lot of oysters, didn't really get the gist of catching the
speckled trout, but striped bass came around. He come to me, he sold
almost 700 dollars worth of striped bass that week, he got his check on
Friday, he went, he was so happy, his new young baby, went to the mama's
house, the babysitter, and he took his girl to the restaurant. He took
her to the same restaurant that I sold them striped bass to. Them
striped bass, he give the restaurant the money that the restaurant
bought them striped bass from me. That money made a complete little
circle inside of two miles Pamlico County. That's real economics, and
it's real important, and it involves real people. That Mirrolure that
these recreational fisherman go and buy, it's manufactured in China.
It's not manufactured in Pamlico County like that striped bass was. So
that money is now going to China, we're going to have to spend more
money getting seafood from China, all our dollars are going overseas,
and what do we got? A bunch of recreational fisherman. This is about
money? Let's keep the money here, let's keep it local, and support our
people that live there every day, not somebody who might live from away
and might come down and might spend money. They could do the same thing
with a 10 dollar cane pole and a bucket of minnows. Thank ya'll.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good afternoon. My name is Fred Walker. Thank you for having this forum.
I'm here to respectably ask you that you support HB 983. It would bring
good management practice back to a valuable fishery and at the same
time, increase jobs and improve the economy of North Carolina. I'm a
lifelong resident of Pender County and was an avid fisherman of many
years. I raised my children around some areas ya'll will recognize -
Topsoil, Elmores, and Ridges Inlet, fishing. Job requirements and some
health issues took me away from fishing for years, but when my wife and
I retired a few years ago, we started fishing again, and were appalled
by how few fish they were. There weren't any red drumspecks, stripers,
flounders, croakers, all the fish that we had caught down in the
Wilmington area in the past, you just didn't catch many. You know, if
you caught just a few, you were really happy. I started researching and
found that we truly had over-fished our valuable resource through poor
management of our commercial fishermen. I'm a retired magistrate and the
first thing that I did when somebody came into my courtroom, I said
&quot;let's separate the facts from the emotions&quot;, and the facts
are, if you look at it, and you look at the science, commercial
fishermen themselves have shown that only a small portion of that income
came from these types of fish. In 2012, per a North Carolina Division of
Marine ?? only 77 fishermen made 10,000 dollars or more from these
species. All the states that have made this decision have improved their
economies, they have great seafood, look at Louisiana. Great fishing
industry jobs, great seafood, and great tourism. I'd like to share a
quick excerpt from the October, 2011 North Carolina Sportsman's article,
a person who makes his living in Brunswick County, and I'm paraphrasing
- I hate to say it this... I'm out of time. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.

My name is Rick Scroggs, and I'm from Swansborro, North Carolina. I
belong to a great conservation minded sports fishing group called the
Cape Lookout Flyfishers, and on occasion we ask experts from all across
the fishing spectrum to come and address the club. We've had Preston
Pate, and director Daniels from the Division of Marine Fisheries, direct
our group, but probably the one individual who had the most impact on me
as a fisherman was a man named Charles Brown. Charles was a long time
commercial fisherman, lived on Harper's Island, unfortunately see he
succumbed to cancer, not to long ago. Charles...</p>

told his personal story to our club where he switched from being a
commercial fisherman to being a guide because he could finally make
enough money to provide for his family. He took out hundreds of people
in his business. And getting to know him just a little bit more than at
our meeting and at a banquet, he cared a great deal for the resource.
And he taught his people about conservation and about not filling up
with cooler but just enjoying the resource as it was. I would like to
think that this bill will help, in the spirit of Charles Brown, to keep
the resource alive and well for all of us. And I think for him to have
had that turning point in his long career on water to go from ?? was an
instructional lesson for all of us. So I hope that you will support this
bill. Thank you for the opportunity. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Hi. My name is
Scott MacNally. I'm from Ocracoke. I have SMacnally's Raw Bar and Grill
and Gaffer's Sports Pub also, both of which buy local fish, all three of
what we're talking about here today. I think we should not deprive the
tourists that come of the fish that we're speaking of. We saw a lot of
red drum. That's what people want. And I think that I should be able to
support local fishermen by buying their fish, supporting our local
economy, our state economy, and not giving it to someone, whether it be
out of a farm in Vietnam or whether it be out of a farm in Louisiana.
So, I support our local fish. I buy North Carolina fish. I would like to
continue to support our local fish. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] My name
is John Hislop. I'm from Hubert, North Carolina or Bear Creek. I
finished high school in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. I've worked
around the water. I've been around the water. I brought my family back
to North Carolina and wanted them to have the experiences that I had as
I was growing up in those areas. I can remember in the fall of the year,
when the yellow butterflies would fly, we would go get our spot net, and
we'd put our spot net out, and we'd catch spot and either fifty pounds
or a thousand pounds, depending on where we set it, and everybody had a
large time. But, all of a sudden, over the years, the spot started to
dwindle. We used to be able to go out on the beach and see them for
miles. Now, you don't. Now, you come down here, and last year, Carteret
County spent over a hundred thousand dollars advertising that there was
a good spot run. It lasted for about two weeks. It filled up every
motel, every restaurant in the whole area. This is the same thing that's
gone on. Our fish in eastern North Carolina have gone downhill and need
to be taken care of. I think this bill is a good way to start. I'm in
favor of it. If you don't think so, look at your gray trout. Look at
your croaker and these other species. They're virtually gone. We have to
start managing our resource, and we have to start taking care of it. I
know there's a lot of people in here that I've grown up with that have
different feelings than I. And I'm surely not the rich white guy with
the big boat. I just want my family, my children, and my grandchildren
to enjoy North Carolina like I have. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Hi. My
name's Jimmy Nobles from Greenville, North Carolina. I'm a commercial
fisherman and owned West End Seafood of Greenville for the past thirty
years. And I spent probably ten or twelve years on advisory committees
for the marine fisheries. One of them was the Inland Advisory Committee,
and it was dominated by CCA members. And I got to know them and became
friends with them. The first thing I'd like to say is CCA doesn't
represent all recreational fishermen. They're a group of themselves. And
I had the honor to be on the first red drum advisory committee. And it
was commercial fishermen against recreational fishermen. Well, we lost.
It became a by catch fishery. Three fish. That's it. And now, I don't
know why we're here. I mean fishery management is working. And now, all

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good afternoon. I'm Rangor James, I'm from New Bern.
And about the representatives who are here. I really surprised that
they've stirred up quite as much controversy as they obviously have. I'm
sure that's not what was actually intended. I have been in business, I'm
retired now, but I've been in business for a number of years. So I have
a different perspective. I see this more from the perspective of a
business person and a citizen, a taxpayer, that sort of thing. I feel
like it is about jobs. It is about finances. It is about choosing
winners and losers, but more than that, it is about limiting the freedom
of choice and all kinds of freedoms of individual people. I see that as
a very wrong thing to do. It's happened, this choosing winners and
losers, has happened at different levels of government over a period of
time, inch by inch by inch. We are killing the geese who are laying the
golden eggs. Instead of protecting our people and their rights, we are
squeezing them. Is that what we want to be doing? I think we need to
rethink this. I think there's a better way and I'd appreciate it very
much if you find it for us. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good afternoon. My name is Jeff Oden and my family's
roots on the coast go way back. I can say this, it's my great, great,
great grandfather was shipwrecked on Hatteras Island in the mid 1800's
and subsequently married a Native American. According to popular belief,
some have said that Grandfather John Oden washed ashore in a pork
barrel. The irony isn't lost to me that this bill, HB 963 is loaded with
a lot of pork. At present, I run my family's ocean front motel, which
was established in 1955. I also commercial fish and thank God for the
opportunity that I, since I can certainly tell you that in Hatteras
Village, at least, the economy hasn't been the same since Hurricane
Isabell. Between the economy, lack of beach access, lack of rational
solutions to our highway problems, and now of course, you can add this
elitist agenda aiming to take one of the last reasons for people to come
to the coast, which is fresh, local seafood. The question is how many
nails does it take to nail the coffin shut? Over time it would be
interesting to know how many males my family members have made. One of
the three species that we're here today to talk about taking off not
only my family's table, but yours, too, possibly, if you don't have the
means to get to the coast and access it. How can anybody put a price tag
on a resource access and a heritage such as that. I win this by looking
back to my roots. Might be scratching at somebody's eyes, but prior to
the European's arrival at these shores, the Native Americans essentially
led nomadic lifestyles, even on Hatteras Island where they spent their
summers on the shoreline and their winters in Buxton Woods, never
claiming ownership to the lands, the winds, the seas, or the sky, since
they all realized they were just passing through. That way of thinking
certainly has more relevance in this bill. As concerning this bill, you
morally don't have the right to give these resources away. They are the
people's, be they red, black, white, consumers or yes, even recreational
anglers. Finally, it is time to bury this hatchet once and for all and
you're wasting valuable time that could be spent solving the State's far
more pressing...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.

...you think. I can tell you that these fish account for thirty to forty
percent of my income some years. And in the wintertime, when I really
need it, they're up to ninety percent of my income.
As important as this is to me, the supporters of this bill say it's not
important to our state. These same people are asking out state to spend
$1 million of taxpayers' money to pay us not to catch these fish. Let me
say this again -- they're asking you to pay is to quit providing revenue
to our state.
Now this does not sound like a sound economic plan to me. These same
people would have you believe that if you pay us to quit providing
revenue to our state, that droves of recreational fishermen are going to
plop here and spend their money. Where are these fishermen who refuse to
fish in North Carolina until we pass a game fish bill? I haven't seen
any; we haven't heard from any today.
If they do exist, and they do come here, the Division of Marine
Fisheries has said that it will have a detrimental effect on our stock.
That in turn would mean less fish, stricter regulation, and less
fishing. In my opinion, that would be a loss of revenue, on top of the
loss of revenue that they're already asking you to throw away.
My question to you is, are you willing to take an economic plan provided
by a bunch of greedy individuals, who want this all to their self, and
risk all that we already have. We have a thriving commercial fishing
industry; we have the second largest recreation industry in the East.
Folks, are you willing to risk all of that on some long shot of an
economic plan that holds no merit.
I don't see how anybody can justify giving up what we already have when
we don't know what this will provide, we have no idea where they got
these numbers. We have no idea where these people are going to come
from, and even if our stocks can handle it.
The Chairman: Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] My name is Kelly Fadill [??], and I come here to fight
for my livelihood. Approximately twenty percent of my income comes from
red drum, striped bass, and trout. I'm a hard working, independent,
self-employed individual who has never had to rely on government
assistance to support myself or my family. Banning these species from
commercial fishermen and only allowing sports fishermen to benefit from
these fish is a clear message from our government that they simply do
not care about our well being.
With ongoing restrictive fishing regulations and high gas prices, it is
difficult enough to maintain a stable income. Furthermore, there are
many contradictions in this game fish bill that are being proposed. Only
ten percent of the catch is actually commercially caught and sold. I
estimate, in my local area, the ratio of commercial fishermen to sport
fishermen is two to ten. So obviously, the focus wasn't solely on
conservation.
There's a high demand for fresh seafood, and if this resource is
deliberately removed the harvest, it will negatively impact growth and
tourism in our local communities. I am fortunate to have a commercial
fishing trade and to be able to provide Eastern North Carolina with
fresh local seafood. My integrity, focus, and dedication have made me a
successful fisherman, as it did my father, grandfathers, and generations
before me. This is an honorable profession and my only way to make a
living, tracing back over three hundred years.
Our family's heritage is built upon the history, camaraderie, and
appreciation of the salt life. My family and I should not be financially
compromised simply to support another luxurious coastal excursion
vacation for sport.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] My name is Mike Fadila [??]. The reason I'm hear to do
is my daughter-in-law wavted to be here, but she couldn't, because she's
a counselor at the Clay County public school, and she had to work, so
I'm going to read a letter from her.
'My name is Jesse [??]. I am a wife, a daughter, and a sister of
commercial fishermen. We're all scared that there is something to be
lost. However, there is something that has already been lost. The human
component of this equation has been overlooked. The fishermen, the
wives, the sons, the daughters, and the grandchildren have all been
forgotten. Our livelihoods, careers, and our occupations are all
secondary if the effects of this law and the restrictions of this bill
will be put upon us. I was sent to college, got a master's degree and
allowed my future to be credited to the water...'</p>

What is being said here, it is an economic thing. The people that use
these resources, either in the restaurant or commercial kitchen, are
discriminated against due to the fact of their economic standing. Just
because my boat’s not 60 thousand dollars, I’m looked upon while riding
around in the water with gill nets on the back of my boat trying to make
a mere living to stay off of any assistance program and to pay my own
way, and that’s what every one of these commercial fishermen are here to
do today. Thank you. Repeal the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] good afternoon,
everyone. My name is Chelsea Brown. I’m going to try to keep this as
short and sweet as possible. I’m from Marshallberg in Down East Carteret
County. I come from a long line of fishermen and I have a commercial
fishing license. I have fished crab pots and nets with my daddy my whole
life. Not much can compare to wild-caught North Carolina seafood – I
think we can all agree on that. I was in fifth grade when I received my
first string of crab pots, 40 to be exact. I learned a lot of very hard
lessons those summers, but I have two that have had a huge significance
on my life: I learned the value of a dollar, and I learned that
commercial fishing is hard work, but it makes me so proud of our
commercial fishermen in eastern North Carolina. I am here to present to
you a petition sponsored by the NC seafood Coalition called ‘Keep Local
Seafood on North Carolina Dinner Plates. Oppose NC House Bill 983.’ The
NC Seafood Coalition, for those of you that don’t know, is an alliance
of seafood harvesters, restaurant owners, local foods advocates and
consumers united in the support of sustainable commercial fisheries and
public access to North Carolina seafood. As of 5 pm yesterday, we had
one 1,959 signatures from coastal North Carolina and beyond and from all
walks of life. This was the online petition. We also had a hardcopy
petition that had 13 hundred signatures. Those signatures have been
included for your review. I encourage you to read the comments that were
submitted as well. Not included are more recent signatures that total
more than 2,102. Thank you for your time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Hello, my
name is Lin Peterson. I founded local seafood with Ryan Speckman in
2010. We’re based in Raleigh, North Carolina. We’re both fishers and
wildlife graduates of NC State University. We understand natural
resource management. This is an economic issue. Fishermen, whether
recreational or commercial, constitute a very small percentage of the
general public. Our customers come to us because we sell North Carolina
seafood. We’re getting a resource caught on the coast or produced by NC
agriculture to the consumers in Raleigh, North Carolina, and we’re doing
it. Folks love it. They have it. There’s a demand for this product, and
these three species are 20% of our total seafood purchases from October
of 2012 until April 2013. We are buying these species, we’re selling
them. There’s a demand for them. DMF is managing the resource. Our
customers appreciate knowing where it comes from and supporting
commercial North Carolina fishermen. There’s a great demand on local
foods, as everybody knows. The trend, these restaurants on the coast all
the way to the mountains have a demand from their customers to get a
resource, know where it’s produced, know the guy who caught it. We’re
telling that story. My great-grandfather Elma Wade was a boat-builder in
Williston, North Carolina. He built recreational boats, he built
commercial, very important commercial fishing vessels. We can all work
together to manage this resource and get it to people. There’s a demand
and folks really appreciate it, and they smile when they buy our fish
and are happy for what everybody does in this room. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you for the opportunity to speak. My name is Jim Horton;
I live in Greenville, North Carolina. I’ve lived in North Carolina my
whole life basically. I’m an employee of Grady-White Boats in
Greenville. I’m speaking on behalf of the company I work for. Back in
2008, 2009, the economy really hit our business hard industry-wide.
Wholesale boat orders dropped in the neighborhood of 70 to 80% in all
segments of market, so when you talk about taking a hit, I know what I’m
talking about. I’m still feeling it every day. We have currently about
190 fulltime employees. Our jobs</p>

...are mostly unskilled or very much semi-skilled, and the people I work
with everyday are hard working people.  They earn their living from
recreational boaters and anglers.  Our business depends on recreational
anglers.  The Recreational Boating and Fishing Foundation showed that
about 33% of fishing participants own a boat, and about 52% of the
participants considering the purchase of a boat were doing so for better
or more access to fish.  Anglers are interested in an abundance of fish,
and the occasional opportunity for a trophy size fish.  Recreational
fishing does create jobs and does stimulate economic activity.  It pays
my bills, and it has done it for over 31 years.  This is a tough
situation, but the Bill will create jobs.  I think the abundance of fish
will help many people that don't directly touch the fish or commercially
sell fish.  We actually rely on recreational fishing to make a living.
Please help us and support the Game Fish Bill.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Hello, I am Stephen Ammons.  I am the executive
director for CCA, and I am a paid staff, just like Mr. Sean McKeon is
for the commercial industry.  I come to you not as a commercial angler,
and I had a script all written out, but I've sat here and listened to
both sides argue for the Game Fish Bill, and I'm not a commercial
angler, and I don't even ______ recreational fishing up because they
work me too hard.  I don't get to get on the war as much as I'd like to,
but I do know something about heritage, county, farming tobacco all my
life.  I was picking up leaves at the age of four, so I understand a
little bit about what you're saying on the heritage side.  However, the
state of North Carolina has to look beyond the heritage, just like it
did in the tobacco situation, and do what's best for the entire
citizenry for the state of North Carolina, and by doing that, they'll
pass this bill, they'll pass the Game Fish Bill, and the money, and I'm
not even going to do the figures, because the figures have been beaten
to death by both sides.  Thank you.  But I also want you to remember
another thing.  The Bill not only concerns game fish, but if you look at
the Bill clearly, it also allocates money for observer funds, for the
flounder fishery, which is, from what commercial people tell me, is a
whole lot more _____ than these three fish are.  The Bill is providing
money for observer funds, it is also providing funding for dredging, but
it might not mean a lot to you smaller fisherman, but I guarantee you it
means something to the bigger fisherman here in this room.  They want
that Dredging Bill passed, and that's part of that Bill as well.  So
it's not just only game fish.  We're wrapped up in it, and I understand
the emotion behind it, but please look at the Bill as a whole, complete
Bill, and I think you'll be satisfied with it.  Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Hello, my name is Dick Hamilton.  I am a fish and
wildlife biologist.  I come to you today after a 37-year career with the
Wildlife Resources Commission.  Presently, I am working for the North
Carolina Wildlife Federation, and we try and take an objective look at
the management of all of the resources of the state of North Carolina
and encourage the General Assembly to do the right thing.  I am pleased
to report that all the game fish and all the game animals in North
Carolina are doing quite well.  They are being managed quite efficiently
and effectively by the Wildlife Resources Commission and the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service, which manages the migratory game birds.  No game
animal or game fish has ever been classified as threatened or
endangered.  In fact, none have ever even been classified as depleted.
Unfortunately, I can't say the same for our marine fisheries, which have
been managed with a commercial component over the years.  The _____ is
depleted.  Seasons are closed.  The sturgeon is endangered.  It is
completely protected.  The spectral seats are out, depleted, with
restrictive limits.  Gray trout, depleted, severely restricted.  Yes,
sir.  Southern flounder, depleted.  Menhaden, closed.  Hickory shad,
depleted.  Another thing, I heard a lot about the 1997 Fisheries Reform
Act today.  I call your attention to the fact that the 1997 Fisheries
Reform Act has a preamble which is identical to the preamble for House
Bill 983.  It says exactly the same thing, so it can not be referred to
one way...</p>

Terry. Terry II. If you signed up as Terry II, please come up here.
Britain Shackleford and Burt Owens, please line up over here and the
Sergeant-At-Arms will give you further instruction. Thank you. You may
proceed. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] My name’s Alan Hudson. I’m a third
generation commercial fisherman from Tampa, Florida. I spent 29 years
fishing from ?? in Florida, and I also have 17 years experience in
Venice, Louisiana where our coastal communities are all but gone.
There’s not any amount of tourism that can replace the viability of
commercial fishermen. When people come down to spend a few dollars and
then leave again, that money’s not going to stay with us. Far as farm
fish, you take in antibiotics every time you eat a farmed fish. When you
take in antibiotics all the time, you cannot no longer fight off
diseases that comes naturally to you because you’re all the time
ingesting antibiotics. Farmed fish is not the answer. To feed a farm
fish to make him grow 1 pound, it takes 12 pounds of wild-caught fish to
make a farmed fish grow 1 pound. There’s more to it than just one side
getting a few fish, then the other. We’re letting our fishers become
corporate. The small boat industry will be gone, and there’s no getting
it back. Once they take it, there’s no getting it back. They’ll never
give it to us. People are saying all our catches are declining but they
don’t ever look at water quality. You’ve got hundreds of farms dumping
off in these sounds, and is anybody here to even care about the water
quality? The pesticides, the fertilizer from your own yards. That’s all
I got to say. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m Bob Rot from Onslow County. I was
born here in Wake County and lived in Harnett County. Went in the US
Army in 1955. Moved to Onslow County in the ‘80s, and soon after that it
was involved with marine fisheries. When North Carolina created the four
regional advisory committees, I was selected to be one of the… first two
terms, one of the co-chairs. At the present time I serve on the North
Carolina Sea Grant Committee… I’m sorry, Fishers’ Grant Committee, for
five years with Sea Grant. At the current time I’m serving on the Shrimp
Management Plan and North Carolina Advisory to Sea Grant. House Bill 983
for me is against all I’ve been taught in North Carolina, that the
resource should be available to all, not just a select few. I do not
fish for any one of the three species personally. I enjoy two of the
species; striped bass are kind of scarce as far as I’m concerned in our
neighborhood, New River. We do not need rules and regulations for our
fisheries? Yes. Do we need rules? Yes. Marine fisheries at this time has
a good set of rules and are working constantly to improve the value and
quantity of our fisheries. I enjoy fishing. Shrimping is what I do
mainly, but without… it’s just House Bill 983 is just not for North
Carolina. It is not for the benefit of our marine fisheries overall.
Marine fisheries has done an excellent job as far as I can see. Yes,
they need to improve in some areas. Everybody needs to improve in some
areas. I thank you and have a good day. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? James. I
live in Craven County, about halfway down to Cherry Point and Havelock
from ??, and I do fish, but I’m not here to tell a bunch of fishermen
what kind of regulations they ought to have. I’m here as a spokesperson
for the Coastal Carolina Taxpayers’ Association and I appreciate this
opportunity to oppose House Bill 983. Coastal Carolina Taxpayers’

Discussion that’s going on.  I’d like to call your attention to one
statement, an emission statement and also to one of the first law that I
remember about North Carolina here. It is called First in Freedom.  I
hope you remember that one.  Our coastal Carolina tax payers’
association advocates minimum government and maximum freedom. I’ve heard
a couple of fishermen that I’m sure now what they’re talking about.
Talk about being overregulated in North Carolina. First few times I went
puppy drum fishing, I was shocked when we caught one nice puppy drum
after turning about a dozen of them loose, and I was told, okay that’s
our limit we got to go back into shore.  I agree with the person that
said if you want to increase the fund that fishermen get out of going
fishing in North Carolina, raise the limits and expand the sale of the
range of fish that can be taken. We’re dedicated in our association to
the preservation of free enterprise and I think that’s enough said. I
believe this bill is totally against free enterprise system and I urge
you to reject it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, my name is Bill Mendlelak.  I’m a recreational fishermen.
I’ve been fishing the North Carolina coastal waters for over 35 years.
I’m part of what the Division of Marine Fisheries says is a million
recreational fishermen herein North Carolina.  I’ve served on several
committees, the Inland Committee, the Red Drum Advisory Committee and
I’m currently serving on the Northern Advisory Committee. I’m also on
the Federal Weak Fish Advisory Committee.  And what I’ve learned over
the past 10 years or so that I’ve been involved in fisheries management,
is that there’s a difference in the way you manage fish for recreational
fishermen and for commercial fishermen.  Commercial fishermen want lots
of fish, they want lots of poundage, generally smaller fish that are
give you a maximum sustainable yield. Recreational fishermen on the
other hand want an abundance of fish in the water. Lots of encounters a
few for the table and a chance for trophy fish. And we have lots of
examples where the division has been schizophrenic about how they have
to manage these fish. We have limits that are different sizes, different
bag limits and so forth for commercial and recreational fisherman. But
the question is, why do we even look at these 3 species. And the fact is
that they’re available to everybody. They’ve available to everybody
depending on not on rich or poor They’re available to everybody because
they can be caught from the beach, from small boats, wading,  you don’t
have to have a million dollar boat catch these, you can catch them off
the beach or off the bank of a coastal river. And the fact is and a good
example of that is the world record red drum was caught here in North
Carolina. It was caught by a guy who paid a couple dollars to fish off
Avon Pier.  So I urge you to look at who’s after this, who does this
benefit, and I urge you to support this bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My name’s Terry Backus, I’m a commercial and recreational fisher but I
make my living off of commercial fishermen.  Seafood restaurants and
retail seafood stores will suffer without commercial fishing. Locally
caught Brunswick catch, Carteret catch, Outer Banks catch, and Ocracoke
Fresh are all terms that represent a growing movement to eat locally
produced food. Retail seafood sales will be seriously hurt if we
eliminate North Carolina’s commercial fishing industry. If you believe
in made in U.S.A. products, if you believe n supporting home town
production and if you believe in the small time independent entrepreneur
than you do not want imported seafood. The game fish bill’s.</p>

around and discarded, we need to sell them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I am Browny Douglas the current Republican Chairman of
Dale county. Having in the past been a full time commercial fisherman,
and being a 20 year veteran of controversy with the CCA. It could not be
more clear to me that the CCA's agenda is, and always has been about
control. 100% control of access to public resources for themselves only.
Sound science has always failed them, but there muscle money has not.
But with the current economic downturn and new leadership of and withing
North Carolina's Legislature, they, the CCA, pounced with promising
visions of economic grandeur. A vision of success that has yet to
materializein any of the CCA's victim states, except for the 2011
attempt of HB353 North Carolina law makers have been void of Fish
resistance since the passage of the Fishery format from 97, Therefore a
great portion of North Carolina's present legislature is fundamentally
uninformed on this topic of debate. Making them blindly vulnerable to
the steal;th intentions of the game fisherman. These intentions being
the satisfaction of fulfilling there own selfishness, all the while
somewhat mirroring the practice of extreme environmentalism. On March
1st at a meeting in Wancheez Representative Tom Murray told fisherman
they eneded to reinvent themselves. I respectfully contend that
Representative Murray should make that suggestion to the coastal
conservation association. North Carolina is now so to speak serving as a
dam, a wall of protection for the states north of us. The state needs to
reject the agenda of the CCA which will help defend the states to the
north, And hopefully help those to the south regain natural, natures
social, econimic, and scientific balance. Thank you for this oppurtunity
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Good afternoon, i am Donald Woolice from Auburn North
Carolina, Im a second generation of my family that has made there living
from the recreational fishery. I ask for your support for HB983 because
its a wiser use of our public trust resource. It will generate 6.5 times
more jobs, 12.5 times more in sales. This is turn will create a larger
tax base that will benefit all North Carolina residents. If the game
fish part of this bill passes today, the net effect would be a 9/10's of
1% loss of the total commercial catch,leaving for them, and if consumers
of sea food of the state of North Carolina, 99.1% of the prior catch.
Thank you for your time and efforts in looking into this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]My name is Tom Roller, and i live in Carter County
North Carolina, i would like to voice my support for all aspects of
house bill 983. I have been a full time working waterman for 11years, I
run a full time small business as an intro fishing guide, and i want to
emphasize that i do not fish for fun, i fish for a living. Unlike the
majority of commercial fisherman and charter boat captains here, red
drum, speckled trout and striped bass comprise the vast majority of my
landings. I bring clients from all of the state of North Carolina and
all corners of the United States, 12 months of the year. This is vitaly
important to the health of our coastal economy. recreational angling is
not simply about catching a bag limit. its about perception, abundance,
and the experience. Game fish management enhances these qualities that
atract people to the coast. This is different from managing for maximum
scanable harvest. Recreational fisherman value and pay to experience
more fish left in the water. This is why most of our fellow southern
states have granted gamefish status to those fish and never looked back.
DMF data indicates that the popularity of intro fishing is growing, we
have all the ingredients for exceptional fishing in this state. We need
to encourage more jobs like</p>

Mine which have less of a negative impact on the resource while creating
vastly more income and better economic returns to the state. I encourage
you to look at the DMF economic impact estimates. And make your decision
on the best allocation of these valuable public resources based upon
that analysis. I would also like to emphasize that this bill provides
observing funds to keep flounder gillnets in the water. While this
fishery cost nearly as much to observe as it generates in landings, this
bill provides an acceptable compromise. It gives both user groups their
most fundamental necessities. I trust DMF data and I trust their
science, but as an agency they are not charged with creating economic
value as demonstrated by the tax payer subsidized and unprofitable
flounder gillnet fishery. I encourage you to make a decision that'll
support a fishery and coastal economy that will sustain us long into the
future, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My name is Charles ?? Jr. and I live in ?? North Carolina. I'm opposed
to this house bill 983. In 2008 the same three fish had a bill come up
about game fish. It didn't pass. I have a newsflash the recreational
fishermen did not lose any income. They didn't commit suicide, they
didn't sell their boats, or their fishing gear. They didn't stop fishing
or coming to the coast. They didn't buy golf clubs, or tennis racquets
and join a country club. And all the recreational support industry did
not lose income. Life went on just as before. Spending money coming to
the coast, going fishing, and having fun. So if this bill doesn't pass
that law the recreational fisherman as before won't commit suicide,
won’t stop fishing, will come into the coast. Life will go on just as
before with no negative impact at all. It won't affect the income, or
the income of the support industry or their way of life. What this bill
would do if it is passed, it would hurt the fisherman and their way of
life. It will also harm the sport of the support industry for commercial
fishing. And hurt the consumer who enjoys eating wild caught fish
including striped bass, speckled trout, and red drum. Thank you for the
opportunity to speak.

I'm Mikey Daniels from Long teeth, North Carolina. And I wasn't gonna
speak, but I feel like I have to. There's two story's here, two clear
cut stories. We were getting on the bus we were leaving ?? this morning,
40 men gathered together and we all joined hands, and we prayed. He said
God we can't fight these people by our self. Lord you know who we are,
you know what's going on, we need your help. And that's what it is, I
have trouble sleeping nights worrying about what's gonna happen. I wanna
?? fishers meeting. I hear a lot of things said up here. But a lot of
things you'll hear it's not the truth, that's why we have to be real
careful. Or one day we're gonna have to ?? of our self what we've done,
and what we said, and where we are. The ?? fishing in North Carolina's
in terrible condition, and we need help. And you'd think you're trying
to get more jobs, we need to secure the jobs that we have right now. I
would love to sit and I could talk to you for hours about what we need
to do, what we need to do is we need to come up here to see you. We need
to tell you what we need, where we need to go, what we need to do. We
need to come up here and tell you what kind of fish we catch, with what
kind of net. Y'all know nothing, about what we do. It is what is. What's
the deal? And I say ?? my God why didn't somebody call me? Why didn't
somebody ask me what we need to do? And how do we counter react this?
Not one call. All we want is you, we want our voice to be heard. Our
voice is not being heard up here. Would you please listen to us, we need
help. We're worth something. My daughter last week she was a freshmen
asked ?? she was a teacher of the year. We are good people, we're not
bad people. Thank you so much, God bless you.</p>

My name is Sonny Davis. I’m from Atlantic Beach, North Carolina. Me and
my family has been in the fishing business for over 60 years. My
daughter, my son, my grandchildren are running the business now along
with me and we are both recreational and commercial fishermen. We’re
trying to make a living out of the water.
As far as a new regulation, that’s one thing that we do not need. We
also we have the state, the Marine Fisheries regulations which controls
the inlet waters and as most people look at it, it’s a book about this
thick that you have to go through with to find out what you can catch,
keep, the size and all that.
And on the other hand we have another regulation that we have to
participate in which is a Federal regulation that controls federal
waters. That’s another book about this thick that we have to go through
to find out what we can keep and what size we have and all this.
I think the one thing that we do not need is another regulation stopping
more fishing. We’ve had enough, and enough is enough. Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attendance today. Your voice
