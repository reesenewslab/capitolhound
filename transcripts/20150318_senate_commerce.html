  Call the meeting of Commerce to order. First of all, a little house
keeping. Sergeant of Arms, we have Marcus Kitt and Canton Lewis. Thank
you for being here. We appreciate it. We’ve got two pages with us today
and they are somewhere, aren’t they? There they are. We have Nicholas
Otta from Wake Forest, Senator Barefoot and Jasmine McNeill from
Raleigh, Senator Blue. Thank you for serving this week and I hope you’re
having a good time. I am going to now open it up and we’ll hear Senate
Bill 305. I’m going to ask Senators Newton and Bryant to come up here
and give a brief explanation and then we will call on staff, Heather
Fennell, to further dig into the bill and then we’ll open it up for
questions and a vote. So, Senator Newton? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mr. Chairman. Can you hear okay there ?? Can everybody here me okay?
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank you for agreeing. Senator Gunn I want to
thank you personally for agreeing to hear this bill today, and it’s a
beautiful day and I know you’d rather be on a golf course, but I
appreciate you making the exception for us today. I hope it works out
better for you tomorrow. [LAUGHTER] [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m just glad this
is not tomorrow, or we would not be hearing it. [LAUGHTER] [SPEAKER
CHANGES] That’s right. And fellow committee members, thank you for being
here today and I really appreciate the opportunity to be here on this
beautiful Spring day and if you’ll bear with me for a moment, there are
times like today where you just sort of have to pinch yourself and say,
“Am I really here doing this?” Senator Bryant and myself, Representative
Collins who’s here, we’ve worked on this issue that’s before you for
such a long time, and so many of you folks that are out in the public
here have worked on this a long time and it’s sometimes hard to imagine
that you really actually have gotten to this place where we have a
chance to do such a great thing for our state and for Eastern North
Carolina. We have an opportunity with this bill to address a very
serious and long-standing problem in Eastern North Carolina. Many folks
who don’t live there are not directly aware, but we’ve had now a couple
of decades where Eastern North Carolina cities have been carrying a very
heavy debt from their purchase of generating facilities here in North
Carolina. They own part of Sharon Harris, two nuclear reactors, the
Brunswick Reactors in Southport, and two coal fired plants in Roxborough
Mayo Colfaire plants. And from that they took on billions of dollars of
debt. And today they still have about 1.8 billion dollars of debt from
that purchase. What that means is, for rate payers in towns like Wilson,
Rocky Mount, where Senator Bryant’s from, Smithfield, Clayton,
Greenville, Newburn, Kenston, there’s a list of these cities on the back
of your summary if you have any interest in seeing that and seeing how
much debt they’re carrying. What that means is, is that we pay an extra
premium on our monthly electric bill, and it varies from town to town
but it could be, I’ve heard it said as high as 50%. I’m comfortable with
a lot of towns are paying at 35-40%, what I’ll call mark-up premium on
their rates, simply to pay this debt. And we’ve been doing it for year
after year after year. As you can imagine, this has a huge negative
economic impact on our districts. It’s not just the common man, the
working family that struggles to pay you know, 500 or maybe an 800
dollar in the winter electric bill. It’s our small businesses. It’s our
churches. It’s our large businesses. It’s our major manufacturers. It’s
a struggle to deal with this issue. And what we have before us is a
historic opportunity to address this in a market-driven way. With years
of work, the cities have negotiated in good faith over a long period of
time, through electricities called ??. And they have reached an
agreement with Duke Progress. It was First Progress Energy and then
after the merger Duke Progress, to

  <p id="05:00">
  Where Duke Progress would essentially buy out their partners. Duke
Progress owns the rest of these facilities and they manage these
facilities and so what they’re doing essentially is they’re buying out
their partners and they’ve reached an agreement to buy these facilities
for $1.2 billion and so what this piece of legislation does, and staff
will explain it in more detail, is enable legislatively and legally for
this deal to be completed. This is something that the cities in Eastern
North Carolina desperately want but also importantly this is important
for Duke Progress and its rate payers because it enables them to reduce
their fuel cost long term and ultimately keep rates low in the Duke
Progress area. It truly is a win win situation for the state of North
Carolina. With that I thank you for letting me be here. I look forward
to answering questions and I know Senator Bryant would like to make a
few comments as well. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator Newton,
members of the committee. It is really great to have an opportunity to
solve a problem like the problem we are solving with this legislation. I
represent four of the electric cities, Rocky Mount, Wilson, Scotland
Neck and Hobgood so we have cities and small towns impacted by this and
just think about the crippling pressure this debt has been for those in
our region. This is an opportunity to take one of the structural steps
we can take this session to address the disparities between the East and
the rest of the state and to help us and our families and businesses
have a chance for prosperity and growth that we wouldn’t otherwise have
without this support and also it’s very important to note that if it
weren’t for the Duke Progress merger this wouldn’t even be an
opportunity on the table. So that gave us an opportunity to take this
step that would benefit all of North Carolina. So we have I think
270,000 accounts in the Eastern Municipal Power Agency that as a result
of this merger we won’t be bowed out and go into the sunset, we will
become a significant wholesale power purchaser with Duke Progress
Carolina, so we are also participating in the repayment of the debt as
well as getting relief from our own debt in this process. In addition
those of you who are not in the Duke Progress territory or the electric
cities territory benefit in helping to make this structural step that
will help economic opportunity across the state and the staff will
review how each of the, how the Duke Progress customers will be impacted
by this as well as our electric cities customers. I started out on this
journey as a city council representative in Rocky Mount and served as an
Eastern Municipal Power Agency Commissioner for three years as well. So
this is a long time in the works and this is a historic day for us I
think in the state and in the East to be able to address this kind of
issue together and the bipartisan support we had yesterday, 40 some
members across party and regional lines, standing together to say we
want to take this step was really a moving experience and I want to
thank you all for that. Thank you so much. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Senators. Senator Tillman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Senator Bryant, I’m going to use your word, I’m particularly interested
in this bill. I do have a question, Senator Newton, Senator Bryant, I
think you all could, I’m pretty sure you know the answer to it. If after
this deal is completed, and I’m all for it, there will be some debt
leftover. We won’t totally wipe out their big, big debt. How much is
leftover and are they going to be well-equipped then to handle that?
Senator Newton? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, thank you, Senator Tillman and
that’s a very good question. This deal will wipe out approximately 70%
of the debt. In dollar numbers there’ll be approximately $600 million
left for these 32 cities to repay and this bill specifically provides
for the mechanism that they do that. This debt that we currently have is
all bonded debt but it’s attached to these assets, these generating
assets. With the sale of these assets there’s going to have to be new
bonds to secure the, to pay the remaining debt and that’s what this bill
does and when we get into staff’s answer we can drill into that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up then we’ll
let staff speak too. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Now henceforth after the deal is
done there won’t be a wiggle out room of not paying that debt. This is
going to be bonded debt and they’re going to attach assets if not, so
we’re pretty clear that they will take care of their obligations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely Senator Tillman and that is, the cities are
all

  bound. Actually they&#39;re bound collectively. Should one city or
municipality not, somehow have trouble making payments, they&#39;re all
bound collectively on this debt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We don&#39;t need to repossess any city halls down
there?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. At this time we will call on staff, Heather
Fennel, to further explain the bill. Heather?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. I&#39;m gonna start with section 1 of
the bill. Section 1 of the bill provides cost recovery for any public
utility that purchases the assets of a joint municipal power agency. The
first section provides that recovery of the purchase price of the assets
will be allowed in an annual rider. What will be allowed will be the
acquisition cost, which includes the actual cost paid for the assets,
including any amount above net book value. Subsection B of this first
section provides what is allowed to be recovered in the rider, and that
will include the acquisition cost, any financing cost, any operating
cost, and it also includes an adjustment to reflect the changes in the
proportion between the wholesale and retail load in the state that will
happen after the sale of the assets. Subsection B provides how the rider
will be determined. Each year the electric public utility must file
information to allow the commission to determine the amount of the
rider. The acquisition costs will be levelized over the length of the
rider. That means usually the acquisition costs would be greater in the
early years and less over the time of the rider. This allows that these
costs will be levelized over that period of time. Subsection C provides
the information that a utility must provide to the commission in setting
the rider each year, and subsection D provides that the rider will
expire at the end of the useful life of the acquisition assets. As you
can see in a summary in a footnote, it provides the useful life of each
of the assets, and that ranges from basically 20 years to 31 years. So
the rider will exist for approximately 31 years. So that&#39;s the cost
recovery for the public utility that purchases these assets. The
remainder of the bill, section 2 through section 8, provides changes to
chapter 115 B of the general statutes. And that chapter provides the
statutory framework for the cities to form joint agencies, also known as
MPAs, to purchase the assets. So section 2 changes the purposes of that
chapter just to reflect that the purpose of this chapter&#39;s also to
allow the sale of the duration assets. Section 3 amends the duties of
the joint agencies to allow that they can use their revenues from the
sale of electric power to pay for the new bonds that will be issued.
Section 4 gets into language that allows for support contracts. So
support contracts gets to Senator Tillman&#39;s questions, and the the
support contracts are actually the contracts that are gonna allow the
bonds to be repaid. Each city will agree to make payments under the
support contracts to pay a proportionate share of the bonds, also to
finance any collateral posting requirements of any power purchase
agreements, and also to finance any required reserves of this proposed
sale of the assets. As Senator Newton noted, on page 7 lines 49-50,
should any city default, the other cities in the deal agree to pay for
that city&#39;s portion. The support contracts can last for a period of
up to 30 years. And if you look on page 8 lines 9-11, the payments under
the support contracts are considered an operating cost of the enterprise
systems, and will be used to pay first the debt. The payments under this
contract, just like any other contract of the joint municipal power
agencies, can only be used, the revenues from the electric system must
be used to pay for the support contract. There&#39;s also new language
on page 8, lines 43-49 that reinforce that the oversight of the LGC is
still in effect, and should anything happen, the LGC can take over
financial oversight over these cities and make sure the debt is repaid.
Section 5 is the bonding authority. This is the specific language that
gives the specific authority for the new bonds. If you look on page 9,
lines 35-37, page 9, lines 34-37, these are the new bonds that can be
issued. The only bonds that can be issued are to one, pay the difference
between the price paid for the assets and the amount remaining on the
current debt, and two, for the purpose of financing any collateral
posting requirements that may be required of the replacement power
supply arrangement that will be necessary. Now that the municipal power
agencies are selling their assets, they will now purchase additional
power from Duke to serve their retail customers. Lines 37-43 of that
same page provide the revenues that can be pledged to pay those bonds,
and those include the revenues from the sale of the project, the
revenues from the sale of their power and their retail systems, and also

  The support contracts that I mentioned earlier and the amounts the
cities pay to the municipal power agencies to pay back those bonds.
Sections 6, 7 and 8 are very similar and they make conforming changes to
other sections in Chapter 159 to just make it clear that they payments
made on behalf of the cities to the power agencies can be used to pay
these new bonds as well as the existing bonds that they already have.
And finally the act becomes effective when it becomes law. I’m happy to
answer any questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Heather. At this time,
I am going to open it up for either staff or the esteemed Senators for
any questions or comments. Senator McKissick. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I
have several questions. Perhaps Heather, you can help me out with some
of these, okay? It’s my understanding that under this particular bill,
what we will observe is rate decreases for individuals, after several
years. But initially what you’ll see is rate decreases for I guess
commercial and industrial users but a small rider on residential costs
for about 25 cents a month or a little less than that. That gets paid
out over about a three to four year period. Is that correct, first?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Probably, I would say that is correct. When you’re,
the conversation you’re having now is about the Duke Progress customers.
That won’t apply to the NCEMPA customers. Now the NCEMPA customers, the
customers of the cities in the NCEMPA area, should see an immediate
decline in their rates, all of them across the board, at the beginning.
The projected impact of this purchase by Duke does show that for the
first several years there will be a small impact on retail customers and
what I have seen is that’ll be less than a quarter a month, for the
residential customers, and for commercial and industrials depending on
the size of the customers, they may have a small impact as well. But
when you get to the later years, 2020, year 5-6 and beyond, all
customers should have a decrease if their projected savings from the
fuel savings are correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Mr. Chair. Thank
you for sharing that information, because that clarifies it. So that’s
really the Duke Progress people that will be paying that 22 cents a
month. In terms of those in Electro Cities, those customers, what is the
projected saving they will see, in terms of estimated projected decrease
in the amount that they’re currently paying? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We have
some representatives from Electro Cities. They may be able to give you
percentages. However they can’t give at this point the exact details the
way Duke can for the exact cost, because of the way the right structures
are. Basically, the individual cities set their own rates, but that’s
based on power they purchase from the power agency which is also
purchased from Duke. And those rates have not been set yet because those
rates of the new wholesale purchases from Duke will be set based on a
formula that is common for other wholesale purchases. I believe the
amount we’ve heard is somewhere between 10 and 15 percent reduction, is
the expected reduction in the rates. I will say that although there is
not a way for the cities to at this point say the exact amount of the
decrease, there was legislation enacted approximately three years ago,
and I believe Senator Newton was also, maybe Senator Bryant was also
sponsors of that legislation. And for the cities, especially the NCEMPA
cities, statutorily they can only use their funds derived from the
electric system for certain things. And those things are paying for the
cost of the system, a small rate of return, and making debt payments. So
if they don’t take the savings from this deal and put it towards
reducing rates, what will happen is just their enterprise fund will just
get bigger and you will be able to see that. So they are effectively
statutorily forced to lower their rates, because they have nothing else
they can do with these revenues, other than lower the rates. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up, Mr. Chair, if I could. And that leads me to two
additional questions. It’s my understanding the cities continue to own
the distribution systems for electricity and they would be responsible
in the future for maintenance as well as for expansion. Now in the
models that have been created and the projections that have been done,
are there sufficient funds that will be reserved so that in the future
they can picture what I would call are anticipated demands, you know in
the future? Granted you know, they’re going to be buying the power
wholesale from Duke Progress but the infrastructure that it’s
distributed through is a different issue so I mean, do we, is that built
into the model? Or is there somebody here from Electro Cities or
Progress that could help me with that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It wouldn’t be
built into the Progress model because they wouldn’t deal with that.
Electro cities may be able to address that. They will have to go through
the LGC and have the LGC make a determination, a final determination
that they are sufficiently economically suited to make this deal. So you
know as far as that, that’s all I can say on that unless you want to ask
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I can, Senator McKissick

  <p id="20:00">
  We’ve got Graham Edwards from the Electrocities of North Carolina here.
Mr. Graham, if you’d come to the mic, introduce yourself and see if you
can help us here. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Sure, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much. I’m Graham Edwards.
I’m the CEO at Electrocities and the Eastern Power Agency. To answer
your question directly this transaction only impacts the generating
assets. The distribution assets, the customer service that the cities
provide to their consumers right now, all that stays intact. Their
infrastructure stays there. They will continue to improve the
infrastructure as they go forward but they will do that anyway whether
this transaction goes through or not, so from my perspective we’re
dealing with just the generating assets and not the distribution or the
customer service or what the cities are providing on their side of the
service. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Quick follow up if I could? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. Oh, Senator Newton. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If I could add something
to that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Keep in mind that all
of the cities, that they’re operating and they’re led by their city
councils who are of course elected by the voters, so I mean, I know
there’s one mayor of one of the towns here and they hear from these rate
payers regularly about not just their bill but the quality of their
service. So they’ve been operating in that way for I don’t know how many
decades. This has been going on many decades that they’ve been operating
that way and they’ll have to continue to operate the same as they always
have with these, the distribution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Got the. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up there for the gentleman
at the podium. So what you’re saying is that this bill only deals with
generating capacity. It would not deal with any of the infrastructure
and distribution systems that you are responsible for continuing to
maintain. Do you feel as if you have adequate reserves and resources for
those expansions based upon the model we are working under right now
cause obviously it looks like there are going to be rate decreases. I
heard that the projected rate decrease was 10-15%. Is that accurate and
if that is passed onto customers do you continue to have funds available
for future expansion to guarantee that the needs and demands are met?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir, the short answer is yes and let me expand a
little if I may. The individual members, the 32 towns and cities and
communities, they currently as Senator Newton said they design their own
rates. The way they design those rates is they take the whole fuel power
cost from the Eastern Power Agency and then they add their distribution
cost to it, so they will continue to do that, it’s just that the
wholesale power cost that they’ll be receiving from us will be
significantly lower than it is today. Going back to your other question,
each community is different. We have had communities that have grown
over the last 15 to 20 years. We have had communities that have lost
customers, lost load over the last 15 to 20 years. The customer mix
matters, how much industrial customers they have. They have customers
that use energy around the clock, so all those come in to say that I
can’t give you a specific right now on each community, but what we can
say is that we feel like that the book ends if you will is that the
communities that have grown faster such as those around the Raleigh area
primarily whether it be Apex or some of those, the will see in the 5 or
slightly less than 5% impact whereas some of the other ones that Senator
Newton and Senator Bryant mentioned, they can be upwards of 20%
reduction. So, and they’ll be some all in between there, but it’s gonna
depend on the individual community and how their current system is
constructed. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Senator Bryant. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
wanted to also add to Senator McKissick that Electrocities is a full
service entity for the cities and there are, there’s a rate committee.
They’ve already been studying this. They look at the rates collectively
but also they get support around looking at their differential impacts
because many of these cities have different capacities. To address these
details and for every locality there are some different impacts. Some
groupings have more in common than others. They’ve been studying those,
that, for over a year I’m sure and continue now that this is more
eminent to look at it and the biggest thing in this bill is the
requirement, the LGC review and the fact that they are required to
maintain a revenue structure that will allow for the repayment of this
debt which will include operating their facilities because that’s how
they will repay debt if you follow my point. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So I think in terms of this bill we’ve provided a
stronger safety net than would otherwise have been there. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] And I’d like to thank both Senator Newton and Senator Bryant
for bringing the bill forward and certainly for the foresight and
studying of the issues that

Chairman, I know there&#39;s probably others that want to say something
and are just dying to say something and it&#39;s okay with me, but I
want to move a favorable report. I don&#39;t know anybody I&#39;ve
talked to that doesn&#39;t like this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hold that. Thank you, sir. Anybody else, my distinguished colleagues,
that would like to speak or have a question or comment? Senator McInnis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just want to say that I have one city that&#39;s involved -- the city of
Laurinburg, North Carolina -- and they are very, very excited to see
this legislation coming forward and hope that it moves forward quickly
so they can give some relief to their folks that they&#39;re selling
power to. So, they&#39;re very, very appreciative for this legislation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator Smith?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just wanted to make a point that from an economic development
standpoint this is wonderful for eastern North Carolina because it has
been really a problem recruiting companies when they&#39;re looking at
such a high utility rate that other places don&#39;t have. So, this will
make a big difference in economic development recruitment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
See no others. I would like to ask Mr. Edwards, do you need any
additional comments? I know that you traveled far to be here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, thank you. I&#39;ll do just a comment, if I may. Just very
short. Members of the committee, thank you all very much for allowing us
to be here, but also thank you for your consideration. Senators that
sponsored and co-sponsored the legislation that was introduced yesterday
both in the Senate and the House were excited about it. I know I&#39;ve
personally been with ElectriCities for almost six years now and this is
something we&#39;ve been working on ever since I got there. I know that
Senators Newton and Bryant, they have been thinking about this for many,
many years as well as others have. So, I just wanted to say thank you
very much. Thank you for the introduction of the bill. I also want to
say thank you to Duke Progress, because the Duke Progress people have
really come to the table with us. It was a tough negotiation and I think
we settled on where both parties are satisfied. Neither party got what
they wanted completely, but, also, we got enough to where the deal makes
sense for everybody, not just for Duke Progress but for our customers
and our members, but also for the state of North Carolina. Let&#39;s
pitch from an economic development perspective. Thank you very much and
we hope to see this bill go through pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Edwards. Does anybody--? Yes, Senator Bryant.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We just want to recognize that Mayor Bruce Rose is here from Wilson,
North Carolina and we just want to recognize him in support of it. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Very good. Is anybody else in the audience who is just itching and
burning to speak?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
See none. Senator Tillman has moved for a favorable report with a serial
referral to finance. All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.

Opposed no. Ayes have it. There will be no other business. We are
