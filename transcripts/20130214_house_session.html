Speaker: The house will come to order. Members, please take your seats.
Members, p[lease retire from the chamber. Sargeant in arms, please
secure the doors. Members and visitors, please silence all cellular
phones and electronic devices.  The prayer will be offered by
Representative Davel. Members and visitors please stand and remain
standing for the pledge of allegiance.
Representative: Happy Valentines Day friends. I would like to read from
1st Corinthians 13. Though I speak with the tongues of men or of angels,
but do not have charity, I am become a sounding grass or a tinkling
cymbal. Though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries
and all knowledge, and though I have all faith so that I could move
mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. Though I bestow all ,my
goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have
not charity, it profit me nothing. Charity suffers long and is kind.
Charity envies not, charity vaunts not itself, it is not puffed up. It
does not behave itself unseemly, it seeks not its own, it is not easily
provoked, it thinks no evil, it rejoices not in inequity, but rejoices
with the truth. It bears all things and believes all things, hopes and
endures all things. Charity never fails. Please join me in prayer.
Father, we thank you for this day you have given us. Every day is a gift
from you. This valentine’s day, when we think a lot about love,
understand that we love because you first love d us, and, if we love
just you, understand that we will keep all commandments, not just the
ones we find agreeable or easy, but all of them. we are to love you with
all our hear, mind, body and soul, and our neighbor as ourself. We come
before you this day in prayer for our president, all those in federal
office, service for our governor, those of us privileged to be in this
body, servants of yours and government, the senate, other officers in
government, and all those down to the local magistrates, city councils
and commissioners. We pray for wisdom. We pray for discernment. We pray
for a spirit of love. In christ’s name we pray. Amen

…going to be. There may be some issues with the voting system today. If
an issue occurs we’ll figure out how to get the votes done but I’ll look
to the Clerk to let me know whether or not it’s anything that I need to
act on. House Bill 82, the Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Committee substitute for House Bill 82, a bill to be entitled, “An Act
to Update the Reference to the Internal Revenue Code and to Decouple
from Certain Provisions of the Federal American Taxpayer Relief Act of
2012.” General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Before I recognize Representative Howard to debate the bill, ladies and
gentlemen of the House, we are going to try and just keep…Yesterday I
announced that we would have 30 minutes of debate on Senate Bill 4. We
will. But instead of taking a vote at around 1:30 it will be taken in
turn. Representative Howard is recognized to debate House Bill 82.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and Members of the House. This is the Internal
Revenue Code update of the bill that you see every year. Each year the
General Assembly must decide whether to conform to the Federal tax law
changes and usually this is done in the year following those changes.
But this year the Fiscal-cliff legislation was enacted on January 2,
2013.
In the past North Carolina has only decoupled from the very costly bonus
depreciation and section 179 which is the expensing provisions. This
year the objective was to minimize the General Fund impact as much as
possible while at the same time minimizing the complexity for taxpayers
and for the Department of Revenue.
With that in mind, if you have with you today or can locate the summary
of the bill, on page four you will see an outline of all of the various
provisions and the ones that we decoupled from, meaning for those of us
who are new to the House, that means we are not conforming to what the
Federal law has imposed. Where it says that we are coupling, meaning
that we are conforming. So there’s a list of those and I believe those
will be on your screen.
The bill conforms to all of the provisions that were retroactive to the
2012 tax year with the exception of the 179 provision because we
recognize that we are almost in the middle of tax filing season and the
provisions that would require taxpayers to refer to old, prior, obsolete
versions of the Code or keep two separate books for their accounting
purposes if we decoupled because it would be very complicated.
The bill decouples from several provisions to minimize the fiscal impact
on our state budget. The bonus depreciation, the section 179, the
expensing for both 2012 and 2013, the qualified tuition and expense
deductions, the mortgage interest premium as interest deduction, the
income exclusion for the discharge of residents’ indebtedness and the
income exclusion for IRA distributions to charities by a person who has
attained the age of 70-and-a-half years.
The bill also modifies three current North Carolina tax credits by
reducing the credit percentage for the tax year 2013 because those
credits piggyback against the Federal credits that were enhanced by
Federal legislation. By reducing the percentage of those credits the
impact on the budget is revenue neutral.
Those three tax credits will expire next year regardless of what we
would do. Those three credits are the old income tax reducing the
percentage from five percent of the Federal tax credit to 4.5…</p>

<p id="015:00">
The OTC from 6% to 3% and the adoption credit from 50% to 30%. By
decoupling and modifying these provisions, we reduce the impact on
general fund from $219 million to $13 million in the year 13-14. And
with that Mr. Speaker I will be glad to answer any questions.
[Speaker Changes] Ladies and gentlemen on the floor. We continue the
debate here and the chair would like to extend the courtesies of the
gallery to a group of elementary school students from Holtrain web
elementary school Concord . Thank you for coming here today and thanks
to the teachers and Chaprons who come with you. Welcome. Rep Luebke
please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] Sent forth an amendment
[Speaker Changes]The gentlemen is recognized to send forth an amendment
The clerk will read
[Speaker Changes] Rep Luebke moves to amend the bill on page 1 lines 2
to 4 by rewriting the lines to read
[Speaker Changes] The gentlemen is recognized to debate the amendment
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members of the house, if you
have your bills with you either hard copy or in screen I would urge you
I request you to turn to Page4 Line 19. Because this is the issue that
concerns me is the failure to move forward on the earned income tax
credit for our state tax payers. As the bill is written, the state EITC,
Earned Income tax credit  will expire in 2014. My amendment moves it
forward makes a statement that we will continue to state our earned
income tax credit till 2019. Now what is EITC? Some know but some do
not. The EITC is something that first of all listen carefully was
heralded  was  advocated for by President Ronald Reagan. Please listen
on the other side of the aisle there. Why? Because the EITC rewards
what. It allows two things going on. Number 1 it allows employers who
cannot small employers business employers who cannot afford to pay
living wage to the employees. It allows them to hire that person at say
$10 $11 an hour when the person needs really to have a living wage and
the person can after filing federal tax return get a tax credit which in
effect increases the person’s the family’s income. So that’s good for
business because they get to hire folks . It’s also the humane thing to
do for these low income employees. It is set up as a tax credit for the
working low income or moderate income families of the country. What we
did in the general assembly in 2007 was to implement a 5% credit, which
means if you add earned income tax credit of $100 from federal fund we
would from out department of revenue from our general fund  send you $5.
I do not disagree with what Rep Howard has recommended in terms of
reducing it to $4 and 50 cents. There is kind of a technical reason on
why it is and there is not a problem with that. But if there is a
problem with the fact that we do not make a statement to the working
people of the state that we support their hard work and we want them to
continue to  have their credit. And I way members from my perspective
that the vote we took to cut unemployment benefits as much as we did was
an unfortunate vote what we took yesterday not to accept the medic aid
dollars, was an unfortunate vote. Here is a chance that’s still
positive. Here is a chance  to do something for the working families by
voting yes on this amendment and I urge the adoption of the amendment.
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker Changes]  Rep Howard, Please your purpose
[Speaker Changes] To debate the amendment
[Speaker Changes] Lady is recognized to debate the amendment
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker and Dr Luebke. Thank you.
Members of this house. We had this woman in finance and it was sourly
defeated. If I could tell you a few things, this provision is already to
sun set at the end of this year. It was supposed to sun set at the end
of last year. But because of the tax modernization the provision was
extended one year further. The checks the amount of checks.</p>

214:
Speaker1: This is not a credit, this is a refund, re-writing checks in
tax amounting to a 110 million dollars. Now I mentioned in the committee
and I mention it again with more evidence there is a lot of fraud in
this program. In this document comes from the Department of Revenue;
I’ll give you an example how pieces of foul play into this. This is one
example; many married couples pledge that they have children and both
file as heads of households. So that means that the IS system and the
Internal Revenue, I’m sorry the North Carolina Department of Revenue,
they have to scrutinize each one of these xxx and they don’t have the
manpower , they just sample, randomly sample and the fraud is estimated
to be between  23 and 28 percent of all ERTC claims that were paid xxx.
I would ask you to vote no on this amendment.
Speaker changes: Representative Holley please state your purpose.
Speaker changes: To speak on the amendment.
Speaker changes: The lady is recognized to explain the amendment.
Speaker changes: First of all I want to repeat what Representative
Luebke said; this is a tax credit for poor families and people making
most of the time making minimum wage, which we have already determined
is not a living wage. It is a tax credit. We give Tax credits to anybody
who just about ask for it, but this is one for poor people. The other
thing is I think we think we need to be very careful when we throw
around the word fraud. And we start talking about 23, 28 percent of
anything being fraud, because it has not been substantiated, it is not
proven and we need to be careful and these are poor people who are at
the mercy of us right now. To try to get a little bit of wage rather
would earn income tax credit. Thank you.
Speaker changes: Motion.
Speaker changes: The gentleman has arisen for motion.
Speaker changes: Mr. Speaker, I think we will remove this bill from
today’s calendar and re-calendar it for Tuesday February 19.
Speaker changes: Without objection, so ordered. House bill 10, the clerk
will read.
Speaker changes:  House bill 10, the bill has been drawn to remove the
restriction on the xx party’s selection of a cadre vocation for the
South-Eastern extension project of North Carolina 540; Representatives
of North Carolina in act.
Speaker changes: Representative Dollar please state your purpose.
Speaker changes: To speak on the bill.
Speaker changes: Gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
Speaker changes: Thank you Mr. Speaker, members of the House, I
appreciate the vote yesterday, and hopefully will have just a stronger
vote today. I would call your attention to a piece of paper that
Representative  Stam  had placed on your desk ; we went back because of
questions on both sides of the aisle with respect to the cost ,
additional cost on the environmental impact, stating that additional
cost xx central staff is one million dollars. Now it is basically simply
said a million dollar project. We have 18.8 miles of this project bills,
cost of a billion dollars. We have got the next 12 plus miles to go, we
have got a tremendous investment, this is the largest North Carolina
sponsored road project in the history of our state. It makes no sense
not to complete it. We want to clarify something because a question was
asked yesterday. This environmental impact paper is done on every
project they do, so that is always a requirement there. Our problem is f
the Federal Government who has to be involved in the financing of this
we will not participate unless all of the routes that were originally
identified by the North Carolina Department of Transportation are
included in the environmental study. And that is standard procedure , so
we do this and again I think as we mentioned before I think the
commitment on behalf of everyone in this chamber and in the other body
is that if for some bizarre reason that I can’t..</p>

Representative: …fathom at this time the red route would come back as
the only route. We would nto build it based on feasibility and based on
actions that we would take in this eneral assembly to prevent that. I
will be happy to answer any question and would appreciate your support.
Spekaer: Representative Terry, please state your purpose. Representative
Jackson, please state your purpose.
Representative: To speak on the bill. Mr. Speaker, I will be quick. I
reentering my position form yesterday of voting red on red. I did want
to point out a couple of things to you because there has been a lot of
talk about this environment study, and how it is going to turn out and
if it turns out to be red, then we are not going to fund it. We already
know that the army core of engineers have looked at the orange core
route and they have already made a preliminary determination that the
red route would be less damaging to the environment. The orange route
goes through some sensitive wetlands and comes across a dwarf wedge
muscle. So, I think it is already clear. If we study the orange and red
route, which one the federal government and the environmental
protection and core of engineers are going to come back and tell us –
they are going to tell us that we have to build a red route, and that
will be a waste of $15 million and a waste of four years for the town of
Garner. I ask that you vote against it.
Speaker: Representative Bill Riley, please state your purpose.
Representative: To debate the bill.
Speaker: The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker. With all do respect to my
colleague from Wade county, he has misstated the way the endangered
species act would work. You do have to come up with whatever the impacts
would be, but that is not the determining factor of the road, it has to
be adequately documented. As you are aware, several projects in
McClemburg County have been delayed by lawsuits. The lawsuits did nto
say that the damage would prevent the road. In fact the attorneys, with
the southern environmental law center, have said that regardless of the
damage, they cannot stop the project. What they can require is full
disclosure of the risk so that the people can make an informed decision.
If it comes back that it is less environmentally damaging to build the
red route rather than the orange route, that does not mean that we have
to build the red route. It simply means we have to disclose the
potential for environmental damage with the orange route. I believe it
was stated earlier that the actual cost of the study was $1 million, not
$15. This is a good bill. I still support, and would ask you to do so
also.
Speaker: Further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question before
the house is the passage of house bill 10 on its third reading. All in
favor will vote aye, all opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the
vote. The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote: 87 having
voted in the affirmative, 39 in the negative. House bill 10 has passed
its third reading and will be sent to the senate. House bill 24, the
clerk will read.
Clerk: House bill 24, a bill entitled an act to provide for the district
attorney to be notified if a person on supervised or unsupervised
probation is discharged from a domestic violence abuse treatment program
to comply program, or its rules, and to make other changes to the
reporting of domestic violence. NC general assembly enacts.
Speaker: Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
Representative: To debate the bill.
Speaker: The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker, members of the house. House bill
24 received a very good vote yesterday. We explained it had to do with
improving the notification requirements when an offender fails to
complete the domestic violence treatment as court ordered. I have
reviewed an amendemnt proposed by Senator Vaskerville. I think the
amendment is fine. I would encourage members to vote for the amendment
and bill. Thank you.
Speaker: Representative Vaskerville, please state your purpose.
Representative: To send forth an amendment.
Speaker: The gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment. The
clerk will read.
Clerk: Representative Vaskerville moves to amend the bill on page 1,
line 27, by rewriting the line to read
Speaker: The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker. The amendment is fairly simple.
It just puts a little teeth in the bill. It requires the probation
officer not only to notify the district attorney, but to file a
violation report with the court. That way, it insures that the judge is
going to know that the person has not completed the treatment as
supposed to. Then the judge can decide what the appropriate course of
action is. I ask that you all support the amendment.
Speaker: Further discussion or debate? If not, the question before the
house is the amendment sent forth by Senator Vaskerville fro the house
committee substitute for house bill 24. All in favor will vote aye, all
opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the vote.</p>

Representative Moore, does the gentleman yield? The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, I’m sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ll yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. I’d just like to ask, I don’t see it in the bill, would the
person’s victims also be notified normally? Was that something we might
need to add to this or would that be a concern at all? Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It wouldn’t be a necessary provision of this bill. The victim is only
brought in if necessary to testify or if there’s something concerning
the victim. An example of where you would see it, for example, a
criminal victim being  notified of a violation might be if say the
defendant was ordered to pay restitution and that was relieved sometimes
the victim is supposed to be notified in that kind of case.
This is a compliance issue for the classes so they wouldn’t necessarily
have to notify the victim. They could if they wanted to but this is just
part of the judgment side.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate. If not, the question before the
House is the passage of the House Committee Substitute for House Bill 24
as amended on its third reading. All those in favor will vote, “Aye.”
All opposed vote, “No.” The Clerk will open the vote.

House Bill 24 as amended has passed its third reading. It will be
engrossed and sent to the Senate. Senate Bill 4, the Clerk will read.

House Committee substitute for Senate Bill 4, a bill that’s been
entitled, “An Act to Declare the State’s Intent Not to Operate State-Run

what seems to be a conservative attack on the unemployed, the uninsured,
and now even the poor as we look at these bills on unemployment,
Medicaid and earned income tax credit.
So we really have to ask that question, “Are we letting politics get in
the way of helping our citizens?” Are we letting politics keep us from
expanding healthcare coverage to the 500,000 North Carolinians who would
receive help were we not to enact this bill? Are we letting politics get
in the way of providing 25,000 jobs to our citizens? Expanding Medicaid
could result in those 25,000 jobs.
Yesterday I took the time to read off to you those different areas that
those jobs would be created in. But maybe the most important thing is
that those jobs would be created in your communities. Those jobs and
training that come from them would be in your communities.
We know that without this added support rural hospitals across the state
will be put in jeopardy. We know this as we vote on this bill. Again, I
remind you, those hospitals are in your communities. This is the first
legislature we’ve had in the history of North Carolina where the
majority of the members are from metropolitan areas versus…</p>

<p id="035:00">
[SPEAKER] Rural areas. And if we looked at what we've done it seems that
the rural poor now are being left out of our considerations. And again,
I ask you are we letting politics get in the way of expanding this
health care coverage for these North Carolinians who desperately need
it?  Why would we deny this added support for these hospitals in these
rural areas? Why would we knowingly do that?
Why would we let politics keep us from doing the right thing by our
citizens in our districts? It’s important to think about the
consequences of these actions in Raleigh. And as I said, we don’t want
to make decisions to hurt people in our communities. But for some
reason, I’m saying it’s politics maybe there’s some other reason, we are
doing it as a body. You as the majority are doing it by choice. It is
your choice. You have the power. You have the numbers, overwhelming
numbers as some of you would say, and you have the right to make the
decision.
But what you do here in Raleigh does matter to the citizens in your
district. As a result of what we’re doing, North Carolina will lose more
than a billion dollars a year in uncompensated care to these individuals
who are in your communities.  These hospitals which would be forced in
many instances to shut down as you heard are in your communities.
As I said before, luckily I’m in a community that has several hospitals.
Those members from metropolitan areas, several options. That’s where all
the doctors and medical professionals will be going. In your communities
many of you will lose your hospital and lose your access to medical care
for your hardworking tax paying citizens.
And these cards will be transferred to those hard working tax paying
citizens in your districts. So again, I ask are you letting politics get
in the way of making the right decision to provide this care for 500,000
North Carolinians and to provide these jobs that will help them and help
our state? Is this politics or is this good public policy?
These higher premiums that will result from this failure will go on the
backs and go on the policies of those tax payers in your communities who
can least afford it.  But because we deny this, it will cost those hard
working tax payers in your communities more.  And they have to have that
health care coverage. Is this politics or is this good public policy?
North Carolina will cover many more citizens than spend all their per
capita than usual by expanding Medicaid.  Without this bill if we
insured those additional 500,000 North Carolinians under this Medicare
provision and we created those jobs, those 25,000 jobs in your district
and in mind, North Carolina would be providing more coverage and better
coverage and delivering better service.
You know, the Medicaid System in North Carolina has been studied and
evaluated nationally. And it is one of the best delivery systems in the
nation. There’s been a lot of talk about a recent audit that said there
was some inefficiencies in Medicaid administration. And today in the
meeting the HHS director said that all of the issues mentioned in that
report, the HHS Director who was recently hired and looked at that
report said, that those discrepancies would be completed and cleared up
by June 30th of this year.
Once again, all those who would parade any discrepancies as a reason not
to do this, the newly hired Director said that systems inequities or
inefficiencies would be completed and corrected by June 30th. Again, is
this politics or is this good policy for the citizens in your district?
Finally, if you’ll look on your desk, you’ll see a handout for
Representative Insko. It’s titled “North Carolina County Level Estimates
of Non-elderly Uninsured.” And I direct your attention to the middle
column, adults 19 to 64 as an indicator of folks who will not be able to
access health care in your counties. And you can look down and see your
county listed. And you’ll see the percentages of people in your counties
who you are denying the opportunity to get this health care coverage.
So again, I ask you is it politics? Is it good policy? Are you really
telling us that the people at home in your districts have said they
don’t want to have good healthcare. They don’t want to have access.</p>

<p id="040:00">
They dont wanna have jobs. I really wonder. Job after job lost in North
Carolina due to the recent recession. No jobs bill, we haven't created
one yet. And this is the opportunity. Expanded health care coverage for
the citizens we claim to represent and we take the oath to the flag and
we try to do a liberty and justice for all. When it comes times to say
justice for all means have some degree of healthcare. We decide well we
don't really mean justice for all if it means health care and an
opportunity and employment. We just mean justice for all if we're in
Rally and we're making a decision. Again i ask you is it policy or is
this politics? Politics is hurting the tax payers of North Carolina. I'd
ask you to reconsider your vote, again the questions of inefficiencies
has been taken away by June 1st it should be in play. And finally this
idea of giving up our authority to Washington instead of having our
state insurance commissioners continue to monitor and help folks who do
have policies and do have complaints. If we do not empower him or
confirm the authority he has now, we will lose that opportunity after
March 1st. You cant go back and un-ring that bell. Those folks who favor
local control who believe local Carolinians should be able to call their
insurance commissioners and get help with problems on coverage and their
policies should want to amend this bill and allow our insurance
commissioners to continue to do that. The idea of a North Carolinian
having a problem with their policy and now having to call 1 800
Washington for help seems to go against everything you've argued for.
And so again I'd ask, is this good policy or is this politics getting in
the way of helping the tax payer citizens of North Carolina.  I'd ask
that you vote against this bill, that you come back with something that
addresses these issues as I know you can and I know you have the
authority to do.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen of the house,
Representative Halls debate consumed 9 minutes of the 20 minutes
allotment. Representative Cunningham please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] mr speaker i rise to speak to the bill [SPEAKER CHANGES] the
lady is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] thank you.
today i come to you feeled with compassion. I have served in my
community as a healthcare professional for 33 years. Currently my
specialty area is in hospice and paraletive care. I have held dying
toddlers in my arms. Struggling to breath in the Halofax county, one of
the poorest county in the state of North Carolina. While waiting for air
transport to Nash Regional Hospital. I have held the hands of dying
people. And wiped the tears from loved ones eyes, because the diagnosis
came too late. And while doing all of this it never crossed my mind,
whether they are a republican or a democrat. In my heart i am committed
to provide the best care to anyone, no matter where they come from or
what their walk of life may be. This is the charge on my heart. Even
though you may not be my friend or you may disagree with my views on
this bill. If you needed my help in this chamber today. I will not
hesitate to assist you. Today I am my own conscience. I must speak to
those individual voices that are not here to be heard in this chamber. I
appeal to you to reconsider the estimated 2840 people that will die this
year according to the new england medical journal in the state of north
carolina. Due to the lack of health care coverage. And 2000 and 14000
uninsured children in this state. I close by saying to all of you I am
committed to paying down the debt but in this moment I am committed to
assisting people in our great state to live healthier lives, suffer
less...</p>

pain and the choice of dying with dignity. Thank you. Please reconsider
your decision on this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Pierce,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill, Mr.
Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the
bill [SPEAKER CHANGES] There was a time, Mr. Speaker, in this chamber,
that I was offended by the term Obamacare, but then I realized that that
was a good term because Obama cares. Medicaid was designed as a safety
net to take care of those who struggle in poverty. As we have weathered
the recessions over the past few years, more and more working families
have found themselves living in poverty. Twenty-five percent of the
state's children live in poverty. Almost ten percent of the senior
citizens in the great state of North Carolina live in poverty. And
forty-four percent of the state's single mothers live in poverty.
Expanding Medicaid would help those individuals to receive quality
affordable health care. It is important to note the decision to reject
Medicaid expansion disproportionately affects minority communities,
Afro-Americans, American Indians, and Latinos, all who are far more
likely to live in poverty. As a result, many of them do not have
healthcare. They do not receive quality care and treatment, impacting
the quality of life and life expectancy. This is an opportunity to
expand coverage for five hundred thousand in the great state of North
Carolina. The impact will also be felt in rural communities which I
represent, Scotland, Hoke, and Robeson, and other rural areas. Many of
them are dealing with poverty rates of twenty percent or higher. By
expanding Medicaid, we have the opportunity to lift up rural North
Carolina, support minority communities, both which would lead to a
stronger state and a stronger economy. I would urge my colleagues to
vote no. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen of the house, at this
time, the minority caucus has consumed twelve and a half minutes of
their twenty minute allotment. Representative Blust, state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Speaker and members of the house. This really isn't that easy of a
decision. Once again, this body's been cast in a difficult situation
because of just the makeup of the healthcare law and the makeup of our
politics today. You're left, again, are you going to drink cyanide, or
are you going to drink arsenic? Either you have to take this money and
take the very big risk that everything isn't going to be paid for in the
future, or you can turn the money down and hear some of the stories that
you've shared with us on that end. But I think you're discounting on
your side, those opposing this bill are discounting the incredible
threat of our debt situation in this country. Representative Collins
explained yesterday, this isn't a matter of us sending our dollars to
Washington, and then we're not going to get what we've sent into
Washington back. There are no dollars in Washington. One hundred percent
of the money to fund this additional coverage is going to be borrowed.
And I want someone to come over afterward. I won't take the time. But
explain to me how this is working because I've tried to search for it,
how this works. You've got the federal Treasury borrowing a trillion
dollars a year, but they're not selling the bonds on the market. Most of
them, ninety percent in the last year, have been bought by our own
Federal Reserve. How does that work? How long can that work? Where does
the Federal Reserve get those dollars? It creates those dollars. How
long is this going to be able to last? Someone come, get a professor,
and come explain this to me. And what's going to happen to those rural
communities? What's going to happen to those people you purport to care
for when this federal debt bubble bursts and all sorts of bad things
happen? So, I don't know. There may be some jobs out of. I would point
out that, in 2009, we got 2.5 extra billion to unemployment insurance
that we borrowed came into this state, and I didn't see an economic
boom. So, I discount somewhat the projections of the jobs. I don't know
where the doctors are going to come from. I've handed out an article.
California, elsewhere, you're going to lose a lot of, there are people
saying, &quot;I can't deal with this complex system any more. I'm
getting out. And you can't create new doctors overnight. But I just say
I think our dilemma is somewhat described by the old poem that starts
out, &quot;'Will you walk into my parlor?' said the spider to the fly.
'It's the prettiest little parlor that you ever did spy.'&quot; And the
Federal government's saying, &quot;Hey.&quot;</p>

…here expand your Medicaid. We’ll pay for it. It’s free money and you
think you’re going to go into it and it’s not going to change. Let me
just read from another article I handed out. Last summer a bipartisan
state budget crisis task force shared by former New York Lieutenant
Governor Richard Ravitch and former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker warned the states not to go along with the Obamacare Medicaid
expansion. Every deficit reduction plan being discussed in Washington DC
includes abandoning that nine to one match soon, the task force warned.
States that expand Medicaid to comply with the Obama healthcare law will
be plunged into a fiscal disaster. So we have to take that into account
whether we can actually go forward with this and it’s a sober reflection
to say we’re not. I believe that we should wisely consider this and vote
the way we did yesterday and pass this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman of the house, Representative Blust’s
comments consumed four minutes of the ten minute allotment.
Representative Earle please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Lady’s recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and members. I’ll be very brief
so as not to take up too much of your time. I want to go over a few
things I said yesterday. First of all the unemployment bill and not
expanding Medicaid drastically impact our economy and our most
vulnerable citizens. As I said yesterday, we need to consider the
economic impact that this is going to have. In two weeks you have put
folk on the street, you have taken away their safety net and you denied
low income people healthcare. You do not want to even take the three
years for that we get the service for free.  Now I use that word because
it is free and it’s better to have healthcare for three years than not
to have it at all. It’s free because it’s our tax dollars and somebody
else is going to use them if we don’t use them. We sided and we heard
all kinds of reasons why we shouldn’t and if you don’t want to accept
the federal dollars for this just like Representative Lucas said, why
don’t we send back the federal money that we get for education or for
roads or for the many other reasons that we get federal money? Then we
should send that back also. I just want to say too that there are some
republican governors that have a different attitude about this and right
here I’ve got comments from three republican governors from North
Dakota, from Michigan and from Ohio. The governor from Ohio has said
that taking the money will help the vulnerable citizens in that state.
It will free up funds for mental health, other critical issues also it
would prevent increases in the healthcare premiums and it will help the
local hospitals. Let me quote something that he said that additionally,
“It avoids leaving Ohioans federal tax dollars on the table and keeps
the federal government from simply giving them away to other states.”
Good point. Ohio will roll back this extension if the federal government
changes the rules. We have that same option if it doesn’t work and as I
said I know people that would love to have health coverage for a year,
for a month to be able to go to a doctor and I ask you to please
reconsider and send this back and we can work on it and come up with
something better for your constituents and mine. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen of the house, the minority caucus
has five minutes remaining on the 20 minute allotment. Representative
Burr please state your purpose.

need…</p>

<p id="055:00">
To fix the existing structure in North Carolina in terms of Medicaid. If
we're worried about that population we need to make sure that they have
the best opportunity to have good healthy outcomes as possible, and that
needs to first be done through fixing out current program. Which by the
way I believe this morning in the appropriation subcommittee on health
and human services, that the auditor even stated that the federal
government had contacted her about her audit. Folks that's not a good
thing. That's very concerning. That shows there must be something even
more to this than what the audit sheds the light on. So we need to
certainly make sure we're working to repair our existing structure.
This whole idea that we can create jobs through this, to me that is
hogwash. That is just pure BS in my mind. I mean this is the same thing
as stimulus. This is what we're - it's irresponsible. You don't create
jobs through borrowing money from the federal government. It doesn't
work. It is irresponsible. And it is a horrible argument to use for
expanding Medicaid. We create jobs in this state and what we're trying
to do is do that by pulling the government back and allowing the public
sector to flourish. That's how you create jobs, not through taking
borrowed money and spending it temporarily and hoping it doesn't
something. It didn't work for the stimulus. Yesterday we heard again
that argument about free money and that's exactly whats been wrong in
this country for years, we're...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We've taken free money.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hall please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just ask if the representative will yield to a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No sir, we're time limited right now, I do not yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman does not yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker could I yield some of my time to the
representative to answer the question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] At that time the gentleman will be recognized. The
gentleman may continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Again yesterday we heard the argument and I'm gonna
try to be brief because I know representative Dollar wants to speak,
representative Blust, so we want to make sure we leave some time for
him. But that's whats wrong with our country. We continue to think the
federal government can dangle money in front of our faces and we need to
grab it and take it and it creates problems and burdens for future
legislatures and tax payers for years and years to come. There's simply
too much uncertainty. And the fact that there's this argument that the
state will have control over this and we're giving up control, that is
nothing more than an illusion. The federal government created this beast
and they should manage what they've created and it is not the
responsibility of our state tax payers to do that. And I would ask that
members oppose or support this legislation and certainly stand up and
vote not to expand Medicaid, not to accept or to run a state based
partnership. And I would ask you to vote yes on senate bill four. Thank
you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hall the gentleman will be recognized
and the questions that you may ask should representative Burr or any
other member choose to yield will be counted against the remaining five
minute allocation. The gentleman is recognized, does the gentleman wish
to direct his question towards representative Burr?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well Mr. Speaker and I being recognized in order now
to speak or...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is being recognized either to speak on
the bill or to direct his question which was the prior request.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, I'll speak on the bill and then
I have a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Mr. Speaker, and I appreciate again the comments
that were made, but again they don't address the fact that we can do
better and should do better. The whole idea that by sending this money
or sending these tax payer dollars back to Washington or allowing them
to stay in Washington and we're somehow going to help the federal
government, if it were going broke this small amount of money would last
about 40 minutes. So we're saying we're giving up 500, 000 jobs, excuse
me, health care for 500,000 citizens who are tax payers as well who have
to pay the extra burden. We're giving up 25,000 jobs and we're saying,
well, we're great Americans because we're going to send this money back
to Washington which will not stay there, will be redistributed to other
states. but we're gonna say that we're great Americans.
I don't know if that's gonna help folks who need health care in your
communities. I don't know that that's gonna create jobs in your
communities. To use that excuse, to say I didn't vote your interests, I
said send your tax payer dollars to other states. So it's not free
money, it's hard earned money that North Carolina...</p>

Nothing free about it. And Mr. Speaker, at this time I have a motion.

particularly for the freshmen members here, the motion to lie on the

before I put the question. Representative Dollar, please state your
purpose.
[Speaker Changes] To speak on the motion.
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Member of the House, let me try to very quickly
explain a couple of things to you. First of all, with respect to the
exchanges, no matter what type of exchange we set up, North Carolina is
going to control the most important part, and that is eligibility, and
we will control that through NC fast. Now, if we want to make a
different decision down the road and have a state exchange, we have time
to do that. We can see how this develops. We can see how other states,
what’s approved, what’s not approved. We can come back and revisit this
issue in the future. There’s no reason for us to act this year. In terms
of looking at the expansion again, as Representative Burr has said,
there are so many questions that I have heard no one on this floor
answer. And I’ve heard no one answer in committee up to this point that
we simply have to have answers to before we move forward. In terms of
consolidation of hospitals, the consolidation of hospitals has been
accelerated since the passage of Obamacare. It has nothing to do with
what we may or may not do today on this floor. And so the concern about
that is been driven more by the underlying federal bill, not by any
actions that we’re taking here in the state of North Carolina. And I
want to point out, folks have been taking about who’s eligible and who’s
been effected. Let me point out something, that apparently most people
don’t know about the current program. If you are a child, birth to five
years old, you are covered at 200% of poverty now. Right now. If you a
child 6-18, through medicaid, and the North Carolina health choice
program, we cover you to 200%. Today. Right now. If you are a pregnant
woman, 180% of poverty, today, right now. If you are in an adult care
facility, long term care, you’re at 150% of poverty. All of these are
well above the 138% margin. If you are a breast cancer victim, you get
up to 200% of federal poverty, 100% of the treatment. The folks that are
not covered, frankly, are those adults without dependent children, who
are not disabled, and who are not elderly. That’s who we’re talking
about. And another thing that has been mentioned on this floor, nobody
said you’ve been talking about federal money. What about the state
money? You don’t know how much the department and the report that was
done by the state under the last administration came up with an estimate
of 830 million dollars net state appropriations. If we were to expand in
the first six years, at a run-rate of 220 million dollars or more, I ask
you one final question, and it is this: have you ever in your life seen
a federal entitlement program that didn’t far exceed its rejected cost
to the taxpayers?
[Speaker Changes] Representative Dollar. You finished right at three
minutes. That concludes the allotment of time for the majority caucus.
There’s 1 1/2 minutes left for the minority caucus. Representative
Earle, please state your purpose.

<p id="065:00">
I want to quickly address some of the statements that Representative
Dollar just said. He is absolutely correct about the folk that are
covered on Medicaid right now, but the bottom line is, what we’re
talking about is the 5,000 – 500,000, I’m sorry – additional people that
will be covered. Those are the ones - we’re also talking about the
people that are going to be unemployed, and after 12-20 weeks will not
have any income coming in. The single people that don’t fit in one of
those categories, those are the people that we are talking about right
now, and that’s a significant number when you look at the unemployment

There’s 30 seconds left for the minority caucus – the majority caucus’
time has been allocated – further discussion, further debate? If not,
the question before the house is the passage of the house committee
substitute to senate bill four on its third reading. All in favor vote
aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk ballot
machine will record the vote. 75 having voted in the affirmative, and 42
in the negative, the house committee substitute for senate bill four has
passed its third reading, and will be returned to the senate. The house
be at ease. Ladies and gentlemen of the house, if you go to the second
page of the calendar, we are going to try and dispose of some of these
matters. They may or may not be displaced based on the length of debate.
As you all know, there will be no votes on Monday night, or no votes on
matters that would be carried on from the calendar – all those would be
re-calendared for Tuesday. House bill 13, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House bill 13 – the bill has been titled natural cross state agencies
binding to the report to the department of administration the program
evaluation division the use of real property and to require the
department of public instruction to report annually on the amount of
revenue generated through leasing space on residential school campuses
as recommended by the surplus property subcommittee of the house select
committee on state-owned assets. General assembly of North Carolina
next.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, without objection, rule 12d is suspended. So
ordered. Representative Howard is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Last year, if you all remember, there was a
state surplus committee, chaired by speaker Brubaker and the
subcommittee was an extension of that particular subcommittee. This bill
is relatively simple – or at least I thought it was. I understand
there’s going to be some amendments, and I believe that the one
amendment that I’ve seen from Representative Ross will improve the way
the bill flows and simply, the language of the bill, but for those of
you in this chamber, it is a little discouraging to know that we members
of the North Carolina house do not have a complete list of the
state-owned property in the state of North Carolina, and don’t be too
discouraged because the Senate doesn’t have that list either – neither
does the administration. So what we tried to do was start a process so
there would be a complete list of all of the state-owned property in the
state of North Carolina, and that includes all state agencies in the
executive and the judicial branch will report biannually to the
department of administration an analysis of the agencies use of real
property – just real property. We’re not talking about any personal
properties, but all real property</p>

but due to the donors recognize the right bill. I demonstrate your
ladies and gentle men the house. this is a bill that came out of the
joint legislative emergency management oversight committee that met this
past fall. this is joint committee is assertive and it's a relatively
simple bill it if you about because we found that in some cases. in some
departments that there were vehicles that were having to respond to
emergency</p>

<p id="080:00">
in the state such as hurricanes and other types of things that happen
all across our state. And these vehicles had to respond in many cases in
a hurry. Because it was an emergency it was endangering somebody. Or
else it was a violator of some sort who was having to be perused by a
law enforcement officer within one of those agencies.  And his vehicle
might not have been properly equipped with the lights and sirens and so
forth that most law enforcement officers of the state all should have of
coarse. So what this does it speaks to the division of parks and
recreation or the department of environment and natural resources,
that's the park rangers and those that have emergency authorities in the
parks. And the north ?? forest service the department of agricultural
and consumer services we all know of the problems the forest service can
have in time of emergencies and what have you. What the first section of
the bill simply authorizes the installation of lights and sirens only on
those vehicles that are used for law enforcement purposes or for
response to fires or emergencies. It also authorizes the use of the
proper color light on the law enforcement or emergency vehicles. Either
red or blue as the case may be. It authorizes vehicles to exceed the
speed limit when they are responding to those emergencies. Of coarse it
requires them to be very careful and follow all the laws of the road
that would protect the public. It also requires motorists to yield the
right of way to those vehicles just as they would fire and police in
towns. It requires motorists to move to the side of the road and stop.
All of these things that we know we associate with emergency vehicles it
empowers these particular vehicles to do. Section two of the bill we
found that in some emergencies particularly where there has been a lot
of trees down or there's been other litter in the road and so forth
there might very well be a time when inmates in the prison system could
be used to assist and clean up road emergencies afterwards. So what the
comity did was propose that the department of public safety study
methods of allowing prisoners to contribute to clean up and mitigation
efforts in connection with states of emergencies declared by the state.
Department is required to report the join of legislative emergency
management committee, management oversight committee, and the
legislative oversight committee on justice in public safety no later
than October 1st, 2013 with regard to the possible use of those
prisoners. I'd be glad to answer any questions ask your favor vote for
the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Will the gentleman yield for question [SPEAKER

CHANGES] I will [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there a
penalty for motorists who does not yield the right of way to one of
these people responding in an emergency. [SPEAKER CHANGES] just as there
would be for ordinary police vehicles, highway patrol vehicles, or fire
trucks or anything else. The same penalties will apply [SPEAKER CHANGES]
follow up [SPEAKER CHANGES] gentleman yields? gentleman yields [SPEAKER
CHANGES] yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Help me understand this the only concern
I have, we're giving authority to some departments to exceed the speed
limit to respond to an emergency but its not clear to me that these
vehicles have a red or blue flashing light and usually you're going down
the road you look in the rear view mirror you see a red light or a blue
light and you know to slow down or to pull over but if someone from
parks and recreation is rushing off to some emergency and they don't
have a light, I'm just wondering how do we know that they're from parks
and recreation and are responding to an emergency. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes you hit exactly on the problem that we've found,
they were rushing to these emergencies they didn't have the proper
lights and the public could not tell that. so what we're saying in this
bill is that if they're gonna rush to that emergency they've gotta be
properly equipped with a proper equipment the lights and sirens and what
have you and if its a  law enforcement emergency they have to be a law
enforcement officer within one of those departments. If it's a fire
fighter or a forest ranger or something like that that's rushing to an
emergency they have to have the lights and sirens so we know its an
emergency vehicle. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you [SPEAKER CHANGES]

Mister Speaker, I've had my same seat mate these two terms and on this
special day I didn't get to speak actually the last two years. In the
first year being a freshman I was a little bit slow on the uptake and
another one of my colleagues actually, Representative Torbett jumped
right in front of me. And in the second year we actually happened to be
in session at the time but my memory was that the Speaker didn't want to
hear from anybody at the end of that session. So I'm proud to stand up
today on this special day for Representative Faircloth.
I would tell you, I've sat with John now for beginning three years and
I've never heard a disparaging word about anything. He is not a man that
uses adjectives and adverbs lightly and certainly never says, if he
doesn't have something good to say about something, he doesn't say it. A
good example of his character, he doesn't speak on the floor a lot
unless he's got a bill. But some of you may remember during the debate
over the Cherokee gambling bill we were both sitting here and I leaned
over and I said, where are you on this, and</p>

He said I really don't know and I lean back and about a minute and half
later, he hits his button, and I figured he decided where he is and in
turn he got called on by the Speaker and he stood up and if you might
remember he told us all the good reasons why we shouldn't vote for this
bill and then he told us all the reasons why we should for the bill and
he sat down. I leaned over to John and said Where are you on this bill
