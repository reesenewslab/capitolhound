end of the train as far as school vouchers are concerned, because we
know that it's failed in other places. This is also about North Carolina
being last instead of being first. We have been the innovators in
education, and we will no longer be seen as the innovators in education.
We'll be the copycats. So, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Now, as Representative Fisher's remarks indicate,
certainly when you look at the cost of attending, allegedly, these
private schools that are high quality, the vouchers that we're talking
about giving will not enable poor families attend them. And so what is
this really about? We know on a continuing basis we have members of the
Republican party saying they want to defund public education, which we
know is against the Constitution of the State of North Carolina, and
this is just another step of defunding our public school systems and
making them inadequate and incapable of providing the constitutionally
required sound and basic education. Representative Adams is gonna talk a
little bit, as well, about the impact of this bill on poor students.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning. Children live in poverty because their
parents live in poverty and bills that we have seen, that have come
before us, address particularly children who are at the lowest economic,
at the lowest economic ladder. Opportunities for students' success
continues to be an important issue in education and for all of us here,
it is still an important issue. A good education, as we have continued
to say, is what we want for all children, but it's important to make
sure that accountability for their education is not only provided for
but accounted for as well. North Carolina's public schools traditionally
have provided education for the masses of children, and in spite of
whatever options or choices are currently available, and there are many,
even in our public schools today, throughout the Eleazar North Carolina,
there are still many choices and options that parents can take with
their children. And while the public schools are not perfect, our
responsibilities as elected officials should be to provide the needed
resources to make our public schools the best that they can be. We can't
make them the best that they can be if we continue to diminish the
support and the resources that we take from them when we know that those
are the things that they need. We continue to hear sponsors of this bill
talk about students' success and proficiency, but there are no
guarantees when the bills that I have seen, that provide vouchers and
scholarships, that those bills do not ensure any student success or
proficiency. As a matter of fact, student success is really not
indicated in those bills. They don't, as you've heard, provide the
transparency that we require of our public schools. No accountability to
the public. We've heard a lot about choice, and parents needing choice,
and I believe that choice in education is a valid one. But public
schools are charged with educating all children, regardless of zip code,
regardless of disability or any other problems that may be going on with
those students. And so, as I've said before, there are many choices,
magnates and other programs that are provided. But when the choice that
I need for my child goes beyond the choices that are provided by public
schools, and particularly when there is a cost involved, I think it's
the parents responsibility to pay for those choices, and that public
dollars should not be used to pay for children to be educated in private
schools. Choices in education, as I said, are valid, but using public
dollars to support education in private schools is just wrong. And they
are not the kinds of choices that we should be making with taxpayer
dollars. We don't currently fund our public schools adequately and that
really ought to be the focus of this General Assembly, that's what we
need to be looking at. As you've heard, North Carolina is 48th in the
nation per pupil spending, so instead of investing in public education
this bill, and all the bills that I've seen regarding vouchers and
scholarships, will diminish the funding that we need to make available
for our public schools. And they're going to continue to dismantle, and
I believe that that is the underlying, the underlying intent of these
bills to</p>

Representative: …dismantle our public schools. This bill is also a bit
disingenious because it will not truly provide the kind of choice that
parents say they need for their children. When you look at children that
these bills have been directed towards, i.e. those at the lowest
economic ladder, these young students will not have the funding in terms
of their family income to pay for the additional costs to offset the
vouchers that may be provided. In one instance, I think one of the first
bills we saw, it would necessitate that the parent would have to spend
the money first and then get reimbursed for it. Now, we are talking
about parents who don’t have the income level to even have the money to
spend upfront. Overall, I will say it is inappropriate again for private
choices to be used at the expense of public dollars. I hope, somewhere
along the line, these bills can be derailed and sent back. Thank you.
Speaker: Now it is good to talk philosophically about education in NC,
to talk generally about our constitutional duties. You see all the
legislators before you. All of them have strong re cords on trying to
improve education in NC. As we talk about this bill in particular,
Representative Glacier is going to come forward and talk about some of
the efficiencies of this bill that may not be apparent on its face but
are there. It is important to understand that this bill in no way will
improve for low income students to achieve a good education. It does not
do that statewide, or in any particular school, and it is not a fair
representation of what education should be in NC. Representative
Glacier?
Representative: Thank you Mr. Leader. Good morning everyone. I concur
with all the comments made so far but let me try to sum up, in a couple
of minutes, a few points. First, 944 has been touted by its advocates as
education reform. It is no such thing. It is actually a complete
abdication of the public school system in this state. It is not, as
someone suggests, the camel’s nose under the tent – now, the whole camel
has made its way under the tent, if this bill passes. It starts off with
a whole 100% and escalates in the second year costing the tax payers,
over that 2 year period, $50 million. We all know, from Representative
Stan’s comments before session, and bills that have been filed
previously, that there is no intent on the part of these sponsors to
keep it at the poverty level, or any poverty level. This bill will soon
be, in my view, used as a step to open a private voucher system that
will in effect destroy the public school education in the state of NC
were that to occur. Let’s talk specifically about a couple of provisions
in this bill. Representative Fisher and Adams have said, correctly, that
the data, if anyone looks at the data, that it will cost low income
folks, who get the full voucher, an additional $5689 to go to elementary
school, an additional $7150 to go to middle school, and an additional
$8457 to go to high school, and that is not including fees which a lot
of these private schools charge – anywhere from $500-1500. That’s just
the tuition and the basic cost. If you are at a 100% poverty level,
where are you going to come up with that money? Now, what is really
being funded here are not the students opportunity to go to the best
private schools, because the best private schools are way out of that
reach. Secondly, to the extent that they are the best private schools,
they have their scholarships in reach and are offering scholarships to
some amount of students. This bill will only help one set of schools,
and it is the struggling, poor academic schools: they are the only ones
that are going to benefit under this bill, certainly not the students
that attend there. Secondly, this is a private option, and as
Representative Adams made clear, even if a student gets a voucher, there
is no guarantee that they are going to be accepted in that school: they
are not going to accept the [xx] care, they are not going to accept the
kid with serious learning difficulties, the disciplinary child, they are
not going to accept the child with a D or C record going in, because
they do not have</p>

...have to, and because they haven't historically done that anyway, and
so those students will be left in the public school, creating additional
problems for us in terms of a public, of giving all of the students in
that school a great education, with less resources, because they're
being diverted increasingly to voucher schools, and then with voucher
schools being able to say, look what we've done with these great kids,
we've done great test scores, and look at the schools and the public,
they've had this decrease in test scores, and using it as this vicious
circle to undercut public education, and they're doing it in a way, as
Representative Hall said, in a Bill that has almost no provisions
providing for any serious accountability, for any serious qualifications
for the teachers who teach in these schools, and so who are we doing
this for?  I supported, years ago, a tax credit bill, minimal, with
Representative Lucas, to deal with a couple hundred exceptional
children, in the most extraordinary exceptionalities, where the school
districts are unable or, in my opinion, were not able to provide any
services.  That is one thing, but to create a wholesale voucher system
that says your private choice is now the public expense, and to allow
public students to then be chosen at will and capriciously by private
schools, leaving one set going there and everyone else to be in the
public school, is ultimately destructive of public education.  Finally,
what I would add is a comment I made yesterday, and that is that public
education is the one institution in this nation that has bonded our
people together, as one people, under one flag, under one nation, and
nothing else has ever done that.  If we separate our children into
hundreds or indeed thousands of private options, then it rips away at
the fabric of the democracy of our state and fundamentally at our
country.  This is a seriously flawed Bill, a seriously bad Bill, and it
cannot be sustained, given the problems it has and the funding it has,
when we're talking about cutting 142 million dollars out of teacher
assistance, when we're talking about cutting hundreds of millions of
dollars over the course of the last several years from our education
system, when we are, as it's been said, 48th in funding per school in
the country, and we justify improving public education how, by ?? it,
abandoning it, and saying to these children, well, we're going to turn
you over to voucher school and all will be fine.  It seems to me, in the
end, their poverty doesn't go away because they go to another school.
The abuse they suffer at home doesn't go away because they go to a
different school.  Their exceptionality doesn't go away because they go
to a different school.  Their discipline issues don't go away because
they go to a different school.  Their ADD or ADHD doesn't go away
because they show up at someone else's door.  This is a political
solution, a simplistic political solution, ideological solution, for a
complex, educational, economic and moral problem, and it really is
beneath the dignity of this institution to be using this as the way to
solve issues in public education.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Now, you've heard from several of the legislators
involved.  We're going to take questions, but briefly, it is clear
though, this whole voucher idea, at this point in time, under our
Constitution, is really educational malpractice by those who would seek
to put it forward, and I wouldn't doubt that some people have the best
of intentions and are looking for a solution, but they look to provide a
solution that does not help the children, does not help their
performance, and certainly doesn't help our state move forward with a
work force that will be able to compete in the future, and so we admire
folks who have an idea and want to do the best.  This is not the best.
This is not the way we should be going as a state.  It certainly ?? our
constitutional responsibility, and I would submit to you that it's not a
serious attempt to address our problems.  It is educational malpractice,
if this type of effort is sustained and we go down this road.  We'll
take questions.  I'll take you and then you.  Yes, ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The numbers in this Bill.  Is it 4200 for the school
year?  Is that the number that we're talking about?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  What is your accountability diversion?
Accountability wide, ?? the accountability is enough?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Well, the accountability is deficient, and I'll let
other folks jump in, but in my estimation when you first say we're going
to take the children, put them in front of a teacher who, as you may
have heard the questioning yesterday in the Committee meeting, who has
no set qualifications.  The teacher doesn't have to have any experience
in the subject matter, doesn't have to have training...</p>
