there was some options that we won't go in a lot of detail, but they can
pick all transit or all education or a quarter of each so that provision

that
part of this will describe the general purpose of levy that gives the
opportunity for local governments to give grants with their sales tax,
levy, and at their own discretion for any type of rehabilitation of
either nil or any type of industrial structures on historic structure so
that gives a little bit more flexibility for those communities of the

balloon validity of any type of subsidies or incentives of the historic

interim, and reported back to the two thousand and fifteen General
assemblyâ€“ also Senate Bill forty two, which we did of vote on in its
similar contents to house Bill one oh six nine employment uninsured
unemployment insurance Asian gentleman we had done a excellent
unemployment insurance proposal passed House passes Senate.
unfortunately, the governor didn't see the value in that bill. there was
a lot of good things. we made great strides. we will see the
unemployment insurance fund solvent Bible will see the fact that because
of all the good work. this general simply did that somewhere around made
of two thousand and fifteen we will completely eliminate the three
billion dollars worth of debt. it's on the right path. I unfortunately
am sad that the governor didn't see value in that, but for the
protection of the businesses we ate we included the provision of a the
confidentiality provision, which will minimize any possible increase in
in the FUTA tax upwards of three hundred dollars per employee per year
and this way the businesses will be protected and at some point the
other good provisions that were written. this bill, hopefully in two
thousand and fifteen will be moved forward and there is also we did
pass, says Senate Bill seven sixty three, which was the Senate finance
technical corrections. they are listed. they were included. not all of
them are listed in this bill. some of them because of the fact that they
will roll call will have to be delayed for another period of time, but
the ones that are there are included. many of them were from the
Department of revenue aware requests, and therefore we met that
obligation. originally, the Senate got to go in front of you. we have
loaded on each of these bills, and there really isn't any of the news
they are. I will lost it for any questions,

do the same and we felt it was a very fair way for them to achieve with

Change speaker: now the question is

an opportunity as you were critical of us that they now will have the
opportunity to have a two. seven five and therefore you should be
thrilled and happy to achieve your goal.
Change speaker:  now the question is present to you on page nine of this

the use of this text, I guess that would be generated if it's put on him
him before December thirty first, explain to me what this program, which
actually means us, especially when it says that that attacks must use

then under section BMC 's policies may be used must be used for any
unlawful purpose, except they may not be used for purpose for which a
tax levied under article forty three must be used
Change speaker:  if I am correct in my interpretation what it's saying
is that if it's used for projects like Neil, rehabilitation or
historical properties. if it is a public purpose use that that is
eligible for it. it is not for a public use, then it won't be eligible
from that that source of money and I can begin:
Change speaker: Underwood,
Change speaker:  I am ultimately also that the quarter sandwich. it was
in the original bill was that you cannot use that transit, which is what
was in the original bill that we passed out of the two. seven five past

Senator Araujo consulted the four senators who represent County about

but when you're setting up your college professors mentally show
something with you because
we can see some a rather achieved what it has achieved both enhance
economic vitality and focus educational pursuits, and I agree that
family calendar, deciding what's best for wake County seven hundred
constraints of what our Constitution and state statutes provide that for
our side. I got a tell you an opportunity this morning. some lady talked
about nationally certified and certified teachers in late County than
anywhere else in the United States. that's because the county government
decided who valued education will run a conference of teachers in this
county, etc. above teachers across the United States County him him him
last year decided we wanted to have the biggest
bond issue. I can only ever voted for in the state. in the past, roughly
a billion dollar bond issue to build schools in this county now say that
because when, so then what's going on what's on the calendar. then I
looked at the anonymous election clarifications bill for three on an
open wound vote on it
was successful in passing that bond issue last year by very comfortable
margin because two of the chamber, which is a County wide chamber for
all intents and purposes into the citizens of this county. it was
important to put that bond issue on the ballot when they could attract
the most attention from the taxpayers in this county. I like the
bestseller for him and him have prohibited wake County from Clinton.
it's about down thing gets punishment about the last few values
willingly turned out for this different treatment of candidates
sometimes and you know something that is just paddling in the things
that wake County people about a prepared for the side of themselves and
that's pretty much the way I see this compromise provision inherently
smart enough. it is a compromise provision because it took us months
upon months for the chamber first to raise the money to do this bond
issue. second, limited idea from everybody who needed to be a part of
it, and we got by and from the entire community across him will him
position back on issue, and I was offended that this compromise does is
Charles Austin with Johnny that this is a test in about five minutes
tells us that between August, September and October. you got to first
organize the people in this county. secondly, you got to raise the money
to start advertising photos shows tax referendum. thirdly, you got to
convince the people that feels familiar campaign themed and relevant. I
want to think about it in place is much smaller than wake County for
together a campaign and that is just the start about the start
assembling your campaign team, raising the money and then going out</p>

him, asking him county at .com commissioners meeting to talk about it.
mind you they haven't put it on the ballot. they haven't even discussed
the County commissioners meeting Mecklenburg County. I guess sometimes
been discussing the cent sales tax
to the county has been discussing both of them on the ballot and it
means that some another. they planned it and they put together teams to
do it slowly. you know you're giving us a choice. it's not really a
choice, so don't make your solving the problem district created the wake
County Botswana status in the House delegation was on it, but apparently
there were financed, how you put together campaigns or just don't want
to have the options that these other counties have in connection with
using this medicine. sales tax is still allowing this county governments
commitment to arms and the counties and creating additional transit
system, a transit system that develops high-capacity as I said on Robert
special remains and out of these other things against the light rail
train systems. so, I just don't want to be suffering under the illusion
that you fix this problem that has been created for the county. because
you happen and I told the commissioners may talk about the sales tax
increase. I was beginning to seven hundred letters him exhale what the
issues we dispatched and I don't regret a thing sets in property taxes
for schools in this county. most of the citizens of that state property
tax increase feel the same way. now, fortunately, in this county. we
don't have the highest tax rates, tax rates would probably lower than
most of the opportunities that have visibility to have to go back to the
citizens of this county and talk about property taxes to fund the things
that we decided are essential for this County, but it's unfair. unfair
to keep keeping on. wake County. these extra burdens that you can run us
without any great reason for it can't for the life of me understand if
you allow us to so determine our own fate. you tell us if we got to do
it in the next session and ninety days just doesn't make sense. and so I
think that's out of the young senator and made a very important
observation. and I agree with him on the other parts of the bill that
will create economic opportunity that the power funding and all of those
things really do create economic opportunity in the same bill that began
that children's economic opportunity in this county. I just want you to
think about the gravity of what you do when you do something like this.
I plan to vote against Bush, simply because this proposition about the
sales tax and how it affects weekends and I wish I could vote for the
other sections in the him. the sections and then move the financial
investment outlook of the state. once we thank you,
