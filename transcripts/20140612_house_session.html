and women like Officer Crisp proudly perform their duties as marine
patrol officers, wildlife enforcement officers, forest rangers, and park
rangers throughout the United States and the State of North Carolina;
and Whereas, Section 5 of Article XIV of the North Carolina Constitution
declares it to be the policy of this State to conserve and protect its
lands and waters for the benefit of all its citizenry; and Whereas,
Section 5 of Article XIV of the North Carolina Constitution also
declares it to be the proper function of the State to preserve as a part
of the common heritage of this State its forests, wetlands, estuaries,
beaches, historical sites, open lands, and places of beauty; and
Whereas, G.S. 113‑44.8 provides that the State of North Carolina offers
unique archaeological, geological, biological, scenic, and recreational
resources, and finds that these resources are part of the heritage of
the people of this State and should be preserved and managed by the
people for their use and for the use of their visitors and descendants;
and Whereas, the officers of the North Carolina Marine Patrol, Wildlife
Enforcement Officers of the Wildlife Resources Commission, and Rangers
of the State Parks System and the State's Forest Service are dedicated
public servants and work tirelessly to uphold these provisions of the
State's Constitution and General Statutes, fulfill their duties to
preserve our State's spectacular natural resources, and assure the
safety of the State's citizenry in enjoying these resources; and
Whereas, the origins of the North Carolina Marine Patrol may be traced
to as early as 1822, serving to protect the State's extensive marine and
estuarine resources; and Whereas, the North Carolina Marine Patrol has

for the benefit of the people of North Carolina and has jurisdiction
over all coastal waters, which includes monitoring 2.5 million acres of

that promote stewardship of the State's natural heritage; and Whereas,
the Rangers of the State Parks System have responsibility for management
of more than 217,000 acres included within the State Parks System and
protection of the many millions of visitors to sites within the System
each year; and Whereas, many Rangers of the State Parks System have been
injured in the line of duty; and Whereas, the origins of the State's
Forest Service may be traced to as early as 1891, when the North
Carolina Geological Survey was established to protect the State's
natural diversity and to encourage opportunities that promote
stewardship of the State's natural heritage and the first State employee
was appointed to carry out forestry work; and Whereas, the Rangers of
the State Forest Service have responsibility for management of the rich
and diverse forest resources within North Carolina, which enrich the
lives of all North Carolinians and provide us with clean water and air,
wildlife, recreation, and forest products; and Whereas, many Rangers of
the State Forest Service have been injured in the line of duty, and 26

duty since 1950; and Whereas, it is fitting to honor and commend the

our State and nation and routinely endure dangerous and difficult
conditions.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Dobson please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members of the house, before we
begin what is sure to be a lengthy and spirited debate in just a little
while, I hope we can take a few minutes to put things in perspective.
When I think about what makes our state special, I really think about
two things. One is our natural resources. It really is amazing all that
we have right here in North Carolina. If you’ve ever taken a Sunday
afternoon drive on the blue ridge parkway in the fall you know what I’m
talking about. If you’ve ever spent a summer day on Lake Norman, you
know what I’m referring to. If you’ve ever walked the shores of our
coast you know that we truly do live in the most beautiful state in the
country. The other thing that I think about that makes our state great
are the men and women who protect our natural resources and who protect
our people. The number one objective as we all know of any level of
government is to protect the people that it serves. There are men and
women across this state who every day when they get up and go to work
they literally risk their lives for each and every one of us. One of
these men is Untied States forest service officer Jason Crisp. Jason
began his career as a part time deputy with the McDowell county
sheriff’s officer in 1997. He became a full time deputy in June of 1998
and worked there until March of 2004. Jason stayed on there as a reserve
officer with the sheriff’s office until March of 2014. In March of 2004
officer Crisp began his job working with the United States forest
service. He began his job on the grandfather ranger district as a timber
marker and graduated from the federal law enforcement training center in
2005. For ten years he served with the forest district, his district
covered almost 190,000 acres covering five large counties. It was said
of Jason by the forest service that from the brown mountain OHV areas to
the ??? gorge wilderness, Jason knew every nook and cranny of the
district. On Wednesday March 12, 2014, three months ago to the day,
officer Crisp was off duty at home working on his house that he was
building for his family when he got the call to assist in a manhunt.
Officer Crisp didn’t ask questions or complain, he knew..</p>

<p id="025:00">
It was his duty to serve us. That would be his last day he would spend
on earth you see, he and his partner his dog?? were both queued in the
line of duty that day. Jason was kind of the guy that personifies North
Carolina values. He loved his wife Amanda and his two boys Gary and
Logan. He loved his church and his community. It's men like this of make
north Carolina special. Men and women across this state weather they
work in emergency services, local law enforcement, state law enforcement
or in Jason's case federal law enforcement. And by been the kind of man
he was and by going into public service and taking an oath to protect
natural resources of our state and our people, I think this is the best
way to sum it up officer Jason Chris left three world a little better
than the way he found it. Mr. Speaker thank you for the opportunity to
speak I comment the resolution to you.

the Chair is going to move ahead of the next bill on the calendar to

the clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Committee Substitute Number 2 for
House Bill 1034, bill from the Tyler Act, to amend the laws related to
Local Firefighters’ Relief Fund, the Statewide Firefighters’ Relief
Fund, the Rescue Squad Workers’ Relief Fund, Worker’s Compensational,
Firefighters’ and Rescue workers’ Supplemental Pensions for Firefighters
and Rescue Squad Workers in the Volunteer Fire Department Fund, and
Volunteer Rescue EMS Fund is recommended by the Joint Legislative
Program Evaluation Oversight Committee General Assembly of North
Carolina, next. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard, please state
your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and Members of the House.  This is a
bill that was a recommendation of the Program Evaluation Division. And
actually, it was four bills and were merged into one bill. The bill has
already had a visit into Appropriations and now it’s back on the floor.
Also, it’s had a visit over in the Finance Committee so this is the last
stop. There were four reports done by the Program Evaluation Division
and the first report was dealing with the local Firefighters’ Relief
Fund. And the second report was dealing with the Rescue – the statewide
Firefighters’ Relief Fund, excuse me – the Rescue Squad Workers’ Relief
Fund, the Worker’s Compensation Fund and the Pension Fund. And, as I
said, we merged all of those bills into one. It’s a rather lengthy bill
but I will briefly tell you what it does.  We took the four bills and
went into subcommittee and spent many weeks trying to fix this issue.
It’s a problem that’s been pending for nearly 19 years now. And when we
get this bill passed and signed by the Governor, everybody is going to
be very content and pleased that we have answered all the questions.
Members of the House, you can proudly go home and tell your local
firefighters that these are the things that you have put in place that
will help them to do their job with their pension and also with some of
the other advantages, such as physicals and firefighters will also have
local benefits. First of all, in the Relief Fund, it simply provides
guidance on the minimum and maximum level of the relief fund balances.
It adds – and this is in addition – annual physicals to the list of
allowable expenditures for your local firefighters. It provides a
line-of-duty death benefit to firefighters – that’s new. And it also
requires the Department of Insurance to create a database – a database
where you can make one phone call when you get a call from your local
firefighters asking about his or her retirement. That database will be
at one place – the Department of Insurance – and it requires the local
relief fund boards and the State Fire and Rescue Associations to act
with prudence with respect to the relief funds. Secondly, with the
Worker’s Compensation Fund, like certain statewide associations eligible
for membership, requires the Department of Insurance to conduct an
annual actuarial study. It provides a list of requirements for the State
Fire and Rescue Commission to include in its contract for a third party
administrator.  On the Pension Fund it pays pensions to all participants
age 55 and over regardless of whether or not they are retired from
firefighting or rescue squad work. The benefit is paid by the 5%

everybody will set the table and all of your local farmers and the
department of insurance, everybody is on-board with this and I would
hope to get your support. I’ll answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lucas, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak briefly on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Speaker. As representative Howard has
indicated this bill represents quite a journey of compromise. The
challenge was constantly to satisfy all of the stakeholders and I must
tell you that in our attempt to satisfy all of the stakeholders, it was
like squeezing a saturated balloon. It [fix], one section you squeeze it
and it will bulge in another place and we’ve worked over a period of
weeks, even months until we finally reached a compromise and that’s what
this bill is. It’s a compromise of all of the stakeholders. So I urge
your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. Representative
Insko, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to ask the bill sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard, does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard, find understand reading this
quickly. This includes a formula to redistribute the fire fund?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Not exactly. What we’re trying to do is determine that
each fire department has a minimum amount of money in their local
department in case they have issues that they need to address. So we set
it at a certain dollar amount per person that’s a member of that
particular fire department. If the departments have accumulated excess
funds, Representative Insko, nothing will be taken from them and
everybody is at peace and very happy about this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields.
Though the fire chiefs across the state have signed off ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Ma’am, they certainly have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You.

question before the house is the passage of House Committee Substitute
number 2 for House Bill 1034 on its second reading. All in favor, vote
Aye. All oppose, vote No. The clerk will open the vote. Members, please
record. The clerk will let the machine record the vote. 114 having voted

There's no known opposition that we are aware of in support of our
county commissioners association and sheriffs association. The only
thing this bill does is make our minimum detention center standards
equal and apply uniformly across all counties. The current law has a
different standard for counties in excess of  300,000 population and
those counties in less than 300,000 population in this bill just
equalizes that standard and the intent of the bill is to allow counties
to house the additional inmates in a more efficient way. And I commend
the bill and stand for any questions that you may have.
[Speaker Change] Representative Alma [sp] please state your question.
[Speaker Change] To ask a question that the bill sponsors.
[Speaker Change] Representative Ramsay, does the gentleman yield?
[Speaker Change] I yield.
[Speaker Change] The gentleman yields.
[Speaker Change] Thank you Mister Speaker. How in these minimum
standards are we taking into consideration any of the requirements
coming down through the federal priya [sp] law?
[Speaker Change] We would certainly have to meet the priya [sp]
requirements. If you notice int he bill they would still have to meet
the space requirements under  153 A. And previously the counties under
300,000 could house 56 and the counties over 300,000 could house 64. So
[??] applied prior to the passage of this bill, it's a federal law so it
applies regardless, Representative Alma.
[Speaker Change] Follow up.
[Speaker Change] Does the gentleman yield?
[Speaker Change] I yield.
[Speaker Change] The gentleman yields.
[Speaker Change] And does this also include the new requirements under
that law for separation of minors or those under the age of 18?
[Speaker Change] To my knowledge this bill does not address this and if
other members may have some knowledge to the contrary, this only
equalizes those standards. It's my understanding that we have to meet
those priya [sp] requirements regardless of what occurs relating to
minors and other things. So this bill does not impact priya [sp] in any
way the counties that will have to meet the priya [sp] requirements.
[Speaker Change] Thank you.
[Speaker Change] Representative McNeal please state your purpose.
[Speaker Change] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker Change] I just rise to say that in any jail there's different
classifications of inmates. You wouldn't put someone of 16 or 17 years
old in a dormitory anyway. Dormitory is basically what it says. It's a
large room that has bunk beds in it. People that you're concerned about,
Representative Alma would be put in separate cells.

<p id="050:00">
If it said simply we’re putting a moratorium on the school board county
commissioner disputes and their ability to file suit under this statute,
only. I think again, really bad policy. But it is a policy. We created
that statute, we can put limitations on that statute. But read with me
what section 1 says. Notwithstanding those three general statutes, a
local board shall not file any legal action challenging the sufficiency
of the funds appropriated by the board of county commissioners to the
local school expense fund capital fund ?? vote. We have no ability to
tell anyone, any citizen including a school board, they may file no suit
under any other statute or under the Constitution of the United States
or under the Constitution of North Carolina, challenging the local fund.
We have a right to say they can’t do it under our statute, but that’s
not what this says. This says if a school board, for example, wanted to
file a Leandro Claim, saying that Union County or Nash County’s funding
by county commissioners violates the Constitution of North Carolina. Or
a Section 1983 claim that they violate the civil rights of their
students within the district with regard to this. That we are barring
them from the court. That is language way too far. And that may be the
problem. And I recognize asleep on the switch when the motion was just
made to put this on the calendar. Now not in my view the right way to do
it but it was done and we didn’t object. But let’s have the discussion
now since it’s on the floor. We can’t tell the legislature has no
ability to tell any citizen of this state including school boards they
may never file any suit for a particular ground for any reason. So if
you want to protect your bill, at a minimum you would amend this thing
to stick strictly to the statute. Now, I’m perfectly fine because I
don’t like the bill if it goes forward but if I’m the school board’s
attorney, I’m going to tell them file suit right away. Go ahead and do
whatever you’re going to do because we have told them something we have
no constitutional ability to tell them. So if you’re trying, or if this
bill is trying to simply limit the lawsuit under that statute, it
doesn’t do just that. It attempts to limit the school board’s ability to
file any lawsuit. And I am opposed to this bill and I suggest we not
concur and at least send it to conference, or to a committee to talk
about this. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sorry.
Representative Iler, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To see
if Representative Glazier would yield to a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This is purely an understanding
question on my part. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure. [SPEAKER CHANGES] When you
say legal action for any reason, I’m reading legal action challenging
the sufficiency of funds as appropriated by the board. Doesn’t that
limit it just to suits for the funds? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The funds, but
it takes into account any cause of action you would have for that. So
for example one reason school boards are able to sue or they do sue, is
because they have direct cause of action to sue under this statute if
mediation fails and all that good stuff. The school boards before that
certainly had the ability to sue tougher lawsuits, right? Tougher
lawsuits to win, if they believe that the county allocation violated the
Constitution of North Carolina or the Constitution of the country. So
there were other causes of action they can file. In fact now what we’re
telling them, instead of going through the more narrow lens of what we
give them to do, mediation if it fails, then file the lawsuit, we give
direction about how it’s to be filed, what to do, now all we’re saying
is because this bars everything, well what they’re going to do is file
the everything. To bar the lawsuit, which will have far greater damage
capacity. In fact, in trying to narrow this, you’re forcing the school
boards to file the federal constitutional claim, the state
constitutional claim, all those lawsuits and I don’t think that’s at all
what we’re trying to do here, even if you agree with the policy. That’s
what you’re going to force state boards to do if this passes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brody, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d
like to request that we displace this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The

[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does Representative Dollar rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, let me
begin by thanking our full chairs of the appropriations committee,
Representative Linda Johnson, Representative Justin Burr, Representative
Bryan Holloway, and Representative Pat McElraft. I also want to thank
all of our many chairs of the subcommittees, their committee members and
the full appropriations committee which is about 2/3 or 3/4 of the
members of this body. Ladies and Gentlemen of the House, our vote today
is about the future of North Carolina. We have traveled a long and
challenging road since 2009 and in 2011 our state budget was in a
crisis. We had record deficits, lowering revenues, and a very painful,
slow recovery. We certainly were coming out of and dealing with the
deepest recession in a generation. Now we are in recovery and our
state's in recovery. Over the past three years we have worked to close
the deficits, modernize state government, create a more innovative and
inviting climate for business in our state. We have worked to grow our
economy and to create jobs that are so important to all our families and
businesses here in North Carolina. Mr. Speaker and members of this
House, today's budget is sound, it is responsible, and it is focused on
our highest priorities. Let me mention just a few of the highlights. The
budget before you today for your consideration has a 5% increase for
teachers in our state, it contains a $1000 flat raise for most state
employees plus benefits, that's roughly a 2.3% increase and additional 5
days of leave time for state employees. We have a 1.44% COLA for state
retirees as well and teacher retirees. This state budget establishes a
risk reserve of some 117.8 million dollars for Medicaid to be
administered by the State Office of Management and Budget so that we can
have greater flexibility and accountability in our Medicaid program. It
adds funding for repairs and renovations and it brings our savings
reserve in the state of North Carolina, our rainy day fund, up to 741
million dollars. As our subcommittee chairs will discuss briefly, we
have addressed a range of important issues facing our state.</p>

We're addressing job retraining, veterans, the development of a
compensation system for teachers, child protective services, coal ash
issue, criminal justice issues, transportation issues, issues involving
culture, history and the arts, and mental health services, as well as
those - protecting those - critical health care services that are
important to our most vulnerable citizens. I am pleased to say, our
budget enjoys broad public support all across North Carolina. Today, the
actions we take will help ensure a bright future for the citizens of
North Carolina and greater prosperity for our businesses. Mr. Speaker,
the Chairs and Members of the Appropriations Committee are proud to
submit this budget to the consideration of the House. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
And at this time, and in a very timely manner and fashion, I would like
to recognize the nurse of the day, Miss Lynnette Fort from Goldsboro.
Thank you for being here. [APPLAUSE] Your services may be required at a

does Representative Horn arise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Horn is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
House, this is a great day. A great day for education in North Carolina
as we roll out the House budget for all of our citizens. As you've
already heard, this budget implements an average 5% pay raise for all
teachers - all teachers across this great state in our public schools.
It keeps our teaching assistants - the folks that are helping those
teachers in the classroom, the folks that are closest to the kids on a
day in and day out basis - keeps the teaching assistants, all of them,
in the classroom. It funds the retirement system, funds workmen's
compensation and tort liability. We begin a new era, a pathway - a
career pathway - for teachers that's going to result in keeping high
quality teachers in the classroom. They don't have to move out of the
classroom to move up. They can stay in the classroom, take on more
responsibility, help each other to a greater extent, and end up helping
our kids in the classroom every day, raising the bar for everyone. The
North Carolina Center for the Advancement of Teaching stays in effect,
where it's going to help our teachers transist[sic] into the digital
environment, expand their ability to help our kids' reading abilities
and promote an exchange of ideas among teachers so they can learn from
each other. It lives up to our commitment on Master's pay, when we told
teachers a couple of years ago, &quot;You go get your Master’s, we'll
pay you a Master's supplement.&quot; We're living up to that and
restoring that Master's supplement for all teachers that are in that
pipeline and then opening up - beginning the process of opening up -  a
Master's supplement for teachers teaching in their - with their - major
and in their profession. What I'm really trying to say is math teachers
- math majors - need to be teaching math and not PE or chemistry. It
pilots a new approach on attaining a Master’s degree that melds
practical application and a digital environment into the classroom. What
a concept! We're going to teach teachers in a classroom environment to
be even better teachers. It addresses the needs of our smallest
communities with a revised and improved, expanded small counties'
allotment. It helps reduce stress on our kids in Read to Achieve and
recognizes the challenges and builds upon what has been initiated in the
Senate. Improved further legislation, we're hoping to continue to
improve that. We're going to test a couple of new concepts like virtual
charter schools. We're going to increase the amount of money in
textbooks and recognize that not every LEA is at the same level in
progressing toward that digital environment which we set as the goal for
our schools before this decade is over. Community colleges increased
compensation - we added a fourth tier to closing the gaps, allowing
community colleges to hire the needed staff for these highly needed</p>

Career fields. We are instituting the yellow ribbon program, both in the
community college and the university system by putting nearly $6 million
there for matching grants to help our veterans get that education to
help them transition to an even greater extent into our North Carolina
economy. We’re restoring teaching fellows, a program that was near and
dear to the heart of many of those in this house and across the state.
We’re keeping our CFNC, the college foundation of North Carolina, an
active and viable program. We have three new initiatives in the
university system including game changing research that focuses
investments in key areas, next generation power and electronics we all
remember when President Obama came to North Carolina and committed a
major new program right here in North Carolina and we’re going to
participate in that, and we are supporting a highly successful new
teacher support program initiated here in North Carolina that’s giving
hands on support to our teachers in the classroom where the rubber meets
the road resulting in improved student outcomes. Ladies and gentlemen I
am incredibly proud to have played a small role in developing this
budget. I’m proud to present this budget to you, I ask for your support.
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you for that brief explanation, but very thorough
and timely. For what purpose does Representative Murry arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To briefly debate the NER budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentlemen is recognized to debate the NER budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. It’s been a real pleasure to
work with Representative West on developing the budget for natural and
economic resources which includes the department of agriculture and
consumer services or the agriculture department, department of labor,
DENR, department of commerce, and the wildlife resources commission. The
total budget includes $382.2 million, I’m going to hit the highlights.
We’re investing in plant science initiatives and food processing
initiatives through NC State through the department of agriculture. This
will help produce 21st century jobs in the agriculture field and we
think it’s a good investment, $600,000 investment through the department
of agriculture and NC State. We’re also providing an additional one
million dollars support farmland preservation through the farmland
preservation trust fund around military buffers. This money will not be
able to be expended until there’s a federal match. This helps protect
our first industry, our number one industry agriculture, and our number
two economic impact industry the military industry at the same time and
it also requires like I said a federal match. We also transferred the
animal welfare program ??? account to the department of public safety as
recommended by the governor from the department of agriculture. The
department of labor is real simple, it’s just a 2% management flex cut
it’s around $330,000. Within DENR the major expansion includes 18 new
positions and $1.8 million for the cleanup of coal ash. The major
distinction between the house budget and the senate budget on this item,
it doesn’t require that the general assembly pass a coal ash bill in
order to expend these funds, DENR can get to work. We all think we’re
going to be passing a coal ash bill but we just didn’t want to predicate
these funds being spended based on a new policy position by the general
assembly. Additionally we’re providing an additional one million dollars
in nonrecurring funds for clean water management trust fund and an
additional $7 million for the trust fund as appropriated in the reserve
section of the budget. They bring in total funding available from the
general fund in ’14-’15 to $21.6 million for clean water management
trust fund. Additionally the reserve section of the committee report
provides an additional $3 million for a parks and recreation trust fund
so we’re expanding both clean water and part F in the DENR budget this
year. Wildlife resources we’re reducing funding to the wildlife
resources commission by about 9% through the combination of a 2%
management flex reserve and the budgeting of about a million dollars in
additional federal grants so swapping out general fund dollars for
federal grant dollars. In the department of commerce we are establishing
a limited resource communities grant program, it has $1.25 million for
local government sand non-profits to help limited resources communities.
Additionally we’re providing in CDBG funds community development block
grants. The department is directed to provide $637,500 in recurring
funding to draw down additional funds and we’re offsetting positions
from the general fund.</p>

To help advance CDBG funds getting back down to the community level. The
rural economic development grants, the new department in commerce that
helps our rural communities is getting an additional $2.2 million in
non-recurring funds for expansion for rural grants, but this does not
include administrative costs, so we want to make sure that money
actually gets down instead of getting spent in the department for admin.
We want it to get down to our rural communities. And additionally, we
have an apprentice program and $300,000 received from the community
college system to waive fees associated with this apprenticeship
program.  We have various and asundry special provisions dealing with
various items I’d be more than willing to answer any questions about any
special provisions. I know we’re going to have a few amendments. But at
the end of the day I think the NER portion of the budget helps us
advance clean up of coal ash. It helps the department of commerce
re-invest money in additional funds for biotechnology center in our
rural communities and a Main Street solution so we get money from the
state down to our communities so they can help grow jobs, and advance
every sector of the state. So I’d ask your support for the budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. For what purpose does Representative
Lambeth of Forsythe arise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You are recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, the health and human services
appropriations committee has been responsive to the needs of the
citizens of North Carolina, while being fiscally responsible. The
overall HHS budget is $5.1 billion. A decrease from the 14 15 certified
budget of 32 million or .63 percent. The key provisions of the HHS
budget does not change Medicaid eligibility. It includes 9 million of
additional funding for Pre-K, an increase of 13%. It includes an
increase of 5 million for foster care assistance programs, which is an
18% increase in response to an increase in case load. 27 million new
dollars to enhance the child protective services including funds to
reduce county departments of social services case loads. It adds 4
million to fund the health information exchange. It continues to respond
to the mental health needs of our state, with an additional 9.3 million
for crisis service and intervention. It fully funds the school nurses.
It fully funds the Wright School. It supports the governor’s plan to
reform Medicaid with an additional 1 million, rewarding quality, not
quantity. Also authorizes 7.3 million to fund unpaid liabilities the HHS
owes to the local management entities for community mental health. And I
would point out that in the reserve accounts, we’ve also set a 117.8
million dollar reserve for Medicaid for some of the unknowns and the
unexpected. Thank you for allowing me to share that information.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does Representative Daughtry arise?

recognized to speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Speaker. First of all I would like to say I have the finest co-chairs in
the General Assembly, and John Faircloth, Pat Hurley, and Jamie Bowles.
They are outstanding and they are dedicated to making sure that justice
and public safety works in our state. And I am pleased to inform you
that in North Carolina, crime is down and continues to decline. In 2011,
our prisons had 41,030 inmates. Today we have 37,827 inmates. Because of
that decline, we have been able to close 17 prisons since 2011. As far
as juvenile crime goes, in 2001 we had 660 youths in the youth
development centers. Today we have 210. 700 to 210. Arrest in teenagers
under 16 is down by 40%. That’s because the courts have tried different
programs. They’ve got a deferred prosecution program, a first offenders
program, but most of all our justice reinvestment act that we passed
some years ago is working in our state. It allows probation officers to
get the attention of</p>

The offender by quick dip and that three or four days in prison makes
all the difference in the world and we’re very proud of the fact that
our prisons are down and crime is down. As far as our budget goes we
closed two prisons, two women’s prisons, the Fountain Correction Center
for Women and North Piedmont Correction Center for Women. We’ve reduced
the appropriations for the AOC by 6.6%. As far as expansions go I’m
proud to say we increased the funding for the state highway patrol
mashers and clerks staff by having the steps reinstituted. We have a
nonrecurring allocation of $1.8 million. It’s provided to DPS to
purchase vehicles for the due one hundred new probation and parole
officers positions that were funded in the 2013 budget. These are the
probation and parole officers that will be doing the work in the justice
reinvestment act. We funded two dedicated confinement in response to
violation, it’s called CRV facilities, one in Burke County and one in
Robinson County. We increased the state highway patrol uniform budget by
$873,000 to $1.6 million, we want our patrolmen to look good. We
transfer the state bureau of investigation to the department of public
safety. This was done and all the concern was to be sure that the SBI
remains as independent as possible. We believe we’ve accomplished that
by having the director of the SBI appointed for eight year term by the
governor subject to the confirmation by the general assembly and he
cannot be fired except for cause, good cause. We moved all misdemeanors
from the state prison system where they currently are and put them in
the local jails. This is a voluntary program and the sheriff’s
association is in favor of it and those counties that wish to
participate may and those who do not wish to participate may not. These
are some of the highlights of our budget, we are proud of it, we hope
you will support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] For what purpose does Representative Shepard from
Onslow rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To debate the budget sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] You’re recognized to debate the budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Ladies and gentlemen of the house it’s my pleasure also
to speak to you about the transportation budget. We worked real hard on
this and I think we’ve got a real good budget as far as transportation
is concerned. The combined state transportation budget is 3.14 billion,
that’s a 4% increase. The forecast revenue is 3.8% higher than it was
and that’s due to the motor fuels consumption increasing and rebounding
highway use tax. Also the highway fund is an increase of 3.4%, the
highway trust fund is an increase of 5.2%. We will be eliminating 298
positions in DOT of which 270 are already vacant and have been vacant
180 days. This budget also increases contract resurfacing in the state
to 11.5 million which would be 5.5% of the state highway system. It also
provides 50.3 million to the payment preservation fund. It also
increases 8 million to the economic development fund in the state and
that is changed to reoccurring. Also the ??? and municipalities is 9.5
million, an increase of 9.5 million.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Members give your attention to Representative Shepard,
you wouldn’t want to miss anything now. Representative Shepard.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] No we wouldn’t want them to miss anything that’s for
sure. Also and some other highlights in this is we continue funding the
??? programs in the state and with that being said and done we fully
fund the fairies and also we have approximately 7.5 million dedicated
annually to go to rehabilitation replacement of the vessels. Also
something else that we continue to fund is the driver education program,
the transfer to DPI for the high school driver education programs and
that is reoccurring. Finally the strategic privatization program STI
increased 68 million and will continue to increase to 680 million over a
ten year period of time and that’s all I want to share, Representative
Torbett I think will share the rest.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] For what purpose does Representative Torbett of Gason
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Debate the bill Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] You’re recognized to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen
Representative Shepard touched on some and I’ll go over the virtual

One of the large things that we are very pleased about is it improves
road quality standards by restricting the use of tar and gravel
treatment such as chip seal, in favor of other preservation treatments
that produce a smoother surface. And when I say that, that's from
mountain to sea, across the state. It requires D.O.T to report on a
number of lane miles that are not included int hat schedule for lack of
funding and they will report back and we will be looking for funds
needed to fully fund contract resurfacing and pavement preservation
activities. Requires D.O.T to let 60% of contract resurfacing this year
in July and August, which in essence means we're putting the peoples
money to work on the roads faster for them than ever before. That
changes to 70% next year. It establishes a permanent fund for pavement
preservation and sets outsourcing requirements so that 80% of this work
is outsourced in 4 years, pushing more money into the private sector.
Outsourcing a pre-construction activity, we're going to be pushing more
of that into the private sector. We mentioned the removal of fairy toes
on all fairies therefor this body would not be penalizing anyone in
North Carolina simply because you live close to water. That being said,
Mister Speaker, that's the high points and we are available for any
questions.

County arise?
[Speaker Change] To debate the bill.
[Speaker Change] You are recognized to speak on the bill.
[Speaker Change] Thank you Mister Speaker. I have the privilege of
delivering to you the information technology portion of the budget. If
you were in appropriations yesterday, you know I went through this very
quickly. If you were not in appropriations yesterday and you have not
come to see me with any questions about the IT budget, please do prepare
your questions but since most folks know what we did during the last
session in terms of improving IT, I will give you just a highlight real
quick. Just 2 sentences and I will be glad to yield to any questions.
This years general fund appropriation for the information technology
fund and information technology reserve is reduced by 13% from 42
million to 36 million. The information technology internal service fund
which is supported by agency receipts is maintained at 190 million
dollars. We are moving forward with some of our security initiatives. A
refresh as we get away from the old desktops and roll out new desktops
and virtual desktop. And of course working across multiple agencies.

Funds for 3 new positions in state board of elections for investigators

One of the reason is the state requires one to one match, many of you

cannot afford to come up with a 2 hunted thousand match. This could be

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative geiger you ate recognized to explain

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Its read more confusing than it actually is, it's
repelling the repel. If you will currently reallow chancellors to
authorize capital projects up to a million dollars for that board of
governor's approval. This section would reduce that amount to a 3
hundred thousand dollar cap, chancellors would like that cap to remain
in a million dollars has been requested by the UNC system. There are lot
of reasons we talk about fires franker system, elevator system that
waiting three months to get that approved by the board of governor seems
humorous and we would ask that you to support this amendment which
repeals the repeal and keeps the current statics in place with the
million dollar cap ?? take any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion or debate? For what purpose
does representative McGrady from     Henderson rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For two purposes. On the last vote I was here and I

Bill on page 169 line 42 through page 189 line 44 by deleting the lines
and.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative ?? you are recognized to debate you
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, thank you ladies and gentlemen
this is the same amendment that many of you have heard yesterday in
appropriations I have no illusion that taking representative Steven name
off the amendment and put mine not gonna give me any more votes but I
gonna still stand up and try to convince you why this is the wrong
policy to put in the budget and it is a policy and you can tell us
policy because it's 20 some pages of special provisions in order to
accomplishment. Our constitutional system is set up as a system of
cheques and balances we don't necessarily need three branches of
government but the founders thought it would be a good cheque and
balance. And we don't need a house and a Senate we both serve to?? terms
in north Carolina but on most occasions it's a good thing to have
cheques and balances and I want you to look at what we are creating in
the department of public safety. Last session we transferred the state
highway patrol budget from transportation to JPS or department of public
safety. This bill before you today transfers the ?? systems licensing
board to DPS. It transfers the rape crisis and domestic violence center
program for a department of administration to DPS. It transfers animal
welfare from the department of manifestation to DPS. It transfers the
AVC commission budget from commerce to DPS. It transfers AVC ware house
budget from commerce to DPS. It transfers ALV from justice to DPS and
filling the transfers in SBI from justice to DPS. President James
Madison believe that cheques and balanced would protect liberty in a
large republic. We are creating a very very large department very large
indeed. Now what offer and support of moving SBI is that it might save
money and on that I would ask you to look at your budget on page R3 line
11 and tell you that this move we don't know is gonna save us some
money. There was a line at it saying DPS is directed to identify million
dollars and savings so that could be some possible argument the data
belongs in the budget. That's it we can't even tell you where million
dollars gonna be safe what positions gonna be ?? we don't know. Further
it says consolidation of all the major law enforcement agencies in
criminal information sections under DPS should result in additional
savings but again e don't know and that's my point. We want to transfer
so we through into the budget so the majority can't vote against it. And
not even study whether it makes sense financially, legally, public
corruption for whatever reason again I am gonna close with a quote from
president Madison the accumulation of all powers legislative, executive
and judiciary in same hand weather of one a few or many or weather
hereditary, self-appointed or elective may justly be pronounced very
different definition of teary. I am gonna ask you to take this policy
out of the budget listen to law enforcement, listen to our local shares.
We can study it we well be back in January let's see how it might have
fed law enforcement how it might have fed public corruption prosecution
and how much money it might actually save. I'd ask for your support.

cut within Deener, if there's an add-on within the House budget that
wasn't adopted, and add them in the Senate budget that's not adopted. We
are limiting their discretion, but they can't run on those places
because obviously we made a decision that we didn't adopt those cuts
either. And so we are limiting that discretion to make sure that if
there is a state park or a state attraction that was proposed for
closure, in the Senate budget, that was absolutely not adopted, a state
attraction that was in the House budget, the stated for closure, that
was ultimately not adopted then Deener can't run to those state

Forth an amendment. The clerk will read. House Committee Substitute for
Senate Bill 744 is back before the body. Proceed, Representative
Speciale. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Speciale moves to amend the
bill on page 136, line 50 by inserting the following language after that
line. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Speciale is recognized to explain
his amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen, this is a bill to
establish North Carolina commercial fishing resources fund. A little bit
of history here. Last January some fishermen met with legislative
leaders about funding for observers in the large mesh gill net fishery.
Observers are requiring as the result of an agreement between the state
and federal government to protect sea turtles, called an ITP or an
Incidental Take Permit, the provision required by the Federal Endangered
Species Act. The observer program has a price tag of about $1.4 million
annually, and the legislators explained to the fishermen about the
status of the year’s budget, asked if they could go home and figure out
a way to fund half of those costs. So the fishermen agreed, went back to
the coast, talked about it with other fishermen, came up with an idea to
totally fund the observer program by doubling their license fees. They
took the idea to North Carolina fisheries, which is a 60 member trade
organization that has represented commercial fishermen since 1952. After
a four hour debate which was very spirited, the fisheries association
board voted unanimously to endorse the proposal that included the
doubling of six commercial license fees and would generate between 1.4
and 1.6 million dollars. What I’m telling you is that the commercial
fishermen, the people that represent, they came up with a proposal to
double, almost double the cost of the license they have to purchase
every year, in order to fund the observer program. So, what also is in
this bill is a board to ensure that that money is using the way it’s
supposed to be used, and it consists of commercial fishermen from around
the state, representing all areas of the state. That’s the bulk of the
bill, ladies and gentlemen, and I ask you to support it. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] For what purpose does Representative Murray from Wake County
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You
are recognized the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Members, I would ask that you oppose this amendment. This was in the
Senate budget and it was not in the Governor’s budget. And so, I don’t
have any problem with using commercial, increased commercial licensing
fees on the at-sea observer program. We’re doing that in this budget.
That’s what the General Assembly does. The General Assembly appropriates
money. That’s our constitutional responsibility. We don’t set up special
funds and special boards to do that. And so we need to keep the
responsibility of the General Assembly on appropriating money within
this body instead of setting up this special resources board. There is a
similar resources fund within the Division of Marine Fisheries on the
recreational side. I actually had this conversation with Representative
Speciale. We should try to treat both sides similarly. On the marine
fisheries commission we have three commercial representatives. And we
have three recreational representatives. The recreational
representatives help the marine fisheries commission determine how some
of their extra fees are allocated. Instead of setting up a separate
board, what I think we should do and what we’re trying to get to in
conference on this budget item, and what Representative Millis actually
put an amendment in our subcommittee to help study this issue, to make
sure it’s operating fairly and above board. And so what I’d like to see
happen, and I’m more than willing to work on this in conference with
folks from the commercial fishing association. I think they’re great.
They’re great guys. But what I want to make sure, is that we’re treating
both sides fairly. That’s the goal of the marine fisheries commission.
And so if you you’ll look at North Carolina General Statute 113-175.1,
it clearly designates how the marine resources fund is allocated. It has
control over it with the treasurer, and it also makes sure that the
director of the marine fisheries commission has ultimate say in this.
That’s what the marine fisheries commission is for, to help</p>

For what purpose does Representative McElraft from Carteret arise?
[Speaker changes]
To speak on the amendment.
[Speaker Changes]
The Lady is recognized to speak on the amendment.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr. Chair. While I agree with the amendment, in a way I agree
with this language, because it is different really from the recreational
fishing license in that the State set this license. This was a group of
commercial fisherman that put this fee on themselves. But there are some
issues that staff has brought to our attention, so if we vote this
amendment down, it will go into conference. We can get those issues
straightened out, because I don't like exactly the way it's written the
way the Senate has done it. So if I promise you if we will work this to
where the commercial fisherman are happy with it once we get it into
conference. But we will take out the issues that staff had with it, and
I truly do think there are some issues with it with the way the money
will be handled. We'll make sure that marine fisheries'  Louis Daniel is
with it -- everyone will be happy. And that we will do it ethically with
the money. And will make sure the state treasurer, everybody, everything
-- The flow of the money is good.
But I will promise the commercial fisherman that we will protect the
money that they voted themselves to put in this fee. And it will be used
specifically and only for putting these turtle observers on their boats,
and not for other general fun things, so I ask you to vote no on this
amendment, so that it will be in contention, and we can do it right.
[Speaker Changes]
To what purpose does Representative Tine of Dare arise?
[Speaker Changes]
To debate on the amendment.
[Speaker Changes]
You are recognized to debate the amendment.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you, sir. This one's a difficult situation, because it's got long
history that Representative Speciale just barely alluded to in regards
to it. And one of the things that I think our commercial fisherman are
most sensitive to is each time they've come to the table and they give a
little bit, they end up with something that they didn't think they were
gonna get. And that, respectfully to the Chairs, I don't know what the
problems that staff have said, and there might very well be. So that
needn't be addressed. But my concern is that once we take the language
out and it then goes behind doors and we have two chairs that are
working in our best interests that perhaps we may not get to where we
need to on the back-end, so this is unfortunately one of those burden
the hands that I ask that you vote yes to make sure that we have this in
there. If we need to do some tweaks to it, we always have the
corrections that we run at the end, and we can do some language tweaks.
This just shows the folks that made a good-faith effort to raise the
funds themselves for this program that we're still with them.

To what purpose does Representative Pittman of Cabarrus arise?
[Speaker Changes]
To ask Representative Speciale a question.
[Speaker Changes]
Representative Speciale, do you yield?
[Speaker Changes]
I yield.
[Speaker Changes]
Representative, when the fishermen agreed to this hike in their fees, do
you understand it to have been that they had the understanding that this
board being established would have been part of that agreement?
[Speaker Changes]
That's correct, this is part of the package that was presented. We will
allow you to charge us almost double, they've got the fee schedule in
there. But this The board we want to set up to make sure the money that
is left over after the observer program is taken care of be used for the
advancement of commercial fishing. So it only makes sense that
commercial fisherman from around the state get put on this board.
[Speaker Changes]
Follow up, Mr. Speaker?
[Speaker Changes]
Follow up.
[Speaker Changes]
So that being the case, would you say that if we hike the fee without
establishing the board, they're sort of getting a bait-and-switch, or
something to that effect?
[Speaker Changes]
I do, that was the agreement. All the folks that were involved, Deaner,
there were...</p>

a list of them somewhere but I have so much paper on my desk. But every
body involved had agreed to the fact that they would do the board... do
the fee hike. One of the concerns,..one of the concerns on that board
was oversight and the oversight would be the head of Deanor[sp] Period.
[Speaker changed] May I speak on the amendment?
[Speaker changed] Gentleman's recognized to speak on the amendment.
[Speaker changed] Thank you. Sounds clear to me that these gentlemen or
folks did make an arrange... an agreement in good faith expecting this
board to be part of the arrangement. And I think we'd be double-crossing
them to raise their fees and not establish this board that they
understood would be part of the agreement. So I am in favor of the
amendment. Thank you.
[Speaker changed] For what purpose does Cleveland of Onslow arise?
[Speaker changed] To speak on the amendment.
[Speaker changed] You are recognized to speak on the amendment.
[Speaker changed] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm in favor of this
amendment. The commercial fishermen in this state are in dire straits.
Our fisher industry is choking to death. These gentlemen stood up and
said, &quot;We're forced to have these observers on our boats. The state
can't afford the money to do it; we'll do it.&quot; And I think they
have the perfect right to have their representatives overlook that fund
and make sure it's used properly. If there are problems with it, moving
forward, it could come back and we could address the problems. But I
would encourage you to vote for the amendment.
[Speaker changed] For what purpose does Representative of Iller of
Brunswick arise?
[Speaker changed] To speak on the amendment.
[Speaker changed] You're recognized to speak on the amendment.
[Speaker changed] Since my county's also mentioned in here, I'd better
speak to the amendment. I agree with what Representative Cleveland said.
Every time they come to the table, they seem to come away short-handed
particularly versus the Recreational Fishers Handle people who are
trying to get them to change their nets to be sure not one turtle will
pay the price for million of pounds of fish. So Im'a support the
amendment. If it has to go to conference, if it has to be tweaked, in
future legislatures, then so be it. Thank you.
[Speaker changed] For what purpose does Representative Speciale of
Craven arise?
[Speaker changed] To speak a second time on the amendment.
[Speaker changed] You're recognized to speak a second time.
[Speaker changed] The...this agreement was endorsed by Demner[sp]and all
nine members of the Marine Fishers Commission. It's a good deal. One,
one of the concerns the staff had, again, was this board, six member
board, of folks that are not government officials, okay, being involved
in determining what the remainder of this tax money will go to. The bet
has been ?? the bill because the decision is not theirs alone. It has to
be...the Marine Fishers has to also sign off on anything...any plans for
the future they have for what will help the industry and what this
remaining money might be spent on. So I think it's a good deal. I think
it's great that the citizen's involved in a problem within the state
have stepped up to the plate, come up with their own ideals on how to
fix it, are willing to pool their own money out of their pocket to take
care of it. And I think we should support our commercial fishermen by
supporting this amendment.
[Speaker changed] For what purpose does Representative Murray of Wake
arise?
[Speaker changed] To debate the amendment a second time.
[Speaker changed] You're recognized to debate the amendment a second

[Speaker changed] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The report that Representative
Speciale is referring to actually recommended more fees than what we're
doing in the budget. They wanted to double....they wanted to double the
fees that we increased in the first year of the budget. What we did, we
went, before the fees were increased we went, we doubled that fee. So
the amount of money that's being collected...collected here just about,
exactly, funds the At Sea Observer Program, which is why this fee has
been increased. The purpose of this fee was to increase, was to fund the
At Sea Observer program. Commercial fishermen can not fish if we don't
have that observers due to a federal mandate that's unfunded. So one of
the ways we're funding it is through this fee increase. It's a wash. It
is a wash. There is no extra money being talked about. This special fund
could very well be populated with no money. We're spending the exact
increase on the At Sea Observer Program and my contention is that we
need to use the existing structure of the Marine Fishery Commission
similar to how we treat recreational fishermen and any additional funds
in their ??</p>

We need to treat them the same. There’s no special fund for recreational
fishermen with a board of recreational fishermen on it. That does not
exist. We use the marine fisheries commission to do that so we should
treat both sides of the equation similarly which is the goal of the
marine fishers commission, it was our goal as chairs of the NER working
on this budget, and I can tell you, if we going to increase fees to
commercial fishermen their fees should go to help improve their
industry. That’s what we’re doing in this budget, that’s the purpose of
the marine fisheries commission. I would ask that you oppose this

what this amendment does. This is the other part of the policy that I
think is in the budget. For those of you who don’t know what this
provision does it sweeps out all our deputy commissioners and industrial
commission over the next eighteen months. First we’re taking the SBA
rights and then we’re sweeping them out. I think it’s just bad policy to
fire 15 or so people and I’d ask your support on the amendment. Thank

Wants to expand that to be 8 year terms. So that's what we're really
talking about here is whether you think it's better to have, 1. Do you
think they should have terms or not? The only way to go to a term for
these deputy commissioners is to sweep the board. I don't know how you
get there without doing that. These are quasi-judicial officers. There's
no appointment process, there's no election. The full commissioners are
completely opposite. They have basically the same rule, so we're trying
to institute a level of accountability through an appointment process
with terms and the only way to get there is to sweep the board. And it's
not an overnight sweep at all, it's staggered. I would ask that you
oppose this amendment to help us have a fair and balanced industrial
commission with a term that's long enough to transcend politics of 8
years will get you through a Governor. And so if we ever re-elect a
Governor but this will help keep politics out of the industrial
commission and have a good long term and the only way to get there is to
have a good long board and so I ask that you oppose the amendment.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier moves to amend the bill on page
56 lines 28 and 29 by inserting the following sub-sections between those
lines.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to explain his amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker and I apologize to
the Chair, the Co-chairs. I haven’t had a chance to get this to them,
but I will explain it and if there is any concern, I’ll be glad to
temporarily displace it. In the changes that have been made yesterday to
the budget that create for prospective teachers. Those who are going to
be getting 1 year contracts and then 1, 2 and 4 year contracts. Those
who’d have been hired from now on. We have eliminated because there has
been a lot of change in the statutes. We eliminated a lot of their
rights. What the existing law would provide is that for anybody who’s
non-renewed and they have a right to at least grieve to their school
board, there is no formal process that is they’re not entitled to
counsel, they’re not entitled to examination of witnesses, they’re not
entitled to appeal. But you do have a right to at least explain to the
boards. The board knows if they’re contesting their termination and then
the board can simply vote to uphold the superintendence termination.
Under the changes we’ve made, we haven’t given that right that exists
now and in there at all. So, right now, I want a teacher under the new
statute we’re putting in place is non-renewed when their 1 or 2 or 4
year contract expires. They have no right to grieve to anybody. I don’t
think that’s what was intended. We don’t wanna put in, and I assume that
nobody wants to put in a full due process hearing. But they ought to
have the right to at least be able to be heard when they’re being fired
and that may be a five minute discussion but they ought have the right
to put on the record what their concern is and let the board say Aye or
Nay. Again, this doesn’t create any due process rights at all of how
that hearing should be held, doesn’t make it formal, doesn’t make it
recorded, doesn’t do anything except to say what they’ve always had the
process to do. Let me at least tell you why I think I shouldn’t be
fired. It seems to me a pretty basic concern and pretty limited and we
ought to do that. And again, it creates absolutely no right to appeal,
no right of a due process, formal hearing, no right of a counsel, no
right of evidence, no right of anything except to be allowed to be heard
and I would hope we would give them that right. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Glazier. Thank you for your
comments but do you not think they deserve due process, even teachers
coming in?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I do but I’m trying to find at least a bare
minimum ground to stay with what the process is now that they would have
a right and I think we ought to, in a subsequent amendment, talk about
expanding that. But, for me, I’m trying to at least give them a base
opportunity to be heard which is what it is now and I don’t wanna try to
expand it given the circumstances we’re under but I agree with you in
every way but that’s not what I’m doing with this amendment. I’m trying
to do step 1 and we’re talking steps 2 and 3.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does Representative Elmore of Wilkes
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You are recognized to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Currently the teachers that are entering the
profession are on yearly contracts. They do not obtain tenure until year
four, granted by the local entity. So, anybody that is currently in this
situation knows upfront that all they are guaranteed is a year contract.
That’s the current system right now and we’re not dealing with tenure
legislation in our house budget. So, any teacher that is tenured right
now will still have all of these. What he’s trying to do is extend that
down to new hires which already know that it’s only going to be a year
contract. That’s already the policy. So, I would urge you not to support
this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does Representative McGrady of
Henderson rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You are recognized to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Elmore stated one of my concerns. This
is a matter that we have taken up before. We have set in place, a
process whereby a teacher can petition for a hearing but we don’t
require the local board to grant such a hearing. I think, I agree with
Representative Glazier that this is a discussion that we need to have
about what the process ought to be but we ought not to have it in the
middle of the budget document in the short session and so I’ll
personally make a commitment to have that discussion but I do urge the
members to vote against the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does Representative Brian of
Mecklenburg rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the amendment sponsor a question
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Representative Glazier, I just
wanted if there have been any conversation about the burden this might
put on local boards from an automatic appeal right to them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, the answer is yes and no. That is not in detail
because, obviously we’ve had a day and a half to be having those
conversations and that makes it awfully difficult given what’s occurred.
Secondly, what I can speak to is, and those who are former board members
I think can speak too, the vast majority of times when you have
terminations, although that may increase with the new system; they’re
worked out. You do the resignation and everybody has these informal
discussions and for all kinds of reasons, the teacher ends up resigning
and we all know how that works. In the few cases where it doesn’t, then
obviously they have a right to be heard and that’s the end of it. This
doesn’t create any process beyond that but since we’re now putting this
new system in place, it goes into effect now and that’s the problem.
Representative McGrady may be right and I’m not trying to write the
whole system into this but we are in this budget saying for all the
teachers hired after the budget goes into effect, they are under this.
It’s not like we have time to write a whole new system because you all
are putting a new system into this. And so, at a minimum all this says,
all this does is say that the teacher has a right to be heard, it may be
for 5 minutes, it may be, that’s all the board has to do but they at
least ought to have to hear the teacher who says I’m being wrongfully
fired. They don’t have to grant her counsel, they don’t have to give her
evidence, they don’t have to do any of that but for the life of me I
can’t understand why we wouldn’t let the teacher have her 5 minutes
before board as the one sort of ?? process and if there’s a problem, we
can come back next year and fix it but this is going into effect now and
I think teachers at least given everything that’s happened to them,
deserve for us to say “Alright, we’ll at least give you this amount and
then we’ll figure it out and any more detail one way or another next
session”. This is going into effect now, we don’t get to wait till next
session.

In this era of teacher shortages. And as we are attempting to recruit
more professionalism in our teaching arena that it’s just common
courtesy that we, in turn, be professional in our deportment and
relationship to the teachers. It’s just a matter of giving a hearing to
them. I think we owe them at least that. I don’t know what harm comes to

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does Representative Speciale of Craven arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’re recognized to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I”m just trying to ascertain from the bill sponsor, are we talking about
firings or are we talking about contract renewals? Because a contract
renewal, when you decide not to renew a contract, that is not firing
somebody. That’s simply not renewing a contract.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier, do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly, Mister Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you and thank you for the question. Under the new process going
forward, they are granted one year and then one, two, and four year
contracts possibilities. Then there is non-renewal of those contracts
under which, currently when you are a teacher and you a non-renewed
before you had career status, you got notified. Some districts then
created  processes how to deal with it, some did not. But at a minimum,
most districts, I think I would say, at least allow the teacher to be
heard and then they went ahead and did what they were going to do.
Again, most of these are worked out, there’s a reason why they’re being
non-renewed. But for those where there is a real contest, where there’s
been a personality issue, or there’s things that probably ought to be
heard, and we having nothing in this new system that allows them to
really do that. And we can fix this. There’s going to be very little
non-renewal between now and the long session. So all this is saying to
teachers is, we get it, we know we have to do something. For the one or
two cases that may come up between now and when we come back in long
session, you’ll at least have the right to be heard. And then we can
meet and put whatever process, full or little, needs to be in place. But
right now we got zero.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. But would you acknowledge that a not renewing a contract is
not necessarily a firing? Because the contract says one year or two
years and that’s all you should expect until if and when it comes time
for you to renew.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I certainly agree that a non-renewal is not a firing. It is often in
places a precursor substitute for, “we’re going to do this, and we can
do this the easy way or the hard way.”

For what purpose does Representative Meyer of Orange arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’re recognized to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The creation of due process rights for teachers was established in the
late nineteenth, early twentieth century because there was often in
school districts the creation of arbitrary rules introduced at the
school level that would be used to fire a teacher who was not actually
in violation of any law. That has become something more extensive over
time obviously. But if we think about law that has been passed by this
legislature, this session, we passed a bill that would allow a teacher
to join with a student led prayer. If a school wishing to set a
different set of polices within in their school said, “Our rule in the
school to avoid any issues with student led prayer in our school is that
teachers need to leave the classroom whenever a student led prayer is
introduced.” And then a teacher said, “No, I have the legal right to
stay in the classroom and join with those students.” If the school
decided to dismiss that teacher, without any due process rights, that
teacher would be dismissed from the school having not actually broken
the law that we would have put in place to protect them. This amendment
does not go so far as to reinstate all due process rights that we’ve
taken away from teachers, but it does give back to a teacher the right
to sit down for a five minutes with an administrator in the school
district or an appointee of the board and say, “I do believe I was
acting within my legal rights to stay in the classroom. I should have
been allowed to do so.” And that gives them the opportunity to raise the
right to the higher point of power and speak up on their behalf. I
support the amendment.

See if President Glazier, would you answer that question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And President Glazier, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] President Glazier, I think you know me well enough,
I’m truly trying to understand the wording in your amendment, here. I
keep reading the word, non renewal but, I keep hearing debate on the
word firing and dismissal, and I’m wondering, can you envision a
situation, probably not in my county, maybe not in yours, where in Wake
County, if there are 4 or 500 non renewed teachers in any given year,
that all these teacher could request a hearing before the school board,
how that would be a complication to the school board? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I think, we can envision a scenario in the most outlandish of
circumstances but, that’s never, that’s not gonna happen, that’s not the
nature of how these things come up. Most teachers who are non renewed
are in their first, second and third years now, because now we are
extending it past that. There’s a pretty good basis, everyone knows,
there’s not a contest over it, the teacher’s given some notice, but in
the rare cases, and it was rare, and probably in the 6 years I served on
the school board, we probably had three calls to be heard. They were, in
two of those three cases, pretty legitimate. What is happening, it’s not
a firing, [??] absolutely right. It’s not a pure dismissal, but what’s
happening is, what Representative Meyer said could be, the reason I’m
not renewing is because you disobeyed my order about getting out of the
classroom when the prayer was going on. Under our changes we’ve made,
there’s really no way for that teacher to be heard, unless they decide,
at this point, nothing really allows that to happen. All I’m trying to
do is to fill in the gap until January, to allow a teacher the right,
and I think it’s gonna be rare, to allow that teacher the right to be
heard. Again, it can be limited to five minutes, but at least the issue,
she’s at least had a chance to tell the board what the problem was. They
may say, don’t agree, on we go. I don’t think you’re gonna have any rush
or glut of these cases, and as I suggested, because we’re gonna be back
in January, we ought to then take time to fix it and figure out, listen
to the school boards, and figure out a process, whatever that process is
gonna be. In the meantime, there ought to be something, and they ought
to know, given everything that’s happening, that at least we understand
they have the right to be heard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak to amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [??]  to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I respectfully, disagree,
maybe not in the numbers that may come forward, but in the possibility
of turning the school board meeting into a political platform and other
things that can go on if they are forced to give them a hearing. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What purpose does Representative Elmore of Wilkes
arise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I speak a second time to the amendment, and
I’ll do this quickly, I don’t want to get too far into the weeds.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re recognized to speak a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You’re getting painted a
perception that a teacher could just automatically be dismissed with the
principal walking through the door, and saying, get out of the building.
A new hire that comes in knows that they have a year contract. In that
year contract, they have to be evaluated four times on our new
evaluation system, which has over 36 checkpoints where the principal has
direct communication with the teacher, speaking with them, where the
teacher can make a formal response back to the principal on their
comments, and even attaching documentation. That’s guaranteed, and the
principal has the option to do additional observations if they choose
to. So, you’re being painted a picture that it’s an environment where
there’s no communication between the employee and the principal, and
that the administration is going to go after teachers. It is set up in
part of their duties to create that line of communication between the
employee and the principal by regulations, so that the protections are
in place. So, this environment where a teacher is never communicated
with, is automatically fired when they come through the door is a very
inaccurate portrayal. They even admitted,  they used the term extreme,
and rare. It’s not set up that way. This is not the time or place with
this amendment to be dealing with this. I would urge you not to support
the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What purpose is Representative Brandon of Guilford
arise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment just briefly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You may now speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I listened to debate, I was a little bit nervous about
the amendment because, Representative Elmore makes very good points, we
don’t wanna look at things, and just make things a political platform at
the school board, and things like that, but this amendment, basically
just gives basic due process that pretty much, every single business
across this state, anybody that does business with anyone</p>

[Speaker Changes] You want your employees to have some type of due
process and whether you are a contract employee or a non contract
employee, I think everybody deserves some type of recourse to be able to
say something and it will be extreme and it will be rare just as
representative Elmore [sp] said, these cases portrayal of some of the
rhetoric is not true. I don't think it's the rhetoric that believe that
in extreme rare cases there are personality conflicts, there are
situations that we have where we would actually need this in place and I
think that my gentleman that spoke earlier, Representative Ilend [sp],
he spoke very very clear about that, about one of the extreme cases that
could happen whenever you talk about a teacher that wants to pray with
their kids. These are all extreme rare occasions but that is the whole
reason why we come here every year. We have to make laws. I made laws
when I first got here on how many chickens you can carry because someone
evidently carried too many chickens. So, we do this. This is why we make
law and even if it's rare and even if it's extreme, that person needs
protection also so I urge you to support the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] For what purpose does Representative Collins of Nash
[sp] arise?
[Speaker Changes] To ask Representative Glasier [sp] a question.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Glasier [sp], do you yield?
[Speaker Changes] Yes sir.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Glasier [sp], and again I don't
understand this completely so I want ot make sure I get an understanding
of it. You keep talking about this new system, the old system, new
system, old system. I was kind of under the impression that the first 3
years a teacher was hired, they were kind of hired at the pleasure of
their employer and then after they reached tenure status there was a
difference. And unless i'm reading this wrong, we're looking here at
line 5 where you're starting to make the change. The right to petition
for hearing? It looks like the current situation is they have a right to
apply for a hearing but they don't necessarily have to receive it. Is
that correct or not?
[Speaker Changes] There's multi parts to your question, Representative
Collins. Remember we do have or if this budget passes if the senate
concurs, we end up with these provisions. We've now created a 2 tier
system. We're correctly I think obeying the court order so anybody who
is currently a teacher would be under the old system with career status
in place. Very different statutes. Anyone who is hired prospectively
will be under the new system. What you're looking at are some statutory
changes that were put in place last year to put in place the new system
that only now applies to prospective teachers. So that is why there is a
double issue going on. This is only applying to the prospective
teachers. The former teachers have their own set of system and rules in
place as career status. Secondly, under the former system your first
couple years are probationary years and you can be non-renewed under
each of those years until you reach career status and then different
reasons. Cause comes into play. The new system offers 1, 2 and 4 year
contracts based on a number of principles but in some regards a
subjective discretion of the principle and the superintendent on the
board. So you're putting teachers in a very different position not only
from the get go but for those teachers who are 1,  2 and 4 year
contracts. Not just the first 3 probationary years. We have a very
different system going. We haven't I would say because of the time and
the rush and the changes that have occurred, there hasn't been a whole
lot of perfection of this system. And all i'm trying to do is fill in a
gap until we can really look at this issue, as Representative McGrady
[sp] is correct. We need to in January. In the meantime, a teacher who
is in the rare case, and I think that's what we are talking about, ought
to at least have the right to be heard as a matter of law and then the
board can do what it's going to do .
[Speaker Changes] Follow up.
[Speaker Changes] But we are then saying, I am correct I believe in
understanding that this amendment is asking for a new guaranteed right
for teachers at least in their first 3 years that they had not had
previously. Is that correct?
[Speaker Changes] I think it's asking for them to have a right to be
heard, which is generally what occurs in many districts but it is
changing that aspect. But again we're in a very different system. It's
not the 3 year probationary as you understand. It creates far more
uncertainty for everybody in that new system right from the get go and
that I think is a concern i'm trying to allay a little bit with this
until we can figure out how better to do that in January.</p>

The gentleman is recognized to speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think it’s clear we are indeed creating a new right for at least
teachers in their first three years. Now if we want to go back and do
something later to deal with people who’ve had four-year contracts and
now in their fifth year, I certainly would be willing to listen to that,
but I think it’s pretty clear here folks, we are establishing a new

Representative Goodman is recognized to explain his amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES’]
Thank you, Mister Speaker. This amendment simply renews ten million
dollars that was appropriated for  the Opportunities Scholarship Act or
vouchers and returns it to DPI for to modify classroom teacher
allocations in grade two and three. If I could debate the amendment I
would just like to say that we’ve heard all the arguments, for and
against the voucher program but my argument, the reason I want it
removed is that it violates constitution of the state that says, “Public
education funds will be used only for public schools.” And the courts
have weighed in on this, and until those constitutional questions are
answered, I think we should not be spending state money here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does Representative Stam of Wake arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman is recognized to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Part of my amendment could be a point of order but I rather have a vote
on it. He takes that ten million and then spends it somewhere else. But
unfortunately for Representative Goodman the fiscal memorandum shows
that that ten million saves us 11.6 million. So rather than spend it
somewhere else, he really needs to find something else to cut. Others
will speak to the merits of it. I just wanted to point that out so you
realize what you’re actually doing here is loosing money.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I answer Representative Stam’s point please, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would you not speak a second time and this will be your last.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To answer to his point, we discuss this with staff and staff says that’s
not so. They say it’s a ten for ten swap. So staff disagrees. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does Representative Bryan of Mecklenburg arise again?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’re recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mister Speaker. First I would say, that only in this county,
due to the technical amendment we’ve made, is that actually correct. It
would be a two million dollar savings, I believe, in the next fiscal
year. Which means there’s a two million dollar cut it would have to make
based on the savings. I’m not going to go through all the long
conversations we’ve had before. How we’ve talked a lot and debated this
issue a lot. Let me just clarify though, this is a scholarship for low
income kids that do not have good options. We have had over five
thousand families apply in a very brief window of time. And this
scholarship will unfortunately only allow about half of those families
the opportunity they need. But I urge you to let them have that
opportunity and to vote down this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does Representative Brandon of Guilford arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would like to ask the colleagues if we would please vote down this
amendment. As a sponsor of this bill, I would like for you to know that
Representative Goodman said that there were some constitutional issues.
I would remind you of our constitutional responsibility, which is to
make sure that we provide a quality education for every single child in
this state. And we have numbers and we have data that shows for
thirty-five, forty years that there are particular segments of our
population that have not been receiving a quality education. And that
it’s not because we have bad teachers, and it’s not because we have bad
principals, it’s because we have a bad system. And we’re trying to fix
that. And a lot of my colleagues would like to engage into a fantasy
conversation. And that fantasy being, as long as we continue to invest
into public education, everything will be fine. Well, we’ve been having
that conversation for the better part of fifty years, and the only
people that suffer from it is the people that live in my community.  And
so if you’re going to really do your constitutional duty, you will
understand that the constitution provides you the right to make sure
that you provide a quality education for every child. It’s interesting
to me that we have decided that this particular bill is
unconstitutional, when Representative Goodman and others who are against
this bill voted for the special needs scholarship. which is exactly the
same exact bill.</p>

And I will tell you that my children may not roll up in school with an
IEP and they might not come to school with a wheelchair but the needs
are indeed special and we owe it in this body to make sure that we
provide that same opportunity that we did with children with special
needs. The same thing that we do for children in pre-K and ???, that
folks is a voucher program. That’s a voucher program, people could take
money from the state and they can go to whatever preschool and whatever
daycare they want to go to and it doesn’t matter if it’s religious or
it’s not. I will be very careful about saying this is unconstitutional
because we do it in every facet of education except in K-12. We do it in
higher education, we do it in pre-K, we do it everywhere, but somehow
we’re manipulated to think that because somehow we want to give kids in
my community the same opportunity that we give special needs, the same
opportunity with give preschoolers, and the same opportunities we give
higher ed kids that somehow it is unconstitutional. I will let you know
there is nothing unconstitutional about giving poor and minority
children the same exact opportunity as every other children. Nothing
unconstitutional about it. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you. For what purpose does Representative Glazier
of Cumberland arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To debate the amendment Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
Today we confront a frighteningly bizarre question. Does article 9,
section 6 allow what its text plainly prohibits? Needless to say, except
that this budget obliges us to say it, the question answers itself. I
think a little constitutional history might be in order for a
constitutional decision that doesn’t relate at all to preschools or
colleges because of course those who have read the constitution know the
provisions don’t apply to them, they apply only to K-12. That being
said, it ought to be that we think about this. This is not the policy
debate, we’ve had that, we agree or disagree on whether vouchers will
solve it. But we now have a court decision stayed only because of a writ
of supersedeas that has nothing to do with the merits, in fact if you
read what a writ of supersedeas is it’s simply to stay the decision so
there can be a more legitimate discussion at the court on the merits
before the decision is made and in fact the trial will be had on the
merits and I suspect the trial courts injunction will eventually be
upheld on the merits, but we at least ought to know the argument because
that’s what at issue here so I’m going to make it and I’m going to ask
for your consideration on the merits of the legal issue, not the policy
of vouchers. Others can make that back and forth and we’ve done it in
this chamber quite a bit. Article 1 section 15 of the constitution of
North Carolina states the people have a right to privilege of education
and it is the duty of the state to guard and maintain it. The meaning of
that is specified in article 9. Here’s the language of article 9,
section 2: he general assembly shall provide by taxation and otherwise
for a general and uniform system of free public schools and article 9,
section 6 then sets forth exactly how the state is to do that and at the
end of that article it says as to the money that can be used and
together with so much of the revenue of the state as may be set apart
for that purpose shall be faithfully appropriated and used exclusively
for establishing and maintaining a uniform system of free public
schools.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] For what purpose does Representative Hastings rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To see if Representative Glazier would yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Glazier would you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I do not yield at this time Representative Hastings but
I’ll be delighted to when I finish.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] He does not yield at this time. Continue Representative
Glazier.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The 1868 constitution committed to the state providing
education through a general and uniform system of public schools. At
that time article 9 section 4 obliged us to fund public schools quote to
an irreducible education fund which shall be faithfully appropriated for
establishing and perfecting in the state a system of free public
schools. In 1875 section 4 was amended so that state revenues could be
expended quote for the purposes of education quote..</p>

<p id="165:00">
… faithfully appropriated for establishing a state system of free and
public schools. Well we all know the history of what happened in our
state and in much of our country between the later 1800s and 1955, and
in 1955, the North Carolina General Assembly appointed, as a result of
Brown vs Board of Education, the Pearsall Commission, which in order
avoid to some extent school integration recommended this General
Assembly enact a voucher program that provided taxpayer-funded grants
for use in public schools for kids who were otherwise assigned to an
integrated public school. The General Assembly enacted that Pearsall
Plan in 1956 and amended the Constitution, or allowed to be authorized
under new section 12 that notwithstanding any other provision of the
Constitution, the General Assembly can provide for those vouchers, very
specifically. A decade later, in litigation and federal court, the
Pearsall Plan and article 9, section 12 were struck down. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] For what purpose does Representative Szoka rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I thought we were debating
the amount that was being appropriated, not the policy, and I don’t see
how Representative Glazier’s explanation right now relates to the
appropriation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Point of order taken. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker… [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
It directly relates to it because what Representative Goodman is doing
is saying the ten million is being unconstitutionally appropriated and
needs to be put to a constitutionally appropriate space. I think that in
a few minutes, my argument will end and people will be able to vote, but
we ought to be able to make the reason for Representative Goodman’s
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Proceed. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. So the Pearsall Plan was struck down by the federal courts. As
a result of that, and this is the key, in 1968, the State Constitution
was amended. Article 12 that allowed for the vouchers was removed,
section 12 was replaced, section 4 and section 6 were changed, and the
wording we now have came into play, which is unlike almost any other
state constitution in the country, and it says that the money we expend
here for public education, for education of the public, has to be
faithfully appropriated and used exclusively for establishing and
maintaining a uniform system of free public schools. Whatever else we
can say, it is only a tortured reading of the Constitution that could
suggest that money that goes to families to allow them to make choices
to send their children to private school with the taxpayer-funded
voucher is money used exclusively for the establishment of public
schools. It is precisely this point that the trial judge enjoined us on,
and yet here we are today attempting to go for yet another
constitutional issue with it. There is lots of discussion we can have
about the policy, and it is up to the public though. We have sometimes
forget that the Constitution takes some issues away from us. That’s the
purpose of it, to remove certain issues from public debate. It may be
the public wants vouchers, it may be they don’t, but because we have
this constitutional provision, if you want as the majority to have
vouchers in this state, there is only one way to do it, and I would vote
for you to do this. Put an amendment on the ballet that asks the state
to revise the Constitution, take out the word “exclusively”. You do
that, you get the public to vote for it, then we can put in place a
voucher policy by statute or otherwise. You leave that word in as it is,
the public has taken this issue from us, and this is the public’s
Constitution, not ours, and there are some things that they have removed
from the policy debate, and this is it, and Representative Goodman is
exactly right. This is not a policy discussion; this is a constitutional
law discussion, and eventually the justices of the Supreme Court I think
– and unfortunately you are doing a dis-justice to them because we have
put this in their laps in a political year, and that is unfortunate, but
I expect they will come up with the right answer when all is said and
done because there is no other way to read the word “exclusively”. Now
Representative Stam would argue because you’re putting 11.6 million
dollars back in the budget that that’s going to undo the problem,
recognizing the trial court might have been right and trying to create a
way around it.</p>

other public funds can be used to fund non-exclusive public schools.
That's not what the constitution says and it doesn't say what's in the
public education fund. It says taxpayer funds must be used exclusively.
There is no way to get around that. We can argue all we want about
vouchers, but as we said on the floor last year and as the trial court
is now affirmed and I believe will eventual be affirmed up the chain. We
have put in place something that is unconstitutional. There's only one
way to get the policy you want and it's to do it the right way, amend
the constitution, then create your voucher program, but for now
Representative Goodman is exactly correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does Representative Stam of Wake
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak a second time on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Your recognized to speak a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And I ask you to vote no. In the lawsuit I filed a 46
page affidavit, but I'm not going to go over it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thankfully.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll email it to you. Representative Glazier filed a
long affidavit and he's just wrong on this. Let me tell you why he's
wrong. If you have you're constitution, because I want you to feel good
about the fact that you're following the constitution when you are. But
if you're in Article 9, first of all there's a provision, religion,
morality, and knowledge being necessary to good government and the
happiness of mankind, schools shall forever be encouraged. So we've got
to have these public schools to help, to do religion and morality.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker
[SPEAKER CHANGES] School attendance. I'll yield later. That every child
shall attend the public schools unless educated by other means. So from
the beginning, we've recognized private education. Now we go to the
state school fund, to which Representative Glazier sites, but he's
completely wrong on the source of the money involved. If you have your
money report today, the blue thing. This is under the UNC system, not,
but you won't see it here, it was in last years money report, but it's
not under the public schools at all. It's under the UNC system and
allocated to the State Education Assistance Authority, which is the same
one that disperses money to Merideth, and Duke, and 35 other private
colleges. So the whole, in other words, when he looks at the
constitution, Article 9, Section 6, it says the last 4 lines if you're
in this little book, together with so much of the revenue of the state
as may be set apart for that purpose. This 10 million was never set
apart for that purpose of the K-12. It never entered that system
whatever, whenever, ever. The entire predicate of their constitutional
lawsuit is based upon a misunderstanding by some of our budget process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What purpose does Representative Warren of Rowan rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative Stam would yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representatvie Stam, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam, when I was working on the Voter
ID Bill, I ran across a lot of things in the constitution that we don't
adhere to like the literacy act or requirement in Section 6 of the
statement in Section 8 of Article 6 that you're ineligible to run for
office if you don't profess a belief in god, but looking at Article 9 in
Section 2 the constitution states the General Assembly shall provide
that every child of appropriate age and sufficient mental and physical
ability shall attend the public schools unless educated by other means.
Now since you have identified a different source of the funding,
wouldn't this other means opportunity, scholarships, qualify as the
other means that we're referring to in the constitution?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Exactly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Horn, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the Bill, or Amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the Amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, thank goodness I'm not a constitutional scholar
or a legal scholar or an attorney or anything else like that. Thank
goodness, I am a grandpa and a father and I want a good education for my
kids. And I suspect everyone in here wants a good education for their
children and grandchildren. I think everyone in here agrees that not
everything works for everybody. I think everyone in here agrees that not
every child learns the same thing at the same rate or in the same way.
It just doesn't happen. So this General Assembly took that challenge 2
years ago to address that issue. That</p>

Not everything works for everyone. We came up with a solution that
allowed folks that didn’t have the means that unlucky enough to have. If
my kids aren’t getting a good education or my grandchildren aren’t
getting a good education someplace, I’m fortunate enough I have the
means to send them someplace else, but there’s a lot of really hard
working people in this state that don’t have those means. I’m not going
to really carry this on to any length of time. We don’t have I think the
patience, we’ve already debated the sense of the issue, but we made a
decision two years ago. We committed ourselves to a system and now we’re
funding the system in the budget as we had committed. I am not a
constitutional lawyer thank God, I am a grandpa, and I want my kids to
get a good education and I want kids from poor families across this
state to have an opportunity for their kids to get a good education.
Please vote down this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Hastings please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To see if Representative Glazier would yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Glazier does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Certainly Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Glazier I was going to see if you could
clarify a constitutional issue for me, and the staff tells me that state
appropriated dollars to private colleges and universities dates back all
the way to the 1970s and that would be tax payers dollars going to a
private college. Did you support those?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] And I’ll finish my answer to you. I do, except of
course the constitutional provision.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Does the gentleman wish to debate the amendment a
second time?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I wish to debate the amendment a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment a
second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker, and Representative Hastings it’s
a good question, raised in part as well by Representative Brandon in his
discussion, except of course the constitutional provision that we’re
interpreting has nothing to do with colleges and universities, it
relates to K-12 and so the provisions as to what we do and give to
colleges and universities are not covered by article 9, section 6. Thank
you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Hastings please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To see if Representative Glazier would yield for a
second question?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Glazier does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Glazier, my copy of the state
constitution says a uniform system of free public schools, it doesn’t
say K-12, would that be correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Hastings if you read the history of that
constitutional provision it’s clear that the free system of public
schools that it’s referring to is K-12, it’s not referring to colleges
and universities that have their own independent constitutional
provision.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Brandon please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To speak a second time on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment a
second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Hastings to your other point of this
before I speak on that, I would say that our tax credit, the same exact
bill for special needs is definitely within the provision of K-12 and
Representative Glazier also voted for that measure also so this is the
crux of my statement and I’m leaving so I can make these statements
because I know it’s hard for some people to hear but I want people to
know that when I came here I noticed some things. The whole reason why I
ran for office, and I felt that I needed to come because I felt that
people in my community get marginalized a lot and the whole reason why
this is important and why we have to be here and talk about his is
because folks, it doesn’t matter what anybody says, you can make any
argument you want, you can talk about it the way you want to talk about
it, but we have hard data, hard specific data, but more importantly than
that I have human lives that are affected by this. You can concentrate
on a problem for forty years and it doesn’t get better, it is an
impossibility and that’s exactly what has happened. We continue to come
down here year after year, we make the campaign promises, we do all of
that, but there is one population for forty straight years or more that
has continued to have the same exact numbers but nobody got up during
the special needs and talked about these constitutional issues and
nobody got up and spoke about it that way and nobody for years talks
about any other thing other than what’s going on in my community, but
anytime there’s something for poor or minority kids, whether you’re a
democrat or a republican, in the history of this chamber we ??? now we
have a problem. We didn’t have a problem for it for the other children
but you have a problem..</p>

children for political redirect. If you were serious about it, it
wouldn’t have the same number for 50 years. It’s not possible, it’s just
not possible. So you folks, if they’re gonna stay here, there gonna be

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hanes, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good Afternoon, Colleagues. The last time I stood to
speak with regard to this opportunity scholarship program or the voucher
program, I stood to ask that the program be pulled out of the budget. I
did that. It was the right thing to do. It was an appropriate thing to
do and I stand by that. Today, I stand to oppose this amendment and to
explain to you a little bit about why I want to do that. My colleague,
several minutes ago, as he often does, spoke quite eloquently in terms
of his constitutional analysis and I wanted to touch base on that just a
little bit. When we started with Article 9, section 2, the uniform
system of schools, I won’t go so far as to say that my good friend,
Representative Glazier was wrong, would never do that. But, what I will
say is that a little misdirection going on and we conveniently stepped
over a little bit of language here. So let me start, I wanna read that
in full. General and uniform system term. The General Assembly shall
provide by taxation otherwise for a general and uniform system of free
public schools which shall be maintained at least 9 months in every year
and wherein equal opportunities shall be provided for all students. That
is the key language – where equal opportunity shall be provided for poor
students. Then we moved on and move to section 6 and I was surprised we
took a quite a strict constructionist approach to that language. In
section 6, where when we spoke the words ‘and shall be faithfully
appropriated and used exclusively for establishing a uniform system of
free public schools’. I take umbrage at the word free, when we start
talking about public schools in the communities that some of us
represent. I don’t know if students who are forced to go to school that
are 99% free and reduced lunch. I don’t know how free that is. I think
those students are being taxed in ways that are unimaginable. Let me
read a couple of numbers for you here. These are the end of grade, 3rd
grade proficiency scores for some of our counties. Alamance – 26%
proficient for economically disadvantaged students. Alexander – 41%,
Aleghany – 44%, Anson – 29%, Ashe – 36%, Bladen – 24%, Burke – 38%,
Caldwell – 36%, Cherokee – 37%, Cleveland – 38%, Columbus – 19%, Craven
– 30%, Davie – 36% and my home country of Forsyth – 23%. 23% in Forsyth
County. Economically disadvantaged students. In Forsyth County, there
are few different schools that I represent.</p>

One of the ?? school that my daughter attends, they’re in the third
grade reading proficiency. 86% public schools. It’s the neighborhood I
live in. Here are a couple of scores for schools that are less than 1.5
miles from where I live and these are the scores of the schools that my
father grew up in. 13.8 % - 99% free reduced lunch. 10% - 99% free
reduced lunch. 13.7% - 99% free and reduced lunch. And 6% - 97% eligible
for jail according to the department of corrections. There’s nothing
free about that when 99% of those students look like me or look like
anyone else who is poor and does not have the opportunity. I have a real
problem today with people in this assembly, in my caucus, who will get
ready 10 minutes from now to vote yes on this amendment and they have
children in private school and will tell you that they are there because
they cannot send their kids to an 80% free and reduced lunch school. Now
why is that? Why is it good for us but not good for the rest of the
State of North Carolina and we’re talking about poor children. Ladies
and Gentlemen, this is the kind of hypocrisy that the state of North
Carolina and the citizens do not want. I understand this is a difficult
issue. I understand we have our own folks that we have to answer to. I
understand that the [NCAE] is upset. I understand that folks on both
sides of the aisle have people they have to answer to but at the end of
the day, we ought to be able to agree that we are gonna stand for poor
children. If you can vote for a disability voucher bill then you can
vote for this voucher bill. You can vote to vote down this amendment.
Let’s have some consistency here. Everybody talks to me about how folks
aren’t ready. You don’t wanna do this Rep. because people aren’t ready,
people in your communities aren’t necessarily ready, the public schools
aren’t ready. We’ve been talking about not being ready since the
beginning of time. It is a constant argument that has happened. Back to
the biblical ages, folks. Some folks weren’t ready when Moses went the
?? and he said “What? Let my people go”. 3500 families in this state are
families who like me say, they want to go. Let them go. People weren’t
ready. Everybody wasn’t ready when it came time to run. It didn’t mean
Harry ?? had a bad idea. Everybody wasn’t ready when it came time to
march across the bridge. It didn’t mean ?? dream wasn’t valid. Just
because people weren’t ready to stand up it didn’t mean green ?? of want
to sit in. This is what we’re talking about. We’re talking about
opportunity. We don’t have to always agree but we’re made to be
consistent. Ladies and Gentlemen, if we can vote on one thing, going
forward we can come together on one thing, let’s please always do it
when we’re talking about the needs of poor children. Thank you. Please
don’t do that.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Bringing this issue before you
on behalf of many of the patients that are on Medicaid and having
difficult to get their prescription filled because of drug shortages, we
have a preferred drug program here, in the state of  Medicaid, and what
in certain instances we actually require dispensing of a brand drug
because of the rebate situation that we have. We're running into
problems where we can't buy the brand name drugs not available in the
market place, and so this directs department to analyze this issue and
find savings from allowing pharmacists to help preserve patient's access
to these drugs, especially in situations where misdosage may lead to
negative and costly, patient outcomes and bypass a prior authorization
process to be able to dismiss a generic drug until the preferred brand
drug is available and not move a dot from the amendment.

Floyd, it’s the understanding of the Chair that the minority leader,
Representative Larry Hall consulted with the caucus and that it was the
desire of the minority caucus to meet on Friday [Morning] Night at
Midnight as was offered. The Chair’s position is that the timing of this
is going to something that would only be through consensus with the
caucus leadership. So it’s probably more appropriate, we will be taking
a recess here shortly so that we can have a brief rules meeting. At that
time, if that something that your caucus would like to take up, the
Chair will still entertain the option of midnight. With respect to time
check, the Chair understands that we have some 20 or 21 amendments in
possession of the clerk. We think there are some other ones being
drafted. So, we have still several hours of amendments to take up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So, how long, we have 20, how long do you project. I
know you want to be fair and give everybody an opportunity.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Chair anticipates probably half of the amendments
being relatively limited debate, maybe 5 minutes each. So, call that 45
minutes worth of debate. The other half, probably 30 minutes of debate
each. So that’s about 3 hours.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Before we start the 3.5 hour debate on the budget,
Representative Speciale is recognized to send forth amendment AMH-78.
The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Speciale moves to amend the bill on
page 137 lines 5 through 22 by deleting those lines.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Speaker. Basically, what we’re deleting
is the section that would allow the fisheries director or his designee
to enter into an agreement with national marine fishery service of the
United States department of commerce. Allowing our marine fisheries
inspectors to accept the delegation of law enforcement powers over
matters within the jurisdiction of the National Marine Fisheries
Service. In other words, I guess they wanna recruit our people, our
marine fisheries with the promise of a dangling buck here, which is
about 200,000 dollars and what my amendment does here, is it removes
that. It removes that future entanglement with the Federal Government
which has a very bad reputation. I have a report here, scathing audit of
them and for many many reasons, constitutional reasons, sovereign
reasons, we don’t need to get in yet another entanglement with the
federal government for federal money. So, I ask you to please stand up
for your state and do not allow us to get tied in with a federal agency
once again. Thank You.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If members wishing to carry on discussions near the
rear of the room, please go outside the chamber. I have members
indicating that they cannot hear the debate who are seated in the rear
of the chamber. Representative Murry, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Speaker. The Senate budget expressly
prohibits the entering into of joint enforcement agreements which is the
subject of this amendment. The Senate expressly prohibits. The problem
with that is that in the first year of the budget, we projected a
150,000 dollars’ worth of savings by entering into this. The second year
of the budget, it’s 200,000 dollars’ worth of savings in the Marine
Fisheries Commission. Representative Speciale acknowledges this as an
amendment by taking 200,000 dollars out of the Clean Water Management
Trust fund which has nothing to do with fishing, to pay for this savings
associated with Joint enforcement agreements. This is and will be an
[automatic] contention between the house and the senate. Let me tell you
why joint enforcement agreements are a good idea. First, it reduces the
number of officers that can step on foot of a boat. So, right now,
you’ve got federal waters and state waters. Violation on the boat, where
there’s commercial fishing boat mainly where it deals with. Get a state
officer that can step on foot of that boat. That boat could ?? start
going off, federal officer can get on the same issue, same boat and this
help consolidate this. Last thing I’ll say is.</p>

Only state that on any coast whether it is the pacific or the Atlantic
doe s has a join enforcement agreement, this a way to leverage state and

stopped over and over again by multiple different layers of officers and
so it is as I said states asked if we still oppose the amendment , let
North Caroline join every other coastal state and leveraging our state
and federal dollars to make sure we have better enforcement and less
reputation amongst enforcement for our commercial fisherman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Mcgardy, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Without getting to the substance of the amendment, my
objection to this amendment relates to the line 79 that includes in
appropriation of 2000 thousand  dollars to restore the reduction on
marine patrol activities, the money is coming from clean water
management trust and if we start down this road of just taking money out
of the trust fund that is specifically designated for one thing to cover
some other cause somewhere else , it’s a very dangerous precedent and so
I urge putting aside the substance of amendment that the amendment is
flawed in terms of where it proposes to fund  what the author of the
amendment  would like to have funded.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Tine, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I assure the concerns about the
spot the money and I take this opportunity to share that the chair is
going to conference debate that is, that it will be in conflict is that
each time we have gone into an agreement with federal government and our
coastal areas whether it is the park service or it one of the
enforcement agencies we have been told one thing on the coast , we have
been given something else over the time and it may not be next year may
not be 2 years and may not be 5 years but you look down the road and the
park that we gave them inheritors  that was  supposed to be able, so we
have access the people have access to the beach of those areas is now
cut off completely much the time because of the way they are managing
that facility at the federal level despite the promises that we have
been writing from the federal government that time, so I, why I agree
with the spirit of it and will probably point green on it , I hope the
chair here see me as in regards to the joint enforcement because that
needs to be  taken care in the conference. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Cleveland, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am in favour of this
amendment. The federal government controls us by the dollar, if we start
taking to have a joint agreement on law enforcement on the waters 2-3
years down the road it’s not gonna be our enforcement it will be federal
government’s enforcement, we are bounce saying yes sir yes sir because
we don’t wanna lose the free dollar its 200 thousand dollars coming out
of the clean water trust fund, I don’t like the idea of taking money out
of the clean water trust fund for this but our rules are as such that it
was probably the best place to represent the specially we can find and
there is another 7 million dollars if I remember rightly in the budget
of  clean water trust fund , so we are not putting any great harm to the
trust fund. When I am out on the boat in the News  river I don’t want to
have the worry of what a federal agent pulling me over and looking at my
boat, it’s not his business , we have state enforcement, they can look
at my boat and may have and I have no problem with that. We do not need
to get in another entitlement on our coastal waters with the federal
government , it will come to no end, I don’t know how many of you have
read the wolf problem out on the coast but the federal government has

introduction.  Well I will get out of the Red Wolf, but it was a classic
example of what happens when you deal with the Federal Government, in
wildlife or well just leave it in this wild life area.  We do not need
another entanglement.  Vote for the Amendment.
(SPEAKER CHANGES)    Representative Pittman, please state your purpose.
(SPEAKER CHANGES)    Debate The Amendment.
(SPEAKER CHANGES)    Gentlemen is recognized to debate the  Amendment
(SPEAKER CHANGES)    Thank you Sir, I just want to add my voice to say,
saving money is a great thing  and getting money from where we can
sometimes is good, but not if it means selling your soul to the devil,
and dealing with the Federal Government is selling your soul to the
devil, and I’m in favor of this Amendment, thank you.
(SPEAKER CHANGES)    Representative Speciale, please state your purpose.
(SPEAKER CHANGES)    Speaker I am going to debate a second time.
(SPEAKER CHANGES)    The gentleman is recognized to debate the Amendment
a second time.
(SPEAKER CHANGES)    The Agency that we are going to be partnering with,
Okay? I’ve got a copy I’m going to read of a recent audit.  ”Senior
leadership elements need to exercise substantial ly greater management
in oversights of the Agencies regional enforcement operations.  They
need to strengthen their  policy guidance,  procedures and internal
controls  in  enforcement operations, to address a common industry
perception that  it’s  Civil penalty assessment  process is arbitrary
and unfair.  They need to re-asses their work force composition, to
determine if 90% criminal investigation enforcement structure is
effective for accomplishing its mission.  Fisherman and   other industry
sources express concern   that ?? fines are excessive, constituting a
form of bounty.   Because they are able to retain the proceeds from
enforcement cases.  I can go on and on okay, it’s a damming audit, and
we do not need to get ourselves involved in an organization, State,
Federal, or otherwise that  can’t even keep its own house in order, and
we don’t need them to come here and try to keep our house in order.  We
don’t need to be subservient to them, we don’t need them to be adding
things and powers to our folks, for our Fisheries folks, so that it
could subject the State to fines and things, and it’s going to cost us
more in the long run for equipment that they are going to need to
enforce Federal Laws along the coast.  It’s just a bad deal.  We all
said smaller government – most of us   ?? we said smaller government,
and here we are, we’re going  to expand our reach into the Federal
Government.  We are going to team up with them.  Look,. They are out of
money  so if they are doing this for the money, and that’s what It looks
like, the check is not going to be cashable here in the near future.  I
can guarantee that.  We need to just maintain our sovereignty .  I like
Representative   Murphy’s comment that we are the only State that
doesn’t do this.   That’s a point of pride with me, and it should be
with you, and I ask you to support this Amendment.

(SPEAKER CHANGES)    Representative Murry, I am trying to follow this
and understand what’s going on.  First question is this.  How long have
other States had these joint agreements and I guess North Carolina has
not had them before?
(SPEAKER CHANGES)   For several years.
(SPEAKER CHANGES)   For several years?
(SPEAKER CHANGES)   Years, we had the opportunity to tap into this, and
this opportunity to decrease the number of Federal  Agencies policing
commercial fishermen, and using State agencies to do that and get
Federal  money to do so, for years.
(SPEAKER CHANGES)  Second question Mr. Speaker?
(SPEAKER CHANGES)    The gentlemen yields.
(SPEAKER CHANGES)    What’s the jurisdictional area of the Federal
government?  Is this only on the high seas? Or, is this back in the
rivers and the estuaries that are, would be solely thought of as being
in North Carolina, vs on the high seas?

Representative Murry, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
debate the amendment a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the amendment a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] As
I've mentioned in my answer to Representative Blust, right now we have
state agents policing commercial fishermen and federal agents policing
commercial fisherman. This joint enforcement agreement lowers that to
just state agents helping reducing the amount of burden on our
commercial fishermen to allow state agents to be federally funded. Use
the money that every other state is using on every other coastal state.
And to make sure these operations are more efficient. Peronally, if I
had a choice between a federal DEA agent coming to my pharmacy or a
state SBI agent coming to my pharmacy, I'll take the SBI agent every day
because that's within our existing structure. I think that's the point
of the joint enforcement agreement. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative

Gladly. {SPEAKER CHANGES} The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You've

Cause I'm concerned about them coming up New (?) River. [SPEALER
CHANGES] We're dealing with, the situation you're describing is a
situation that concerns me as well. Federal agents encroaching into
state waters. This joint enforcement agreement uses state agents to help
police federal waters. That's how I see the joint enforcement agreement.
Your concerns are very valid. This is a one way street, not really a two
way street. We're not allowing the federal agents to police state
waters. It's the other way around. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The question before

debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. I’m sorry
Mr. Speaker. This amendment right here is about the libraries. And there
are two libraries that are going to be impacted. Two library systems.
One is Wake County and one is Mecklenburg County. And I would like for
us to start considering our libraries as learning centers because what
is happening in the community I come from is that people that are
unemployed and people may not have Internet services in their homes, so
they are going to the libraries to use the Internet services. As well as
children programs, we’re entering the summer and lots of children that
may not be attending a day care program or some other type of program
may be going to the libraries to learn to read, early reading inside the
libraries. So the 2% reduction to the libraries in Mecklenburg and Wake,
I really don’t see where it’s equitable and fair that the largest two
libraries should take a cut right now especially when we’re looking at a
dollar for every dollar that’s spent there’s a six dollar return ratio.
Additionally, these libraries in our communities the last time they were
reduced and didn’t get county funding, we went to save our libraries and
tried to raise the money to keep them open. But in the impoverished
areas where people that are low income, people that have kids that may
not have the opportunity to attend some of these other things that are
out in the community, the libraries are where they have to go. So that
is why I’m asking for the money to be moved and to restore the 2% to the
Wake County Library and the Mecklenburg County Library. Because it’s
fair and everyone will be receiving the same thing. Please support the
amendment. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Cleveland, please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would hope we all vote no on this amendment. We did
the best we could in the subcommittee for libraries. We protected the
regional libraries. We’ve unfortunately capped the amount of money that
can be given to each system and that impacted Mecklenburg</p>

And Wake Counties. They are the largest counties in the state and I

Mecklenburg and Wake County anyway. But please vote no on the amendment.

The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House, I tried this
amendment in committee yesterday and it was voted down at the request of
the chairs. All this simply does is if you look in the budget in the
money book, you’ll find that there’s a 28 26 29% flexible option for the
university, a flex cut for the university. And what we’re trying to do,
actually the ?? says it should not be spread out across the board. But
if you look at the portion that this is amending, it says that there is
a possibility that it can be spread across the board. What this would do
would be to eliminate those focus growth institutions from that flex cut
being put upon them. If you know these institutions you know that they
have had hard times in the past, and that they need these funds and that
it’s just one of those situations where a lot of the larger universities
can afford to take any kind of cut at all but these no telling what kind
of cut the board of governors or anybody would put upon these particular
institutions. So we are asking that they just be, not, that they not
allow those cuts to go across the board to those particularly focus
growth institutions. I appreciate your support, I’d be happy to answer
any questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blackwell, please state
your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. On behalf of the co-chairs of the ??
subcommittee, I’d like to ask the members of the House to oppose this
amendment. When the particular provision in question came over from the
Senate, one of the things that we did was eliminate, to carve out

that some individuals had succeeded in putting in there to say the Board
of Governors has to have a hands-off attitude with respect to certain
institutions. What Representative Michaux is trying to do here is to add
special protection in that will isolate, or insulate rather, certain
institutions from the Board of Governors being able to look at them and
make cuts. What we need to do is understand that the Board of Governors
can consider the very factors that Representative Michaux would have us
use as a way of tying the hands of the Board of Governors. They can
understand when an across the board is inappropriate. That's their job.

I would like to agree with Representative Blackwell on his statement
that he made if I had some assurance that this, that anybody who's in
the administration in the university system would take this in to
account. But giving what has happened, particularly in the past month/
month and a half with one of those institutions, it just scares me that
they don't pay attention. I don't like to label anybody at all but
sometimes some of us just gettin' lost in everything that goes on. I'm
just trying to prevent us from becoming lost because these focus growth
institutions are the ones that have suffered when it comes time for
cuts, when it comes time for not getting the things that they need.
We've always had to basically fight to keep those institutions going.
This is just a very simple, literal thing, don't let them put any more
cuts on those institutions. I know right now that right now most of them
have had, some up to 3% cuts already without this going into effect, and
this has affected the way that their staff, their faculty, all of this
in there. Just don't let this affect these small institutions that have
made significant contributions to this state. I ask that you support the
amendment.

<p id="230:00">
And for the Governor to submit that for confirmation to the General
Assembly. This people over the school of government tell me that this is
an encroachment on the responsibility and authority of the
administrative branch by the legislative branch and that could be a
constitutional issue. That’s not actually what bothers me the most. The
most troubling thing I think is what is found in the second half of this
on page 106. This says if the Governor doesn’t submit that name to the
General Assembly for confirmation, let the Speaker of the House and
President approach him, can’t submit a name and we will have a bill that
we will vote and the General Assembly will appoint a Medicaid Director.
Those of you who have not been here very long and have observed some of
the turmoil in Medicaid and in the Department of Health and Human
Services might think that this is a good solution but in the eighteen
years I’ve been here, I believe I can name twelve, ten to twelve
different Medicaid Directors. Nationally they serve about two years in
any state. So if an effort to sort of require or set up a system where
we hope that we would get more continuity actually is a system I think
that would make for more chaos. One of the most important things about a
successful Medicaid Director is the trust and confidence that the
Secretary has in that person, the trust and confidence that the Governor
has in that person and that does the State Budget office has in that
person. Those are all administrative duties in the Department of
Administration. This might be a well-meaning amendment but I believe it
violates our Constitution. I believe it will create more problems than
it solves. I support the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human
Services appointing that person and that we would assist them by making
sure that we have enough money in the budget to hire a good person. And
I will probably vote for my amendment and make this correction. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Burr, please state your purpose. Speak on the ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Speaker. I would ask members to oppose this amendment. The
language used here is very similar language that is in place for other
positions. You remember just a few weeks ago we had confirmations here
in the House for the Controller and for other positions. It is something
that we do and I believe that it is an important; certainly Medicaid
Director is important even as Representative Insko pointed out. I mean,
look the issues that we’ve had over the previous years. I think that it
is critical and, and a good move for the General Assembly to have an
opportunity to confirm that person and to raise the stature of the
position of Medicaid Director and put it at a different level and to;
yes, give the ability for someone to hold that position for five years
so that perhaps they can actually fix something over there. It’ll be
nice. So I would ask that you oppose this amendment and leave this
provision here in allowing us to, to move forward with, with the
confirmation for a future Medicaid Director. Thank you.

What I’ve done here is I hope has done at least a decent job of putting
together some of the issues and some of the questions that some of the
people had about the SBI transfer. I’m hoping that this amendment does
not violate any policies and the entire transfer itself. And what I’m
attempting to do with this is to address one of the issues that was
stated early on when we began this process, about some of the policy
concerns we had about the transfer to SBI. What I would address in this
amendment is only the public corruption unit, and no other unit of the
SBI. Fiscally it doesn’t violate any of the economic transfers for the
transfer to SBI. I don’t think in theory it violates any policies. It
doesn’t change anything but it does keep that unit separate. What I’ve
attempted to do is talk to people on both sides of the aisle about the
concerns with the SBI transfer, what would make them satisfied, and try
to craft something that would satisfy both sides in that manner. As
stated, it doesn’t violate any of the policy that was put forth in the
transfer of the SBI bureau to the department of public safety but we
also do at least have an opportunity to address the one thing that I
think most of the general public, both your sheriffs, your law
enforcement, people of those sort, would have with the SBI’s
independence. And that allows for the public corruption unit to be a
separate unit that’s still under the AG’s office. I think the second
thing that it does is that it would restore confidence in these times
that the SBI is called in. Too many times we think of the public
corruption unit as being a unit that addresses state-wide corruption,
state-wide officials, things of that sort. This is something as simple
as a magistrate or a deputy or somebody related to somebody of that
sort, at the local level. And our DAs an our sheriffs get an opportunity
to have the SBI investigate this and feel that it’s an independent
investigation and more important for them, for the communities to feel
like it’s an independent investigation that’s resolved in a good way.
And so we just ask that you would please support this amendment.

Members, I would ask you to vote against this amendment. What we’re
talking about is keeping politics out of the SBI. We have done our very
best to do that. Taking the corruption unit and leaving it with the
Attorney General, believing that he is not political, is a fallacy. It
is, we have done the very best we can to take politics out and we want
to move the whole thing over. And certainly the director who has an
eight year term will be independent enough to conduct the investigations
as we expect him to. So vote against the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate? If not, the question before the
House is the passage of the amendment sent forth by Representative
Reives, to House Committee Substitute number 2 to Senate Bill 744. All
in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote.
The clerk will let the machine record the vote. 47 having voted in the
affirmative, 69 in the negative, the amendment fails. Representative
Glazier is recognized to send forth AMK-102. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier moves to amend the bill on page
39, line 36 through page 40, line 9 by deleting the lines and. [SPEAKER

please? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The amendment will be temporarily displaced.
Representative Holley is recognized to send forth ATMX-52. The clerk

bill on page 279, line 37 and 38 by inserting the following. [SPEAKER

CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is an amendment to reinstate the
earned income tax credit for the state of North Carolina. Trying to do
so by not [COUGH], I’m trying to help the unincorporated poor, by taking
4/10ths of 1% from the corporate money that they’re trying to give the
?? corporate money to instead of taking it down from 6 to 5, to go from
6 to 5.6. 4/10ths of a percent, we’re trying to take it down. Now what

Is this who enables the working people the working class people who are
not usually own an income tax credit more than 2 years and opportunity
to stay off welfare rules stay off other public assistance rules. The
average person who get the earn income tax credit is someone who is out
there working and there are people who don't stay on it very long
because they are not able to get enough funding and move on and move up
I think we need to look into something for poor in this general assembly
because we have been overlooking them for the whole time I have been
here. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members we have debate about
this issue for at least 2 may be 3 years. If you were a member when we
talked about allowing the earn income tax credit to sunset. We talked
about how much fraud ?? there was in the program I am gonna ask you to
vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Richardson please state you purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES The Lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Again I stand and ask my fellow colleagues you support
this amendment. We have so many people who would benefit from these
dollars and our local government and our home towns were also benefit
and when we talk about abuse we have abused right here in the general
assembly. But we didn't forbid everybody else from running because a few
people chose not to follow the law. So I don't our poor disadvantage
people should be held to higher standards that any other population of
people. These were dreams that our citizen had they delayed dreams
because they were trying to save funds for different items and different
wishes and when did it let be our sunset we literally crashed those
dreams and we destroyed the thoughts of ever rising themselves raising
themselves out of poverty and hopefully not been in class of always
having to have people look out for them self I urge you to remember that
just because one population commits some people on a population it
should not relegate everyone in there population to be punished as we
have done here based on this letting this issue sunset. I urge to vote
for those who need these dollars and look at how it would benefit our
different countess I could spread sheet desk as well as representative
Stearns put on my desk but I still beg you forgive those people who have
violated this rule and support the people who try to work hard and live
honestly and he use the funds they have to realize their dreams thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, members this original earn income tax
credit is something that I voted 4 years ago when I was here but I agree
with representative Howard we should defeat this amendment. Look at the
things that have changed during the last 3 years particularly we have
lower taxes across the borders in this state we have lowered the sales
tax we have lowered the service tax we have pushed tax reforms and tax
reductions around the state that help everybody this is no longer needed
my friend and I urge the body to vote against it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker I wanted to say first I support
the amendment and I gonna remind everyone that the biggest backer of the
expansion of the federal earn income tax program was present ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke your for question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] When I am finished.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is not yell. The gentleman has the for.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And president Wagon and later president Clinton are
those between recognize there were many people working who didn't make
enough money from their work to really make a living. They did not have
a living wage and the notion behind the earned income tax credit is that
it is.</p>

For people who are working. 22% of north Carolinians most recent data
available 22% of our population qualify, well more qualify, 22% have
filled for the earned income tax credit benefit. It or something that is
simply fair in particularly herms those from wool counties those with
the high level of unemployment high level of poverty, the jobs don't pay
very well and it is a good reason to spot it there. Finally I would say
to the reference to my friend representative Moore who spoke to the
issue of the tax changes last year. It's not that they are working poor
benefit really from the tax changes, give you just one example, the
sells tax on yours and my power bill, sales tax on the electricity went
from 3% to 7%, a lot of sells tax.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Floyd please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] And I want to ask gentleman a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Does the gentleman you?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I do not you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman does not you. The chair anticipates
several questions after the gentleman competes his debate. The gentleman
may continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Happy to entertain them then. So
the point when we think about the tax reform, the tax changes on 2013
session. Is that the great majority of the monies in the intern come tax
cut went to the super wealthy. Indeed according to the ?? research
20,000 file, 20,000 tax fillers who are millionaire will have a tax
break this year of a3 hundred million dollars. This amendment simply
asks you to help a million tax fillers to the tune of a hundred million
dollars. We have a million people benefiting from this amendment versus
20,000 people who actually are getting the three times what this
amendment will cost us in the state. It is only fair to help the working
poor and the working families to the tune of 1 hundred thousand, I am
sorry 1 hundred million dollars when other groups are making a tax break
of 3 hundred million dollars plus I urge you to support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Stam please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Luebke your for question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Does the gentleman you?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Luebke you are not old enough to
remember ??. Do you recall it's rational for the earn income tax credit
with these folks were praying pay roll taxes like social security and
Medicare tax?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes Sir I think it's no different then these folks
paying 7% now on their electricity bill when they used to pay 3%.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] And you realize the second question of mine?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Does the gentleman you?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I am.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] You realize there is no pay roll tax in North Carolina?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Stam what I was trying to say is that
when this body the majority raise the sells tax and electricity from 3%
to 7% that is something we have to try to overcome and the earning
income tax credit helps in that direction.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Second question for what?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Does the gentleman you?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I think it's the third question. Yes I yells.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman yells.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Luebke do you realize that from 2003 to
2010 I believe you were the chair of the finance committee and you
raised extra penny on the sells tax which disproportionately effects the
poor for all those years.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Stam what I remember is that we kept a
fair income tax in those who made a whole lot of money, that's what we
did and we brought the income that we needed for the state by asking the
vault to do to make their pay their per share. We had to make due with
more sells tax yes on a temporary basis but it came down after the
temporary basis thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Louis please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the
house I feel like when we debate issues here or is very important to
have the facts and the information that are shared on this floor at
least presented in a fair way. First of all I wanna say to the
amendment.</p>

There is no means that the dollars were fraud and when have we start the
bank you know let’s be realistic lets be proportionate about this, yes
there are some things that have affected people overall representative
Louis, you know there are some things that are people are hurting the
number one fraud thing that they are talking about that they said was
fraud, my research is proved because these people can’t afford to have
recounted to do their tax forms and made an error on it and improving is
that an error and not necessarily fraud that has caused some of the so
called abuse in this system. Let’s not throw the baby out with the bath
water, these people aren't asking for a handout they are asking for a
hand, a temporary help, for 1-2 years until they can get to the point
that they can sustain themselves. And like the representative ? said,
yes we can go in my district and I can show you a lot of things and I
can bring people here in tell you how important that little bit of money
made in their lives. So they ask me as their representative to plead
their case and that’s what I am doing here today and I say let’s not
hurt the poor, let’s do that what we can and give them a hand and not a
handout. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Blust, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the house, first I
want to make one thing clear on the fraud I don’t think anyone who
address this fraud and this program is necessarily saying it’s the poor
people who are committing the fraud, a lot of times its not poor people
, it’s some sophisticated scum man that set up phony people and generate
this because it’s a completely refundable tax that many times means that
it’s just a cheque coming from the government to the tax payers, it
doesn't have to be poor person, it’s just a way to get cash now this our
state earned income tax credit was equal to 5% of the federal  earned
income tax credit, we piggybacked on the federal, the statistics show at
the federal level there was like 30%, I think it has been reduced to
slightly 20’s now, so if we are spending on the North Carolina 105
million dollars on the earned income tax credit that means around 30
million of that is flat out go into to scam artists, what happens with
the tax that formed last year  we took that 105 million the provision
sun setted by its own terms that for the built 5 years , now 6 years
ago. It was allowed to sunset but that 100 is used to lower tax rates
across the board in all kinds of manners to benefit North Carolinians ,
many of those same people and its just one thing that move me to speak
today is the concern for the poor expressed by advocates of this
amendment  and those same advocates were rowing to raise sales taxes on
those same poor people for probably the  about the same amount as they
are getting from the earned income tax credit and I heard no whaling
when the tax increased the sales tax increases run into effect  when the
democrats were in the majority that this will fall on the poor and the
tailor’s tax just increased didn't just fall on the poor, the working
poor , it fell on the unemployed and the non-working anyone who has
spent money in this state for goods and some services was taxed when
democrats were in the majority, now the average benefit is a 110-115 per
tax return, I don’t believe that’s is going to live someone out of the
poverty that additional 110 dollars a year , I do think the same amount
and much more has been returned to those same taxpayers and other
changes of the law we have made in the last 2 or 3 years including doing
away with that one sales tax that hit the same people, so we have
returned to those people affected by this, more  money than into their
pockets than they would have gotten through this earned income tax
credit, so I urge you to defeat the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative? please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It’s been much talk about
fraud here and I thought I just add a couple of words and some
statistics that come from the department of treasury. Treasury inspector
general for administration has been tracking the fraud problems NEITC
since 2003 whose report you can</p>

?? that they did August 28th 2013, which in from the time they started
in 2003 that the improper payments, and their formula addressed the fact
that some people make honest mistakes. So when they're talking about
improper formulas they deducted out addition, subtraction errors things
like that. In 2003 improper payments was estimated at 30% of all EITC
returns, we've gotten better as a country from 2003 to 2012 in 2012 it
was 25% so what that means is 25% of these EITC applications are
fraudulent. Now what's that mean for the state of North Carolina? Well
112 million dollars I think is the number for 2012 which means that this
state paid out 28 million dollars in fraudulent EITC claims, 28 million
dollars. I for one am not willing to vote to continue to send millions
of dollars from the state treasury out to people who are committing
fraud, so it's not honest mistakes we're talking about what we're
talking out is outing out fraud the number is 28 million dollars.
Representative Collins please state your purpose. Briefly debate the
amendment. The gentleman's recognize to debate the amendment. Not trying
to repeat what others have said but I do want to piggyback on what some
including representative Lewis have said, I think there's just two
different approaches here, our approach through tax reform has been to
help the working poor with the three things he's already mentioned.
There's no way in the world that if you add up the reduced sales tax the
increased child tax credit and the greatly increased standard deduction
that we're not benefiting these poor working families by more than the
115 dollars that the earned income tax credit was giving them. Also as
has been stated by representative Holloway that's designed to be a very
temporary thing lasting just a year or two, whereas the tax changes
we've made will help these working poor forever. For the rest of their
lives, because these aren't changes we're going to go back and re change
again. So I would just like to say that we've done more for the working
poor than the earned income tax credit has we want to keep those changes
permanent not just rely on something that works for a year or two, I
would ask you to defeat this amendment. Representative Larry Hall please
state your purpose. Debate the amendment. The gentleman's recognize to
debate the amendment. Thank you Mr Speaker, and members of the house I
appreciate your indulgence in this issue and as you know we can approach
it from an individual standpoint  and say we don't realize we cut
unemployment benefits, and we could say we don't realize we decided not
to expand medicaid, and take knock all the other legs out from under
poor North Caronlinians and say we did this one thing. We can say we
think for the purpose of the cameras or whoever else is watching we can
indulge in that fiction and say we don't know we did that over the last
few years. We do know we did it, we do know these people are suffering
and we do know, and I agree with representative Blust it may be a small
amount of money to those of us in here, but for people who are trying to
make it every day, trying to put food on the table trying to keep heat
in their houses in the wintertime that little bit of money each month is
the difference between them being homeless and then having to go into
more benefits and programs that we provide or being able to stay in some
minimal amount of protection and housing for their family. So yes for us
it doesn't mean anything. For most of us we're well enough off that we
wouldn't even dream about what earned income tax credit would mean, but
for the folks that we have continually taken any support away from, and
yes there have been some tax changes but they haven't been in isolation.
We have reduced that unemployment insurance and we reduced the period of
time that they would have so for us to address this issue as if it
stands alone and this is the only affect we have on our poor working..
Mr speaker. Representative Blust please state your purpose.
Representative Hall yield for a question. Be glad to yield when I've
completed sir. The gentleman has the floor. So I think we do need to be
honest with ourselves, this does not exist in the ?? I agree with
representative Blust if there was some fraud and representative Szoka if
there was fraud in the old program that old program has ceased we have
new mechanisms new ability to track situations and TO have applications.
Let's start the programs let's be fair let's help our poor and
unemployed and our poor working poor let's help them let's put a program
in place now with all that we've learned with all the different
technology we now have in place let's put a program in place and help
these North Carolinians there's no excuse to say there might be fraud so
we won't use our best efforts to help our fellow</p>

citizens. That's something we have to do, I mean, I believe many of you
probably pledged that across the campaign trail - to try to help those
need help the most. And this is the opportunity to do it. Again, you can
start this program back, it's not under the same roles, it's not the
same people, and it doesn't have to have the same enforcement mechanisms
as before, but we can help North Carolinians and this is our opportunity
to do it. The most people with the least amount of money that will make
the greatest difference. And if we decide not to do that, then the shame
is on us for not taking this opportunity to help those who are
struggling in North Carolina. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion,

292, short title Moratorium Lawsuit for School Funds be reconsidered and
asked to be recognized to debate at the appropriate time. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. Mr. Speaker, Members, as you know, earlier this
afternoon we voted to not concur with House Bill 292 and that was done
based in part believing that the Senate had adjourned subject to the
receipt of - excuse me - appointment of conferees. Turns out that the
Senate did not adjourn subject that, they did, however, adjourn subject
to the ratification and a number of other things. In consultation with
Representative Glazier, who was very involved with this process,
Representatives Torbett, Mark Brody, Stam, Blackwell - I'm trying to
remember if I've left anybody out. I think we've been around the horn
about three times with this thing. We have come up with a solution, and
the way this would work, would be that there were some constitutional
issues I believe Representative Glazier raised, and  Representative Stam
raised. There is going to be a fix for that, that will be addressed in a
separate bill that will be dealt with in rules during the recess, but
would be sending this bill over simply to the Senate - would be on a
motion to concur that would be made thereafter. But at this point,
Members, I would simply ask for your affirmative vote on the motion to
reconsider so that the bill will be back before us. We can then debate
the merits of the motion to concur that I believe Representative Brody
will make at that time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the motion, Mr.
Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would encourage
people to vote yes on the motion to reconsider. And, while I have
concerns, I think the constitutional concerns will be fixed in one - in
the bill, there is still policy concerns that I will speak to, and I'm
sure others, about the bill and the reconsideration. But I think, in
fairness, to get this heard and decided on the merits because I believe
the majority has solved at least the constitutional question, I would
encourage you to vote for Representative Moore's motion. [SPEAKER

the House is the motion is to reconsider the vote to not concur on the
Senate Committee substitute for House Bill 292. All in favor vote Aye,

comments, if I may. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to

constitutional issues I can assure you are being addressed and will be
dealt with in the rules committee that will be meeting at the recess. So
I would urge the Body's support on the Bill. Otherwise, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brody, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just want to be real quick on this and kind of
reassure everybody that those of you who wish to go back to your
constituents, you might want to reassure them that this is a local bill
and if they're really concerned, you can let them know they still can be
sued unless you're not from Union, Nash, or Gaston. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Richardson, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, I stand in opposition to this
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sorry, thank you. My school board has called me and
asked me to oppose this amendment because they're in the process of a
mediation as we speak and this Bill will discontinue that and they feel
that this Bill also imposes upon their authority to carry out their
statute as school board members. I urge you to not vote for this Bill.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Since I'm from Nash county and Nash county is one of
the counties listed on this. I just wanted the House to know that I
received a unanimous resolution from the County Commissioners asking for
this and the County Commission in Nash county is majority democrat. I
would ask you to please support this Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glacier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, to speak to the motion, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and I want to speak to the
things that were fixed and are that are going to be fixed and then but
to talk about why I still oppose the Bill and the policy. But first
appreciate that we've resolved some of the constitutional or the
constitutional issue so it doesn't affect anyone else directly. There,
the Bill when it comes forward will take care of the issue and allow
school boards, including those in Union, Nash, and Gaston to still have
access to the courts. It will not be through the statute which is what
the moratorium is designed to do, now but if they have a case under
Leandro or federal or state constitution they will be allowed to file
that. And I think that's an appropriate fix for the policy, if you
believe in the policy, and I appreciate that fix. I think the Bill will
also will narrow and make sure everyone's clear that it doesn't affect
anyone else's county. But the policy behind it, I want to talk to. So
we're resolving a terrible dispute in Union county that the
commissioners and school board apparently were unable to fully resolve
and while that may be good or bad, that's up to the Union county folks
to decide. It's a terrible thing that we're involved as a super-county
commissioners and super-school board. I mean, sometimes the law was
designed for those two to work it out, when they couldn't to mediate,
when they refused or couldn't resolve, to go to court. Whether that's
the best or right way to do it, I don't know. But I know that it's not
up to us to solve that dispute and the problem that I have with this is
even if the Union county folks agree and I'm assuming they do. Is, so
the next time a county gets in a dispute, what's the precedent we've
set? And what are we telling school boards and county commissioners
across the state? I mean, there's one message being given, which is try
to resolve your own problems. That's a good message generally. But the
other message is and if you don't like the resolution come to us and
we'll resolve it for you. On one side or the other depending on who's in
control and what it is and that's a terrible message to send. And I
think that will be sent and I fear that we will end up resolving lots of
people's disputes by legislation as opposed to the process. The other
thing I will tell you and it applies both to the motion on the current
Bill and the Bill that's coming, that I didn't see, unrelated to
constitution. But if you look at it, it talks about that the subsection
that we're dealing with will expire on the 2016-17, I believe, budget
adoption and it resolves the 2014-15 dispute and it also tells them how
to resolve essentially the 15-16 dispute. There's nothing in here that
resolves as I can tell the 16-17 dispute that may be on the horizon. It
tells them they need to meet which they better, I mean after this they
certainly should, but you know what can happen here and it certainly can
happen to Nash and Gaston, because they don't resolve anything in this
Bill, is what if the County Commissioners now say we're going to give
you zero or we're going to give you 10%</p>

We've told them, at least in those 3 counties 2016 for union, the other
2 for all 3 years. You don't get to sue under the statute. You can sue
under the other things but you don't get to sue so a county board
commissioners gets away with having complete and total leverage. I don't
think that's what's intended here. i think the legislators are in good
faith trying to solve an awful problem out of Union County and maybe as
it appears out of Nash, but I fear we're opening far more doors for
problems than we are solving today, for ourselves, for the state, for
the school board and county commissioners and for that reason i'm voting
against the motion and will vote against the bill. But on the
constitutional issue that we worked on, that at least is resolved.
[Speaker Change] Any members wishing to speak against the motion? The
question before the house is the motion to concur an [??] committee
substitute for house bill 292. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote
no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will [??] machine record the
vote. 70 having voted affirmative and 42 in the negative. The motion
passes. The senate will be so notified by special message. The chair
apologizes, it will be ordered in [??]. Representative Tim Moore, please
state your purpose.
[Speaker Change] For a motion.
[Speaker Change] The gentleman is recognized to state his motion.
[Speaker Change] To move the senate bill 355, the present short title is

are going to take a recess. During that recess there will be what the
chair believes to be a brief rules meeting in 1228 which the rules chair

which will also be your dinner break so I woud use it wisely. That means
that the recess we will come back at 5:10. When we return we have
another 30 amendments. I'm just kidding. It's about 5. The chair
understands that Representative Larry Hall intends to withdraw his
amendment for consideration on third reading. The chair would ask any
member who is preparing any other amendments to please turn on their
lights now so we can get an idea of any other amendments we might
receive. It looks like maybe only one amendment so that gives us about 5
or 6 amendments to dispose of before we start debating the bill.
Representative Moore, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Speaker. Members, this is the technical
fix to the bill. So, whether you liked the bill or did not like the
other bill, you can vote for this one. This is the technical fix that
was agreed upon then we took it up in the rules committee. I think, even
Representative Glazier may vote for this bill. So, I would urge the
body’s yes vote, again, this fixes the technical – whether they were
constitutional issues or not, this fixes it. I urge the body’s support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Torbett, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For an inquiry, Mr. Speaker.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The house will come to order. The gentleman is

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Speaker and thank you, Members. Again,
I’ll be voting against the bill only because it contains the other
provisions but Representative Moore is right, it does the fix on
constitutional issue. If it just had that, I’d be totally pleased but
because it adds the rest in, it’s awfully hard to be consistent in the
other way. I’ve made the arguments about why I think the rest of the
bill is inappropriate but I do appreciate Representative Moore and the
Speaker and everyone working on the constitutional fix. I’ll still be
voting no for the other reasons though. Thank You.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Richardson, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I appreciate to be able to sit in on the rules
committee and observe the changes and my issues were not necessarily
with the changes but with the fact that we have put Counties in here and
now that we’ll resort to go into the State that’s gonna probably cost a
lot more money than mediation would but I will still be voting against
the bill. I thank you for the opportunity to sit in on the rules
committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Whitmire, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ask the bill sponsor, a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, does the gentleman yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Earlier it was mentioned about potentially since local
budgets haven’t been fully resolved at this point for Nash and Gaston
counties. Does this resolve or preclude the potential to where their
particular board of education could get a ?? and have no recourse.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This bill would prohibit in those three counties, as I
understand, the board of education from suing the county commissioners
on claiming that they did not receive the proper amount of funds. What
this bill did, what this language did was to narrow the scope to those
issues so that it wouldn't catch anything else that was unintended and I
think that was the problem, and Representative Glazier is nodding, and I
think it was the problem that Representative Stam, Representative
Glazier and couple other found. So, we've already made that policy
decision on the bill that we've already sent over to the Senate. This
just narrows that a little bit to give comfort to those who thought
there we some constitutional concerns.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. If not, the

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman's recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and welcome back. One more time with feeling,
you've all heard about this amendment that's come up. Maybe not this
amendment, you heard about a ghost amendment that was never there. You
got a lot of emails about it. And it happened, the emails you got were
about the Governor's language that he was trying to put into the budget
which did not make it into our process. Over a year ago in May this
House voted 101 to 14 to finally do something about the issue of animal
abuse for dogs in our state and yes, while we all accomplished together
something that the sponsors were told would never make it out of
committee, we got it to the House floor. House Bill 930 passed out of
the judiciary committee unanimously before our vote here and as we stood
the amendment that I'm offering I keep looking around for those meddling
kids, Shaggy and Scooby-Doo to show up 'cause they just don't happen to
be here. It's been amazing to me that such opposition would come over
our emails over an amendment that, again, never existed, while the
government had language in it's budget to address this issue Moore
County law currently provides standards for commercial dog breeders that
sell to pet shops and research labs that does not provide standards for
commercial dog breeders that sell directly to the public and so, given
the language that he had put forth, it didn't match. It wasn't with the
spirit of the bill of House Bill 930. As you'll recall, and as you'll
look on that amendment, we exempt sporting dogs, hunting dogs, field
trials, and so forth. The rationale being that I, as well as the
sponsors and my co-sponsors understood that those folks take good care
of their dogs and we wanted to avoid getting mixed up in the same old
debate that has come through the House and Senate as we look at this
issue that it somehow touches agriculture. So we got out of that. This
is very similar to HB-930, contains the same definition of commercial
dog breeder but does not spell out the standards which we did in that
bill. You can only go so far and I know what the appetite might be for
here today. The standards will established by the Department of Public
Safety. If all we do is move the animal welfare section from the
Department of Agriculture to the Department of Public Safety, which is
already in the budget that we're voting on tonight, without these
changes we do nothing to address this issue and this problem in North
Carolina. In fact, we go backwards. All the work that we have done along
with the help of the Governor and the First Lady, will be gone and we'll
have to start all over again. The language is much narrower than the
original Governor's, than the original language in the Governor's budget
proposal and only covers the large scale commercial breeders. North
Carolina's one of the most popular states in the country for puppy mill</p>

They know they can move in here because we don’t have state laws that
regulate them. Virginia and Tennessee do, but North Carolina does not.
North Carolinians had twenty puppy mills in the last two years. You have

since some of you need links, if you go to ?? News site and say North
Carolinians, there is one going on the deck. Almost nine out of ten
North Carolinians support regulations for commercial ?? I hop you would
support this language. I will add it in there. Will send it to the

same issue back last over a year ago. I urge your support and appreciate
it
[speaker changes] Rep Dickson, please state your purpose
[Speaker changes] To debate the amendment
[Speaker changes] Gentlemen Right now is to debate the amendment
[Speaker changes] Thank you speaker. I was one of the positive votes in
the last session and was very pleased to cast that positive vote.
However, since then a lot of things has happened that should not have
happened. I hope it’s not a surprise and this is one of the only
disappointing things that I would have in reference to representatives
saying in his eloquent speech supporting this amendment. If there is
anybody on the floor of this house who is surprised that there is some
announcement that there is some raid going on today then I have got some
nice highway front property in the middle of goshim, which is a nice
area in ?? I would like to sell you. You could go to the human society’s
website and part of the web site you would find six pages of criteria
for states to be graded according to what they refer to is human state
rankings. On page 5 of those 6 pages, we would find this criteria. It’s
about 70 or 80 about this criteria. Then they check all of these states
whether these states meet  that criteria or not. And on page 5 is this
criteria. This includes basic human standards for dogs and puppy mills.
And North Carolina is checked as being in compliance with that. So, I
could stand here and say many other things. But believing that brevity
can be  powerful, I won’t say anything else less I have to asked to
speak again rather than tell you that on a scale of 1 to 10 and my
opposition to this amendment, I am at a 45 vote No.
[Speaker Changes] President ?? Please state you purpose
[Speaker changes] To debate the amendment Mr Speaker
[Speaker Changes] Gentlemen Right now is to debate the amendment
[Speaker changes] Thank you. I supported this bill when it came through.
Last session. I am actually the owner of a puppy mill rescue from
Brunswick county. Her name is Selvey and she had been in the cage for 3
years and I have no idea how many puppies she would have had. After the
raid, we were asked to be her foster parents. After about two hours we
fell in love and we decided to adopt her. But she could not walk. She
had never been out of the cage. Her feet all brown her paws were all
brown from  standing in her own waist. She had all sorts of illnesses.
Finally when she took her outside for the first time, the way she stood
there and looked at the trees and looked at the sky, she saw the world
for the first time. If we don’t find a way to make it better then we are
not doing the right thing. I strongly urge you to support this.
[Speaker changes] Rep Collins, Please state your purpose
[Speaker changes] To see if Rep ?? would be here
[Speaker changes] Rep ??, is there a gentlemen in you?
[Speaker Changes] I think so
[Speaker Changes] I believe I heard you say in there after the raid, is
that what I understand correctly?
[Speaker Changes] That’s correct
[Speaker Changes] Gentlemen in yours
[Speaker changes] This is one thing that I don’t understand about this
whole bill. If we already have laws in place where we raid this puppy
mill and take care of the problem, then what’s the need for this
additional legislation?
[Speaker changes] In my opinion it would and I have told to the local
sheriff department, we would give them more authority to do more often
inspections.</p>

Thank you Mr.Speaker. Members of the House, I am in favor of doing this I voted for the bill but I do have some concerns as some others have seen in the past now about policy going in to the budget. And I’m worried about what’s going to happen if we have bills that we pass and send over to the senate they don’t act on them as is their right as a body I don’t know why they do the things they do but I am concerned about loading up the budget with every provision we want to force them to accept in law.

The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.

[Speaker change]

Thank you very much Mr. Speaker and members, this relates specifically to a prevision that’s in the special provisions. It is the rural charter school development pilot program and I think I can speak with some history here because this was provision for the $300,000 to this private organization Parents for Educational Freedom was proposed last year in the budget and it may surprise some of you but I actually voted for that and spoke to it in the education subcommittee. And agreed with it and here’s how it was said last year, and specifically the reason that I voted for it. It was told that it was going to be used as an assistencing grants to try and get more rural counties to have the  wherewithal to create applications for charter schools. I thought that was a good thing still do. We are there needed because part of the issue about charters has been that they crop up in lots of urban areas but that places that may could use them the most we don’t have much charter development. I thought that was legitimate and whether it was going to the private group or not I thought that was at least enough to give it a shot. And I didn’t look at this provision when we were in subcommittee the other day because I assumed it was the same $300,000 because it didn’t pass the senate as I recall. We put it in and it didn’t pass. so I was fine with it. Until I read what it’s going for this year. If you look with me on the budget provision in section 8.31C last year this was sold to us as this is going to be money to help rural charters get charters and apply for charters to give more people an opportunity. It’s not going for that this year. PFNC shall require the grant recipients and here’s what it’s going for, it’s going to 12 charter schools, which is fine, in counties with currently with less than a 65% rate, but if you look at the criteria the only people who can grants are those that have already been approved by the state board to operate the charter. This isn’t going any longer for the purpose it was set out for, which was to help get more people to apply for charters and have better applications in communities that might not have had the wherewithal to really put together a good charter application. Now it’s not going for that at all. Now it’s going to a select set of charters that have already been granted for what reasons the provision doesn’t say with no criteria about how this private group is to grant  the grants. Look at the provision there is nothing

<p id="300:00">
Anything in there about the criteria that they will issue. This private
group will issue 12 grants, but what selection material? We don't know.
We get on DPI appropriately all the time because we don't have
supervision over what they're doing, who they're granting to, that it
could be political grants. We've put nothing in here. Well, that didn't
bother me when we were doing it to get charters. It bothers me a lot
about a private group selecting what charters are going to get state
money through their organization with no criteria. I think that's just
fundamentally wrong, and I take you back to a criticism the majority
legitimately had on the Hatney plan years ago that created a 13 million
dollar fund for after school and school improvement programs, and
at-risk students. The first year that came out, a legitimate criticism
was we didn't have sufficient oversight or criteria. We put in pages,
pages, in the next couple budgets of criteria and supervision because we
didn't want it being abused, and that was legitimately done at the
result of the argument. Here, we put nothing in, and we've changed the
total purpose they're seeking the money for. That is fundamentally
wrong, and I'm transferring it for now in this budget provision to
what's an open category where we have a huge deficit and we've cut
repeatedly and that is school supplies, because I would rather schools
get the money for children and supplies than not know where any of it's
going for a purpose that was completely different than how it was
originally set out, and I ask for your support on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blackwell, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentlemen was recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, this concern that my friend Representative Glazier has
raised is not something that I think as he acknowledged, he had
discussed with us, I actually agree with him that the intent was that
this is entirely to be used in trying to develop new charter schools
where they don't exist in counties that would have the difficulty with
our assistance in putting together an application. Taking Representative
Glazier's word that he was for this before, and I hope would be for it
with that change, I would ask the house to defeat the amendment that
he's offering, or maybe Representative Glazier might consider
withdrawing it or displacing it. Representative Stam is already working
on amendment to address the concern to try to come up with language that
would hopefully say something along the lines of assisting those who are
in the process of applying or intend to or desire to. We'll be glad to
work with Representative Glazier to try to hopefully have language that
we can all agree serves that purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blackwell, if the chair will, if the gentlemen will
indulge the chair, understands that Representative Stam may be sending
forth a perfecting amendment that may address the concern.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, if I might speak.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentlemen has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would temporarily displace the amendment in the hope as opposed to
maybe the easiest is to instead of perfecting to ?? the amendment that
does what they're trying to do, and I'd be glad to do that if we're able
to reach an agreement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, we've displaced it once, why not again? We'll displace the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We'll move now. Representative Earl, is the lady ready to take up her
amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I wish to withdraw my amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady's amendment will be withdrawn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cunningham, is the lady ready to send forward her
amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr. Speaker, I am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cunningham is recognized to send forth an amendment, the
??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This amendment allows the department of cultural resources not to
allocate a grant to municipal or single county library from the aid to
public library's funds that exceeds 475,000. The original cap was
400,000, so by doing this it will not impact the wake or the ??
libraries as much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cunningham, the chair understands that maybe we've worked
out a different ammendment, so I want to make sure the proper amendment
is before us. It's the understanding of the chair that the lady wishes
to withdraw the amendment ALG-67 and send forth the amendment ALG-69.
Does that...</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen for those
of you who have been here for a while, this is a familiar amendment.
We’ve passed it out of the house twice, maybe three times but I know at
least twice. This amendment will repeal the board of governors authority
to give in-state tuition to out of state and out of country students
from the various and sundry foundations that fund students to go to our
universities. We presently have some 1,300 of these students in our
universities and these students being treated as in-state students mean
that 1,300 seats that belong to North Carolinians are being filled by
out of state and out of country students. I constantly hear the argument
that this brings in the brightest people in the world to our
universities and it may do that and I have no problem with that however
I do have a problem our rate payers subsidizing foundations to bring in
these brightest people. The foundations have sufficient funds, most of
them do I imagine, I can’t speak for all of them. Most of them have
sufficient funds to cover the cost of these students that they wish to
sponsor and they should be the one spaying the freight for these
students, not the rate payer of North Carolina. We shouldn’t be
subsidizing people from Brazil, from the United Kingdom, from Malaysia,
not Malaysia Morocco, from Canada, from Nigeria, from Vietnam. We should
not be subsidizing those students. I hope I have your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Jeter please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I’m opposed to this amendment in it’s totality. A
little bit of history, we argued this policy in the house of education
last year and it failed in the house of education committee so it didn’t
get past house of education, didn’t make it in the floor so we’re going
to stick it in the budget this year. Here’s the problem, and I’m not..</p>

<p id="310:00">
Going to sit here and deny that there are some cases where this makes
sense, but we don’t want to throw the baby out with the bath water. Let
me give you a prime example. Let’s take the Levine Scholarship at UNC
Charlotte. Levine Scholarship is put out by a private foundation, the
Levine family, one of the most philanthropic families in the Charlotte
area. They have a scholarship that funds anywhere from 15 to 16
students, it’s 15 or 16, that scholarship mandates that 4 to 5 must be
out of state. Currently those 4 to 5 out of state tuitions get in state
tuition. That’s part of the process and that’s what Representative
Cleveland is trying to kill. The problem you get is, the Levine
Scholarship since it’s their money, gets to make their rules. And what
happens if this passes, is there are 8 North Carolina students at UNC
Charlotte that will not get a scholarship. You are not hurting the 5
people out of state. They’re coming anyway. It’s a mandated part of the
funds. Who you are hurting is the people of North Carolina who are no
longer going to be eligible for the 248 thousand dollars in scholarships
because of this vote. We go to the Moorehead Caine, you go to the Park
Scholarship, they’re all over the place. These aren’t state funded
scholarship programs. These are independent philanthropic scholarship
programs that will take money, or take students’ opportunity, North
Carolina students’ opportunity away from attending our UNC system, if we
pass this amendment. I urge you to defeat it as we did in House
Education last year. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Adams, please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Question for Representative
Cleveland. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Cleveland, does the
gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Cleveland,
you didn’t give us the names of the scholarships. Could you do that?
We’ve got a lot of new people here you mentioned a sundry, but what can
you? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Are you asking? Mr. Speaker? Are you asking who
the groups are that give the scholarships? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If you’ll bear with me, I have, I thought I had, we
have Chancellor Scholars, Wilson Scholars, Park Scholarships, Moorehead
Caine, Robertson Davis United World, Thomas Wolfe, Keenan Music, Levine
Scholars, Ground Scholars, and that’s about all I have on my list.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Saine, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Speaker. Just real quick, I’m opposed to the amendment for this
very reason. And if you’ve attended one of our public universities in
North Carolina, you know that students from other places bring value
added to our students. Students from North Carolina learn a lot from
folks from other places. It enhances their educational experience. I ask
that you vote against the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Glazier, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To briefly debate
the amendment, please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to
debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much, and I
appreciate Representative Cleveland and I have had this debate many
times. There used to be two sets of out of state. One was academic and
one was athletic. He and I were in much agreement and eventually
actually in 2009 or 10, we got rid of the athletic ones, because I
thought that was an inappropriate use and I think a majority of this
body did. But the academic scholarships are a different story for a
couple of reasons. One, this affects as he said 11 campuses. On all 11
campuses it’s hundreds, three or four hundred total, maybe 450 actually,
students involved. The two important points, or three important points I
would say. Number one, not only what Representative Jeter eloquently
said that a number of these scholarships have mandated specifics as to
the number of out of state they can have, which then supply an
inordinate number of in state students with their scholarship money and
saves the state an enormous amount of expense because they’re funded
through that scholarship. Second, listening to the bodies debate over
the years, these scholarships have also tried and Moorehead is a classic
example last year, they added 10 additional North Carolina students to
the scholarship rolls. By having the state support to reduce the out of
state to in state, it allow</p>

<p id="315:00">
a lot more money to be available then to in-state students to get the
scholarships. If we take this away, we’re not just hurting the out of
state not getting it, we not just keeping those globally competitive
students from being here and staying here, who we are really hurting is
North Carolina students. Who otherwise might not be going to Carolina,
or Chapel, or to State or to Charlotte or to Winston Salem State and all
the campuses that have these because there the ones who are going to
loose out on the scholarship money. it’s really, in a sense counter
intuitive, but it’s exactly right. By doing this the people we’re
hurting the most are the in-state students who have the scholarship. I
don’t think that would be worth it. For the money we’re getting from
these scholarships, it is saving us far, far more. And I would really
encourage the defeat of this amendment. Thank you.

Thank you, Mister Speaker. Ladies and gentleman, I think the case has
been well made. And, at the risk of and rather, to ensure that I don’t
say what’s all ready been said, I will say that the ed. chairs have
reviewed this policy and this program. We’ve debated it in Committee.
It’s been debated, as you’ve heard, several years in education as well
as in appropriations. And I urge you strongly, on behalf of all the
chairs, to oppose the amendment. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mister Speaker. I really need to reiterate Representative
Horn’s point. Don’t want to say what’s all ready been said. But as
someone who has concern for our obligations for our in-state students, I
do think Representative Glazier appropriately put it that we have, at
the end of the day, scholarships are one big pot of money. And if you
lower this, you lower the pot of money, these out of state scholarships
are not going away. And so it actually end up hurting the scholarship
money we have for in-state students. So I would urge you to vote against
the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cleveland, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak a second time on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mister Speaker. I appreciate all the arguments against my
amendment. However, I have a problem with my tax payers supporting
foundations who have ample funds to cover the cost of any student they
want to send to our universities. I think your arguments are fallacious,
and I did not buy into them. If a organization requires five out of
state or out of country students and they’re going to have eight
in-state  students, then that organization should pay the fee. Not the
tax payer of North Carolina. The idea that we need these people to
better our state or better our universities, I don’t think is true
either. We are taking seats away from North Carolina students that want
to go to universities. We have give or take around thirteen hundred
seats in the universities that belong to North Carolina students. And
our rate payers are subsidizing to make these seats to make sure that
our North Carolina students don’t get them. That’s wrong. I don’t care
how you try to cut it, that’s wrong. I would hope that you will support
the amendment.

Members, these scholarships are historic and many of them were funded by
very generous private philanthropists who cared about the university and
the future of the state. And I think that we’re honoring a tradition by
having the in-state tuition. It let’s us spread the money over more
years and support more students. These students that come in are very
bright. They stay in North Carolina. Many of them stay in North
Carolina, start businesses here and make a real contribution.</p>

raises the cap from $400 to 475,000 for the library grants and by doing
that it lessens the impact on Mecklenburg and Wake County and it also
spreads out the rest of the reduction to all the libraries so it’s more
equitable so that it’s only about a 1% cut that is spread out throughout

Increases the budget for UNC need based financial program, aid program,

reduction by five million dollars. The management flex cut is currently
19 million, 19.8 million. This would increase the budget cut to 24.8
million. The five million equals less than 0.2 percent. That's 0.2
percent of the UNC budget. This amendment would give 2.5 million for
need based aid at Elizabeth City State University, and that is my alma
mater, and you've heard that over the past few weeks what the attempt
was. Last fiscal year, the UNC need budget for need based grant program
served 1,629 students at Elizabeth City, using a total of 2.2 million.

I would urge my colleagues to vote &quot;No&quot; on the amendment. If
there is the need that representative Mobley states here it would be
certainly appropriate for the board of governors to make that decision,
and to allocate additional moneys to these schools or to other schools,
but we have a board of governors for a reason. Taking money, putting
more of a burden of a cut on the board of governors and giving them less
flexibility in how they spend their money I believe is really a mistake,
and again, this is in some ways a precedent issue here. I just don't
think we ought to go down this road, because once we start down here and
are making these sorts of decisions about how we're going to send
financial aid to one school and not to another school, we put ourselves
in a very, very difficult position. I urge my colleagues to vote
&quot;No&quot; on the amendment.

Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the house, a few moments back,
before we took the recess, Representative Hanes made an impassioned plea
aimed particularly at minority community, along with Representative
Brown. I noticed the applause that wasn't aloud supporting what they
were saying. Here you have an opportunity to really express your wishes,
and I say that because, understand, Elizabeth City State University was
put on the chopping block by our friends across the hall. There was a
lot of publicity on that, and that publicity caused a lot of harm. Even
though they pulled it out, it caused a lot of harm to that school in
terms of recruiting students, in terms of recruiting faculty. One of the
things they said is that &quot;The student enrollment had dropped
off.&quot; Well, if you use this two and a half million dollars, it can
increase that student enrollment. Elizabeth City is a very significant
university in the system, and I don't mind telling you that I had a
client, speaking of ladies and gentlemen, that gave, and even in spite
of that, had came out and gave a half a million dollars to an endowed
scholarship in Elizabeth City State University. Now, it is a viable
institution, and it ought to remain that way. The other two and a half
million in there is for the other historically black colleges and
universities in order to get more students in there, and it affects the
minority of the community.</p>

Like I said, since we heard what you did from impassioned please by
Representative Heinz and Representative Brandon, this is your
opportunity to really express your feelings about that and particularly
the minority community. But I simply express to you the fact that you
live in the city state university, it is the third most viable economic
engine in that region. And to equate it in a position that they are in
right now, it was certainly attainable. And I know that the board of
governors, now, come on, folks, face it. Y'all have changed the board of
governors, basically, all the way around. So we don't know what that
board of governors is gonna do. We don't have a much minority
representation on that board of governors as we've had in the past. And
so we just don't know, it's up to us and this body, to maintain those
institutions and I ask that you support this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The chair would take issue with one comment made by

done in every incident when that occurred over the last three and half

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady has recognize to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and Gentlemen, I can't
add a whole lot to it. I've spent 40 years on the camp for 7 HPCU, I've
been at college, I did my graduate and undergraduate work in North
Carolina NTC State University. I've been on every HPCU campus in the
state of North Carolina. Lead the North Carolina legislative black
caucus foundation and raise in scholarship. We appreciate all the
support that you've given us to help keep students in school and to make
education accessible and affordable. We talked a lot tonight about
opportunity. So here's your opportunity to help students who need that
opportunity. Some of these students, a lot of these students are from
North Carolina, but all of these students, as we look at the attendance
and the financial status of many of our students who attend HPCUs, all
of them are in dire need of help. Many of them are first generation
college students as I was. And so I think we have a responsibility as
well to help these students. They are trying to help themselves by
getting a college education. That is the way for young people to move up
and ahead, and too many of them, if they are not from North Carolina
will remain here as I did, become a productive citizen and tax payers.
But we do know, and I have to share Representative Michelle's concern
about our board of governors. It is not diverse anymore. And I think we
also have to have people who know about these schools, because either
they have attended them or they've been on those campuses, they have
relatives but they know something internally and intrinsically about how
they work and the needs of those students, and I guess, you can't teach
want you don't know. But, it is really imperative that we not only help
our students and these colleges and universities to survive but they
must thrive. And here's an opportunity that we have to create
opportunity, and maybe we can get Representative Haines to get up and
give another passionate speech about the opportunity for these young
people who are attending this college. It's a beautiful campus. They've
got great programs there. But they simply need some help and some
assistance, and this is the way for us to do that. If we say we care
about diversity, if we say we care about students and what happens to
them, because what happens to them will enable our state to be
maintained and to grow. So I would urge you to support this amendment.
It's certainly very favor. I mean, we got a lot of things in this budget
that are giving our people and other entities and opportunity, and these
young people need it. I would encourage your support of this amendment.

...think. From my discussions with members of the board of governors.
They are very well aware of the situation at Elizabeth City State
University. Everyone is concerned about the health of that institution.
At least people that I talk to quite often for some time. I think there
are efforts underway  to resolve a number of the issues at Elizabeth
City State. And to make sure that, that can be a very viable institution
for many years to come. And I think obviously the point is well made
about the impact on the economy of the Northeast that Elizabeth City
State has. But I want folks to understand something, um, we on the
republican side have had to ask for restraint from some of our members.
I have had to restrain myself in certain ways. When the thought comes to
mind let's have more restrictions on what the board of governors can and
can't do. We have been moving in a direction over the last several years
and certainly this year to give the board of governors the opportunity
to actually implement reforms and modernize things in our university
system, and ensure that in future generations we will have the type of
university system that we want in this state we have a tremendous board.
And I'm not saying that in relation to any of the past boards, but I can
say for this board, it is one of the most accomplished boards of
governors that I have ever seen. The collection of individuals. They are
very accomplished, they are very serious, they are very dedicated. And I
think they take very seriously the issues that have been raised in
Elizabeth City State and all of the 16 university campuses as well as
the schools of math and science and other responsibilities that we have.
So, I believe that we need to not include this amendment. To feed this
amendment and give them the opportunity don't, let's not shackle them
let's give them the opportunity to do the work that they need to do as a
board of governors and I think we will be- I think all of us in this
chamber will be very pleased with the results and be able to strongly
support them moving forward. Thank you.

I just wanted to stand up. I don't want to be repetitive. I want to
support this amendment if you'll look on line 18 of the amendment we are
talking about North Carolina's only historical American Indian
universities which is UNC,P and in that part of the state we have many
Native American students or American Indian students, however you want
to recognize the American Indians in this state, that would love to
attend that university. However, due to financial circumstances. Due to
their lack of support within the family they are unable to do that. This
is another opportunity grant at the highest level, as we say in our
community we would love to have your support and appreciate everything
you do. This is a wonderful opportunity to do something good for the
American Indian population as well as the other universities mentioned
in this amendment. Thank you, and I encourage your vote of support.

Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members, I rise in support of the amendment. I do
agree with Chairman Dollar regarding the outstanding, and very
accomplished board of governors that we currently have. And I do think
that they will make fantastic decisions moving forward. I also agree
that they need maximum flexibility. But in this case, when we look at
universities like Elizabeth City State, and you look at their decreased
enrollment. Ladies and gentlemen, all you have to do is go to Elizabeth
City, look at the area, look at the region.  Their decreased enrollment
has nothing to do with whether kids want to go to college and better
their lives. It has to do with what they have in terms of resources. Go
to Elizabeth City State. If you haven't been there, please do it. It is
a beautiful campus in a beautiful city. With outstanding kids who could
and would...</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Pierce, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
Mr. Speaker, Ladies and gentlemen, I rise this afternoon to support this
amendment for a couple of reasons. You spent a lot of [wuss] in the
chamber, in the general assembly of the last two sessions. We've heard
about consolidating and I think, I heard representative dollar talk
about some things, how good a job people are doing but there was some
[wuss] a couple of years ago about consolidation. I think that's still
in demand of some folks so we need to consider that and what happened
just a few weeks ago I think that you'll remember that legislative black
caucus had a press conference to lay us out against the proposal that
was on the table in dealing with Elizabeth City. But with that proposal
on the table, what you end up doing was you put a nail in the coffin.
Because of what happened students who were thinking about going to
Elizabeth City, you put something in their minds they can then believe
that maybe for a year or two the school could close down. So, I think we
set a dangerous precedent for Elizabeth City by doing that. Black
Universities have been underfunded for years and I think we all know
that and they face a very difficult time and we've got a lot of issues
that we definitely need to deal with but I think we're setting a
dangerous precedent dealing with Elizabeth City because I think that the
[competition] is still gonna be out there. I think the board of
governors still have a mind to find some way somehow to close that
University down. We don't need to run from it, we don't need to hide
from it. I believe they're still talking about it while they're drinking
ice water in back rooms, they are still talking about that. Why do you
say that representative Pierce?
Because we've been talking about it for two sessions; each time we would
beat it back but I still think the reality is on the table to try to
find a way. We're pulling programs, we're pulling curriculum, I remember
that. Keep right on pulling that and eventually students would not want
to go to that University. So, Representative Mobley has a good proposal
on the table. And you're right. I think when I stand and speak, people
say well he's preaching. What's in like everybody else who deny who
don't have a life has been preaching so, I guess I need to preach. But I
think we really need to take a hard look at this and let's be fair to
this university. You have dug a hole for this university in the last two
sessions. Ladies and gentlemen, you did that. You have sent a negative
signal across this state and to surrounding areas. Students who would
consider going there, you sent the wrong signal. So we're asking
tonight, I agree with my colleagues, we need to do the right thing. It's
not gonna hurt the budget. This will help them recruit, this will help
them sustain programs already at that University. Let's give them a
chance. I ask you to vote yes on this amendment. Thank you, Mr. Speaker
and Ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak briefly on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the house, for many
years I've represented in my district, the North Carolina central
University and we're proud and ?? of the work that NCCU has done for our
community and for the state and for the nation. The reason I'm speaking
to support the amendment is because the amendment is about financial
assistance for students and I learned a few years ago in research and in
conversation at NCCU some realities about income of the families at the
HPCUs of our state and Pembroke State vs. UNC Chapel Hill and NC State
and the reality is this that for the five HPCUs, the average family
income is 30,000 dollars. At NC State and at UNC Chapel Hill, the
average family income is 90,000 dollars. It's obvious then that the
young people who are attending these schools badly need financial
assistance and that to me is enough reason for us to make a special
step, an unusual step that ?? to provide assistance for young people.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Baskerville please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of this
amendment. We’ve talked a lot about education today, K-12. This bill
deals with a lifetime of learning, continued education across a lifespan
of young folks that might not have been able to get into school in other
places have an opportunity to attend Elizabeth State City University, I
know this from first hand experience with members of my family, and it
is an economic driver in that region and let’s give some of these young
folks an opportunity that want to go to school. These aren’t folks that
are hanging out in the streets or getting into trouble or doing bad
things, these are folks that can’t afford to go. Elizabeth City is
providing them an opportunity to get a four year degree and I think we
need to support that. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Brandon please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I do rise to support the amendment. I went to an HBCU.
I will let you know that one of the things that I notice is everybody
has talked about the disadvantages that students have at the HBCUs but
one of the things that I noticed about HBCUs here is that we have a
disadvantage is that we did not have the same type of influence. I see
that the UNC, Chapel Hill, and NC State lobbyists here are making sure
that they are getting funding in all different types of ways. We’ve seen
bills come through here that NC State engineering program is somehow
better than UNC’s engineering program and they deserve more funding than
us. This is something that has been going on in this chamber for a long
time. I think that we can rectify some of that by number one
understanding that the same things Representative Brown and other folks
have talked about that there are disadvantages. People do not go to
college on the same level, $30,000 and $90,000 is a tremendous
difference and it’s also a difference in mindset, but just in the matter
of being here, just witnessing how other universities know how to
manipulate the system better than some of the HBCUs do that alone gives
you a tremendous amount of more coverage and more money that HBCUs just
simply do not get. This is a small drop in the budget and I think that
we should support this amendment because Elizabeth City, not only
Elizabeth City but UNC Pembroke and other HBCUs and schools of color
definitely need a little additional support and even with this support
that we would have we would still probably be 40-50% behind the rest of
the universities in terms of funding, even with that support. Just think
about that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Terry please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you very much Mr. Speaker. I have listened to the
various opinions about this and I stand in support of this amendment as
a person who has ten years of experience working in an HBCU some years
back, but one of the things that I want to bring up here is the
opportunity, and I’ve heard the word opportunity used, to allow us to
help Elizabeth City State University reach the potential that it has,
particularly as an economic engine for that region of the state. I have
heard and I have been in the committee sessions where our department of
commerce has established prosperity zones and from my perspective that
northeastern corridor of the state of North Carolina is an excellent
place for us to begin the investment to allow Elizabeth City to be a
part of the prosperity zone for that region that some of our other
universities, particularly the flagships have always and have always
been known to help with the public private partnerships that help us
with entrepreneurship and job development and all of that. I understand
that there’s a fabulous aviation program there that has made the state
very proud.</p>

And considering the size of this budget and all of the things that are
done, I’m new so I cannot possibly understand everything but I do know
within my judgment and the judgment of most people, $5 million here in
an area that is in desperate need of something to help it understand
what it’s endless possibilities may be, particularly for a prosperity
zone in the northeastern section of North Carolina, I cannot understand
why you would not be in favor of that. I recommend and support and hope
you will find, just a place in your heart to understand that we too
would like to be able to prosper. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Blackwell please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Speaker I want to again ask the house to reject
this particular amendment. It really isn’t in my judgment about whether
you want to try do something to indicate your support for Elizabeth City
State or any other particular institution. Keep in mind what this
amendment would do if adopted. It doesn’t create any new programs at
Elizabeth City, it doesn’t build anything. What it does is provide more
scholarship money that is specifically designated for students going
there, but there’s no evidence that anybody has presented to us in
subcommittee and certainly not on the floor today that there is a
shortage of funds available to needy students desiring to attend
Elizabeth City State or any other school that would be benefited by this
amendment. Currently there’s over $300 million available..
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Pierce please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Ask the member a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Blackwell thank you for your remarks
there but you made a part that it’s not building anything, I think it’s
building students and it’s building people to go out to do things in our
state. Let me ask you a question, do you not believe it’s building
people? Buildings are not always important, sometimes it’s more
important to be a student and to suggest that students don’t have
financial problems, that’s just not true. Do you think that’s true, that
students don’t have financial problems?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I believe if I understand your question that I agree
that any individual obtaining a college education is building for the
future and improving their prospects, improving the prospects for the
family that they have or may have, and that’s a good thing. I’m trying
to make a distinction though that what this bill would do is designate
specific funds for scholarships and the university already has over $300
million that will be distributed in the coming school year to students
on the base of need and there’s been no demonstration by anybody here on
the floor and certainly not in the committee that considered this
legislation that there is an unmet need at Elizabeth City or at any
other particular school. Moreover, this would take $5 million from the
university system in the form of an increased flex cut which they would
then have to distribute back out to the universities which would mean
Elizabeth City in order to get this extra money for students that may
not need it, would have to maybe distribute a cut to that same
university in order to come up with the $5 million. Moreover, there is
nothing with the present flexibility that the board of governors has to
prevent them from saying well if they’re going to make a special
provision for Elizabeth City State, we’ll push some more money into
other places since they’ve already gotten theirs from the legislature.
This just isn’t the way we ought to do it, if we want to do something
special for Elizabeth City we ought to discuss it in the long session
and we ought to decide what it is and then we can vote on it but this is
not the way to vote on it in my opinion.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Another question for the member.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] And Representative Blackwell the gentleman still has
the floor, you’re yielding to a question at the end of the question you
can either sit down or continue your debate..</p>

<p id="355:00">
I will yield if I have the floor still.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Representative Blackwell, you - I'm just going to make a point, then the
question - you're a very knowledgeable person. I've enjoyed the time we
fellow shipped here today so, but did you not believe, of all the
schools in the system - do you not believe, of all the schools in the
system that Elizabeth City is suffering at this point? From all that
we've heard and all that we've stood on the floor and talked about 35
minutes, it's obvious that Elizabeth City has a problem and we need to
rectify it today in this General Assembly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] With due respect to my colleagues here on the floor, I
understand that some claims and statements have been made to that effect
and because of that I think it's certainly would be something that the
Education Committees and the Appropriations Committee should look into,
but this is not the place to decide that an extra 2.5 million for
scholarships for students at Elizabeth City, whose needs for
scholarships may already be met out of the 300 million dollars that the
University is going to be able to loan out this year. I'm not sure
that's going to help Elizabeth City. It allows some people to say they
got it in there and it may look like we're doing something, but I'm
suggesting to you that if your purpose is to support and build up a
school that you think is in need of it. That this is not the way to go
about doing it. I would encourage you to discuss this with the Education
Committee and the Appropriations Committee and let's look at the facts
and if in fact they have specific needs that we can meet to try to build
them up then we can address it. I think this does it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up to the member.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blackwell, time is of the essence for
this University. There's no doubt about it ad I would hope that - you
made a point, let's wait till next year. I don't think, we don't have
the time to wait. I think the time is now while we can. We cannot wait
and I would hope that my fellow friends on the other side would
understand that. I just believe Mr. Speaker, I know I'm going a couple
ways here, but if it was any other university - and I don't want to go a
place that I don't, I don't want to go to a certain place with this -
but it just makes me, it troubles me that for two sessions, this
Elizabeth City has been proposed to be on the chopping block and here we
are still talking about it and had not the Black Caucus raised their
voice a couple weeks ago and that amendment would have gone through, I
think we'd have had some problems. So that's were my problem is. That
we're not being really genuine about what we're talking about tonight.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speaker, Mr. Speaker. I'm gonna assume there was a
question there and I'll respond in this way. In the last two sessions,
to my knowledge there's been no discussion on the House Educations
Appropriations subcommittee about consolidating, closing, or doing
anything that I can think of that would be negative as it is directed to
anyone or more, certainly not Elizabeth City State at the university
level. So I really don't think it's been on the chopping block, except
that maybe somebody in the other body is talking about it, but we
haven't taken that up. But my final response to your comments and I hope
I'm not being repetitive or redundant in saying this is, I don't think
this amendment accomplishes anything to advance your purpose. We don't
know that there's students that aren't going to be able to go to
Elizabeth City State because they don't have scholarship money. What we
do know is if this amendment passes is that the Board of Governors is
going to have to distribute 5 million dollars in additional cuts and
that some of those cuts, that might not otherwise go to Elizabeth City
State, may well go there because they got to find the best places to go.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One more just quick, Mr. Speaker. One more question
and I will have it in the form of a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blackwell, were you aware that 97.5% of
the full time, undergraduates going to Elizabeth City receives financial
aid and did you realize that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't know that exact number. I would have assumed
that it was a high percentage.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm gonna be fair to what I said. This is the end of
it. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

the motion passes, now we ate back on the bill about roll 3 minutes to
be allocated to each side, representative Hall may choose the speaker to
delicate the comments. Representative Hall.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker I will accept the three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for a period not to exceed
3 minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentleman we had a good discussion and the
reason we have these budget sessions obviously is because this is the
place we do business. So when I just hear for a vacation we here because
we here to do business tonight and we have changed this process that we
don't go through the self-committees and give proper disclosure and
opportunity for everyone to get their proposals in and get them fairly
heard. So we have pushed the budget to now to become a document where we
have these kind of decisions made in big appropriations meet right
before hand and yes we do better than the Senate but that's a pretty low
bar and then we do it here than we do it here on the floor. Now I am not
gonna preach because I don't have a license. I can get one do I rest
assure but let me tell you this because I did getter earlier tonight how
important it is to be consistent and we are taking about supporting an
institution that's the third largest economic dreary in the eastern
region of the state, we know they need help out there period, no
question no dispute on that but I want to tell you about consistency,
those of you know in darn we got a school of math and science so
everybody knows about it right? Party university system, everybody knows
about school of science and math in darn. Well we don't do things like
this but in yesterday in appropriations everybody was dead no one knows
what we did. We took 5 million dollars and say it hey we don't have the
studies we need another school of math and science in the university
system but we took 5 million dollars and provided plan and money we took
1.2 million in ferns to be used by board of governor's university
directed them to plan for another 800 thousand to sight it and then
finally directed them to distributor 1 million 200 thousand in the
section not be spend for any purpose other than just advance planning.
So we create a whole school, we create a whole duplicative school in the
region of the state because somebody either is from that district or
they just got the power to do it and it is in your budget, it's in your
budget not to pass inappropriations yesterday but tonight when there is
time try to save 4-5 schools and at the moment after we damaged their
public reputation and their ability to function I am getting notes and
their ability to function we decide this is not the place to do it and
now no such objections were raised yesterday in appropriations nobody
see this is not the place to create a whole new school in the university
system. Board of governor is gonna ask for it, scolds of science and
math in darn didn't say we need help we got too many students we need
you to build another campus. There is no study that recommended it. So
when we talk about consistency we talk about fairness, we talk about
what we would be doing and when and where we should be doing it then
this consistency issue comes in again and I gotta note here lemme see,
alright I am not gonna repeat what's been said already about the impact
but yes I am about what happened with the Senate last year proposing the
close of this ?? state university and then coming up again this year in
the discussion, thank you very much for your vote we consistent and
support this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen just as a point of clarification.</p>

Fact and in calling the previous question on an amendment, there is no
obligation to provide the three minutes. The Chair used his discretion
to do that. The question before the House is the passage of the
amendment sent forth by Representative Mobley, for the House Committee
Substitute for Senate Bill 744. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote
no. The clerk will open the vote. [LONG PAUSE] The clerk will let the
machine record the vote. 49 having voted in the affirmative and 66 in
the negative, the amendment fails. Representative Glazier, the Chair
understands that the gentleman wishes to withdraw amendment AMK-102?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct, Mr. Speaker. There will be a
different amendment coming. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam is
recognized to send forth that amendment. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Stam moves to amend the bill on page 39, lines
50 and 51, by deleting those lines and therefore. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks, Mr. Speaker. We were sort of like ships passing in the night,
not really understanding what was intended. This limits the grants
before school opens, the charter school opens, but allows it to also be
used before the charter is granted. But mainly it’ll be used for the
planning year which is between those two events. I move adoption of the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to Representative Stam’s amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And although this is a bit
broader than it was last year, I think it’s limited in this way. It’s
still going to help charters be developed in rural counties. It is only
for that purpose, and then to assist them as they’re planning to open.
It is not the ones that they’ve assisted in getting the grant. They are
not, it cannot be used for operations. It cannot be used to help the
charter once it’s operating. There’s going to be no distinction. So this
is I think still essentially tied to its purpose, albeit a touch
broader. It is my hope that over the course of the interim, that there’s
some criteria that continues to be put for purposes of accountability.
But I think this is back to its original purpose and would urge adoption
of the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate.
If not, the question before the House is the passage of the amendment
sent forth by Representative Stam to House Committee Substitute number 2
for Senate Bill 744. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The
clerk will open the vote. [PAUSE] The clerk will let the machine record
the vote. 114 having voted in the affirmative, 2 in the negative, the
amendment passes. Representative Davis is recognized to send forth an
amendment. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Davis
moves to amend the bill on page 279, line 37 by added immediately after
the line the following language to read. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

incentive issue to proceed for further discussion between the House and
the Senate. Mr. Speaker, Representative Ruth Samuelson and I worked
together on this amendment and I request that you recognize her to
explain it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samuelson, please state
your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Members, basically what this amendment does is convert the film
credit into a grant program. You may be familiar with that. As you know
simplifying our tax code so it helps all people who want to create jobs
do so in North Carolina is one of our objectives. In doing that for the
film industry as a grant program through the division of commerce will
be very helpful. Ultimately this will allow the secretary of commerce to
negotiate and prioritize film projects based on jobs created in North
Carolina, infrastructure improvements in capital investment, and
economic impact. There are several things in it. It will allow her, her
or him, in the future</p>

<p id="370:00">
Prioritize grants based on an economic impact analysis that will be
conducted by the Labor and Economic Development Division. It will
require production companies to offer marketing opportunities in
promotional value for North Carolina for things like our logo and
call-outs.
And it will also allow the Secretary to enter into 3-year contracts with
a sunset in 2020, and this is there to help provide the needed certainty
that any business needs when they're going to have a grant.
And then it requires a full audit before the grant is ever paid. The way
we did this for the budget is it only appropriates five dollars in
Fiscal Year 2014-2015 to put the program on the table for negotiations
in the conference process. If you all have been following the news
around the country, these film credits and film programs have been up
and down all over the country, and so this will give us a chance to look
at it and figure out within our budget constraints in working with the
Senate to figure out what is the appropriate amount to put in the budget
for this year.
Our intent is to keep North Carolina competitive, to retain the jobs and
capital investment we have now, and create new opportunities in this
expanding job sector. I encourage your support.

[Speaker Changes]
Ladies and Gentlemen of the House that just rised to support the
amendment, I'm sorry that we didn't have -- we weren't able to keep in
place what we currently have for the film industry, but I will hold this
up to remind you of the jobs that are created in this State by the film
industry. If you have not been to visit a set, I encourage you to go do
it. But if you go on a set,  you're gonna meet people that are your
neighbors. They're not people from out-of-state, these are people that
over the last 20-some years in North Carolina, if not longer, they have
grown this industry, and it is continuing to grow.
I know some of you have received a bunch of e-mails. I keep in
constantly receiving emails, and have been for the last 2 years, when
we've had this every year come up, &quot;Are we going to extend the
credit-- the deadline for the credit?&quot;. Well, the sunset, excuse
me. Representative Danny McComas, from Wilmington, for years stood up
here and defended this credit, fought for it, and kept it going. And I
applaud the Representatives to night that have stood up and put
something forward for us to keep talking. You've heard me say that, and
I'm gonna keep reminding us of that.
This is an industry, and again, it creates jobs. Go talk to welders who
have jobs today because of the film industry. Talk to the printing
companies, who during the recession -- there's a guy in Charlotte  that
has been across the state promoting this incentive -- but just promoting
the fact that the film industry does promote jobs. Talk to him about
during the recession, how he was able to keep his business afloat from
the industry. From a TV show that was being filmed right in his area.
I could go on and on with the stories, but I want you to have an
opportunity to hear from these workers in North Carolina, people that
are buying a home for the first time, young people. It is an industry
that crosses all ages. Yeah, I'm passionate about it. I wanna get you
passionate. I wanna get you excited about it, because it not only is
about somebody standing in front of a camera, like we do up here --
we're all actors. It isn't all about that. It is beyond -- beyond those
big-name peoples that don't live in North Carolina. It drill it down to
our homegrown jobs in North Carolina. So I urge your support for this
amendment, and let's keep the ball rolling.

I just want to be sure that we’re not moving money out of the P3

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Davis, I just have a question. I’m
trying to understand what’s on line 27, on page 1. It says that this
money will not be used for grants of more than certain dollars. $5
million for feature length film. The next part is the one I’m a little
concerned about. It says more than $5 million for a single episode of a
television or video production. Does that mean that on a typical I think
it’s maybe 13 episode or some are 9 episodes, some are 13 episodes a
season, that we could be out for as much as $65 million for a single
television production? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
have a follow up, then. Can you tell me what that means then? $5 million
per episode. Is there a limit to how many episodes we’ll support?

this amendment will do, will be to extend a program that we put in place
last year to fund the group homes that were housing the individuals who
had last their PCS coverage due to changes in the rules and we said in
that original language that the funding would end either on June 30th of
this year or when the funds were fully expended and due to the beginning
of a slow process, it’s not been completed yet and what we’re actually

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Speaker. We’ve had a good number of
amendments and I can appreciate the time that we spent on the amendments
and the compilation of this document. By and large, I sincerely
appreciate the many improvements that we’ve made in education
particularly, I suppose, to what we received from the Senate. Our
attempt to give teachers a decent raise is quite laudable and
commendable. Our attempt to give state employees a raise, it’s
commendable. However, the uncertainty of the stability of these raises
gives me concern. Reliance on the lottery proceeds, the increasing
lottery proceeds gives me a bit of heartburn. I wish we had a more
stable source of revenue. They use our public school fund to fund
vouchers for private education, greatly disturbs me. We.</p>

Speaker: Have received passionate please that poor children cannot or
will be deprived of a decent adequate education without those firms.if
you would allows me a bit of personal testimony i would ?? you but
that's just not true.You see I'm the sixth child of my seven children
family to my parents my mother and my father.My mother was as stand hold
mother.My dad received only fifth grade education and he worked as a
laborer all his life.Never earning ten thousand dollars a year.But he
felt like it was his responsibility  to educate his children because he
didn't get what.So he served a dual role so does a labor during a day
and a farmer during the night.he said that was his responsibility.That
day labor job would feed the family,that night job would send us to
college with subsidies in the summer by working in tobacco fields and
doing the night jobs in the after noon not the lot of time for leisure
or just patience.The first six of us complete college and i would say
that you would judge the quality of education that we were received the
seventh my baby brother i think my dad was tired at that time and he
just said his son just do whatever you want just go to military.But his
rules were you are collage the, was which one that's the only question
we had ,which college which stipulations you will not left anything
because you are spending his money.?? but that's the just my day and the
other thing that he was very very diligent on you will not receive any
kind of hand out there will be no free lunch in his family you work and
earn for everything you get,so we knew that we have to finish
college.Again this budget i think in the education side will learn it's
?? not lot but some for else. i think we could ?? to other
places.Insulation of a western magazine school with a no origin from
anybody to do so again gives me concern.just a few tip bits of concern
they are other than that the budget and the words of king of ?? when he
was facing a parcel ?? would be that almost almost i could be persuaded
to spot it but i think we could do better.Thank You,

because many members were stepping out of chamber delaying the vote, we
were having to record the vote, the chair extended the time by 30% to 20
seconds, giving every member ample time to be at their seats to record a
vote. The chair is allowed two votes to be changed: one from the
minority, one from the majority, because they cast their votes within

[Speaker Changes]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and members of the House, in today's debate there
were very many amendments, which I thought was coming from the
Democratic side, from this side of the aisle, which were voted down.
Without being specific, I really regret that, because I think all of
them were amendments that would have improved this budget. I think the
biggest issue that faces all of us in North Carolina is whether we're
going to do a great deal, not just a bit, but a great deal, to move
aside from 46th place in teacher pay.  I think it was possible for this
House to have done better than 5%.  As it is, this House is gambling
that the money will be there so that the 5% can be provided.  But to
gamble on the future, particularly the gamble with the Lottery, and also
to say with the lottery, and many of my friends across the aisle who
were here when we voted for the lottery remember that many of us
thought, (and I was one who voted against the Lottery) many of us
thought it was really wrong. Not just for reasons of morality for some,
but for the fact that we were taking money disproportionally - it's
clear as the day is long - that you are disproportionally taking money
from people in the lower end of the economic scale. And we all knew
that, we debated that, and it continues to be true, so it's somehow
ironic that in the attempts to improve education in our state, the
majority has chosen to use the Lottery, and encouraging people to play
the Lottery so that there can be money for the 5%.
Actually, I would say to you, there was money, clearly, money there that
we could do better than 5%. But to do just 5% and rely on Lottery money
seems to me a big big mistake, and I will not be supporting the bill.
Thank you.

Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Members, I was here nine years ago,

Speaker: Particularly on the folks that gentlemen from ?? noted a lot of
most effects.One of also reasons that i oppose the lottery  because i
that believe the gambling is addictive.i believe that the folks out
there who are gonna play the lottery get addicted and we saw the
evidence to suggest that was true.Wat i didn't suspect the time though
folks that get addicted to gambling will be the general assembly of
north Carolina.We liked the first head of it so much we like the double
head of it a double amount a double dose  of the addicting substance and
then to use that try to pay for teachers salary.Juts many other things
wrong with this budget but that alone did not make me vote against
it.I'm gonna vote no and hopes that my colleagues are across the  hour
who with me nine years ago who oppose lottery but also vote no lets go
back to drawing boards work together and find the way to give the
teachers the pay raises with need without continuing addiction to
gambling,
Speaker Changes: Mr Speaker speaker,
Speaker Changes: Representative Stamp please state purpose,
Speaker Changes: I would represent ?? to yells that question,
Speaker Changes: Representative ??,
Speaker Changes: yes sir,
Speaker Changes: He yells,
Speaker Changes: Representative Martin perhaps remember the last session
in which governor easily proposed the expansion of the lottery to get
more money by changing the formula.it was about 100 million dollars in
more money from changing the formula.This change is been by 100 million
more money by making a change in the advertising including making ??
adverting.Do you recall that how you voted on that budget i believe it
was 2007 or 8 in which you voted  to expand the lottery take.Here by 100
million employing gambling provided by about another 300 million,
Speaker Changes: Let me clear about my objection on my point here ?? i
appreciate the language you have got in there to try to put truth in
this lottery supported the form with off course is this gonna have the
people actually believe it is gonna pay the lottery much and therefore
we are not gonna exceed the bill on pay ?? so that you can be able to
pay here.The ?? with this is by increasing the advertising you are
getting more folks get on the gambling.You are actually reaching out
there to them at athletic event i see the ads on TV cant go fill up the
gas station without seeing the ad scratch off and that sort of things
actually reaching not more for ??,
Speaker Changes: Mr.Speaker,
Speaker Changes: Representative Stamp will represent martin for the
second question,
Speaker Changes: Yes sir,
Speaker Changes: He votes,
Speaker Changes: Representative Martin do you recall in 2007 i believe
voting for that budget which took about additional sales of about 300
million dollars  lottery tickets to produce about 100 million of
education your call how you voted,
Speaker Changes: Again i did voted for that budget but i let me be very
clear that the difference here you are taking and marketing,you are
sending the dealer out there,advertising twice as much as they are
people who are already addicted to gambling and using that somehow to
pay to teacher raises to teach the children of those folks that you

Amendment to take up at this time, before we continue the debate.
Representative Adams is recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk
will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Adams moves to amend the
bill on page 120, line 23, by rewriting the line to read. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Adams is recognized to debate her amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
House, this amendment adds a section 12-1J for the Department of Health
and Human Services to ensure that organizations that receive funds under
the maternal and child health block grant for the provision of
reproductive health services or education, provide comprehensive
non-directed reproductive health care counseling. Now, it doesn’t really
matter whether you support choice or my right to choice or whatever you
support, we believe that unbiased reproductive health information should
be provided. Now, the funds that are in the budget that provides for the
crisis pregnancy centers don’t provide comprehensive accurate education
in terms of reproductive health. And that’s what this amendment will do.
It will ensure that the information that women receive is accurate, that
it is not biased, and regardless to where you are on the issue of
abortion, you still need accurate information. So that’s what the
amendment will do. It will allow those individuals who make choices to
get information that’s accurate. And that’s all we’re asking, that
comprehensive information be provided, that whatever the pros and cons
are, that information will be given to those individuals who come to
these centers. That’s the amendment. I hope you will support it,
regardless how you feel about it, everyone can agree that people should
not be mislead or misguided. They shouldn’t be coerced. But that this
information be given to them freely and that’s really what the amendment
does. And I would ask for your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Moore is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I move the
amendment to lie upon the table. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The motion to lay the
amendment 31, the Adams amendment, 37, the Adams amendment on the table
having been made by Representative Moore and seconded by Representative
Cleveland, we will now vote on the motion to lay the amendment on the
table. Those in favor of tabling amendment 37 will vote aye. Those
opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock
the machine and record the vote. 67 having voted in the affirmative,
excuse me 69 having voted in the affirmative and 45 in the negative, the
motion to table amendment 37 has passed and members we are back on the
bill. Representative Holloway, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Folks, in the ten years that I’ve been here, I’ve seen a lot of budgets.
And is this budget perfect? No. But I’m going to have to say it’s the
best budget I’ve seen in ten years. This budget gives teachers the raise
that they deserve and not only does it just give them 5% if you look
very close, we’re moving back to try to get teachers to where they’re
supposed to be on the pay scale. To help correct the wrongs that we were
forced to have to do because of shortfalls. It funds TAs, does not cut a
single cent from teacher assistants. It funds HHS, we’re taking care of
the elderly and the sick, and those who need special care.</p>

All the resources that is there, it could be provided to them to help
lift them out of the current situation that they are in and better that
northeastern portion of our state. I urge you to support this amendment
so that we can try to help continue moving Universities like Elizabeth
City State forward and continue and try to move the State forward. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Pierce, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
Mr. Speaker, Ladies and gentlemen, I rise this afternoon to support this
amendment for a couple of reasons. You spent a lot of [wuss] in the
chamber, in the general assembly of the last two sessions. We've heard
about consolidating and I think, I heard representative Dollar talk
about some things, how good a job people are doing but there was some
[wuss] a couple of years ago about consolidation. I think that's still
in demand of some folks so we need to consider that and what happened
just a few weeks ago I think that you'll remember that legislative black
caucus had a press conference to lay us out against the proposal that
was on the table in dealing with Elizabeth City. But with that proposal
on the table, what you end up doing was you put a nail in the coffin.
Because of what happened students who were thinking about going to
Elizabeth City, you put something in their minds they can then believe
that maybe for a year or two the school could close down. So, I think we
set a dangerous precedent for Elizabeth City by doing that. Black
Universities have been underfunded for years and I think we all know
that and they face a very difficult time and we've got a lot of issues
that we definitely need to deal with but I think we're setting a
dangerous precedent dealing with Elizabeth City because I think that the
[competition] is still gonna be out there. I think the board of
governors still have a mind to find some way somehow to close that
University down. We don't need to run from it, we don't need to hide
from it. I believe they're still talking about it while they're drinking
ice water in back rooms, they are still talking about that. Why do you
say that representative Pierce?
Because we've been talking about it for two sessions; each time we would
beat it back but I still think the reality is on the table to try to
find a way. We're pulling programs, we're pulling curriculum, I remember
that. Keep right on pulling that and eventually students would not want
to go to that University. So, Representative Mobley has a good proposal
on the table. And you're right. I think when I stand and speak, people
say well he's preaching. What's in like everybody else who deny who
don't have a life has been preaching so, I guess I need to preach. But I
think we really need to take a hard look at this and let's be fair to
this university. You have dug a hole for this university in the last two
sessions. Ladies and gentlemen, you did that. You have sent a negative
signal across this state and to surrounding areas. Students who would
consider going there, you sent the wrong signal. So we're asking
tonight, I agree with my colleagues, we need to do the right thing. It's
not gonna hurt the budget. This will help them recruit, this will help
them sustain programs already at that University. Let's give them a
chance. I ask you to vote yes on this amendment. Thank you, Mr. Speaker
and Ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak briefly on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the house, for many
years I've represented in my district, the North Carolina central
University and we're proud and ?? Of the work that NCCU has done for our
community and for the state and for the nation. The reason I'm speaking
to support the amendment is because the amendment is about financial
assistance for students and I learned a few years ago in research and in
conversation at NCCU some realities about income of the families at the
HPCUs of our state and Pembroke State vs. UNC Chapel Hill and NC State
and the reality is this that for the five HPCUs, the average family
income is 30,000 dollars. At NC state and at UNC Chapel Hill, the
average family income is 90,000 dollars. It's obvious then that the
young people who are attending these schools badly need financial
assistance and that to me is enough reason for us to make a special
step, an unusual step that ?? To provide assistance for young people.</p>

Domestic violence commission that is a citizen led board of experts and
leaders. And all of these things are just going to be wrapped up, tied
up, and moved to the department of public safety. And when I asked the
question in subcommittee about why this suddenly appeared in the budget,
no one could really give me an answer. It just is. Transferring this
agency to the department of public safety will result in significant
delays in federal and state grant funding to over 239 non-profits in
North Carolina agencies do not maintain 3 to 6 months of funding to
sustain services.
And these agencies reach people that are in need until January 2015 and
so, what do they do between July 1 and January 2015? This could result
in the possible closing of shelters in North Carolina. Shelters that
protect women and their families. This is going to disrupt services that
are supported by federal funding. Federal funding that comes to North
Carolina because of the programs we supply through the council for
women. And basically what this has done is really eviscerated a program
that deals with women, children and family issues that's been running
very efficiently and very well for very many years. And we don't know
why it's suddenly moving. Transferring this agency to the department of
public safety will impact the maintenance of the council for women
regional offices, and those regional offices with the services that they
provide to citizens in Charlotte and Asheville and New Bern and
Greensboro areas. All of those regional offices will be shuttered. And
so what i'm trying to get at here is the sort of random nature of taking
one very well run program, a program to whose council I was appointed
back during the time that Governor Hunt was Governor in North Carolina.
Why would it suddenly be moved to a whole other department? And for that
reason, and for many other reasons that just give me real pause about
this budget, I have to vote no. And I encourage my colleagues to take a
look at the random sort of things that have happened throughout this
budget and give thought to voting no with me. Thank you.
[Speaker Change]Representative Avella [sp] please state your purpose.

[Speaker Change] The lady has the floor to debate the bill.
[Speaker change] Thank you Mister Speaker. I would venture to say that
i'm 100% correct in making the statement that not one person on the
floor of this house are 100% sure that they are happy with everything
that's in here. And i'm just going to ask you one question, and the
question is the same for several areas. Think about your objection to
the budget. Now, is your objection of a higher priority than maintaining
the Medicaid eligibility that covers some of the most vulnerable people
that you represent? Is it a higher priority than 9 million dollars extra
in pre-k that will possibly change the direction of peoples lives? Is
your objection of a higher priority than 27 million new dollars in child
protective services? Is your objection higher than an increase of 5
million dollars for our foster care programs? For fully funding school
nurses? For keeping the right school open? Answer those questions and
cast your vote. Please support the budget. Thank you.

I would just like to make sure that we all recognize that infect no
teacher with more than 8 years of experience will be getting a 5% raise
and any teacher with 10 year experience or more will actually get less
than 3% raise based on this budget. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the budget Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the authority to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker I had not actually much to
probably your thinking not true not plan to debate the budget this
evening. And I am gonna tell you why and then I am gonna tell you why I
am debating. And no one notes which is always been my way of doing it,
may be the lawyer and me I don't like to go anywhere where I am prepared
but this gonna be truly extemporaneous this evening for me because
literally I have fall elbow with myself for three days over whether to
vote for this budget or not and I am going to tell you why I am not
going to. But I am going to set out first reasons why I have almost did.
I don't think the majority in this body should be commended for doing
couple of things, first for understanding particularly in the education
arena, where I think the couches disserve immense credit for how they
have tried to deal with the restriction in the budget and I think they
deserve credit for saying something that very few of us find easy to say
and that is we made mistakes and they should receive credit for
acknowledging that, weather it is on teacher pay or masters pay weather
it is on carrier statics. We are making some corrective course change
here and that is something we all should be grateful for but I will day
we are making corrective changes impart because of self-inflected wounds
that many of is in the minority warned you about and warned us about for
several years and the results this year can come home to roost in far
greater way than may be anyone of us imagined. We are suffering enormous
enormous difficulty in public education and I credit the majority by
trying to put their fingers in the breaches in the dam and had they
turned that 2 and 3 and even last year we might not be facing a dam that
has multiple beaches where simply stopping a few is not going to hold up
the dam. We have teachers retiring in an ?? numbers. They have literal
confidence in what we do and so that is something we all should share
responsibility for. So while I credit the fixes I have to say that in
this sense for some degree the budget that we pass tonight all be it
many times better than the enormously destructive Senate budget that
passed just a week ago. Is a budget a paraphrasing something president
Bush said years ago remains of budget that is suffers from soft ?? of
the lowest expectations it has its core structural deficit that we do
not fix tonight and we make no plan to sustain a fix for it which in
large measure concerns me greatly. And while it may or may not be true
weather there are other ways for doing things. I cannot in good
conscious some who stood up here and told you last year that I would if
I could change one vote in this building and either it was my vote on
the lottery but now we sit here and try to suppliant completely and hold
our hopes on fixing those things we have done wrong to public education
and elsewhere but the hopes that more and more people will gamble and to
the tune of hundred and 10 million more dollars I think that is just
inherently died way to run a government and it doesn't do justice to
what the majority is trying to do.</p>

Found other ways to fix the teacher pay issue and get us started in the
right direction. Took that lottery proceeds that are there and try to
use  them in other capacities to bolster the budget as a backdrop. There
might at least be an understanding. But that’s not what’s been done
here. And the second thing I would say, in doing this, we are praising
ourselves tonight for giving teacher the pay rise and we should give
them the pay rise. And much more sustainable, I suppose in the relevant
scheme of things between the house and the senate. And we are 46th in
the nation.And we allowed ourselves to get here. And we have no plans to
truly improve it pass it this year, except some good intent, I hope.
Although we fixed the masters pay and some worked through the status.,
can you honestly look at yourself and say, we would have done anything
to the status had the court not joined us.  We are doing this as we
almost have to. But at the same time what we failed to say on this floor
is that the last several years, including years when we were in chair,
we have made over 500 million in continuing cuts to public education.
Thousands of positions that we don’t try to remedy at all  tonight. We
just assume that they can continue to live with it. We have made
multiple digit percentage cuts to office supplies, to central office
personnel, to non certified personnel and we don’t attempt to fix  it
tonight. Because we say we can’t. That is fundamentally a self
fulfilling prophecy. We can we simply chose not to. I don’t agree with
that.  My god. I simply don’t agree with that. Even if that’s the way to
go  given what’s happening in the school today, it cannot be the
confidence builder that we need to have. I looked at the JPS budget. I
sat in and was privileged enough to sit in on Chairman ?? and Chairman
Davis, had good discussions. But the Unanimous report that came out of
that that includes the plead by nearly every aspect of the court system
for help. One of those was by the crime lab. We have lost 50% of the
personnel in a couple of years because they were simply not paid
anything approaching the market rate. We sit on this floor and talk
about the justice system and then the one thing that might help totally
move through the criminal justice system and we do nothing about that.
We sat in that committee and we listened to the fact that ?? defense
services is nearly $ 6 million in back payments and we do nothing
seriously to help them.But we did say, we would try. Are we really
trying?
Chairman Dawry said enormous times how much burden exists on AOC and the
justice system and in truth we don’t do much to help them. Simply we try
to see that there is no further damage. In Helping human services,
majority should be commended for fixing some of the problem that senate
caused in the budget, because this medicaid budget is simply better. But
can we honestly look and  say that we solved any of the issues that we
really say exists with the service needs that are there. Probably not.
The best that can be said is that we are inflicting more damage. Is that
really the vision for the state that we are inflicting it more damage.
On the environment front, we had a few people back. But that after we
terminated  20% to 30% of the department over the last coupleof years.
Is that really the best we can do?. So, I came very close. Because I
wanted to commend the majority for at least admitting responsibility and
moving  in the right direction on several fronts. But I can’t do it
because when the fix is a lottery fix. And I can’t do it, when there is
no sustainable effort that appears to be there to get us past this year
and to really move us to a different place. I may  speak more in the
morning when I have my thoughts together after a long day. I want the
majority to know that I appreciate everything they are trying to do. But
it is as Representative Lucas said and as Rep Martin said, we can do and
we have to do much better than we are doing tonight. And I believe in
higher expectations for all of us. I believe that’s what the citizens
have. And I believe we owe them a better effort that we put in forth
this budget. Thank you.

Please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I appreciate all the
members who have given a lot of attention and effort, my sympathies to
Representative Holloway who says this is one of the toughest things he’s
had to do. And certainly he now empathizes with many of the people who
had to make this happen in the past. I’d probably ask you to close your
eyes and just think good thoughts. And that would probably be emblematic
of some of what we have of this budget that’s critical. Because our
teacher pay crisis deserves more than we’ve given them. And we’re part
of this body too, and so we’ll be looked at as well. And unfortunately
it’s hard to explain to people that hey, we didn’t have a vote. It was a
super majority. We were just along for the ride. We’ll share the blame
for what we did here. Our best teachers will still decide to leave our
state, or they’ll keep working two or three jobs until they just can’t
carry it anymore, and leave the profession. And we’ll still have this
problem in front of us. Many of you have businesses and you understand
and have served in government and you understand maintenance cycles. And
when you fail to do that maintenance, what’s needed to keep things
operating at a good level, and you go to the next cycle, you understand
that you’re doubling the costs. In some way, form or fashion, you’re
doubling the cost. And that’s what I fear that we’re doing now. Our per
people spending will still rank among the worst in the nation, even with
this budget. It does nothing to dig us out of the hole that we’ve
achieved or has resulted from the past cuts of the past few years. And
it doesn’t really give our students then a fair shot and a fair chance
at success. I want to talk about the lottery issue because either a lot
of people fell asleep on it, a lot of folks didn’t really want to see
the truth here. And I certainly want to talk about that because it’s
critical as we talk about funding education. Now we put our lottery
commission in an untenable situation. We told them to figure out what
additional advertising would do as far as revenue it would generate. And
they came back and said well if we did this additional advertising, it
generates $65 million to $105 million. $65 million to $105 million,
about a $40 million spread.  And somehow the absolute top end of that
number got legs without examination and vetting. I don’t know how it got
by you. I trusted in good faith that somehow it just got accepted.
Everybody closed their eyes, thought good thoughts, and we had $105
million all of a sudden. Now, that was before Representative Stam’s
amendment got in on this lottery act. That would by his intent and own
admission, should and probably would decrease the amount of funding that
could be achieved even under that maximum best-case scenario that’s been
put out there to fund these teachers’ raises. I don’t think it was
irresponsibility. Maybe it was a blind spot and we’re reaching for a
solution here in an election year and we’re not being as careful as we
normally are, not doing as much due diligence as we would normally do.
But if you think about it, if just doing more advertising would generate
that additional revenue, then they’d never get fired on Madison Avenue.
Advertising executives would never lose an account if that’s all it
took. Another item in the budget that we need to look at, we’ve decided
that we’re going to move the SBI from the Attorney General to the
Department of Public Safety. And you’ve heard some people comment
already on the problems that’s going to</p>

There are currently ongoing investigations into the governor's office
regarding Duke Energy and the Coal Ash Bill and the Dan River into
donations that were given from sweepstakes gambling on the internet. So
we all know that these things are happening and they're challenging the
confidence the public has in us and our process. And they certainly are
coming to rely on the Attourney General's office to be the one person
standing outside of our process that they can look to let them know
what's going on. And then you think about it, you say, &quot;Well, why
the Attourney General's office? What difference does it make?&quot; 290
investigations into public corruption and influence over the past few
years, since 2009. That's a large number. That's a lot of work. That's a
lot of responsibility. And the public relies on us to provide them that
assurance that we're not down here inside trading and inside dealing
with their interests. The one thing we know after all of these budgets
and again Representative Holloway has my sympathies. I understand and he
now better understands what it's like and the great effort he's put in.
And everyone who's worked on it. As he said late nights, et cetera. But
we chose to do this budget in this fashion. Thats your choice. Could've
done it like the Senate, done it over night. Wham bam, thank you ma'am
and roll something out. We could've had more involvement by community
groups and others in the hearing process. We did have a hearing process
though, and that's to our credit, over at the Senate. But we still have
that problem of our budget. You heard a comment about teachers'
salaries. Let's talk about what this budget is going to do about
teachers' salaries. And we talk about it's going to give a pay raise.
Well, if you're a teacher with 36 years in, you get 0. 35.64 percent. 34
1.30. If you're seventeen years in, you get a 2.21 percent pay raise.
Eighteen years, 2.25. Nineteen years, you're 2.29. So, as was already
commented, once you get past the eighth year, you head downward on the
sacle. So are we really giving our teachers what they deserve and
thereby giving our children what they deserve? I continue to push the
majority to do more and do better. Some people say that's the job of the
worthy opposition. And I know some of you would say I'm not worthy, but
that is part of what we do. And that's why we need to be in the process.
To push you to have better ideas and come up with a better solution for
North Carolina. We can't fund our teachers, we can't fund our children's
education, we can't fund the future of this state on a lottery and on a
number that's the top of the range before we minimized our ability to
reach it. Why is that important? At the end of the day. And we'll get
there. At the end of the day both the House and the Senate has said the
budget's fine as it is. We can go home. We don't need to reach an
accomodation. So with those statements out there, I can't now support
what I don't know because we know this would need to go to conference.
And both chambers have expressed that they don't feel they have to come
to an accomodation on this budget. So where do we go from there? And
once again I look to the majority leader. Excuse me, the Speaker Pro
Tempore. And he says he's not concerned if teachers' pay raises are now
tied closely to a prominence of increased lottery sales. If they don't
get met, we'll just find the money somewhere else. Well we know what the
solution has been on that. We shoud all be honest. The solution has been
let's cut employees, let's cut teachers, let's</p>

<p id="440:00">
Cut teachers’ assistants, that’s what the solution had been the last
couple of cycles and this lottery fix is not a fix so where do we end
up? We either end up in a bigger hole next year or we end up reducing
teachers, reducing state employees, and not fulfilling the promise in
the illusion we’ve created by saying this budget will provide that
assistance. Now I know lots of folks are going to say well you know
you’re in the minority and you need to sit down and be quiet and let us
do what we do, but that’s not really our job. We got elected like you
did, we represent districts just like you do, we have people who are
relying on us, the future of North Carolina, our family members, all of
those. So we can’t sit down and be quiet, we can only push you to be
honest with yourselves and do the best you can do. So again I can’t
support this budget right now, I know it has to go to conference ,I know
there’s been effort made on the house side. I remember the last budget
we sent over to the senate and I implored you, I said please after all
the work we’ve done, do not sell out, do not give up and give in and
give away the principles that we espoused and said that we had when you
did all the work you did to put this together. Don’t just roll over, lie
down, and walk away and then that’s a disservice to everyone that
participated in the process for that to happen and so although it’s been
said that that might be what happens, that people could live with that
and accept it, I hope you won’t do that. I hope you’ll go and fight for
what you claim is in this budget that’s important and I hope you also
find a way to legitimately sustain these raises because there is no
study and I checked with the North Carolina lottery commission, there is
no statement from them saying they can reach this number since we put
this damn amendment on and we’re being irresponsible and closing our
eyes and apparently thinking those good thoughts and just whistling on
past the graveyard so I you’ll open your eyes, look at reality,
negotiate hard, and serve the people of North Carolina and when you
bring back whatever it is that comes back from the conference committee
I hope it’s something that we can then support.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Dollar please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Speaker, members of the house, I find it very
interesting it’s like a basketball game and you’ll have some fans and
they’ll sit up the stands and they’ll criticize and say oh they’re not
playing hard enough and they can’t shoot, they’re not working together,
this is bad, that’s bad, but when are they going to get in the game and
actually play? I hear all the time criticism but who is there soldiering
with us in this endeavor to try to have a budget that meets the needs of
our citizens? And so when people only want to sit on the sidelines and
don’t want to get in and don’t want to vote for things and don’t want to
move forward, I don’t take them quite as seriously, but I do want to
answer some things that have been raised. You talk about teacher using
the lottery for teacher pay, we do it already, $220 million. You already
have $505 million there that the budget relies on coming from the
lottery and what does that fund? That funds teachers in the classroom.
That funds pre-K. That funds school construction. That funds a whole
host of things that are continuing expenditures and it’s been done that
way for years. The percentage of the lottery that has gone to education
has been dropping over years. That was the other side that said what
we’ll do is take off the percentage, the restrictions, on the
percentages that could be used for prizes because what would it do? It
would increase sales. Well it did increase sales, but you also drop the
percentage that’s coming into education from the overall take of the
lottery.</p>

<p id="445:00">
We went to Lottery this year and said, look, we want to know what we can
do to generate additional money for education. Let the Education Lottery
be the Education Lottery. They came to us with the idea. We didn’t
create the numbers. They came to us with these numbers.   Some are
criticizing for the teacher pay schedule. I am just amazed. It’s your
pay schedule. It’s the one, as a matter of fact, as I recall, you froze.
And now you don’t want to help us to unfreeze the pay schedule. That
makes no sense. And I don’t mean to quibble. But when I hear things like
well, the people at the top of the pay range are not getting any salary
increase. Obviously they have not read the budget. They get a bonus.
It’s average of the pay increase at those top ranges.  Everybody is
getting an increase and nobody is left out o this budget. And what do we
do for the future. And we are trying to plan for the future to modernize
the total compensation system with career pathways. And we are trying to
address the fact that we are losing teachers by rising entry level
teacher pay by substantial amount. And we had made a commitment not just
for this year, but also for the next year that we are going to keep and
you can bet on it.
Let me mention a couple of other things. This budget and it has been
brought to everyone’s attention. We are putting in ?? for medic aid to
protect those programs. We have got millions more going in to  job
protective  services. We have got money to address coal ash that
everybody say as a major issue that they want to be addressed by this
general assembly. We are helping veterans and veteran education. We are
putting  money  in, we are fulfilling the community college’s number one
request to the tune of $ 50 million in closing the skills gap. These are
great things that we are doing in this budget. Who is going to come with
us? Who is going to be with us to get these things done? We are putting
money in mental health crisis. I remember when mental health was being
cut by this chamber by the majority by $ 174 million. People seem to
forget that. Few years ago. I haven’t forgotten it. I remember when
those cuts came through. Now we are trying to get money back in to the
system. where is the help for that? I get the impression often that it
is simply a matter of Ok , what people really are saying is they want us
to rise the taxes. But they don’t want to say that. When I hear remarks
like, where you could have done better , you could have done more on
teacher pay, you could have  done here, you could have done it without
funding mechanism since you are looking at doing instead of having
funding mechanism. What you are really saying is you want to raise taxes
but you don’t want to say that. Got to have the  courage and say look ,
we have got a solution. we want to raise taxes. That’s a legitimate
policy. Bring it forward. Be happy to talk with you about that. And what
the alternatives are? I got to mention one another thing and that’s the
whole business domestic violence. The program is moving intact and there
are no cuts. The program is moving intact and will operate. And we
believe it may even operate better than it’s currently operating. There
are so many good things in the budget. The budget is structurally sound.
I just have to laugh out loud when people bring the question, it’s not
structurally sound as it should to be.   Really? You are telling me the
budget we have inherited from you in 2011 with a $2.5  billion
structural hole in it. Compared to this budget. It doesn’t have
structural holes that pay with recurring expenditure with recurring
dollars. That’s exactly what everybody said in this chamber that we want
to have it in this budget and we have been doing that in very difficult
times. So, I would say to all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.
I believe we have crafted a very strong budget that is sound that is
responsible that funds our top priorities in very difficult times. Who
is going to ?? their share of the load. Who is going to shoulder?</p>

Responsibility to the citizens tonight and vote for this budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Robert Brawley please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Ask Representative Dollar a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Dollar does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Dollar you made some very good points,
you and your committee have worked very hard. Would you accept a thank
you?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I would accept a thank you on behalf of the 22 full
chairs and subcommittee chairs of the committees and on behalf of all
those who have worked with us on the appropriations committee, thank you
very much. And the finance committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Dwayne Hall please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Speak to the budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the budget as
amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Members, I walked in today because of the teacher
salary increases and reinstituting the steps program with the intention
to vote for this budget. A lot of members of my caucus tried to convince
me not to, leadership tried to convince me not to, but it was actually a
member on your side that changed my mind. It was a representative that
after we stood up with a great amendment that I know a lot of you guys
agreed with and again laid it on the table so Representative Dollar
asked us to get in the game. You guys don’t allow us to play, you
haven’t allowed us much of the session so this budget is your budget,
this budget that cuts money from DENR, this budget that takes the SBI
and puts it under the control of the people that it’s investigated,
including a lot of members in this gallery. This budget that cuts pre-K
childhood development, this is your budget, this budget that cuts legal
aid and indigent defense services where I started my legal career
defending people who can’t afford to take care of themselves, this is
your budget. So don’t tell me to accept my responsibility, my
responsibility is to the people that voted for me and I’m voting against
this budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Burr please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Will Representative Hall yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Hall does the gentleman yield? The
gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Hall you just mentioned that this budget
cuts pre-K, can you please show me where this budget cuts the overall
pre-K spending?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] It cuts who is eligible for pre-K, it eliminates a lot
of people that could have had that help that is no longer going to be
there.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Does the gentleman yield for a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Representative Hall can you show me what page in this
budget we’re cutting eligibility for pre-K?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I don’t have the page in front of me now.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] So are you positive we’re cutting funding from pre-K or
cutting eligibility for pre-K?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I’m certain we’re cutting whose eligible for pre-K.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Hall I would suggest that you actually
read the budget and would ask that you take a look at that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Burr is the gentleman framing a
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes sir I’m getting there. I would recommend that you
read the budget, specifically the section dealing with education and
pre-K and health care and maybe respond to the question when you have an
opportunity to look at that but you will see that pre-K is not cut,
eligibility, nor funding.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Insko please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I’d like to ask Representative Burr a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] If the members will yield, Representative Hall did you
rise a second time to be recognized to debate the budget?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I did Mr. Speaker. The eligibility cuts are on page G5
of the budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Hall does the gentleman yield for a
follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] No Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Insko please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I’d like to ask Representative Hall a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Hall does the gentleman yield for a
follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I do.

The average income in North Carolina would change that to 100% of
federal poverty level.
[Speaker Change] I am aware. I think we changed it to 133%.
[Speaker Change] Do you wish to ask a follow up question?
[Speaker Change] Yes.
[Speaker Change] Does the gentleman yield? The gentleman yields.
[Speaker Change] Do you have the numbers on how many children that will
cut in that age range? That would no longer be eligible for that
program? I believe it's about 2,500 children. Is that the number you
