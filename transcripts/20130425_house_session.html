upon adoption. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jordan is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, colleagues. Most of my comments
today come from the biography by Dan Miller, editor and publisher of
Flatpicking Guitar Magazine. Arthel Lane “Doc” Watson was born in Stony
Fork, Watauga County North Carolina on March 3rd 1923. The sixth of nine
children, his parents were Annie Green and General Dixon Watson. When he
was born he had a defect in the vessels that carry blood to the eyes. He
later developed an eye infection which caused him to completely lose his
vision before his first birthday. He was raised and resided in Deep Gap
North Carolina in Watauga County, which I currently have the privilege
and honor to represent. The Watson family lineage can be traced back to
Tom Watson, a Scots pioneer who homesteaded three thousand acres in
North Carolina around 1790. Coincidentally, my wife’s family lineage can
also be traced back to a similar Scots pioneer who in similar fashion
homestead property in approximately the same area at approximately the
same time. North Carolina homesteaders like Watson brought folksong and
music to their new world. As music changed and evolved, passing from one
generation to the next, it bound families, neighbors and communities
together through the best and the worst of times. Doc’s mother would
frequently sing old-time songs and ballads while doing chores during the
day, and she sung her children to sleep at night. In the evenings the
family read from the Bible and sung hymns from the Christian Harmony, a
shaped note book published in 1866. Doc’s father, a farmer and day
laborer, also led the singing at the local Baptist church. Clearly Doc’s
earliest musical influences came from his family, church and neighbors;
however, by the time he was about seven years old, his family had
acquired a used windup victrola and a stack of records from his uncle.
Doc was exposed to early county artists such as the Carter Family, Jimmy
Rogers, the Carolina Tar Heels and Gid Tanner and the Skillet Lickers.
His musical horizons were to broaden again when at the age of 10 he
entered the Governor Morehead School for the Blind in Raleigh. One year
at school when Doc was about 13, a school friend had shown him how to
play a few chords on the guitar. A short time later when Doc was back
home, he was messing around with the guitar that his brother had
borrowed from a neighbor. One morning his father heard him trying to
play the guitar. Not knowing that Doc had already learned a few chords,
his father told him if Doc could learn to play one song on the guitar by
the time he got home from work that evening, he’d take him down to North
Wilkesboro that Saturday and make up the difference, help Doc buy a
guitar with whatever Doc had in his piggybank. Since Doc already knew a
few chords, it didn’t take him long to learn how to accompany himself
with the singing a simple song, and that Saturday his father, true to
his word, helped Doc buy a 12 dollar Stellar Guitar, and history was
made. When asked, Doc would say that the most valuable thing his father
did for him was not related to music. It was to put him at the end of a
crosscut saw when he was 14 years old. Doc reflected on the occasion by
saying “He put me to work and that made me feel useful. A lot of blind
people weren’t ever put to work. He made me know that just because I was
blind, certainly didn’t mean I was helpless.” Doc acquired his nickname
when he was 18 years old. He was playing with his friend Paul Greer at a
remote control radio show being broadcast from a furniture store in
Lenoir. The radio announcer decided that Arthel was too long a name to
announce on the radio and he suggested they think of another name to
call him. Young woman in the audience yelled out “Call him Doc!” The
name stuck and has been with him ever since. Also when Doc was around 18
years old, he travelled way over across the mountain to meet with an
old-time fiddler named Gaither Carlton. While he was there he was
introduced to Gaither’s daughter Rosa Lee. Since Rosa Lee was eight
years younger than Doc, he didn’t think much of the meeting at the time;
however six years later, Gaither moved his family just a half mile down
the road from Doc. Doc says “I went out to their house, and Rosa Lee and
a neighbor girl were unpacking dishes. She turned around and said
‘Hello. I haven’t seen you in a long time.’ Somebody might as well have
hit me with a brick. I lost it. I thought ‘Where have I been all these
years? There she is.’ It was like that and it still is.” Doc and Rosa
Lee were married in 1947. Two years later, in 1949, their son Eddy
Merle, named after Eddy Arnold and Merle Travis, was born, followed by
their daughter Nancy Ellen in 1951. Over the past 50 years, the guitar
has had a powerful influence on American music. Predominantly a rhythm
instrument at the turn of the century, the guitar began to step out of
the rhythm section in the thirties and forties and has maintained a
dominant presence in every form of music from rock</p>

The folk, the country, blue grass, blues and old times. While Elvis, the
beatles, Bob Dillon and other icons of the 50s and 60s played a large
role in boasting the guitars popularity. Many observers would say that
the man who's had the deepest most enduring and most profound influence
on the way the acoustic flat top guitars played as the lead instrument
in fold, old time and blue grass music today is Dock Watson. Fans loved
Dock Watsons smooth baritone voice, sharp whit and intellect, easy going
manner, good nature, country charm and wonderful story telling abilities
almost as much as his guitar playing and singing. One fan commented I
would pay to hear Dock Watson read names out of the phone book. There's
a bronze statue of Dock in downtown Boone in Wataka County. Chalk
keepers in downtown West Jefferson in Ash county proudly display Dock
with the proprietors. Dock is a legend. However Docks influence extended
far beyond the small nitch of guitar players that try to faithfully
reproduce his guitar breaks. Because Dock Watson was not just a guitar
player and singer. He was an American hero. To be recognized as a
national treasurer by president Jimmy Carter, honored with the national
medal of the arts by  Bill Clinton and given an honorary doctorate
degree from the university of north Carolina. Caused for being more than
just a fine musician and entertainer. Dock Watson received these
accolades not just for his talent, but for the honor, integrity,
humility, grace and dignity. Which he displayed through out his long and
distinguished career. While there are many many great guitar players and
singers, there's only been one Dock Watson. Its with great honor and
pleasure that I commend the resolution to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollars is recognized to speak to the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr speaker i'll be brief. In the occasion
that I could get away to hear Dock Watson, when Dock and Merl were
playing, and they were playing with David Ho, and his grandson in later
years. I certainly took that opportunity. And had the pleasure just a
couple years ago as Dock was winding down his career to take my son,
just so in late years he can say that he actually heard Dock Watson
live. And the reason why I say that is for this reason. You know, we
produce in this world a lot of extremely talented bright people who
contribute to us in a whole range of fields. But there are really only a
very few geniuses that are produced. And Dock Watson is truly a genius
when it comes to music. He created something that had never been heard
before. He perfected a style. And he changed the nature of music and
influenced it on a very broad level that will be felt and heard for many
years to come. We will miss the sound and of course terms of his family
and friends and all of his fans around the world he will surely miss the
man. But we were blessed for the time that we was here to touched by his
genius and I commend the resolution to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Johnson is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you mr
speaker and I'll be brief also. I don't know that if many of you know
that the north Carolina music hall of fame in is Conapolis. And upon the
passing of Dock Watson they stated these remarks. May the knowledge that
the loving memory of Dock Watson will forever live in the hearts and
minds of his millions of loyal fans and in the North Carolina hall of
fame. Thank you and commend this resolution to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Elmor is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr
speaker. In 1988, Wills community college asked this musical legend to
come down to perform a concert, a one night concert, as a fund raiser
for a garden that they were developing, that was a touch and feel garden
that was targeted toward people with visual impairments. And Dock Watson
asked that that festival or that fund raiser be named after his son Merl
who passed away just three years prior. That fund raiser was held on the
back of a truck bed in a field, a softball field, down at the community
college and there were a few hundred people. This festival over the
years has grown and its actually starting today, as the official start
date, it has 13 stages where folks will be playing all over the campus
of the community college and we will draw about 65 thousand people to
Will County</p>

...this weekend and it’s considered one of the largest Americana music
festivals in the nation. When I say that, it’s not just dealing with
bluegrass music, it’s preserving all of the traditional music that has
been developed in our country and also traditional dancing. The economic
impact for us in Wilkes County with this festival is unbelievable. It’s
all because of this musical legend. What is sad, both Doc and Rosalee
passed away since the last Merlefest and the festival this year will be
in memory of the whole family now and will the circle be unbroken? I
don’t think so. I commend the resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Horn is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I got to thinking about this, about Doc Watson
and I’ve got the strange feeling you all don’t know about me, I grew up
along the Mississippi River in Iowa and Illinois and about ‘59 or ‘60, I
was playing music to make money and there got to be formed an
organization called the Mississippi Valley Country and Western Music
Association. It was the first and largest Country and Western music
association in the United States. We’d get together from time to time.
People came from all over the USA and we’d jam it up in the Cobal room
in Davenport, Iowa. I was a young kid with a set of drums and played a
lot of country music because it paid really well. Rock and roll was fun,
but country music is where you made money. But I remember a blind guitar
player that wasn’t from the midwest. Now I can’t..as I sit here I’m
thinking, was he actually there or did I just hear about him? NOw I
can’t actually tell you I ever played with this guy, but I do absolutely
remember hearing about him because we had some great pickers. I mean,
great pickers. Some went on to be internationally famous. There was a
fellow out of Arizona whose son became Glen Campbell. Glen Campbell’s
dad was a great picker. I remember Doc Watson, not clearly, but just
wanted you to know that this North Carolinian was known, as I’m sure you
already do, nationwide and I commend this resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[Speaker Changes] The gentlemen is recognized to debate the bill
[Speaker Changes] Ladies and gentlemen of the house. It comes as no
surprise that prescription drug abuse is a growing phenomenon in North
Carolina and in United States. We have been hearing about this for a
couple of years. I am not going to blabber. The issue has got plenty of
facts and figures and data to tell you about that I am going to forego
that opportunity. Just one thing I want you to know. Prescription drug
abuse, according to a 2010 National Survey on Drug use and Health an
estimated 2.4 million Americans used prescription drugs non medically
for the first time within the past year. That is 6600 new uses or
abusers every day. The essence of this bill is to do something about it.
There are three ways to handle prescription drug abuse. First we have to
stop getting worse secondly we have got to reduce the inventory that’s
out there and available probably they weren’t very many people in this
chamber that don’t have old prescription drug in their medicine cap. And
then lastly we need to educate people to use as directed only. This
medicine stops us from getting worse. The tool substance reporting
system is in place in this state. But we just don’t use it. So that’s
what this bill does. Mandates using it. Mandates a time period in which
to be used mandates who is to use it and as well discusses who has
access to it. And with that last piece in mind, I do have a second
amendment to send forward
[Speaker Changes] The gentlemen is recognized to send forth an
amendment. The clerk will read.
[Speaker Changes] This is amendment 80j-23D1. Rep Horn moves to amend
the bill on page 4 lines 48 and 49 by deleting the phrase and sheriffs
or each sheriff’s designated deputy in compliance with a duly signed
warrant and
[Speaker Changes] The gentlemen is recognized to debate the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker. This amendment  clarifies
working with the sheriff’s association the SBI, the retail merchants,
the pharmacy association, the hospital association this is an amendment
that was agreed by all to serve the interests of the this bill and North
Carolina. And encourage your support for the amendment

[Speaker Changes] To ask the amendment sponsor a question.
[Speaker Changes] Rep Horn does the gentlemen yield
[Speaker Changes] I do
[Speaker Changes] Gentlemen Yields
[Speaker Changes] My reading of this amendment that this would allow for
this would delete the warrant language in the existing bill. Is that
correct?
[Speaker Changes] That’s correct
[Speaker Changes] Second question, Mr. Speaker
[Speaker Changes]  Does the gentlemen yield?
[Speaker Changes] Yes sir
[Speaker Changes] gentlemen yields
[Speaker Changes] Does this mean that the sheriff can go in to any
pharmacy at any time without probable cause and without a warrant to
search the prescription drug addicts?
[Speaker Changes] No sir. They still. going to have a subpoena. This is
an investigative process. They have reasons to believe there is a
problem. No subpoena no command.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
asking the question, the dumb is recognized and pointed up as my warrant
and a subpoena figure just got to make sure Mister Speaker, that the
that the officer that has come to the pharmacy has probably gone through
judicial hearing and I think the warrant is a much stronger provision in
the subpoena that's that was the point else trying to make it else
hoping that Mister Horn might acknowledge the difference between
subpoena and a warrant and one of the point of this as I think when I
want to not support this amendment because government have sheriffs
coming into the pharmacy. I would rather than go before judge and it
wore been just commenting how many go through the pharmacy records and
in and less less stringent environment. so I think you want to speak to
that issue. that was the point of my question is a speaker of the
strength of that specific issue is in that amendment and what I have to
say zone is recognized to debate him him in the second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
thank you, sir. thank you, Mister Speaker, as the sole allows a sheriff
or a sheriff 's deputy. these are people I have access to lots of
information about us, as it is the intent of the villas allow
investigators to investigate as they need to investigate. I certainly
have no attorney. I don't speak the language particularly well Soper,
perhaps you attorney peoples speakers can do that. great in the system
in us to do the job correctly the people in North Carolina to stop
prescription drug abuse on this specific issue. we do not, in my here
want to keep
information pertinent to an investigation of a drug investigation.
because we know about Doctor shoppers and people selling their
prescription drugs. we don't want to stop police, sheriffs, law
enforcement and having access the information they best in our best
interest will save us money and more particularly will save lives. so I
worked with the Sheriff 's Association pharmacy Association, and pretty
much everybody else I could find to ensure that we had the right

Representative Miller, please state your purpose.
To debate the bill.
Gentleman, it is recognized to debate the bill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen, of the House, I am very pleased to present this
much needed piece of legislation to you all.  It is truly aimed at
correcting an unperceived problem with distressed properties all across
the state.  It became known to me due to the foreclosure situation that
we have experienced over the last four years. [??] Deaner does not have
the statute authority in order to transfer certain environmental
permits.  The situation that has arose is that you have a project that
goes through the design and approval of these environmental permits and
the project goes to actually be built and constructed.  And what happens
is an individual may be foreclosed upon and the bank would actually sell
the property to another individual and it became known that the other
individual cannot get the environmental permits in order to finish out
the project as originally designed and permitted.  What this bill is
intended to do is to give the same exact environmentally permitting
rights to the successor/owner upon which the original permit holder had.
The language in here has been worked out extensively with the
department, and I  am very appreciative of their help and assistance.
But one thing I would like to address to you is in the phrase,
&quot;when the original permit holder is unable to or unwilling to agree
to the permit transfer&quot; Please note that in the bill it outlines
exactly what that means.  A deceased person, a dissolved corporation,
and of course, there are two other bullet points that address the fact
if the original permit holder has been lawfully divested of the title.
So, we are very careful about the language in order to preserve the
capabilities of the successor/owner as the original permittee.  I would
definitely like to, again, thank the sponsors of this bill, as well as
the co-sponsors.  I would definitely commend support for this piece of
legislation.
Representative Hamilton, please state your purpose.
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Many people in the state were left with an unfinished project and unable
to develop the property or recoup the investment they made in a piece of
property as a result of. This bill will allow us to transfer properties
into the hands of a new entity and proceed with those planned
development strategies, planned development subdivisions throughout the
state. I encourage support of this bill and I commend it to you.  Thank
you.

Representative Holloway, rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the Body, I want to
start off by first thanking the primary sponsors who worked very
diligently with me on this bill, and before you is the 2013 School
Safety Act. It is my opinion that this is the most comprehensive bill in
the United States since the terrible tragedy that occurred in Newtown.
And many others also believe that that is, is fact as well. And of all
the school reform bills that we have seen this session, and all the
different things that are very important, I believe this one trumps them
all, because without safety in our schools, nothing else really matters.
The difference in this bill that's before you today than what came
through the education committee, is the bill did have three parts that
did contain appropriations. And we did remove those three parts so that
they would be considered for our budgeting process, and our House
budget. And as primary sponsor of the bill, and one of the Full
Appropriations' chairs, I can assure you that I am committed to those
three parts. But there are eight other parts to the bill other than
that, so there were eleven total, and we wanted to move the other eight
parts on to the Senate. Let our school systems see what we have in mind
in giving them more tools to provide safety for our students. And I'm
going to quickly run through the eight parts very briefly, and certainly
we'll take any questions. And the other primary sponsors may have
comments as well. The first part of the bill, it deals with school
safety exercises requiring at least a two-year exercise for a full lock
down of the school system. Some school systems may already do this, but
this just requires it. Part two requires...</p>

[Speaker Changes] Systematic diagrams of each school to be given to the
local law enforcement so that they know the terrain of the school
systems and master keys to be given to them so that they can get into
the building in an instant without having to knock doors down or break
glass. Part 3 sets up an anonymous tip line, which Representative Gazier
says that Cumberland County had a tremendous amount of success with
this. We thought it would be a good part to add to the bill. Part 4
makes some changes to school improvement plan. We add more safety
components, we also make the safety components not be public record so
that folks who may have ill will intended to the school can know the
schools safety plan. Part 6 makes conforming changes so that charter
schools can also be a pat of this bill. Part 7 puts emergency and crisis
training for the employees in the school systems. Then Part 8,
Representative Barr had a bill that he asked if he could incorporate
with ours, and I thought it was a great measure. Its a volunteer school
safety resource officer program. It lets anyone who has law enforcement
background, former depute, former police officer, former retired
military, come and be under the supervision of the law enforcement body
that oversees the school, whether it be the police department of the
sheriffs department, and work for the sheriff or the police chief as a
volunteer and be an SRO in the school systems, not costing the schools a
single penny. Mr. Speaker, that is the parts of the bill. I'd be happy
to take any questions, and other members or bill sponsors may want to
speak, I don't know. Thanks.

[Speaker Changes] For what purpose does the gentleman from Randolph,
Representative McNeil rise?
[Speaker Changes] To debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you sir, Mr. Chairmen, fellow members, this bill
is a recommendation of the private protective services board. Its a
fourteen member board. Five of which the members are appointed by this
body. They oversee licensing, education and training of private
protective services professionals. That would include armored car
drivers, security guards, couriers, and private detectives and they're
are several other professions that are listed under that. This bill
makes several changes to their procedures for licensing. One change is
this bill increases the time to find a qualifying agent should they lose
a qualifying agent, and includes the time from 30 days to 90 days with a
30 day extension and 100$ late fee if the person doesn't get their
paperwork in on time. It also allows a 90 day extension for an applicant
for a license complete the process with a 30 day extension, also 100$
late fee. It also grants a 90 day extension if there is some underlying
health reason, some reason of physical health or something that a person
can't get their paperwork in on time. And it also requires companies
that employ arm guards to renew their license every two years. There is
also a fiscal note with it. This past finance committee yesterday with a
favorable reort, I commend the bill to you and stand to answer any
questions if there are any.
[Speaker Changes] Further discussion, further debate? Seeing none.
Question before the House is the passage of House Bill 466 on its second
reading. As many as favor the passage of the bill will vote aye, those
opposed will vote no...</p>

You may not. That some guardians provided by the court are compensated
for guardianship, but most guardians in fact are not. What I would
generally think of as a guardian of a  child, of a ward are not. I want
to just briefly state that, there are hundreds of Bills that we sill
pass during this session and most of them to us probably seem relatively
minor. But I will tell you that to two constituents of mine, this is
probably the most important Bill that we will pass this year.
Briefly I will just tell you that one constituent who I have known for
quite some time has been a provider to a young adult with developmental
disability needs for over four years. Recently earlier this year he was
awarded guardianship as the Clerk of Court realized that this was the
best situation for this ward.
Now at the time they didn’t realize, and as a matter of fact because of
the innovations manual, the MCO didn’t realize and even the Provider of
Service didn’t realize, that the law did not allow for a guardian to
serve as a parent would be able to serve. So as the old saying goes,
sometimes no good deed goes unpunished, they soon found out that he was
no longer able to serve under the law as a Provider of Services.
That has been an extremely difficult situation for both the guardian and
particularly to the ward. I would just say to these folks, there aren’t
very many people that are going to be directly impacted by this. But for
those that are, this is a very important piece of legislation. What
we’re doing, the bottom line is, we’re just treating a guardian like we
would a parent. This Bill has been through two committees without
opposition. There is no known opposition and I would appreciate your
support.
[Speaker change]: With that objection what ever rule the Speaker’s
violating, handing out ice cream sandwichs is suspended at this time.
For what purpose does the lady from Wilson, Representative Farmer
Butterfield rise?
[Representative Butterfield]: Speak on the Bill.
[Speaker change]: The lady has the floor to speak on the Bill.
[Representative Butterfield]: I want to commend the sponsors of this
Bill…
[Speaker change]: Counsel please come to order.
[Representative Butterfield]: I want to commend the sponsors of this
Bill. It’s very family friendly and it provides more options for
guardianship to the Clerks of Court in the State of North Carolina.
Thank you.
[Speaker change]: What purpose does the gentleman from Wake,
Representative Hall rise?
[Representative Hall]: Simply that I ask that I be recorded as voting
yes on House Bill 173, Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker change]: The gentleman will be recorded and voting yes on that
Bill. What purpose does the gentleman from Gilford , Representative
Brandon rise?
[Representative Brandon]: Ask the Bill sponsor a question.
[Speaker change]: Does the gentleman from Rockingham yield?
[Gentleman from Rockingham]: I gladly do yield.
[Representative Brandon]: I am glad that you brought this Bill up
because I used to do this kind of work and this would always happen
where we couldn’t get the guardian ?? or we couldn’t get the parents
there and there was no representation.
My question is, who determines whether or not this person becomes the
guardian if all of those factors are not met? Like if there is no parent
and if there is no guardian ??, like how does that come about that this
person just becomes the guardian? Is there a process? What’s is its
client rights a part of this process and them being able to determine
whether they want that person representing them or not. I’m just kind of
confused how this person automatically becomes the guardian in that
process.
[Speaker change]: Gentleman has come forward to answer the question.
[Gentleman from Rockingham]: That determination is made by the Clerk of
Court.
[Representative Brandon]: Thank you.
[Speaker change]: Further discussion? Further debate?  Seeing none. As
many as favor the passage of House Bill 543 on it’s second reading, will

question before the House is the passage of House Bill 543 on it’s third

[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Apodaca, under the circumstances in you having

[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senate Bill 426 Change Deadline and Auditee Response.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Davis of Macon County is recognized to explain
the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. President. Especially at this time, I’m
thankful for a very short bill. And I would like to say is all this bill
does is gives an auditee response time from thirty days to the
discretion of the auditor. Senator MacKissick has an amendment that I
would consider a friendly amendment that he will be offering. And I
would encourage you to vote for that amendment as well. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator McKissick for what purpose do you rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To set forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Do the members have copies, Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] They do, Your Honor.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] You can send forward your amendment. The clerk will
read.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator McKissick moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator McKissick is recognized to explain the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] It simply allows a person who is subject to audit the
opportunity ten days to respond rather than the thirty days provided for
now.  It’s pretty straightforward. And Senator Davis and I worked on
this together. I want to commend him for sending forth a very thoughtful
bill. And I ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing
none, the request before the Senate is the passage of amendment one. All
in favor will vote aye. Opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be
allowed for the voting. The clerk will record the vote. Forty-six having
voted an affirmative and zero in the negative. Amendment one is adopted.
The bill as amended is back before the body. Is there any further
discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Nesbitt, for what purpose do your rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Just to speak briefly on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Nesbitt has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] And I just want to point out what we’re doing here. The
bill started out as whenever the auditor said, and I think it’s improved
to put a date certain in there so that there are some rules of the game.
But what you’re talking about here is the ability of an agency to
respond to an audit that probably took six months.
And most of the audits that have come out in the last year or two have
been critical, some harshly critical, some almost personally critical.
And if you got it on Friday you’ve got to have it by the Monday week. It
may be a six month audit.
And I don’t know what was wrong with the law to start with that says
thirty days after the draft audit is given. I know of nothing around
here that can’t wait thirty days for the agency to give its reply so
that if something’s misstated when the audit comes out, their side of
the story is in there.
Now, it will be your agencies that are getting it this time. And I’m not
in here defending bureacracy but I think fair play dictates it. These
people aren’t the enemy. They run agencies.  And they need to be able to
have time to respond and have their say. I pitched that out and I’ll say
it when the next bill comes through if it does the same thing.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Is there any further discussion or debate. Hearing
none, the question before the Senate is the passage of Senate Bill 426
as amended on a second reading. All in favor will vote aye. Opposed will
vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. The clerk will
record the vote. [Bryant, hi]
Forty-one having voted in the affirmative and five in the negative.
Senate Bill 426 as amended passes its second reading. Without objection
it will be read a third time.

This bill was brought to me by the board of the ?? Seafood Industrial
Park. The idea is to rename the park so it better fits the businesses
that it serves, so it would be the Marine Industrial Park. It would also
help with the expansion of the new location in ?? County by better being
able to market it. And the limited rebranding cost would be born by the
Industrial Park itself. It also amends the language to support the new
name and then makes changes in regard to the cooperation with the
federal government and the waterways simply because they still would
have to follow the federal laws, obviously, but they may need to be in
an adversarial position as we explore solutions to ??. Thank you very

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well contractors are currently required 6 hours
of continuing education a year. This would reduce that to 2 hours. This
idea was brought to me by a constituent who is a well contractor. He
brought to my attention the fact that the rules governing this industry
have not changed significantly over the years, which means you are in a
6 hour class that takes up most of your day. It takes you away from
doing your job. I've talked to DHHS, I've found out that the well
contracting commission falls under the ?? of DHHS. They're ok with the
bill and with that, commend the bill, and would appreciate your support.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, this is a bill that
really the title explains it. There are folks in our population who have
some vision impairments that are corrected with what's called a bioptic
lens. And the best way I know to describe it, if you've ever seen a
surgeon sometimes, dentists may use these, they look like a little
magnifying glass where it sticks out on your glasses so you can see.
They can see fine and see safely with that device adapted to their
glasses. Currently under our State law, they're allowed to drive but
there was some conflicting language about how the testing goes and all
that. And so this bill is the result of a discussion among those who
have the visual impairment, as well as the DMV, to come up with language
that DMV felt was good, that was solid to be able to make sure that
these folks can safely operate a motor vehicle. And it also makes us
consistent with most other States. I know of no objection to the bill.
We've worked it pretty carefully and I would urge the members support of
the bill. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and fellow members of the

medical information exchanged from one site to another through
electronic communications. The potential to bring a wide variety of
healthcare services to patients, especially those in rural areas, is
enormous. The study will attempt to develop consistent guidelines
between providers, insurers, and State agencies. Medicare for one
example. What the study intends to do is research and address the nine
issues that are found on page 1, section 1, line 16 through 30, with the
intent of presenting recommendations and ideas of proposed legislation

Act To Improve the North Carolina Recreational Use Statute by clarifying
that equine recreation, where the landowner receives no compensation, is
subject to the Recreational Use Statute and not the Equine Activity
Liability Statute. By clarifying that contractual releases are not
abrogated or invalidated by the Recreational Use Statute and by allowing
a charge for activities subject to the Recreational Use Statute when the
charge is imposed by certain activity sponsors and not the landowner.
General assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McGrady, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is a bill that is intended to make clear that
landowners who allow their lands to be used for equine activity,
horseback riding, are covered by the Recreational Use Statute and not
specifically by the Equine Activity Statute. The Recreational Use
Statute is one that is really good state policy. It says that when you
allow your land to be used for hiking or mountain biking or horses, that
you don't, you're not gonna have some sort of liability if somebody
happens to have an accident while they're crossing your land on a trail.
Because we've got this more specific Equine Use Statute, there was some
concern that people who use their, allow their trails to be used for
equine activities might, might not have that same protection. This isn't
in response to any lawsuit that's pending anywhere in the state. These
types of statutes are in place in, I think all 50 states, and it's more
responding to some, sort of, trends in other places. It's a good bill.
Representative Whitmire is among the primary co-sponsors. Unfortunately
he's at military service today. But he would tell you if he were here
that, for example in Polk county, this is just a huge issue. Land values
are directly related to these trails. But if landowners are suddenly
subject to, to more liability it creates a big problem. So I think it's,
it's a good bill. It got a unanimous recommendation in Judiciary and I,
I recommend it to you.

Is a common name for epinephrine. So that is just give you an idea of
what that is. We were requiring schools to develop a training program
for teachers so they can recognize allergic reaction. I think this will
help save lives instead of the current situation where you have to have
a patient specific prescription epinephrine injectable device for a
student. This enables to have an EpiPen available for general use in the

[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. The necessity for this bill really has risen as a
result of the policies of prescriptions for these EpiPens for some
children have known peanut allergies or asthmatic attacks. Those pens
have been a presence on the school property but have not been permitted
to be used by the school personnel in the event that some child has new
peanut allergy or new asthmatic attack and didn't happen to have a
prescription. And there have been times when these children have
actually died in some states in this country and we just wanted to
prevent that from happening. And its a wonderful bill and I support it.

Thank you mister speaker and members of the house I strongly recommend

As many of you know I ran a summer camp for kids for a pretty good long

camp director with thousands of kids over a large period of time the
most scary is the one that my colleague representative ?????? has
discussed somebody who has never reacted to some food or never reacted
to some insect bite and then suddenly is near death in no period of time

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, I would ask that each one of us vote no
on this motion to adopt this conference report. After the conference
report was received and read in by the… submitted to the clerk’s office,
the conferees discovered a technical issue that affected two individuals
that the Governor appointed to serve as special superior court judges.
One of these individuals was a district court judge. She resigned her
seat, received a letter from the Governor and was planning to take
office as a special superior court judge. Under this technical issue,
she would not be able to take that special superior court seat, and that
was not the intention of the conferees. Similar, another appointee from
the Governor was in the process of closing down his law practice,
received a letter from the Governor and was preparing to serve as a
special superior court judge, and that individual will be affected by
this legislation. That was not the intent of the conferees, so I’d ask
every member to vote no – that’s a red button – on the conference
report. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate?

that is to put us into a conference situation. In this case we did have
a conference, we have a report before us, and to dispose of it we will
need to vote not to adopt the conference report. That would dispose of
Senate Bill 10 for the remainder of this session. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Vote
red. Understood. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insko, please state
your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I just need to make sure I’ve got this
right. There is no motion not to concur? Is the motion not to concur?

adopt the conference report. Representative Larry Hall, please state

when we were doing the doc Watson resolution, someone used the word
“genius” and I think that here today, we have seen budding legislative
genius before our very eyes, in a performance that can only be described
as dominating. We had house bill 688, Harvester; house bill 760,
Harvester; house bill 762, Harvester; passing by combined 345-2: only 2
misguided souls stopped total unanimity. Three bills in one day is
principal sponsor, something rarely seen in this house. A performance
and a vote total can only be said to have rivaled the former member Dan
Falwell. We may have a future Dan Falwell in Representative Harvester.
