<p id="00:00">
We want to welcome the press and those who gathered to share with the
Legislative Black Caucus as we attempt to lay out our agenda for the
Legislative session. I just want to read something I thought was very
important and continues to be very important. It talks about the mission
of the Legislative Black Caucus. It said that North Carolina Legislative
Black Caucus is an incorporated asssociation apprised of senators and
representaives of Afro-American heritages and American Indian culture
the purpose of which the caucus is organized are namely to operate as a
vehicle through which blacks and other people of color residing in the
state of North Carolina will be able to exercise their political power
in a unified manner. To ensure that their views and concerns of blacks,
of blacks and other communities of colors, are carried out by their
elected representatives and to work and develop political caucuses of
black people. So I thought that was significant and we needed to
continue to remind our members of the Black Caucus and the community in
which we serve that the Black Caucus is here to serve as the vehicle for
which we will keep the issues of people of color and those in our
communities issues at the forefront of the General Assembly. There comes
a time when silence is betrayal. Dr. Martin Luther King says we can and
we must and we will continue to fight for all the citizens of North
Carolina, especially the poor and the middle class. The time has come
for us to talk seriously about the citizens of North Carolina, to talk
about the inequalities, inequalities that are being shown by this
General Assembly at the present time. They're taking as we've said so
many times and people got upset with us about it, but it's true. They're
truly taking from the needy giving to the greedy. Some of the bills that
have been passes General Assembly are counterproductive. First we look
at Medicaid expasion we, the black caucus stayed together on that bill
because we knew it would affect over 500,000 in the immediate
communities that we serve in and others. And it goes back, I'm gonna
state brief contentiously on the poor and the middle class because a lot
of things that are happening now are not only affecting the poor but the
middle class. No income tax credit. 900,000 people will be affected by
that legislation. Reduction in the employment benefit effective July 1
we notice 190,000 people will be affected and those are not only the
poor, but the middle class. They will really see some serious issues
behind this. All of these things are designed to traumatize and
victimize the poor and the middle class in our communities. And then on
the same token we take the inheritance tax and give it tax breaks to
those who really need no tax break and I say to they are the rich and
the famous. Now they are in inflicting pain that seeks to strip away the
only hope that many in our communities have and there's a saying that a
voteless people are a voiceless people one way or the other. The voter
id bill that is being proposed will definitely due damage to the
citizens in contentiously in which we serve each and every day. It will
disenfranchise thousands of voters currently registered in this state.
These things ladies and gentleman are simply fundamentally wrong at the
court and just plainly ungodly. It is written that the poll will always
be with you. Therefore, the writer says in Deutoronomy, that I command
you to open your hands toward your poor brothers and toward the poor of
the needy in the land. Franklin Roosevelt said test of our progress is
not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much, it's
whether we provide enough for those who have lower. The Black Caucus we
can not and we will not set on the sideline idolly and not be vocal
vigilent to all that's going on in our state. We will continue to go
back home remind voters not only democrats only but democrats
independent and republic because a lot of this legislation that's going
forward will help, will hurt people regardless of what party they're in.
I am, I'm convinced that this is a class struggle it's not so much about
black, white and parties it's about class. If you don't have anything
it's obvious that this legislation is saying we're not concerned about
it. But it's just absolutely even painful to tell a man to pull up, be
pulled up by his bootstraps. First of all when he has no boots you won't
give him the ability to buy any boots and then say pull yourself up by
your own bootstraps. We call on the republicans to reexamine these
viscious policies and remind them that the time is always right to do
the right thing. We as the Black Caucus I just, I just commend the Black
Caucus leaders who have come before me and those who stand with me today
and I think we all recognize and understand even our freshman those</p>

coming in, the importance of the legislative black caucus. Some say that
this is a bad time for the black caucus. This is a bad time, what are
you really going to do? Well, we’re going do a lot because we’re going
to be vocal. We’re going to continue to educate, voter educate and talk
and speak truth to power. That’s what you gotta do. You gotta let those
in power that this is wrong and we must continue to work together for
the good of the great state of North Carolina state which we all love,
we’ll continue to work for, and today we have five members who will come
and share with us some of the agenda items that we think are very
important and some of the things we’re going to work towards in the
General Assembly this year. We have five issues, we have criminal
justice which we think there are issues that we need to address.
Healthcare, economic development, education, voter ID, and election
laws. There are many bills that have already been filed by some in our
delegation. There are other bills that have been filed by the party in
power. We will speak on one of those bills. But at this time we’re going
ask Representative Marcus Brandon to come and share with us some issues
he sees in the criminal justice system that really affects the poor, the
middle class, the people of color. We’re going to ask Representative
Marcus Brandon if he will come and share at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Leader. Thank everybody for coming. I am Representative
Brandon out of Guilford County. We have been meeting with the criminal
justice committee and the black caucus and one of the things that we
wanted to deal with is ex offenders and felon rights. We have two bills
that we are advocating for in this general session. One does not quite
have a bill number, but is our biggest legislative item and it is
working, we’re working with Representative Avila and Representative
Mobley is working with that bill, and that is to raise the age of which
you can be a felon from 16 to 18. We think this is a very important
bill. Many of our young people are getting felons before they’re
becoming adults. As we know that when once you become a felon, your life
becomes very, very difficult. These are just children and babies and we
need to respect that law. The second bill is called the Bay in the Box
bill. That is House Bill 204, sponsored by me, Representative Pierce,
and Representative Rodney Moore. The Bay in the Box legislation is a
legislation that many of our cities and municipalities have already
enacted. It would not allow people to...the box that says are you a
convicted felon, that would no longer be able to be on the application.
The reason for that, many of us serve communities where
people...communities where there are folks that have felons and it is a
curse for the rest of their entire life, they have this on their record.
They can’t get jobs, they can’t get housing. There’s numerous things
that happens once you become a felon that makes their life very, very
difficult, especially trying to re-enter to society. These people have
paid their debt to society already, have served time or their probation.
There are folks that are 21 years old that got a charge, who are 50
years old today who have that on their record and cannot get a job. We
really need to deal with that. This is a cancer in our community. The
black caucus has been fighting for this for years. I was encouraged last
year when passed some expungement laws and felon right laws. We hope
that we can work with the other side to be able to pass more...bring
more people into society instead of alienate them. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Rodney Moore will come talk about economic issues within the
community.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good Morning, my name is Representative Rodney Moore. I’m from
Charlotte, North Carolina House district 99. We have some concerns about
some economic concerns that I’ll articulate to you at this moment. One
of the things that we are very concerned about, I don’t need this. One
of the things that we are very concerned about is economic justice.
Economic opportunity, in all parts of the state. If you look at some
statistics, if you look at the unemployment rate, it hits mostly rural
counties. Eastern counties where you have double digit unemployment
rates and most of those counties are rural and have a large population
of African-American and Latino workers. We have a concern about how to
bring...put that unemployment rate down, and retrain these workers...</p>

trained them into the industries and the services that we still talk
about with the 21st Century technology that we need to go.  We also need
to expand opportunities for training between businesses and community
colleges to bring these people up to speed.  There is also an issue
about access to capital for small businesses, women- and minority-owned
businesses, and so that's one of the things that we'll be concentrating
on, finding out how we can give, look through the programs, such as some
programs at the rural center and also enhance the Minority Economic
Development Institute in Durham and the support center to kind of get
the information out there to help some of these small, struggling small
businesses to get access to capital, get access to more technical
training that's going to help them grow their business.  Also we're very
concerned about the agro-business concerns down east and in the rural
parts of the state where lots of times you have high unemployment
because the farmers don't hire a certain type of worker and so we need
to talk about that, and we also need to address how we handle immigrant
workers who are seasonal workers who come here and are work in our
agro-business.  So those are some of the things.  There are many things
I can go on about but for the purposes of time and this press
conference, those are some of the highlights that I want to hit, so
thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Gladys Robinson has come to talk about some
education agenda items at this time.  Senator Gladys Robinson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I'm Senator Gladys Robinson, representing Guilford
County, District 28.  The Education Committee of the black caucus
continues to meet to address several concerns that affect the equitable
and quality education of all the students in North Carolina.  We are
concerned about and we continue to advocate for pre-k funding, and
moving that back to the department of instruction where it belongs, it
is an education program.  As you remember, Judge Manning did mandate
that all kids receive a pre-k education in North Carolina, so we need to
make sure that happens.  We are also concerned about how that affects
the Excellent Schools Act, in terms of requiring that every child read
by age 3 or is retained.  We know that without preparation, early
education children really cannot be expected to achieve those
milestones, and so we see that as very important.  We're also concerned
about the grading of our schools and the Excellent Schools Act, from A
to F.  We know that if parents see that schools have a C, D, E or F,
whatever it is, system, I guess it's not an E, that it means that that's
a bad school, but it does not address resources that are needed, in
terms of counselors, in terms of social workers, even in terms of
teachers who are better prepared to address the needs of those students
to make sure that those schools are excellent, as well.  You might know
that our Superintendents form our ten largest school systems just the
other week met and addressed several issues they're concerned about.
One of those is not having vouchers in our state.  That drains the
resources of our public school system and North Carolina has been a
state that supports public education because it equalizes the playing
field.  The other issue is that we have all, as a caucus, asked that
this general assembly make sure that the Board of Governors for the
University of North Carolina system remains diverse.  It has been known
for diversity from every part of the state, representing all of our
universities, also by gender and by race.  We're concerned at this
point, that as appointments are made, that we have the last remaining
minority members rotating off, and we want to make sure that that board
is constituted with both males and females that are African Americans as
well.  Thank you so very much.
We've got First Vice-President Eileen Palmer.</p>

<p id="15:00">
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I’m Earline Parmon. Senator District 32 for
Forsyth County. As Senate Robertson has said, there are many issues that
we face as a state in North Carolina. We will continue to push and look
at the dropout age of 16. As you know now, as we talk about reform and
education for the state, we still do allow a 16 year old to determine
when they will drop out of school. We will be looking at those issues.
We will also continue to watch and review the wolves that keep coming
forth in sheep clothing with tax credits and vouchers. We are hearing of
a lot of bills that sound good on the surface, but underneath they are
bad for our students and they are bad for our public schools. As a part
of the education committee with Senator Robertson, we will keep an eye
on those things that’s important for North Carolina to progress. We made
great strides in the dropout rate for the first time in the history, but
as we continue to see funding cuts, we’re afraid that we are on the
slippery slope to the bottom again in education. As a black caucus, we
will not allow that. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At this time we’re going to ask that Representative Mick Michaux will
come and share some concerns about voter ID and other election issues
that will be coming before this General Assembly soon and very soon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sooner than we expect. One of the key issues coming before this General
Assembly, of course, is the voter ID bill which the speaker has already
announced this morning that they’re going to take a studied look at.
This is one of the key issues, actually, in voting. It’s odd that we
have a constitutional right to vote mandated by our constitution. This
ID bill is something of a solution looking for a problem. There’s been
no problem particularly in North Carolina in regards to any voter fraud
or anything like that. And what about other ways you can vote without
having to show ID. We’re picking on just a few folks and not looking at
everybody else. For instance, in terms of absentee ballots, you don’t
have to have voter ID to cast an absentee ballot. You get your absentee
ballot, fill it out and mail it back to the Board of Elections. Why
would you let those people do that and not require them to also put
photo ID on that. I understand that the speaker and whoever is working
on that bill are going to make it court proof, but I found out in the
years that I’ve been practicing law that there is no such thing as being
court proof because for every answer in a courtroom there is an opposite
answer even to that. We will see how it works out. The other things we
need to take a look at is if they come back and try to introduce cutting
back on voting time. Last year, for some reason or other, the bill got
sidetracked, but early voting has been a boon to North Carolinians, not
only to Democrats, but it’s been a boon to Republicans. I think that
Republicans found out this time what they could do with early voting
like we found out when we first instituted what we could do with early
voting, so I’m not so sure that they are going to come back and try to
cut out the time on that at all. Primarily, right now, we are interested
in the voter ID bill. There are other states that have passed it and
other states that have been ruled on, some have been ruled
unconstitutional. Some have been ruled that they need to go back and do.
I think that North Carolina is trying to pattern their ID bill after
South Carolina, from what I’m hearing. Here again, there are going to be
fallacy in it. I’m one who believes in equal protection. If you’re going
to use equal protection under the law, then everything ought to be
equally protected under the law. If you put voter ID for some folks and
not other folks, you’re not getting equal protection. It’s going to be
interesting, we’ll see what happens.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have with us comments on the bill that’s been filed. We have two past
chairs with us. We have Senator Floyd McKissick, we have Representative
Alma Adamson who’d like to comment on a bill that she has filed that is
very important to the state of North Carolina. Representative Adams,
past chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank you all for being here. You may remember
that six years ago we...this General Assembly did pass the</p>

<p id="20:00">
House Bill to increase the state’s minimum wage. All of us know that as
the cost of living continues to rise that people who work hard every day
and many of the people that we talk about in the minimum wage bill, it’s
a bill to increase the minimum wage and also to index it inflation. Six
years ago, or actually maybe ten or twelve when we started with the
bill, we initially wanted to increase the minimum wage to a wage that
was a livable wage and we still need a living wage in North Carolina.
Particularly when we think about the numbers of people who are not
working, who have lost their jobs, who work hard everyday two and three
jobs to make the ends meet, still not able to provide for their
families. I have filed a second bill to address that issue again. As you
know, it has also been talked about in the congress with our president,
the need to increase the minimum wage. Of course, if we had indexed it
several years ago when that bill passed, people would still be getting
that benefit today. If you think about it, if you’re on social security
or whatever, you always get some kind of increase in your wages to help
you have a better quality of life. We’re hoping that we can really
address that bill. I would certainly like for us to reach a point where
we can provide a living wage, but certainly, at the least we should do
is to index the bill. To index the minimum wage to meet the needs of
inflation. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. This time we have Senator Floyd McKissick to talk about the
future of the eugenics and the bill and where we are in terms of funding
at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Keroin. At first, I’d like to say that all my colleagues
here pinpointed some significant issues that certainly the Republican
and Democrats will likely be on opposite sides of, but they’re very
important issues that we need to be very deliberate in terms of the way
we focus our attention. Address the messaging and try to bring public
enlightenment to our positions and thoughts about these issues. One
issue I think we can some bipartisan support this year is the eugenics
compensation bill. Of course they were filed last year on both the House
and the Senate side. It did make it through the House. It got stalled in
the Senate. I’m hoping that this year, working with particularly some of
the new members that have joined the Senate this year as well with
colleagues that have remained, that we will be able to build a coalition
of bipartisan support so that we can finally do the right, humane thing
and compensate some of these victims of forced sterilizations who lost
their reproductive rights due to factors that they could not control.
It’s long overdue that we address this population within North Carolina
and we will be working collectively with people on both sides of the
aisle to make sure that’s possible to do so.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If we did see the thing that’s…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
...and I raise this point on the floor. I want you to remember one
thing. Two years ago when the the Republicans took over the General
Assembly, the unemployment rate was 9.2%. This year when they took
absolute control, the unemployment rate was 9.2%. I haven’t seen a job
created yet by anything that they have done. I haven’t seen it in any
legislation that they are proposing. The fact of the matter is they are
proposing cutting some jobs and putting people on unemployment that
they’ve already cut that they couldn’t get, that they won’t be able to
get. I’m just concerned right now that with their focus on things other
than creating jobs in this state, that they are going to lose that jobs
creation ball and a whole bunch of whole bunch of high weeds. It’s
imperative that in order to get our state back on track, we’re just
going to have to do something. I heard one of...Dollar say, we’re out of
the old boy system now. We’re not going to have any more old boy system.
Well, my response to him is simply, we’re going to build a new old boy
system.  And most of it is going to be is on that’s going to be minus a
whole lot of people who have made progress that North Carolina  has made
over the years. That’s going to be wiped out, in my estimation. But I
just want you to keep that one factor in mind. 9.2. 9.2.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Issues that are very important to the legislative black caucus. A person
that just came in. Butterfield will come at this time. Thank you for
being with us on healthcare.

<p id="25:00">
with you is that in North Carolina we are already seeing the impacts
from the unwillingness of republicans in Congress to raise taxes on even
the wealthiest Americans. A sequester in our state means cuts to mental
health block grants. That will mean fewer mental health services. It
will also mean less outreach to people with serious mental illness who
are living on the streets. Cuts to the AIDS work assistance program
means fewer people in our state getting life saving medications. Cuts to
Indian[?] Health Services in viable hospitals mean they will be forced
to serve fewer patients, cuts means that more than 3,000 fewer children
would get vaccines they need for measles, mumps, rubella, and other
diseases. In addition, the hospitals in our state will see 1.3 billion
dollars in cuts over the next ten years due to these federal cuts. Now,
on top of all of these unwise cuts by republicans in Congress, we must
also deal with unwise decisions by republicans in Raleigh. By blocking
federal grants for expanding Medicaid we deny access for more than
500,000 North Carolinians. We are sending more than 15 billion dollars
in our tax money to other states to ensure that populations and fixes
are not there for health disparities. Ladies and gentlemen, I am saying
to you that we are going to be vigilant on health disparities. The
research and the data speaks for itself in terms of the impact on people
of color and we are going to, indeed, be vigilant on services for the
disabled and the elderly in need in North Carolina. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have a opportunity, any members who might have a comment on an issue,
we would welcome that at this time. Any of the members who have a
comment at this time, questions, did you have anything? At this time,
questions. Yes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a question about [??]. The public health polling for that survey
yesterday that showed 93% support the voter ID also showed that only
2.5% of the people they talked to didn't have an ID. Is that something
you all have to overcome or do you disagree with those numbers?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I, something, if it's true, who did the polling on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Public Policy, [??] University.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh, okay. Polls depend on who, the people who do them, the way the
question is asked and what-not. Did they say, specifically, voter ID or
did they just say ID? You know, how the question is raised, the bottom
line is that you got a guaranteed right to vote whether you've got a
photo ID or whether you, whatever kind of ID you've got. Until you can
show whether, then, a vast amount of fraud as the result of that, you
can commit fraud with photo ID. I can have my picture and I can put
several, put it on several ID's that I can go around and get under
different names. It's easy if, it seems to me it would be easier, if you
wanted to commit fraud, to do it with photo ID than you'd do it, then to
do what you're doing it normally. Numbers say something but it depends
on who's putting the question and how it's put.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[??] couple questions that I've asked, [??] to repeat [??] but I wanted
to ensure that-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You might be getting both but go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was wondering if, well actually Representative Lewis, earlier today,
voted for the ID and said that he was involved with this [??] because he
believed in the integrity of the elections [??]. The larger issue that
they always bring up, about integrity, can you just-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't know of any system int he world that has more integrity in it
than the voting system in the United States of America. We've done it
for all of these years without any, there have been instances, yes,
anybody's going to take advantage. Even the smartest crook is sometimes
going to back off but it's not like the [??] robber bankers because
that's where the money is. The reason you are voting is because you want
to provide good leadership and you want to provide that leadership. We
have the best voting system in the world in this state, in this country,
and I don't see why we need to mess it up with any other things that
would cause people not to be able to cast that ballot that they have a
constitutional right to do. I'm thinking about, if you're going to
guarantee every constitutional right with a photo then every, you know,
voter ID, you'r going to</p>

The only thing I can tell Republicans to do is forget it. I mean,
seriously, because you are disenfranchising at least a half million
people. Our state board of elections has proved that figure already. Why
do you do it? Then the second thing is that I have heard nobody say what
it’s going to cost in order to provide everybody with photo ID. Those
who don’t have it, you’ve got 5-600,000 people, how are you going to
provide them with that. How are you going to no disenfranchise those
people. Somebody tell me that. You can’t tell me that photo ID for
voting is something that is needed, particularly in this state where you
have less than 1% of any type of voter fraud even attempted.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[inaudible]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I don’t, I really don’t. I’m not...what I’m saying is that this is
an anathema as far as I’m concerned. That we don’t need it. We haven’t
had any problems with it. People have voted. They voted and they won. We
voted and we won. They voted and they lost. We voted and we lost. What’s
unfair about that? The way that these thing have been going and it’s
work to some folks advantage, but there has been no reason in the world,
none. Nobody has shown me any reason to require you to walk up and
present photo ID in order vote. If you want to make sure fraud doesn’t
exist, why don’t you just put ink on their fingers like they do in some
countries. You go in and get a little ink on  your finger and that says
you voted. It’s just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Mckissick just had a follow up on that and then if there are any
other questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And the thing that I would point to is statistics themselves. If you
look at the unprecedented turnout that we had back in 2008 presidential
election. Over 5 million people voting in this state. The state board of
elections will tell you there were only about 44 cases of alleged voter
fraud. 44 when millions of people are voting. They’re trying to fix a
problem that doesn’t exist. They’re trying to create the perception that
there’s rampant voter fraud when there’s no statistics to bare that out.
It will disproportionately impact voters that will likely come to the
poll who will be more likely to vote either Democrat or Independent than
Republicans, and that is their goal, to repress that vote by any means
necessary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just wanted to add one final statement, I presume, maybe, as it
relates to the poll. It concerns me that we would even...a poll is
interesting, it tells us what public opinion is, but that is not what
you would use to measure the constitutional rights of our citizens. Just
because the public prefers something, this a fundamental right that’s at
stake and our concern is about those people who would be just
disenfranchised, even if its not the majority. Obviously, the majority
of people have always had IDs. That’s not an issue. We’re talking about
the people who would be left out and the cost of that and the
inconvenience of that and clearly the purpose is to disenfranchise them
and yet we’re not being fair when there’s a whole ‘nother group that is
their favorite voters.</p>

The absentee ballot population is not even being affected. So, we don't
know whether they plan to address that inequality or not, but that's a
problem.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
These folks really raise questions. Now, Angela just raised a
constitutional issue. Let me clue you in, look at Article 6, Section 4
of the North Carolina Constitution. What it says, is that before you can
vote you must pass a literacy test. That's the Constitution in North
Carolina that was passed in 1970. 1970. Article 6, Section 4 says you
must pass a literacy test. Now, I went to find out how in the heck that
got in our Constitution in 1970. What happened was the General Assembly
cut it out of the Constitution, but they put that question as a separate
issue on the ballot. And the people voted for that issue on the ballot,
and that's how it got back into the Constitution. So, now hey, if I ever
wanted photo ID for voting that would have been the time. Even with an
honest ballot, you don't need it, folks. You just don't need it. Just,
you know, take a look at it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Dr. Adams, Dr. Adams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Just a question. Perhaps there needs to be another poll, to survey the
people and to ask the people if they would like to have their
Constitutional rights denied. I think you'll get a different answer.
When people don't have all the information, and when other folks are out
here trying to convince them that this is the right thing, and they
don’t think about the rights that they already have. That's the question
we need to ask people.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Oh boy, we've had a lively meeting today. Is there any other questions?
I want to thank the press...
Yes, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Real quick, there's a, in the House Rules Committee, ?? passed that
basically ?? doesn't want the Federal Government to infringe on gun
rights and 2nd Amendment rights. ?? someone who was in that committee or
may have any knowledge of...
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I think they need a picture ID.
But no, I haven’t seen the bill. So, I don’t ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Brandon, I am calling myself on it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I was in House Committee, I would just like to there's absolutely
nothing factual in the bill. There was all opinion. We all went to first
grade, we all had sentences, we can tell whether it's a fact or an
opinion, and that whole entire piece of legislation is just an opinion
inferred that the Federal Government is doing that, but we do have a
Constitution and if the President or Vice President or Members of
Congress was breaking the Constitution we would have an uproar over
that, but it's an opinion and everyone's entitled to their opinion. But
to force that down to the House and say that all of us in the House
agree with an opinion that we are infringing on the rights is completely
false. There is not one factual statement in that entire resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Anymore questions?
Thank you, Press. Thank you, Members.</p>
