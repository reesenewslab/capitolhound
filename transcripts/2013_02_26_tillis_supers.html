... Why don’t we start over here with Representative Cotham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, and good morning superintendents. I am Tricia
Cotham. I represent North Carolina House District 100, which is the town
of Matthews and a small town called Charlotte. I am a teacher by trade
and a former principal in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School Systems.
Welcome to the North Carolina House and thank you Mr. Speaker for
bringing these members here today and for your leadership. We look
forward to hearing from you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Johnson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hi. I’m Representative Johnson. I represent Cabarrus County. I’ve been
with the general assembly 14 years. I want you to know how very grateful
I am that you came today. I want you to know that this is not a dog and
pony show, we really want to hear what you have to say. We want to
discuss it. We want to solve problems. Thank you again for coming today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
By the way, to touch on what Representative Johnson said about a dog and
pony show, the only reason there are press and cameras here today is
because we are a public institution. And if we didn’t do it, I think we
would probably be criticized for it. But it’s certainly not for any
purposes other than the purposes they have to report the news. We’re not
capturing this for our purposes, I want to make that very clear.
Representative Jeter. Incidentally, those members who have education
background, state why you are here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This breaks my policy of not talking on the floor. My name is
Representative Charles Jeter. I’m a first term House member for
Mecklenburg County. I am a member of the education committee. For me,
the compelling reason of why I wanted to be here and be a part of this
is I’m one of the few members who have three children in our public
school system. I have a sixth grader, a fourth grader and a
kindergartener. This is something that touches home for me in a very
real manner. What you all do makes the ability of what we do easier. So
I appreciate you all being here and I echo Representative Johnson and
the speaker’s comments. We’re here to listen and learn. We don’t know
all the answers and we’re hoping to get it from you all. Thank you all
for coming.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Actually Representative Jeter, you’ve reminded me. I’m pretty ruthless
when it comes to managing flow on the floor. I think most of my members
would agree with that, cruel but fair. I want to make sure we keep our
introductions to about 20 seconds, because we have about 12 or 13 other
members who want to speak. Representative Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Welcome everyone to the House floor. Thank you
for being here today. My name is Brian Brown. I represent the 9th
District which is Pitt County. I would just keep it brief by saying
thank you very much for your wiliness to attend and share your thoughts
today to help us build education policy here in North Carolina. I do
serve as the Vice-Chair of Education, and I’m also on Education
Appropriations. Thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lambeth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning. Thank you all for being here. We’re very pleased that you
all made an effort to come here. I represent District 75. I’m a former
chairman of the school board there in Forsyth County for the past 18
years. I’m very fortunate to be here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ford. Representative Martin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning. I’m Representative Martin. I’m proud to have given up my
seat to my superintendent John ??. I’m in Wilson County, representing
House District 8, Wilson and Pitt Counties. Last year I served as the
president of the PTO for the public middle school where my teen age
daughters have attended. I’m interested as a parent. I serve on the
education committee. I’m fortunate to have some good contacts in my
county and a great relationship with my superintendent. I’m eager to
hear from all of you as well, so thank you for taking the time to be
here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I can assure you that Representative Martin looks nothing like
Representative Ford. Representative Arp.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I’m honored to have you ladies and gentlemen
here. My name is Dean Arp. I represent Union County. I’m also like
Representative Lambeth a former school board member for 12 years. Our
challenges are difficult and collaboration is the best way to go
forward. So thank you for coming here and giving us your thoughts. We
certainly appreciate them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McNeill. Sorry about that Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ken Goodman, representing District 66. I’m probably the
only person here who has five superintendents in my district, plus a
former superintendent over there that I see. I just welcome you all here
today. I’m here to learn from you and I hope to learn a lot this
morning. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Murray. I’m having a crosswalk. I have lights up here

represent the Western part of Wake County: Carry, Apex and Morrisville.
Wake county has no issues on our school board. But I am the chair of the
house commerce committee, and what I'm interested in is your thoughts on

development in our state. And that's my interest in hearing from you and
the meeting that we will have with other educators across our state.
Thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Steinburg.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Speaker. I'm representative Bob
Steinburg, I represent Northeastern North Carolina district one, and
just to show you how connected I am with two of my six superintendents,
when I walked into the hall they were sitting in my seats. So we're
thinking about each other in all sorts of different ways. You didn't
know it was my seat, did you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh yeah they did.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh they did? Okay. Well they did. [laughter] But we're
delighted to have you all here, thanks so much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hurley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Speaker. I'm proud to have Diane
Fost, superintendent of the year, sitting in my seat last year
[laughter]. She was glad to be on the whole committee this year for our
schools. I am a product of public schools myself, and I am very proud to
have you here and have all of you here. Thank you for coming and being
interested in helping our students. And we want to help any way we can.
Thank you.

to have superintendent Johnson with Asheville City schools - part of the
district that I represent is in Asheville City school district - and
superintendent Baldwin with Buncombe County schools here today. They

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Torbett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Speaker. John Torbett representing
Gaston district 108. I'm here in full support of, and to listen to my
superintendent Reese McGlowen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The superintendents, the-- we've got a good mix of
members here today. Many of them with educational background from rural
districts, urban districts. Democrats, republicans, men and women,
black, white. And I think it's a reflection of the community of
superintendents that are here as well. I see Representative IIer Did you
just come in Mr. IIer?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I did, Mister Chairman. May I speak for not to exceed
two minutes? Personal privilege?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] 20 seconds.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Speaker. I'm very proud to have
Doctor [Air Pruden] who's sitting in my seat right here in front of me.

Bryan Holloway I represent Stokes and Rockingham counties. This is my
ninth year. I was education appropriations and education policy chair
last session. This time I am full appropriations chair, but it's a
pleasure to have you here today. It's good to see everyone. It's good to
have both my superintendents here. I've got to step away at 11:30, but
again I'll be back as well because I do want to hear the conversation,
and I think it's very good that we're doing this. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Have all the house members in the chamber introduced themselves? You
know you've made it when you have the- Oh, I'm sorry. Representative

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was going to sit quietly because I'm like the other freshmen. I have
talked too much on the floor. But I'm Paul Tine. I represent District 6,

Happy to have several of my folks here. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Elmore
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hi I'm Representative Elmore. I represent District 94, and I've got Dr.
Cox here from Allegheny County, and I represent about 98% of Wilkes
County. ?? ?? There he is up in the front. ?? ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hastings, find a mic and introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative Kelly Hastings, Cleveland and
Gaston Counties. Appreciate the being here today. Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore. We're not asking for a motion, just- ?? ??
Representative Moore is our rules chair. He goes robotic on me
sometimes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning, I'm Ted Moore. I represent Cleveland County. I actually
have two kids in the public schools- a seventh grader and a fifth grader
in Kings Mountain. Good to have you all here, and I'm going to have to
step out, too, here in just a few minutes, but want to hear the
conversation also. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was about to say, you know you've made it when the operating clerk
today is our lieutenant governor. Lieutenant Governor Forest, please
introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning, everybody. I'm Dan Forest, lieutenant governor. It's
obviously great to have you here, Mr. Speaker. Thank you so much for
doing this, and then for inviting the president of the Senate to come
and listen as well. Obviously we don't have all the answers for
education- you do. And so we really just want to hear you out, hear what
you have to say, and move North Carolina forward into the 21st century
of education. So thanks for making the time and sacrificing on this
miserable day to come out and do this. Mr. Speaker, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For the purposes of hearing from superintendents, we're about to move
into stopping talking and listening to you all. You'll notice that you
have the white buttons just in front of the microphones. If you would
like to be recognized and make any comments what we would ask you to do
is simply press the light and I will recognize you in turn. When you're
recognized, if you could state your name and the county that you're
from, I think that would be helpful for the members. Just before we get
started, maybe we'll go back, but Representative Pierce, why don't you
introduce yourself in 20 seconds or less.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. State Representative Garland Pierce, I represent
Scotland, Hoke, Robeson, and Richmond, so I should have four
superintendents somewhere around here today. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Now we're at a point to where the toughest thing is probably
the first person who has to speak. So, I think we don't have a problem
with that, Reeves. Please introduce yourself to the group.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, Reeves McGlohon, I'm superintendent in Gaston County. I
think they asked me to go first because I've been around here 43 years,
and I would say thank you to you and the members of the house. This is
the first time in 43 years that superintendents have been invited to do
this, and we're very appreciative of the invitation, of the opportunity
to have dialogue, and of your leadership and the leadership of the
house. They also asked me to talk about the one issue that I think
nobody wants to talk about today, and that's budget. That's the one
thing that we want to share with you. Get it off the table first. We
understand that we live in a world where resources are few and needs are
great. Whether we're talking our county commissioners, our members of
Congress, or members of the general assembly, that's an issue that comes
up. We're very appreciative of what you did last year to help begin to
eliminate</p>

The discretionary, we understand that was something that you're not a
party of bringing in the world are we appreciate your assistance and in
getting rid of it to Islam’s budget is concern I think you'll find that
all education groups have as their number one priority lessening the
discretionary, working out of that situation are congestion county, we
have to cut the last four years some $27,000,000, 500 on plus jobs on
we've learned how to live with less than two and productivity of
discretionary company is this something that we find to be very
difficult to work with a new reason for that is by the time we get some
discretionary, we cut everything we can, cannot continue to question
them so we would as if you continue the work you started last year alone
do whatever you can to eliminate on as much if not all that
discretionary competition can a (SPEAKER CHANGES) I think it's a good
thing it's a great starting point of precedent of bets on your monitor
on our mind all scientists from aid from organizational perspective
where the end was so as being promptly and one on the west CIA members
light on pricing that a member who wants to respond a question of one
way on my control panel are listening to the one before eliminate so you
do have pointed to one to write it would be helpful for you to put
relying on Nelson, get some sense of the economic outlook and one topic
vs. and other topics are you have anything you want talk about of the
point of internal white LC of a novelty of recognizing any one to a
request to speak and the war the lawmaker lights up about the budget now
both of my staff on the spot the values can speak until about 90 seconds
to go beyond we talk a little bit about the changing the concept of
budgeting, for me to work in progress but the budget situation this year
is far better than the budget situation about ourselves and 2001 we had
to make cuts we are we try to do the best we could and we try to provide
some flexibility along the way on this year is a lot of different story
we have got a structural the structural deficit of about two and half
$1,000,000,000 to sort through and 2011 based on the consensus revenue
forecast we have now we have well over 100,000,000 surplus or body goes
away thinking that are millions about the spending of education probably
not the case because we're more identify some areas project cleanup and
human services for the people around some nice about overage and what
we're trying to do is work towards a no less than what was appropriated
2011 objective and of the two were successful within a week working well
now so please send we have no more money one of things we want to do is
talk about things we can do like to spend the money different
perspective on priorities are bracing for you at some stations that we
have to have to go are also try to sort out the extent to which the a
sequestration when affects the funding flows from the Federal government
and a lot of that is obviously one of the depending on what a pity on
changes occur on 22 countries the president on the discussion of
sequestration repeated this point we have to assume that one of our ad
saying their investments fell about how that affects North Carolina
think overall overall categories spending on Tuesday to patients about
$300,000,000 deficit estimate somewhere in a row of of a 30 to
60,000,000 dollars in education on so we talk about baton and
specifically we need to talk about the kinds of your programs far how is
funding sources are being used on affects you think you'll be all within
a month ago follower of light and it goes to the discretionary cuts the

We continued communication with the influence of the speaker with Intel
where to continue just as we were before and as much information as we
can in we consider this option as well and had on to our regular process
and alternative opposition usually. On fees gossipers forgive me if will
result. In your computer speakers are someone concepts overworking
wanted will want your feedback on input and development is will the
funding streams the funding formulas that we have the state how do we
get that more streamlined and collapse so that it's not probably telling
you where you have to spend your money on these streams whether it's XYZ
nurses to your 80s teachers but give you the design of the flexibility
to implement your system everywhere 1415 funding streams now how do we
clapped that down 1 1/4&quot; block grant scenario where you're given
the money to give the flexibility to design the program that best suits
your school district and were just here to measure results based on the
flexibility to be think about it in the concept as we move forward is
getting rid of the strings of North Carolina a of the state funding
enough in those formulas just give you a bit autobody all the experts is
as tall white society inside the speaker for Mono disfigures is your the
experts in this area how do we get out of your way to let you design
your programs and spend money are you is what we need to do also happy
to entertain in a reaction workers said it's in the early stages will
really talk about God as a set of adding the legislature coming out and
assume that the discretionary Model all the ways that we structured
funding stream or is the framework we have to work with and we think the
framework and you won't regularly give us feedback on how to do that I
think the other thing we have to do is find ways that we can drive out
efficiencies that are either through state funding or other funding
sources and reward the school systems of on those efficiencies by
allowing them to retain them in their districts and use the road out are
probably some school districts that are either their their their viewers
there are percent of fish by others who may be able to find efficiencies
in the past I don't think that the counties in the state's have done a
very good job of rewarding any government institution were actually
taking Russ and implementing measures that make it more efficient
because technically the reward for that was sweet that money away is fed
up with some other purpose the portable child who also is to radically
are called finders keepers and often criticized for impress them by the
concept concept this for you all to go out and find these things up for
us to create structures in place it rewarded for 500 savings and
reinvest them back into the into the school systems are think it's and a
child were red and irritated the cash constrained mode it's the only way
to we can find near-term additional money and and the reason for that is
not competing across the board Health and Human Services as the governor
said is broken and urban hundreds of millions of dollars that have not
been spent for productive purposes that have to continue to manage the
crisis so that I don't want anyone leaving the room thinking that the
soon-to-be significant sums of money that there may be as the economy
terms that turns additional money are clearly there will be at some
point in time right now it's more about how we get more out of
overspending today out of our rewarding school systems for increased
efficiency measures which could be up to and including collaboration
with other school systems to reduce regional cost I don't know the
things that we consider before there may be examples weren't working
today the best sort of thought process that we want to discuss in and
figure out how the legislature would help to facilitate that xenobiotic
Peter Jillson Limassol sailing committee is a proven and him

special opportunity dialogue today very much Mr. Speaker the
superintendents of North Carolina are extremely concerned about any

Some disagreement. One, I think your comments were very eloquent. I'd
actually like to get a copy of them if they were documented as you
spoke. The, a part of your comments are founded on an end state that I'm
not sure is consistent with what's being discussed among members who
support some sort of a tax credit framework. First and foremost, it's at
least one member's position, my position, that any kind of a tax credit
measure needs to be focused on the lowest and most at risk socioeconomic
strata that we have in school systems. That I think there's a lot of
compelling data saying that as we're reforming the school system, there
are parents out there that may need to be afforded other choices. And I
think that you will see any bill that comes out of the House having
threshold testing that would focus on those, that socioeconomic strata
that needs options. And I'm gonna put Representative Brandon on the spot
here and I'm gonna give him a moment to think about what he's gonna say
before he says it, but Representative Brandon and I are two people that
have developed a relationship over the last couple of years. We come
from different sides of the aisle. We come from different ethnicities.
We have very little in common, Marcus, but we're friends and colleagues
on this issue. And what we're trying to talk about is something in
between. This is not a broad based plan to all the sudden eliminate K-12
public education. It's an absurd notion for one thing. There's no way
economically that I think that it would work or structurally that it
would work. So I think it has more to do with the plan design, because
you obviously have a lot of passion around this. I'd like to tag you as
a potential candidate for the working group that we'll create out of a
subset of superintendents here to talk with us about the plan design. So
that we can talk specifics. The problem that we have with a lot of these
issues is people are opposed to it, take it to the logical extreme, that
they see this being a camel's nose under the tent and one step in the
chess game and endgame to privatize education. I think that's an absurd
notion for the reasons  you've mentioned. But I do believe there are
some valid arguments about providing some choices for a segment of the
population that right now, I think we can argue, is not getting exactly
what they need out of a given school. Not necessarily a system. This
isn't about targeting systems, but Representative Brandon I can't force
you to speak, but if you would like to just illuminate the mic and speak
from the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I have struggled with this issue and I come from a background, from
a community where I have lots of children who need choices because we
have struggling folks getting high school diplomas, and I've got 60% of
those kids of my district that are not reading on grade level, and
really when you're talking about academic, I look at a situation where
it's academic genocide, where the numbers that you're talking about, you
can spread it across a district and it doesn't look so bad, but when you
concentrate it into communities, those numbers double and triple. So
when you say 40% are not graduating, well that's like 70% in communities
??. And so that's a difficult situation and I think that the best thing
that we can do in this body and working with you guys is that if we can
have a conversation of not charters versus public or private versus
public, but a conversation of how we can create the capacity to educate
all the different needs of our kids. And if we have that, because a lot
of it's rhetoric. I understand the kids in my community. Even if we did
give, even if we did have a tax credit or a voucher, not all of them are
gonna be able to take advantage of that. It's not going to deplete, the
rhetoric is it's gonna take money from public schools and it's gonna
deplete public schools, but we've had this in other states, all over the
country, and that does not seem to be the case. But I think the rhetoric
sometimes hurts us because it pits us one against the other, when one,
when we really could be having a conversation of how do we meet all the
different needs of all the different children in our community, and this
is just one more tool in the toolbox that we can, that we can utilize.
But certainly the rhetoric, and insightfulness of it, does present a
challenge for people like me and others who have to make a tough
choices. But we would love for you guys to give us input and let us know
how this could be the least restrictive environment for you guys in
terms of that. But I can promise you that most of the people that I've
worked with on this bill and people that have been working on this bill
for several</p>

so we've actually looked at the finances and consolidated some pieces
and we're going to go through a process with our superintendents who are
not a part of the subcommittee to bring you a report of those funds we
believe with flexibility would allow us to move forward and in fact meet
you charge to give us the freedom to meet the challenges of our
children. The second thing, we've also taken your challenge  to look at
those things that the charter school has, and again we're in the process
of vetting that. We'll be bringing that forward to you to show you these
are some rules that in fact tie our hands and if the charter schools are
going to have their hands untied we believe it's going to make it better
for the state. So we'll actually be bringing that. The other thing we're
doing is we've gone to DPI and they've got 30 pages of regulation. We
may not get that completely done this session for you, but we are
actually going to go through those 30 pages breaking it up among our 8
recesses to say which things we believe could be legislated out of
existence now for lack of a better term, which things need to be studied
and which things in fact we believe should stay the same and in fact
support that. The next thing we're g going to do is we've actually taken
your challenge and we're going to ask the people to identivy those 170
tests that you talked about at our last meeting to find out why we're
even giving them.  As you know I'm from California and Florida, we used
to say you can't fatten the cow by weighing it, well we want to look at
those 170 tests first  off and make sure the 170 tests, and begin to
take a look at that. I look deeper into our special education and things
such as that . So we are committed Mr. Speaker to really look at those
things that get in our way, that we can bring to you both financially
nad legislatively to make this a better state so we in fact can beat the
challneges and be competitive. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Dr. Till. And that, it's very important. I'm not realyy into
feel good meetings, I'm into meetings that produce efforts that produce
results, and I'm glad to ear you say that the meetings that we've had
before around identifying specific regulations, not conceptual framework
but specific regulations that we can go after and sunset. The whole idea
would be let's find them, and let's take at face value that we don't
need them. Let's put a sunset on them  that says effective May of 2014,
these regulations are hereby repealed, maybe even sooner. But then we'll
have a governance framework over some period of time where the group
that thinks they should be repealed will have a opportunity  to speak
and articulate why they don't think it's helpful, and then maybe
somebody out there who honestly believes they are we'll hear them too
and provide them with equal time. And that's where I think we can create
a  judicious, not precipitous but judicious process for finding out
which ones we can claw back. My  inclination being clawing back as many
as  professionals of your stature think are unnecessary and not really
tied to improved education outcome. So we need that, we need that pretty
quickly. And Dr. Till, you've just been appointed to the working group
on regulatory reform, and if there are maybe 8 or 10 members who would
like to be a part of that, in addition to the working group that Dr.
Till's already a part of for me or advisory group, I would ask
superintendents that have passion or feedback on that issue up to 10 to
reach out to him and make sure that we create this fabric where people
realize that we're meeting, we're talking about things and we're getting
specifics to members to act on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd be curious if there's anyone here who has spent- and Dr. Till it may
be you, it could be Dr. Bolson or others I have spoken with on this
issue, I'm curious how soon we can expect some feedback on the design
and some adjustments to the school grading the A through F. We've had
discussions  about whether or not year over year progress should be a
factor, I personally think there are valid arguments to have that, but
are there any other members that have been involved in really trying to
come up with a framework. The Senate has proposed a framework that we
tend to agree with conceptually. Going through the A through F framework
is something that's easier for an average parent or person, the
uninitiated to understand but I think ?? proficiencies may not be
enough, because it doesn't capture year over year progress or maybe
other things you would look at as superintendents who would look at a
classroom and say you know, there are other things that I need to do to
really grade how well I think a classroom, a school, or a district is
performing. Are there any superintendents here who would like to pine on
that for a moment?
You'll put your light on.

<p id="045:00">
Shotwell. Superintendent of Rockingham County Schools. I was asked to
address this issue. And you've already done my introduction for me, so I
appreciate that. I think one of the things that we're not afraid of is
the accountability. And we do understand that whenever you say A through
F, just about everybody who's ever been to school understand what that
means. However, for me personally when I think about an F school I think
about ineffective teachers, I think about students that have a lot of
high apathy. I think about a principal that really doesn't care about
what they're doing. And I really don't think that there's that many
schools out there that giving them a label of F would not be a fair
respresentation of what that school would look like. And that brings us
in to two concerns with the legislation that's coming up. We're in a
year of transition right now with a new curriculum, we're also doing new
assessments. And to grade a school in a community that represents
community or part of a county, may be an unfair evaluation this year. Of
course you've heard fokls ask if we could have another year, however I
know there are also legislatures that would like to see it put in this
year. Along with that accountability, and making a change to the
curriculum, we also have the possibility of a one test labeling in
school. Or a couple test labeling in school or a grade level. And I
think just like you said, there are many other indicators that could be
included that could give you a grade of what your school looks like.
What's really interesting is whenver you look at Gallup polls and those
things, and they talk about images what people think of the public
schools it's a little bit lower rating. But then if you ask them about
their public school, where there kid goes, the rating is usually higher.
And I think you'll find that in a lot of the schools. I just think that
it's really critical that what we've had since 1995 it has been a growth
component. It gives teachers, it gives students, an opportunity to look
and see that they've moved from point A to point B. I think one of the
frustrations that folks had is you've had this opportunity yet you still
see folks hovering at this level. I think consistancy with leadership at
the school level, keeping teachers in that school helps brings the
schools up to a higher level. I've had a high school that was on Judge
[Manning']s list, it is no longer on that list. And we did those such
things to help that school. Also waiting a year would also allow us the
opportunity to be adjusted to the curriculum. So next year teachers will
know. They've been through one year, they'll know what the assessments
look like and they'll know what to expect. We're also looking for
continuous improvement of the system, if you would. Right now it looks
like any changes that might have to come would have to come before the
legislative bodies to have it change. You could empower the state board
of education to have the ability to be able to make changes and
flexibility. As we see things coming up, they could be adjusted with
that model. I think anytime you ever have a model that has a good basis
it's going to need some type of adjustment. Also, the-- talking about
the flexibility. The committee that I've helped to serve on also had
some recommendations. That if we are going to have to implement it this
upcoming year - the model that was presented to the state board - my
staff and Dr. Atkinson would be the way if we did have to go for this
year. If you all would please consider that, and please consider the
flexibility with that. Because there are other indicators that would be
included in that, also a component of growth. I do believe that as we
look at this that we are looking for fair measures to evaluate our
schools. So that parents when they do make a choice, they make a choice.
They want to be able to look at it and I think m giving tone test that
says a schools failing may not be fair. It's hard to recover from that
once you've been labeled that. We've seen that in business. Whenever
cars have been considered bad, it took as much as 20 years before people
went back to that brand and said, &quot;You know what, they're buildilng
better cars.&quot; We don't want that to happen in our schools. And I
think by adding other indicators would help out with that. I stand
before you today that we have challenged our staff. I've asked my
principals. I said, &quot;If your kids had a choice to go somewhere else
would they pick your school?&quot; That's the mentality they need to
have. I think with that, it goes with our mantra that we have in
Rockingham County, you would make the choice that rocks. With that being
said, we've seen over the last seven years double digit gains in our
subgroups for graduation rates because of having that attitude. And we'd
just like to ask you all to consider A through F performance model to
give us another year if you possibly could, but if not we do have a
backup plan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Dr. Shotwell, I thank</p>

<p id="050:00">
that the, in consultation with the Senate and actually with some
superintendents, I think that the concern over implementing the grading
model at the same time we’re doing the testing model may distort how
schools or school systems are graded. I understand that, and in
discussing with the Senate, there is some openness to first, I believe
that we will move forward this year. I think that has to be a given, so
with that as a given, how do we manage it. A part of that there is some
openness to some curving or adjusting so that we deal with may variances
in the old way that we’ve measured student performance versus the newer
methods that are coming into place. I think from a timing standpoint, we
have to assume that it is going to occur on the timeline that the Senate
proposed and it’s something that I support. What we’re talking about
here is the methodology. I’ve explained to my members and I’ve explained
to my colleagues in the Senate that if we have a grading system that the
superintendents did not believe in, then it’s going to be very difficult
for them to use that as a management tool, to be able to go into schools
or classrooms that are legitimately not performing at the level that
they should and feel like this is a tool they can use to articulate why
we’ve arrived at that conclusion. We have an opportunity now, I think,
to influence the methodology, to influence the process and I appreciate
your volunteering to lead that working group.  What I’d like to do, is,
again, and incidentally, when we talk about these working group, I’m
very serious about them, what I’d like to do is make sure you have
appropriate geographic and demographic distribution, so, urban, rural,
east, west, Piedmont. But I’d like to move fairly quickly on that.
That’s a matter that’s very important to many of the members in my
chamber and the members in the Senate chamber, so let’s work on a
methodology where you can look at it and say I can make this work and I
can articulate to a principal or a teacher why you agree with the grade
that they ultimately received. I would appreciate if you’re willing to
do that. You can resist, I’m not your boss. You can resist if you so
choose, but unless you resist, I’m going to assume silence is consent.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will accept the challenge, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. And by the way, I told some of the Governor’s staff, when
they were coming in, they’re transitioning, I told them it’s my goal,
just to give you an idea of timeline expectations, I told the governor’s
staff it’s my goal to give them two years to get their feet and really
start moving things, but those are dog years, so that’s about fourteen
weeks. When we’re talking about  these kinds of things, if you want to
have a meaningful impact on that legislation and maybe moving things on
providing more specifics about how they’re modeled, they are things we
need to be thinking in terms of weeks and not months to come back around
and give us something to work with. It doesn’t have to be perfect. It
needs to be a working model that we can sit down and iterate and I will
make some decisions about the legislative members that will pair up with
you on these working groups.
Anybody want to opine….let’s see, who do we back here. Dr. Boleson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Out of respect for my colleagues who have earned their doctorate, I’ll
humbly say Mr. Boleson, I’m still working on mine. I’m on the Regulatory
Reform Workgroup with Dr. Till. I think there’s a lot of great work and
I really believe in your mission there. It’s difficult to make a lot of
progress bailing out the boat if you haven’t plugged the hole first, so
I would just ask humbly that as new legislation’s coming forward, we
take a look at some of those catch phrases that say things like ‘will
require all teachers to be trained in’, things that say, ‘all students
must do x’ because if we’re bringing forth new bills that are going to
be adding new regulations for us to engage in, we can keep looking at
all the ones that currently exist, but just in the spirit of the things
coming forward, I would ask folks to use that filter as they’re looking
at the new legislation coming out so that we’re not adding to the burden
at the same time. I do think we have great interest in keeping some of
these decisions more at the local level and I think we can really do
that together. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, I...Mr. Boleson, I had feedback. I’m not sure from which
superintendent it may have been. It could have been you, actually, that
I got through a member saying, you know, we hear Tillis talking about
all this flexibility in working together and then they drop a bill</p>

<p id="055:00">
That tells us exactly what we have to do, and doesn't give us any
indication of where the money comes from. Let me give you a little sense
about how the legislative process works. Any member in this chamber can
file any bill they want to any time, up to a limit of 10. That's within
our rules this year. But they could be on any topic. And in fact there's
at least one, I'll put Representative Horn on the spot here momentarily,
that I used as an example of are we doing this right? Are we
collaborating with the superintendent. I don't even know if I talked-- I
think maybe I was talking behind your back. I don't know if I've talked
to you directly, but I guess now I am. By the way, you're probably also
being listened to on the internet. I think these mics are live on the
internet. Representative Horn put forth a bill that had to do with
digital learning, and making sure that the teachers are prepared to be
trained to use this new technology that we all think is a very useful
tool in our systems - like tablets and other technology. As we go
through with this bill, as you hear the bill is filed-- the moment you
see a bill filed, that would be the time to pick up the phone or
communicate with us your concerns, so that we can work through the
operational implications, the funding implications. I've used a fairly
simple model with state color groups to tell me whether or not it's a
green, yellow, red. Green means great idea, can't wait to have the
policy implemented. Yellow means seems like a good idea but there may be
some kinks that we need to work out. Red means its the dumbest thing
you've ever heard and you don't know why we would even do it. But use
that kind of construct to give us a very quick feedback on bills that
you see filed, because that's instructive to those of us who, after a
bill is filed, has to decide how to dispose of it. A run-it-through
committee to modify it, to not hear it based on our broader strategy.
Don't take a bill being filed as necessarily a statement as the will of
the body, or the will of the general assembly. And let's use that as a
way to iterate, and you probably have a more direct influence on the
policy movement. Representative Horn, Mr. Balson, did you want to
follow-up? Your lights on I don't know if I-- after you finish talking,
if you'll turn your lights off otherwise I'll assume you want to
follow-up. Representative Horn you want to talk a little bit about the
bill that we debated last week, the intent and just sort of a wild-card
thing we can see if anybody has any feedback.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister Speaker. Thank you all for being
here, and I'm happy to address that particular issue as it deals with
the digital environment. I don't think the digital environment in public
education is something we'd kind of like to do, I personally think it's
something we're going to be forced into whether we like it or not. The
reason we worded this one particular bill, which you may have been
referring, in such a way that it is a will, is simply in order to help
you and us turn the paradigm around. And what I mean by that-- presently
it seems to me that our kids, our students, know more about how to use
these devices than do the teachers teaching the students. Now that has
nothing to do with content, that has to do with how to manipulate,
utilize as a resource. It also therefore seems to me, and to many of us,
that our teachers know more about how to do this than do the people
teaching the teachers to be teachers. The point is that in the use of,
or the application of the digital environment, we've got the paradigm
upside down at the moment. And I said I don't see that it's a matter of,
&quot;Gee, that's a good idea.&quot; Frankly I see it - and I think, in
fact, based on just the heads I see shaking right now - I think it's
here and we've got to deal with it. Part of the problem right now is
we're not teaching our teachers how to utilize the digital environment.
I think we all understand that shoving a textbook and an IPad is not
using the digital environment. Using this as the reader, or say go
online and take a course, is not using the digital environment. Now we
can be like the general that sees which ways the troops are going and
runs around front and says follow me, or we can engage, we can.</p>

this bill as an example we need to do this ?? but at the the same time
when it comes to it is just a last little part requiring the training
for the teacher that may not be the way to engage in something
absolutely agree with this senate gain just looking at this bills
through that filter that something ??,
Speaker Changes:you know i think that's a classic example of our create
this engagement model,
Speaker Changes: all your legislators and superintendents on how do you
?? i think representative ?? it's not red it not the famous thing that
we have very heard but it's probably not quite green you know is so more
about how you ?? to now and that's really the reason why i want to bring
that up doctor boss if you have a comment,
Speaker Changes: yes sir Mr.Speaker if you we are one to one districts
and we put our teachers training 14 hours,
Speaker Changes: explain what do that means,
Speaker Changes: one to one is all teachers have a digital device to
teach with but i think the training ?? before the host we require out
teachers to undergo  minimum 14 hours of training it was relive it was
personal because they knew were the ?? walk back in the classroom every
student have that device every teacher knew the areas that they were
going to use and instructional methodology and that was going to flip
the class room but they have gone through the training without the
resources to the classroom but i think it is necessary to teach our
youths with digital devices but i believe ?? in classroom were to be
true meaning for educational reforms having with the training that of
the use of the digital devices were not create the effort that we are
looking ,
Speaker Changes: yeah Representative Johnson,
Speaker Changes: thank you Mr.Speaker i just wanted to make a comment
here trying to make my digital device  i received an email yesterday and
i ?? from a teacher and  had asked fro how do you see this legislation
technology legislation we are talking about ?? integrated digital
teaching and schooling was included ?? that administering digital
company was one of the universities that were able to use the copy
machine,</p>

I wanna to bring out the point that we are here discussing this and I
know this is K, we are talking about K12 but there is another side of
this issue which is training your teachers. And we are trying to solve a
lot of those problems at the same time we are trying to solve yours. And
just to say that, we realize the problem is there and we are looking for
long term solutions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Dr. Spencer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker I have been asked to just say a few words about digital and
I would like to say that we do appreciate the fact that digital is on
the radar and is part of the conversation because for a while it has
been a difficult battle. We have asked some of our teachers to really
step out and try to take risk just as you mentioned earlier and that’s
not always been very favorable. So, the fact that this legislature is
wiling to say this is part of what the future is, I heard a couple of
the members speak at the beginning is they did introductions and they
spoke about things like economic development and taking risk. The
digital learning is part of that and when we think about the CTE
legislation that is gone through those are all components of the digital
learning. We don’t have all of the answers in every school system right
now because we don’t have all of the resources, we don’t have all of the
pre-service training that our teachers need but the people in this room
are committed to doing what is right for their children, they just need
some support in terms of being able to take those risk and being able to
access some of those resources. I hear from your discussion that you all
are open to that and I think that is gonna be the way to make this
digital learning move forward, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It sounds like Representative Horn has agreed to have a discussion group
from up to eight to 10 superintendents would have an interest in this
and I think that the implications Dr. Spencer is agree to be the
superintendent contact on her side maybe Dr. Moss join that as well but
to really talk about that and see how we go beyond just that baseline
legislation that came through here to something else. I had another I
ask if the resources available to talk about it but I do know that there
is a bill that may potentially be filed that has to do with the AP
Testing Program, we have any member here to talk about that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We hold off on that when it had to do with the bill that you may see
filled, we track the bills to get filled on education and we have the
member coming before the time expires and we will have them talk about
it, Nelson ___[03:10], I do like the flight attendant, if you need to go
to the restroom or step out for a moment, the ladies restroom over here
on the left and you go out these doors and if the doors do not open the
direct sergeant arms to open inside doors and the restrooms over the
right but we will just continue talking versus taken up abroad, break.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Dr. Miller.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, I have been asked to ___[03:42] today for Dr.
Heath E. Morrison, Superintendent of Charlotte-Mecklenburg School
system. My name is Patrick Miller, I’m Superintendent of Green County
Schools and I was a participant in a work group that dealt with tenure
changes and educator evaluation and we have our workgroup participated
in three conference calls over the past two weeks and I’m pleased to
bring you some recommendations that came forth out of that workgroup,
the group was able to fairly easily reach consensus on about six or
seven points regarding teacher tenure changes, we were not able to be a
successful with evaluation instrument and I will address that in a
minute but I do have some points not to go over regarding teacher
tenure. Number one, we will certainly ask that you strongly consider
grandfathering those teachers who already have tenure, we feel like many
teachers view that tenure as a property right and we feel like the
systems, individual school systems could be burden by the expense of
lawsuits from teachers if they were to challenge that law and that
would…

<p id="070:00">
Stretch our budgets even further. We also recommend that you consider
grandfathering those currently in the pipeline for tenure. Those would
be identified as PB 1, 2, 3, and 4. Those who have clear licenses that
are working toward tenure now. We also would ask that you continue to
define teacher as it is currently defined to include media specialists,
guidance counselors, speech pathologists and others who work with
students. We recommend that the contract system mirror the current
principal contract cycle. In other words, it would be a system of
multi-year contracts. The initially licensed folks would remain on one
year contracts, but once they earned clear licensure. The first contract
would be 2-4 years, and all subsequent contracts would be 4 years.
Again, just like the current principal contract cycle. Due process
rights: there would need to be some sort of change to mirror the current
principal due process rights. We suggest that a working group look
further at that particular issue. We would like to see any changes to
teacher tenure implemented in 2014-15 to allow us a transition period
for the new contracts. And, we do have some ideas to incentivize
teachers to voluntarily opt out of tenure. I think some of those ideas
could be brought forth as a result of a working committee on that issue.
The group did agree that there needs to be further study and work to
develop an appropriate comprehensive evaluation instrument, particularly
if it would be linked to performance pay. The group will have the
current members of the teacher tenure educator evaluations work group
appoint designees to create our recommendation for evaluation. Thank you
sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Tell Heath I said hello. Heath (??) I probably should have
started this way. If you’ll notice we have a power point rolling through
the video. I can’t tell you how proud I am to know that our next
National Superintendent of the Year is from right out of North Carolina.
Dr. Edwards is not able to be here today. I’m sure that you all are
proud to call him as a colleague. I think that’s it’s a source of pride
to the state. It’s not the first either. It’s not the first who’s either
been in the final four as they say, or the first who’s come into this
system who’s been recognized as the National Superintendent of the year.
I think, on behalf of all the house members, I congratulate him on that.
I’d actually like to offer him a round of applause. (clapping). I was
joking with him, there’s so many people going to Aradale County now to
see what he’s doing in the school system. He may be one of the most, one
of the greatest economic development resources there for travel and
tourism outside of the racing industry. He’s probably giving them a run
for their money. I will also say that there are a number of other
examples here that I would like to make people aware of. A lot of great
practices. I’m not going to call the governor or the former governor out
by name, but I was at a lunch about a year and a half ago. There were
some members who were with me to visit another state to talk about
education reform. You know how these fads go. There’s one state that’s
doing something interesting so everybody thinks we should be just like
that state or at least some member do. At lunch, I was sitting next to
this governor who recognized on a broad basis that someone’s really done
some great things from education reform. He leaned over to me, and there
were witnesses there, and he said, “Tom, make no mistake about it. We
still wish we were as good as North Carolina. We appreciate you all
coming here with good ideas. Recognize what you already have hear is a
starting point, as something we look at as examples and we try to bring
back and implement in our state.” We cover the tenure issue. Is there
anyone here who has been…incidentally, when I suggest these working
groups. The superintendents have already created working groups, and I
would defer to those to continue to leverage. What we’ll be doing is
maybe pairing some of our members with those working groups. Keep that
in mind as I from the chair appoint people to these working groups. We
want to leverage what already exists not to deflect or duplicate the
effort. The matter of merit pay? Have there been any superintendents
that have have looked at that? Or is there any positions that any member
will speak for the group? Dr. …</p>

<p id="075:00">
Mr. Speaker, we are perhaps the greastest innovation in the 40 years
that I've been in the school business. Is that teaching has become a
collaborative activity. We have our teachers arranged in professional
learning communities. A group of third grade teachers sitting at a table
together. A group of nine grade world history, eleventh grade American
history. 4. 5, 6 teachers sharing what works and what is not working,
picking each other brains. Planning common formative assessments,
looking at the results, saying what are we doing for the kids that are
learning? What are we doing for the kids that aren't learning? And
trying to customize so that every student will be successful. Just the
last day that we had training in Brunswick County, at 9:30 in the
morning, I got a frantic message from the social studies specialist
saying my teachers are sitting here and they don't want to collaborate
because they're afraid that it will impact any bonus that they might
receive in the future if they share their professional secrets with
their colleagues. Merit pay is a concept from the business community and
it might work well in some endeavers, but in the school business, we
need to work in teams and we're just beginning to get there. And we're
afraid that merit pay, if given to individuals, will actually make them
clam up and stop working together for the benefit of their students. So
if we're going to look at that concept, we'd rather reward schools
rather than individuals for making progress, but we don't wanna do
anything that will nip in the bud this beautiful seed of collaboration
and working together that we're just beginning to get in our schools.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Dr. Till, I may you put you on a spot here in a
minute, because I think you went through some transition when you were
down in Florida schools. There's a couple of things that, again this
goes back to building the trust, with trust comes more flexibility, more
opportunities for you all. I'll speak as single legislator, I'm not
being critical, but I do this at the risk at being on a camera, I guess,
but one of the things that we've observed and I'd like to know whether
or not it's actually true. Is that there's a distortion right now in how
we're grading teachers. It would appear as though, that because of
budget cuts, how you have to compensate teachers for variety of, I'm
sure, legitimate reasons. There has been a sort of grading escalation,
which has teachers that may have a broad spectrum of performance all
grooved into the upper tiers of performance, so it makes it very
difficult when you at that and you see things that we need to improve,
and you look at this typical person on models. At the end of the day, I
worked in a consulting business and we had the very difficult task of
grading, we don't make widgets so you couldn't grade somebody on the
basis of this thing that they've created and the quality outcomes, and
the things that you could in a manufactoring process. But we came up
what I thought was on the whole, a fair and structured process for
assessing peer groups. But we also did something that I think has, I
don't want to use a pun, but has merit in merit pay, and that is don't
stop at grading individual, but then grade a school and grade a system,
so that there are 2 or 3 tiers that you use as a way to identify the
performance of, not just the individual, that's a piece of it, but then
also the group that they operate within and the system that they operate
within. And I think that kind of plan design is about the only way you
can address some of the issues that you have a concern with, but then
get to the point to where you have some way to measure and deal with the
H.R. challenge that we have ahead of us. Dr. Till, I'd be very curious,
if you don't mind me putting you on the spot, to talk about how that's
actually worked or not worked. Down in Florida. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
actually think that what Governor Bush did actually mirrors the
suggestion here. We were graded A to F, and when he first started the
process, if you were ?? out of school for a couple years, a voucher came
and that was all thrown out into courts. But the compliment Governor
Bush is that we rewarded an entire school, and so the personnel
practices the evaluation system rewarded a whole school and it changed
the dynamic for the exact reason you said when you had a professional
learning community. You now had an incentive to make sure your colleague
was</p>

<p id="080:00">
The strong because if the were weak in fact what happened was is that
your score at your school became less and your whole school got less and
when you had the unfortunate situation of a teacher that needed
documentation you actually have support of your colleagues at the
teacher level because they realized that what you were doing wasn't just
about the students but it was about your bonuses, so there was actually
a piece of that. And the final thing is Daniel Bing has done some
research on this, the Senate paid for schools and it hasn't worked as
well so I would encourage the legislature to look at Daniel Bing's
research, but I do support, I'm not worried about an aid plan and those
other things but I do like the idea of incentiving an entire school so
that you lead them to be collegiate. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Dr. Moss.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I agree with what my colleagues have
said, but I think that piggybacking on your idea of the tiered system,
it is important to recognize the work of a school but also then to
recognize the work of individual teachers and I think that although it
would be an extremely complicated process, with enough input something
could be developed. I know we used something in Lee County that our
foundation developed that seems to incentivize schools to perform at
higher rates, but I think before you do that there's a larger issue at
hand and that's the teacher salary schedule. Our teachers struggle every
year and I think if you look at a 30 year plus schedule and could
collapse it to 15 years that would actually make it their base pay and
then do cost of living adjustments after the 15 year mark I think that
would also incentivize them to work I think as hard as any kind of merit
pay program. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And Mr. Balson, I'm just curious, were
you in Montgomery County schools? You were in Montgomery County Schools.
Did they have in the process of their transformation did they ever deal
with the merit pay as part of the transformation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No,
in fact we were actively running away from the idea just to be fair. In
fact, the superintendent I worked for up there was a North Carolina
superintendent once upon a time, Dr. Jerry Weist, and in fact years ago
we read some of the initial work by Dan Bing that Dr. To recommended and
his latest book, not his latest, his second to latest book Drive speaks
to this motivation concept. I think we really subscribe to that, that we
just really believe that there are better ways to motivate people than
the extrinsic rewards of merit pay, so that's not something we were
pursuing there, so to help form my beliefs agreeing with what I've heard
from the superintendents here. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Dr. Martin. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Speaker. First on the performance pay idea, our
district actually has a teacher incentive fund grant, about $19 million
from the US Department of Education, and those grants are designed to
study the effect of base pay, sort of a flat bonus versus a performance
bonus and we've had 16 schools involved. We just finished, we've had a
year and a half and we actually have our first year results, just
finished analyzing those and just finished passing out the checks, and
it's a fairly complicated performance pay system in that it does provide
bonuses for the whole school, it provides grade level incentives so we
used, this is in elementary and middle schools, and so you get a math
performance for the math department in this middle school in the eighth
grade, you get one in the fifth grade for all the fifth grade teachers,
so there's the incentive to work together that's very strong. There is
an individual component, but just to give you an idea of the results, we
had 35 indicators of success and only 2 of those did the flat rate 1%
bonus schools succeed in. We had 17 in the performance paid group, it
actually outperformed the others and then the rest of them there was no
difference. They were the same. And I was very surprised by that. We had
this group of teachers, 64 teachers get an $8,000 bonus in their check
in January as a part of that. And we can all, compensation is a
complicated issue. A lot of good points have been made so far. Clearly
having a base that is satisfactory whether it's the 15 year base that
Jeff's talking about and having performance pay on top of that. Clearly
it can't be all about individuals, but needless to say our country's
built on a lot of individual efforts so we certainly don't want to
ignore individual efforts, but clearly there can be ways to incentivize
working together, so I was actually very surprised with our first year
results and we'll have two more years to look at</p>

that with a nice sample of 16 schools. And, Mr. Speaker, while I have
the floor, I want to say that North Carolina and ?? with my school board
chairman for 18 years and this thing needs to be gone in about two
months.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’re glad to have him.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He speaks very favorably of his experience so far and we’ve exchanged a
lot of emails. I do want to speak briefly about charter schools today. I
think you’re aware that we had a white paper group that worked together
for, actually several months right before the holidays, and I’ve had an
opportunity to go over it with you so I won’t go over the details, but I
will make one comment about the why you might have local authorization
of charters, particularly as it relates to individual charter school
that’s not one of our schools. I think all of us that have charter
schools in our district are aware that basically the state has a very
difficult time in monitoring the work of 130 some odd charter schools
across the state. It takes a lot of accountability sides to that, and I
know that the legislature is interested in accountability. At the local
level, we have an opportunity to work with a given charter school. We
have several in Forsyth and we are doing several things with them that
helps in both transportation, helps both in food service. We provide
psychological services. We provide specialists that we needed and there
needs to be a way, a mechanism, that makes that easier so that we really
can use the resources of our districts and our states better to work
with charter schools. We’re interested in students being successful and
it should not matter where they are. We want to be able to be a part of
that and if there are state dollars involved in it, there should be some
accountability for that.
Another thing we’re set up to do is tests. We know how to manage all
that process, train our test coordinators, follow up, monitor, do that,
and we can offer that same service for charter schools exactly like we
do. I think there are a lot of ways that we could work together and to
be advantageous for both the school district and the charter. And for
that matter, our white paper proposes putting all of our test scores
together. If there are public school kids in our county, it’s Forsyth
County scores, then let them be a part of that and we can go to our
state report card and look at individual schools and do that. There’s
probably another side to bring in local authorization, also brings in
our county commissioners as part of it too. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Dr. Martin, I was just waving to some school students up there. They
like to get waved to. Dr. Martiin, is it true that your region has one
of the higher concentrations of charter schools in the state?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We actually have six in Forsyth county out of the 130 some odd. There
are several in Guilford, certainly. A number proposed in Guilford. Our
area…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That region seems to have one of the highest concentrations. That’s what
I was referring to, the Forsyth-Guilford area.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One of things I think we need to do, people have...I’d posted that we
were going to have this meeting and speak with principals and teachers
this week from K-12 schools. We’re going to do something similar with
the charter schools and get that dialogue going. I think a part of what
we have to do is build some...either rebuild trust, or build trust for
the first time between the traditions K-12 and charter schools. As I
understand it, when charter schools were originally conceived, they were
supposed to be these laboratories, innovation areas and there was going
to be a lot of sharing between the traditional K-12 and the charters and
use that as a case for maybe retro-fitting that into K-12 schools. I
don’t think to a large extent that’s happened. I’m glad to hear that
there’s some collaboration going on, but I hope that a part of what we
accomplish here as we have the individual dialogues and figure out how
we come together so we can really build that trust and that working
relationship. I don’t think that it’s healthy for people to think it’s
an all or nothing scenario. People that would like the state to go full
charter or public school folk that would like the charters to go away
and let them absorb that base back, I think there’s something in between
that would probably benefit everybody, so I’m glad to hear you say that.
As we move forward and we have the discussion with the charters, we’d
certainly engage a working group here to work through with that. I
certainly want to put a priority in the remaining 19 minutes that we
have with any other super</p>

front
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yeah, Representative Daughtry and we have
Representative Jimmy Dixon down here in the aisle.  Dr. Cox?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes sir, Mr. Speaker.  Jeff Cox from Allegheny County,
and I'd just like to start by saying how genuinely we appreciate the
opportunity to be here.  Your notion of utilizing the superintendents in
several of these study groups, I think is outstanding.  Your notion of
utilizing the superintendents in several of these study groups, I think
is outstanding.  I thing you'll find us, as a group, ready, willing, and
able to stand with you and help find solutions with this body on how to
improve education in our state.   So thank you for that.  I've been
tasked with the responsibility to talk a little bit about school
calendar flexibility.  There are a number of bills currently pending
toward school calendar flexibility.  This is, all of you in this room,
I'm sure, have been aware, an issue that has been of concern for that
last 8 or 10 years, at least.  We have been looking for that return back
to some local flexibility with the school calendar for a number of
years.  I was a little disheartened this session, instead of moving in
that direction, we kind of took it a step in the other direction with
less flexibility.  Particularly with those mountain counties like
Alleghany, with the later start dates scheduled now, next year, for
August 19th.  I just wanted to speak briefly on a couple of key points
that are important for us.  One is, if you look at the needs of the
different school districts across the state, those districts in
Alleghany, Watauga, Avery, Ashe, Mitchell, all the Blue Ridge Mountains,
it's not uncommon for those districts to miss 20 or more days of school
in a bad winter.  We could look back and, we don't need a crystal ball
to know there's a year coming where we're going to miss 20 or 25 days.
You can just look back at a 20 year history as see, on any number of
occasions, that's been the case.  I just want the legislature to kind of
make the point here today that, with the new August 19th start date,
that the mountain counties next year, it will take 24 days.  If you
begin missing those days after the 1st of January, there won't be time
to make up before the end of June.  You think about that for a minute.
Our fiscal year ends June 30th.  For districts that missed 25 days or
more, once again, Avery, Watauga, Ashe, many, many years have done that,
we're going to be in a position, it's not if but when, they'll be in the
position to say, either we're going to have to wave off some days, and
forgive those, in which case those kids are going to be short-changed of
so many days of their education, or will be pushed into models of having

<p id="100:00">
Blackwell, I'd like to invite you to maybe explain the idea.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Some of you, or maybe all of
you, are aware that last Monday the Governor signed his first piece of
legislation in his term of office, which will provide for an endorsement
to be placed on high school graduation certificates.  Essentially 1 of 3
choices, but one is sort of a career endorsement, one is college ready,
or you can actually get the combination of the 2.  Well, in talking to
you about this advanced placement proposal, I want to concede 1, that
that is addressed at one side of the endorsement that we're talking
about, but I wouldn't want to leave anyone with the impression that
we're not concerned about, and won't be coming back to deal also with
some of programming on the career side.  As far as the advanced
placement proposal goes, it is another outgrowth of experience in
Florida.  A little over 10 years ago, when they started an AP program
that I'm going to tell you just a little bit about, they we're
substantially behind North Carolina in terms of numbers of students
taking advanced placement courses, as well as the number of students who
were scoring at 3 or higher on the AP test at the end of the course.
They are now, I believe, 4th in the nation.  We are still where we were,
we are about this middle of the pack, and our actual rates of increase,
I think, have sort of tapered of somewhat.  What they did in Florida,
and what we are going to be looking at, and what we appreciate having
you feedback on, is a program similar to what they did.  The concept
being if it worked there with twice as many student, with demographics
that are not entirely like ours, but are not entirely dissimilar either,
that maybe we should try to stick as closely as possible to the model
that they established.  And essentially it is an outreach to students we
are not currently pulling into our AP courses, to help identify students
largely through the use of SAT and P-SAT scores, and to persuade faculty
members and administrators in the school buildings, that a lot of
students are capable of taking these AP tests and succeeding, which
means they can have the enhanced potential of getting college credit,
which can be helpful when you consider the course of a college education
these days.  If you can speed up that process somewhat.  So, the AP Bill
would largely revolve around us picking up the costs of the test, which
we think is a deterrent for a lot of students.  And I might throw in
here parenthetically, that one of the real gains that Florida is proud
of is the increased participation from African American and Hispanic
students down there in these AP courses, but paying for the test.  It
also involves the use of a partnership between the school systems and
something like the folks who actually produce and sell the AP tests,
that involves training for school systems across the state in how to
identify student who are not taking the courses that could be
successful, and in helping with professional development of the teachers
for these courses.  It also would offer a bonus to teachers that would
be based upon the number of students successfully completing the course,
and scoring a 3 or higher on that grade end for that AP end course test.
 We would love to have the percentages of students taking the AP test in
North Carolina that they have in Florida.  We would love to have the
percentage that are score 3 or higher that they have in Florida.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The discussion for this, unless there's another
priority.  I don't see any representative from the superintendents, but
the first question that I ask is, how much does it cost, and where is
the money coming from?  And I think that the estimate was $9 million to
pay for the cost, and another $3 million if there was going to be some
bonus component.  Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]That's correct.  $12 million for the total program, if
we copied the Florida model.</p>

Pretty much to a T.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So the reason I mentioned that was when I get with
members who consult with me before they drop a bill, the first question
I have is, &quot;How much does it cost and how are you paying for
it?&quot; For the sake of discussion today, assume that there is a net
incremental source of funding. So we're talking more about the merits of
the program and less about your concerns about where we're taking money
away from you to pay for this good idea. With that...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Dr. Martin? Was there a? I may have the seat number
wrong, the gentleman back here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Jeff McDaris, Transylvania County school. One
piece, first of all I commend you for looking into trying to help pay
for AP testing, because it is a deterrent for some students. And it's
very important for us to have those students participate to do well. I
think we also have to remember as we go into that and look at the data,
that one of the reasons I think - and what we've seen in my district -
why AP participation has dropped is not necessarily always just the
deterrent, it's also because we're encouraging students to take
additional courses on the community college level. And they do not
necessarily need to complete an AP course in order to do that. I think
when we look at it from a broader perspective-- we do want strong
participation, we do want assistance in trying to encourage those
students to take those courses, but at the same also recognize the work
that we've done, thanks to the legislature, in trying to develop those
great partnerships with the community college system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Dr. Ellis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning and thank you for the opportunity to be
here, sir, from Union County. I want to piggy back on the superintendent
from Transylvania County. Our school system, that first semester, that
college and career promise was loud. Our students earned over 500
college credits. We have about 12% of our students who take AP courses
currently, but we are seeing that number drop off because they can get
the college and career promise. And with the advance of the academies
that we're working - like our advanced manufacturing academy which only
takes the highest math and science students. And we can get them
internships in the old German model in the summer, and they're making
$10, $11 an hour. And they can go straight to a two year or a four year
or to work. And when you go to work for a company like Turbo Mecca it's
$27 an hour. We're seeing-- we have a lot of students that are chosing
that as opposed to the AP route. And that is not because they're not
smart enough to do it, but in this economy a lot of them needs jobs and
we're trying to provide those. I hope you would take a road trip
somewhere to see some of the academies that are going on that might not
compete with this, but you're going to get a false positive or negative
possibly. Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's a great take-away. Dr. Cox.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just to follow-up one quick point. The kids in
Alleghany, given the choice between the community college course that
they can take and pass and be guaranteed the college credit, versus the
perhaps more rigorous AP course that they could take - and would
certainly benefit from taking - but then you have to pass the exam with
a certain level. And that level, depending on which college you're going
to attend, it may be a three, it may be a four, it could be a five. And
some places won't even accept those credits anwyay. That's one of the
struggles that we have also, trying to encourage our very best and
brightest kids to challenge themselves into that higher level of rigor,
when they can take the community college course and be guaranteed that
credit. That's just an issue to consider.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Dr. Crum. Will recognize Dr. Crum, and Dr. Martin
you'll be the clean up bidder.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister Speaker. At the risk of being
assigned to a work group, I would encourage you to ask--
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's why everybody got quite [laughter].
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I know there are many districts, Johnston County being
one, that has paid for-- Well, one time we were paying for those kids
who took the AP test, and we went to reimburse a child if you scored a
three or higher. So I know several districts would be able to offer a
lot of information in regard to how those results-- we [did that] make a
change in the results, so you may want to ask for that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think the gentleman from Johnston County.</p>

?? has been identified as a point of contact on the AP program, and the
gentleman from Burke, Representative Blackwell, will be the contact.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative. Dr. Martin. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I just
wanted to say quickly that from our area, I think it would not be
mutually exclusive to offer all of those. I think having you, using your
red, yellow, green, I'd probably give the green to the AP encouragement.
We do a lot to try to encourage more kids to take AP tests, and be
challenged. I think they are rigorous courses and the exam costs for
some of our kids that take four, five, and six. We used to be able to
pay for two. We can't pay for them now. It also allows us, when we do
that, we certainly then require they take the test when they take the
course. And that gives us a good number of how well our teachers are
doing, and I think rewarding those challenging teachers are good too. I
don't think that's mutually exclusive for the community college. Kids
make choices. We offer them. If they want to take them, we're just
removing one barrier, so my compliments. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It seems to
me that maybe if you have the kids taking community college course
credits, we have to have some way to equate that to the other option of
going the AP route, and figuring out how we measure up to other states
on what are both positive outcomes, different means to the same ends. I
want to close, and we've got a meeting that many of our members may be
going to shortly here, as do I. But I wanted to give you all an idea, I
was trying to think about how I'd explain my job if you had a similar
sort of operating framework to work within. Imagine as superintendents
that you have two chambers that you have to work with. You have a
chamber that is full of principals, and then you have another chamber
that is full of teachers. And any principal and any teacher could file
any policy that they wanted to for consideration, as a way to change
your school districts. All they had to do was get a simple majority, and
then they'd pass it over to the other house, principals to teachers,
teachers to principals. That's effectively the legislature. That's
effectively the process that we're going through. And sometimes, I think
in many cases, they probably have shared agendas, and probably an equal
number of times, they may not. And so part of what we're trying to do
here is give you a little bit more insight into the policy formulation
process. But really make the open invitation to have you engage in that,
with Representative Blackwell who would love to hear how a good idea is
made better. So that we can move forward and you feel like it's value
added. And it's operating within the context of North Carolina. The AP
program is a classic example. I'm not sure what Florida's integration is
with their community college system and whether or not they have a
similar relationship and education path. But we do. And that's why a
model identical to Florida may or may not fit here. But in principle it
does, and I think that if you very early in the cycle find out about
some of these legislative matters, we can break down what may look like
some sort of intractable position on the part of the legislator, in to a
good idea that needs some operational advice on how to make it even
better. And make it something that you all would ultimately embrace as
something that is producing a positive outcome for the schools. Well, I
don't know about you all, but one of the bad things about being speaker
is one, I don't get to speak very much, because I'm really just
directing the order of the House, and then two, I have never in my
legislative career chaired a committee. This is the first one outside of
a legislative session that I've ever chaired. I was never a committee
chair when I was in the rank and file membership. I found this very
educational and very helpful to get the dialogue going, though we didn't
solve any problems today. We discussed some of the things that are
important to legislators and important to you, and we identified some
superintendents that hopefully can work with you all to have you speak
with one voice on some of the matters that may come before the
legislature. But again, this is a process of building relationships.
This is a process of creating a feedback loop that may or may not have
existed in the past. I don't know of many examples where we've tried to
do it on this basis, but I hope that when you're called on in the future
that you come back, but in the meantime, you contact my office and we
will dispatch through my staff my</p>

Speaker: half resources and the members to get answers to your questions
so again i have no doubt there will be instances were to agree or
disagree or my guess is the most cases even the level ?? we were get to
point were like we are really more ?? or not just ambling to do the good
job ??
Speaker Changes: tomorrow we have principles i don't know if  every
school districts Representative Joe how may principles do we have come
in tomorrow OK we  invited ?? principals from each of your district
looks like we got some when you think about logistics great turn out
today and ?? what about teachers of the year that would adjust that for
logistical reasons ??
Speaker Changes: i know i whether have logistical reasons i don't expect
to be a lower number but again really provide direct boys absent the
association absent the sports people is very important the association
is a state organization  and great administration down here great
teachers and principals we really gotta create this dialogue if we need
to catch ?? posturing and positioning ?? and do not resulted any follow
up and the goal here is to create follow up and firmly engage with the
house and ?? the firm would work with this too but i appreciate that you
all be in ere today now you have very difficult jobs back in your
district for you to dedicate a day to travel in from all parts of the
state and to spend time with us is greatly appreciated and ?? that you
got something out of this that you leave with some optimism that this is
not ?? but part of the process of speaker expect to continue ?? so thank
you very much for your time</p>
