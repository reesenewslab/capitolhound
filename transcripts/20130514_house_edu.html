If you'll take your seats. We have a couple more yet to be pulled out
and during that time we can make our announcements. Today we have our
Sergeant at Arms, our Marvin Lee, [Carl Marilo?], [Martha Gaddison?],
where's Martha? And VL Pal, [VH Pal?]. We have [Anna Hoffman?]. Uh,
they're passing out. That's Alamance county and that's Representative
Riddell. We have Robert Jenkins from Mecklenburg county, and that's
Tillis, and [Alexandria Stephen?], is that right, Stephen? And she's
from Wake and she's um, Representative Fulghum's um, she's, is her
sponsor. [Daniel Tally?] is from Guilford, and Representative Riddell is
his, also his sponsor. And [Curtis Johnson?] from  Chowan county. And
that's Representative Steinburg. Welcome you and we hope you learn a lot
today. If you'll look at your calendar, um, 8, House Bill 831, Education
Services for Children With PRTS, that has been asked to be pulled, um,
by the sponsor. And we've had one request, uh, because someone has a
bill in another committee, so we're gonna just --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] -- Madam Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What was that bill you say was pulled?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Uh, 831.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's not on the agenda, ma'am. Okay, well we got it
off before it was printed, okay. We're gonna start with House Bill 735
Protect Religious Student Groups, and that's Representative Jones that's
handling that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chairman. Members of the committee,
um, and this is a proposed Committee Substitute, Madam Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Uh, this is a proposed Committee Substitute,
Representative Shepard moves the proposed Committee Substitute be before
us, all those in favor will say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All those opposed, no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's properly before us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chair. Members of the committee, uh,
the Committee Substitute to House Bill 735 is a companion bill to a
Senate bill that passed unanimously. This is a bill that has been passed
in several other states, and basically what it does is provide that
student organizations at our constituent UNC institutions or community
colleges may determine the organizations core functions and resolve any
disputes of that organization. It prohibits constituent institutions and
community colleges from denying recognition to organizations for
exercising these rights. The short title of the, of the Substitute, I
think, probably says it better than the original. It is not simply about
religious organizations, it's about any organization. But it's a
students' rights bill. It basically says that the core function should
be determined by that group. And, as I said, there is a companion bill
in the Senate that passed unanimously. This has been passed in several
other states. Madam Chair, I would be happy to entertain any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do we have any questions? Representative Glazier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. Actually, probably a couple of
questions and then a comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That would be fine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chair. Representative Jones, to the
extent I'm looking at section one and subsection B of section one, so if
a student organization refused to allow someone who was an unrepentant
homosexual to be a member of their club, and denied that person who was
a student at the University access to their club, and the University had
a policy that said, we don't sponsor or at least provide funds,
University funds, to clubs that discriminate against different people or
categories of people including gay and lesbian students. Could the
University, under you're bill enforce that policy?</p>

Madam Chair,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for that question and I believe that  I know the answer to
that but it might be better for me to go ahead and refer  to staff, if
for staff is willing to take that question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are gonna have to repeat the question, there is lot of activity
appear.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My question is, if a University has a Club, that the nice access to go
to code unrepentent on homosexual uncode and says if you are not gonna
repent, you can't be a member of our Club and the University has a
policy that says it will not give University funds or recognition to
Clubs to discriminate against certain groups of people including  on the
basis of sexual orientation or gender and enforces that policy, put that
University enforce that policy under Section B section 1(B) if we pass
this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blazier  and almost an identical situation  actually
happened that in last year at UNC Chapel Hill.  UNC Chapel Hill Crownie
does not have an all comers policy, but has a policy that would be
similar  to this, which allows organization based on beliefs to it,
determine its membership and leadership but does not allow
discrimination based on some one who is a certain group and that one
includes sexual orientation in, in that case it was an ?? group  that
had a over legislatures  and one of their believed statements was that
they did not believe  in homosexuality and one of the members who was
gay was excluded from the group on the basis of his belief rather than
his status and the University upheld that as appropriate to the Policy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep to follow up
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My question is does this bill change the ability of the University  or
any University to enforce their Policy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Um, there may be someone from UNC Zone and  is stationed here, we had
asked them and they had indicated to us that most of  the UNC System
Carolina does not have all comers policy and have policies that do allow
 groups to make determinations based on beliefs but that so but that
didn't have a full survey of all the Universities within the system and
the intricacies of their policies, so we don't know if there is any that
it may require some provision to someone from UNC General Administration
may be here  who can comment further on them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Here one more thing we could hear what the University  has that all with
the Policy
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there anyone here with the University that would like to speak on
this. If so, please recognize yourself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Madam Chair, Druemore University of North Carolina General
Administration, we are in the process of compiling all the systems on
all the campuses, policies I mean this time when it is not  completed
and so, as far as there may be once we certify the campus are that we
saw the entry level right now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, thank you representative Jones, thank you Madam Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes representative Lakie,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair and I am concerned about a lot of phrases in here
representative Jones and let me just start with prof down on line 34, 35
on page 1, professing the faith or mission in the group or let's we say
professing the faith of the group, what does that mean to  profess.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lakie and Mark opinion.  The word profess means to to
say. I mean if you are professing
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
something you are to your saying something,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
True
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
you are making a statement. I can stand up here and profess to be a
native of North Carolina for instance, we talk about Professors.  So
those that stand  before and make statements are  believed that the word
profess means say, I don't have dictionary  ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up Madam Chair,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, Yes when I am concerned concerned about here is that vagueness of
the language.  So if I join, I am raised Lutheran.  If I join the
Baptist Organization as a UNCG where I teach, I join that what, how much
do I have to profess  in order to be a deserve line 36, to serve as a
leader of the Baptist</p>

<p id="10:00">
disenfellowship. Under your - in other words - under your bill, what
would prohibit me from being the president of the Baptist Student
Fellowship? I'm Lutheran.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand that. I believe, if you're asking my opinion, nothing. Now,
basically I think what this bill states is that who makes that
determination? Quite frankly, if you don't think that student
organizations ought to have the ability to determine their own
organization's core functions and resolve their disputes, then I think
you should vote against the bill. If you think someone else should make
that determination. I think what this bill says is not that Rep. Jones,
or Rep. Luebke, or some outside group is going to determine what that is
but the students themselves. It simply recognizing their rights to
exist, if they have been recognized as a student organization, then they
ought to be able to determine their core functions. Now, if you as a
Lutheran, as you say, join the Baptist student union, then I would
assume that that means that you adhere to the purpose of the Baptist
student union. When I was in college, I attended such groups as the
Baptist student union, and I'm not a Baptist, but I adhered to their
core beliefs and I didn't come in to try to change their core beliefs,
or run for leadership positions to change their core beliefs, and it
basically comes down to who should be able to make that determination,
and we believe that the University students in their organizations ought
to have that right, as many other states have determined.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One follow up, Madam Chair.
Would I be professing the faith if I believe strongly in the Eucharist
which includes wine, and as I understand the Baptist denomination grape
juice is used? Am I professing the Baptist faith or not? And this is a
very serious question, because it's the problem with the bill as I see
it. It's so vague, that how am I going to know, and more importantly,
how does the organization know whether to kick me out or to say I can't
be the president of the organization. Is wine vs. grape juice, is that
enough of a profession of faith? And members, that's my problem with the
bill for starters. Can you answer the question as you view it in the
language of the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Luebke, thank you again for your question.
As I view it, I think it is better to have it to be relatively vague
rather than making it too narrow and trying to determine exactly what
someone should believe. I mean quite honestly, if there was a student
organization that was recognized on campus and their core mission was to
see that either grape juice or wine is served at communion, and you went
in with the opposite belief and wanted to run for leadership and change
their core mission, then that might be an issue.  I don't believe that's
the core mission of the baptist student union, but all I'm saying is
that- or all this bill is saying is that the student organization itself
should be able to determine what its core mission is, if they're going
to exist.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Ross.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Chair.
This is a question for the bill sponsors and maybe for staff, if the
bill sponsors can't answer it. I understand where you're getting at, but
I want to find out whether- because I think people assume that these
kinds of laws are going to apply to certain kinds of groups, but they
might have some unintended consequences. And so obviously, religious
student groups can form their own clubs, but we have lots of different
kinds of religions, and I was wondering whether if a majority of people
in a certain religious club said that they wouldn't allow any women to
be in leadership, because that was their religious belief, whether that
would be permitted under this bill, and then even though some sects of
that religion might allow women, but other sects don't, but you might-
there's only one group and there's a majority with the sects that don't
allow women. Sects, S-E-C-T-S. And then the other thing is</p>

<p id="15:00">
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It says in terms of resolving disputes and some religions believe in
resolving disputes under a religious law that may have other
implications on campus, may have other implications because of potential
conflicts with our law. And so I just want to think broadly about this
because it may not be just the situations that Representative Glaizer
and Representative Luebke raised.  There are some religions where a more
conservative element since no women can participate in leadership but a
more moderate element does, but all those students only have one group.
Do you see what I mean? And how do you deal with that and then how does
that go with Title 9?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma’am, let me try to deal with that and then perhaps staff would
like to weigh in. First of all, let me emphasize once again that this is
not a narrowly tailored bill to religious groups. We’re getting a lot of
questions about that. This is about all groups. And I would just simply
say for instance you had a group on campus, let’s just say you had the
Democratic women. And I’m not a Democrat and I’m not a woman. But I
wanted to come and join your group and I wanted to be a leader in your
group and so forth.  My understanding is that you would have the right
to say that no, I’m sorry, you’re not a women, you’re not a Democrat,
you shouldn’t be here. Now as far as your narrowly question regarding
religious groups, I’m not aware of any religious groups. But let’s just
say that you had a Christian women’s group. Or let’s say that you had a
Christian men’s group. I don’t know if any of those groups exist on
campus.  But if it is a women’s group or a men’s group, I would think
that they have a right to say that only men or women would be a part of
that group. Again, this is not a narrowly crafted bill where we’re
trying to stand up here and rally and tell every group exactly what they
should believe or what they should do. We’re simply saying that the
organization itself, not a particular member of the organization or
anything like that but if they are existing for a particular purpose and
the university has approved for them to be a group they ought to be able
to determine their core functions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have a number of bills today. Representative Michaux.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I’ve got a question because you keep talking, on line 17 it says
religious or political. And the inference is on religion there are
political and the two examples you gave seem to be in contrast. But let
me ask you this. Nobody’s answered the question raised by Representative
Glaizer and I see a direct contrast there. If in fact you have an
organization on campus that discriminates against any group, religious
group or anything like that and the campus has a policy that they don’t
believe in discrimination, then under this bill, that would force the
campus to give that discriminatory group funds to operate with, as I
understand it.  Is that what this is saying?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative I can address that. You will notice, some of the language
in this bill might be deemed to be somewhat unnecessary by some, but we
thought it was clarifying  I would point out that on both lines 17 and
32, you see the phrase, to an extent allowed by state and federal law.
Now you discussed discrimination for instance.  Most of us think of the
term discrimination in the negative sense that you’re discrimination
against someone for reasons of hatred or something like that.  But I
would just point out, people do discriminate every day one way or the
other.  Sometimes in a positive sense.  For example, a university might
discriminate whenever it allows certain students to participate at their
institution and others based on their grades, based on their
requirements or whatever so there is a discriminate made. So if that
discrimination is made on the basis of hatred, of discriminating if you
will against someone’s rights then I believe that we have laws that
address that and this bill does not contradict those laws in any way.
We’re simply saying that the student organization ought to have the
ability to determine.</p>

For a motion on the bill, ma'am.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
I have, I'm sorry. I have two more speakers, but I'll at the appropriate
time.  Representative Fisher.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Thank you Madame Chair. This is a question for either staff of the bill
sponsor. Notwithstanding the amendment that was just passed that takes
out the reference to federal law, I'm wondering can campus organizations
discriminate if the sponsoring university or college where the
organization is housed under federal law cannot discriminate? How can
they be sponsored by a university that has to exist under federal law,
federal laws, under a whole other set of laws? That's what I'm trying to
get at.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understood the question. Maybe the staff
member did.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Staff, did you understand the question? Do you want her to repeat it?
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
I think one example might be helpful is that the current UNC Chapel Hill
policy, for example, allows that you can, student organizations. I'm
just going to read it to you because that's easiest. Student
organizations that select their members on a basis of a commitment to a
set of beliefs, such as religious or political beliefs, may limit
membership and participation in the organization to students who upon
individual inquiry confirm that they support the organization's goals
and agree with its beliefs. But that student cannot be excluded from
membership or participation on the basis of age, race, color, national
origin, disability, religious status, historic religious affiliation,
veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression,
or unless exempt from title nine gender. So you can see how the current
policies are set out. There will always be ????
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
The other thing that factors in, of course, is the student's right of
free association to form groups and beliefs as they choose. As part of
their free expression, free association rights. So university
recognition, in many cases, involves being able to use the university
name or symbol as part of its logo or as part of its title. But as part
of that restriction a lot of times it does require that the university
is not sponsoring or endorsing the organization. It simply is an
organization of students associating on the university campus.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
May I follow up, Madame Chairman?
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Yes but we need to hurry along.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Doesn't this open up the campus or the university system to an
inordinate number of lawsuits?  If an organization can do whatever it
wants to do, even though it's supposed to be acting within the host's
guidelines, the campus' guidelines, and they do things that are
discriminatory, doesn't that open the campus as a whole up to...
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
I think I do understand that question, Representative Fisher, and I
would just say that if universities are discriminating against students,
I think that opens them up to more lawsuits. In my opinion, the more
that we can do to clarify the law, the more we keep cases like this out
of court.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
That's all I have Representative Torbett.

A motion is now before us. Representative Adams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam Chair. I wanted to continue with some of the discussion.
The question, and for me it hasn’t really been answered, can the student
organizations, can they basically overrule what the university policy
is? I mean I have a concern about that, and wondered if you can respond.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Adams. The way I understand it, if it’s
currently the university policy that student groups cannot determine
their organization’s core functions. I think that would change, this law
would change the policy because their policy would be in violation of
the law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me just make a comment madam chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s fine
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think basically what this law proposes then is that if a student
organization had whatever functions established, and the university had
policies, if the student organization’s policies were different, then
the student organization’s policy would overrule the university. And I
don’t think that’s right. I have a concern about the language in here
that talks about disputes in particular because I know that on
university campuses you have disciplinary, codes of conduct, or they may
call them different things. And that is something that the university
has to enforce. And so based on what I’m reading here the university
would really not have the power to do that and I just think that when
students come to campuses, they should be able to, even within their
organizations, abide by the rules and regulations of those campuses. And
I just have some grave concerns about what this would open up on our
college campuses and universities. I can’t support this bill.

Let me count that one down there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Bill Passes 30 to 20. Alright, next we gonna have to change around,
Blackwell also has asked that he and Judith's bill be moved forward ??
884 , this one has a referral to appropriations.
Representative Blackwell? 884. Does everyone have this bill?
This is a PCS. Do I have a motion? Representative Collins moves that PCS
for 884 before us, all those in favor say aye. Those opposed no ?? the
bill is properly before us. Representative Judith.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you maam ??, I will like to point out that the PCS which is
version 16 and I will like to offer my deep hearted thanks to Patsy back
there for doing so much good work on this. The referrals appropriation
was removed from the floor yesterday so but the purpose of this bill is
to set up a pilot program with two charter schools that have been with a
successful system based out of the state of Florida. It is to allow for
students that have fallen under basically two categories. One will be
students who have not attended High School but yet have not graduated.
People that just didn't go back to their junior, senior, sophomore year
for whatever reason or more prevalently, those that have dropped out
after some period of time. Our goal here is to allow opportunity with
the charter school system to capture these students, get them back on
track and ultimately return them to the traditional school system if
possible. It is a good system which worked well in Florida. There is two
proposed schools that we recommend in Mecklenberg County, which is a
pilot program, this ironically enough, well it's not ironic, actually
it's been supported by the Charlotte Mecklenberg school system.  DPI is
neutral on it, they do have some concerns about the ADM and some things,
but we feel like we can tweak those issues but they are not opposed to
it. It is a bi-partisan bill that we've worked hard on, with
Representative Cotham, Representative Blackwell and representative Moore
and it is something that we really believe is going to help our
community catch students that are falling through the cracks. Making
sure that they don't fall too far, getting them back on track to getting
a traditional high school diploma and not having to go back years after
the fact and get a GED, with that I will be happy to answer any
questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do I have any questions? Representative Glazier and Representative
[SPEAKER CHANGES] :Graham
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Graham
[SPEAKER CHANGES]?? My question is just following Representative
Judith's presentation and I think the idea is a good one, I am just
curios about what the DPI objections are that are gonna have to be
resolved. I wonder if a person from DPI might be available to answer
what their concerns are.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there someone here from DPI. Do you have a ques..? Go ahead

the DPI.  In section 6, we don't actually have the PCS, so I'm assuming
that I'm working off, thank you sir.  With a brief review of this, some
of the concerns where related to the section 6, which I see now has been
modified pertaining to the movement of funds.  And if I could take a
look at this a little bit longer, that would help.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]If I could address.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Price fromm DP addressed several concerns with us.
A part of the PCS was adjusting as the speaker is, I think, discovering,
adjusting some of those concerns.  The primary concern is transferring
the ADM funds back and forth.  Ultimately this does not dictate how that
appropriation is made.  It would be up to DPI to make that decision,
which we believe, satisfies Mr. Price's ultimate concerns.  He listed 4
specifically.  3 were completely resolved.  The 1 on the ADM, we're
basically are saying in the bill, which is why we took out the
appropriation.  We're going to let you all figure that out, you all know
it better than we do.  I think they're not ready to say they figured it
out, but I think they're okay with the understanding of how we're going
to move forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.  G. Graham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To speak on the bill, Madame Chairman.  My question was
that you recommend in the bill that we make this possible for 3 schools
in Mecklenburg County.  Mecklenburg County doesn't always look like
North Carolina.  I think sometimes we might need to look at a school in
the East, as well as one in the West, and maybe one in the center of the
state to get a better picture of what it is we're trying to do with the
educational program.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Jeter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I believe it's 2 schools, not 3, but I believe that's
correct.  I don't disagree with  you, Representative Graham, that making
this necessarily Mecklenburg centric is overall encompassing a great
idea.  The problem you get is charter schools, as everyone in this rooms
aware, I'm not telling a secret, come with some controversy when you
talk about encompassing them with existing school board associations.
There was a program in New Hanover County that was unsuccessful
primarily, in my opinion, because the New Hanover Board of Education did
not want to participate in that, understandably.  That was their
decision.  In this case the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School Board has
endorsed this proposal and endorsed this plan.   Our belief is that once
we can successfully implement this, we can take it state wide.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Okay, Representative Lucas.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Madame Chair.  We all recognize the purpose
of charter intrusion is a collaboratory process to see if it would work,
and since this will be a charter proposal that's designed to experiment
to see what gains we can get, I'm ready to offer a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I have one more, and then I'll take your motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Madame Chair. A couple of questions
specifically for Representative Jeter, and then speak on the bill.  Did
I hear you say that the intent of this program is to return the students
to the public schools?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I think the intent of it, I may have over stepped, I
think the intent is to get these children educated and get a high school
diploma.  I think the likelihood is some of these children, once they
get back on track, could return to your traditional public schools.
This is not necessarily a program to capture them into the charter
school, and keep them there.  These schools are only designed to be for
about 150 or 200 students, and there's only 2 of them, so there is
limited capacity.  So, this is not an effort to grow a charter school
system, as much as it is to capture students, get them back on track.
And my expectation is, though this is speculative on my part, is that
some of these children, if not a large percentage of them, would be
encouraged to return to the traditional public school system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]One of the criticisms of the charter school system is
that is takes children, young people, and then when the young people are
having problems in the school, Oh then send these kids back to the
public schools.  So, the charter school kind of gets the young people,
and as soon as there's problems</p>

alright the next bill before us is house bill 273 that is Hardister,
Malone, Brandon and Stam.  Its a PCS do i have a motion, representative
Bumgardner makes a motion that bill PCC be before us, all those in favor
say aye all those opposed no, the bill is properly before us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] thank you madam chair PCS for house bill 273 just has
a few provisions and I'll just go over those briefly.  It clarifies that
charter schools can borrow money for operational expenses.  It's my
underStamding that some charter schools are already doing this but its
not clarified in the laws, so this could clarify that charter schools
can borrow money for operational expenses.  This bill requires LEAs to
transfer funds to charter schools in a timely fashion, and it requires
LEAs to provide information on hows funds were calculated and to my
underStamding most LEAs are already doing this but there have been
problems and so this would clarify that LEAs have to transfer funds to
charter schools within 30 days after the LEA has received the funds and
there would be penalty charged at 8% for funds that are delinquent, and
8% because thats the legal interest thats how we came up with that
number and the bill would also repeal the restriction on transferring
supplemental tax revenue outside the tax district.  This simply allows
funds to follow the student and then there's another provision in the
bill that requires court costs to be awarded to the prevailing party in
an action to enforce the transfer of funds from and LEA to a charter and
I'm going to yield to representative Stamd to explain that part of the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] that part of the bill is on page 2 lines 28 to 32 it
is attorneys fees but its for either side, its the prevailing side it
doesn't pick one side or the other, and then normally judgements are due
immediately.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] madam chair I'm over on your right, representative
wilkes on your right
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK
[SPEAKER CHANGES] we are operating from PCS right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct
[SPEAKER CHANGES] we do not have that have it over here
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ok just a moment.  does everyone not have?  just a. .
. if you dont have one would you raise your hand so they can get them to
you. . . representative wilkes do you have. . . OK, alright
representative Stam
[SPEAKER CHANGES] yes I'm just explaining page 2 lines 28 to 32, so its
an either way attorney fee cost shifting provision it doesn't favor one
side or the other.  It does have on lines 30 to 32 in the one of the
litigations where an LEA was required to pay money the judge says OK you
got 3 years to pay it and normally you have to pay judgements
immediately but I guess you could have a case where a small LEA just
couldn't do it.  So this allows a judge but does not require a judge to
give them up to 3 years to do it as long as its in equal monthly
payments.  So that's that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] representative bale
[SPEAKER CHANGES] than you madam chair, representative Stam answered my
question for me I was ?? reciprocity
[SPEAKER CHANGES] alrighty representative Adams
[SPEAKER CHANGES] thank you madam chair this is a question.
Representative Hardister you mention that this bill would allow the
schools to borrow funds for operations?  Is that currently the, you
know, what public schools do?  They borrow funds to operate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For public schools I'm not sure, staff do you know can
you answer?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff can you answer the question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To our knowledge public schools or traditional schools
are not borrowing for operational expenses, they get an appropriation
from the state

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madame Chair, and members of the committee, House Bill
491--basically what it does--is it takes the school resource officers
and puts them under the command of the sheriff's department.  Our
sheriff currently is doing a grant process--we're currently looking to
expand the program, and what we're doing is, over the past ten years,
those funds for the SRO's--the at risk--we're going to take those funds
and let it follow the SRO's; it will just be under the sheriff's
leadership.  Keep in mind, in off-seasons, the sheriff's will be able to
use those SRO's for other programs to help out in the community.  I
think this is a great way to leverage our money and help our community
at large.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madame Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Question for the bill sponsor, please.  Is this a request from the Lee
County Schools--do they support the request since it's Lee County School
money.  It looks like it's being transferred to make sure it supports
the positions including apparently time by these officers not at the Lee
County Schools.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for your question, Representative Glazier.  This request came
from the county commissioners; a resolution sent to my office.  And yes,
the school board does oppose it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The school board opposes--May I add follow-up, please?  Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And so the school board opposes it, the Lee County Commissioner support
it; I'm assuming--well I don't want to assume--Lee County Sheriff's
position?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He would gladly take the program and expand it.  I think he's even
looking with the two grants we currently have under process at putting
more officers in the schools.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Torbett?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a motion, Madame Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do we have anyone--any other questions? Okay--in just a moment.
Representative McManus.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have a school system that has the SRO's from the sheriff's
department.  There is differing opinions on how this works best.  But,
the biggest issue we've run into is when there is a local issue and the
law enforcement officer is needed by the sheriff's department, they're
pulled from the school . That has frequently created problems for our
school system, to have them pulled on short notice and then have an
event at the school and them not be present.  We've also had issues with
lack of control over the officers that were in our schools and the
quality of those officers in our schools.  And, I believe someone is
here from Lee County school board that would like to speak to this
issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Bell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madame Chairman.  I just wanted to say the same thing that
she said.  That often whenever you have them in the school system and
something happens in the community, they are pulled away by the
sheriff's department, and leaving the schools without any kind of
protection whatsoever.  That something we have to guard against, like
[??] work very closely with your sheriff's department.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stone, would you like to--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I'd like to get a chance to respond.  Just want the committee to
understand that currently in North Carolina, 61% of the school resource
officers are operated by the sheriff's department, and currently only 5%
are by special police.  Now the good news for the sheriff's department,
when they get into the SRO position, is they're able to communicate
back, but only with the community.  Currently the SRO's and special
police answer to the police or to the superintendents.  But they're only
allowed by law for ten major crimes.  They're all major.  But with the
sheriff's offices being involved, they're able to communicate a whole
lot more; not only with the parents within the school system, but the
community at large of what's going on in our community.  You're seeing

<p id="70:00">
looking at SROs about a Sheriff’s Department, and I urge you to support
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I have Representative Whitmire and then
someone in our audience. Representative Whitmire. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair, thank you. I simply would like, if they have comments, to
hear from either the School Board Association or the School
Administrators Association, just from a subject matter expertise input,
please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will ask at the end. Does anyone else…?
Representative Lambeth. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I was just going to add, Madam
Chairman, that the Wilson and Forsyth County schools had these same
issues. What we did was we actually developed an RFP and we bid it out.
What resulted from that was the standards and expectations that we
required, and then the municipalities also bid on it and we actually
allocated those schools in the city to the police and those in the
county to the sheriff, and it’s actually worked out very well. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Is there anybody else in the committee? Representative Graham –
G. Graham. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, madam. Thank you, Madam Chairman. I
just wanted to state that when there’s a shortage of teachers or should
there be some other school problem, the first place the superintendent
is going to look is pulling those positions in, and will the grant funds
that you’re using here or that you’re proposing to use to fund the
position, will that grant always be available? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stone. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, thank you for a chance to
reply. The grant funding covers the first three years at a reduced rate
each year, and then the county takes over the other part of the new
officers. Keep in mind by putting the SROs under the Sheriff’s
Department, this will allow our School Board, our principals and
teachers to concentrate on education and a lot less dealing with issues
and troubles in the community and the schools. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If
there are no more from the committee, we have… Anyone would like to
speak? I understand we have someone here from the School Board. You are
recognized. State your name and position. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Am I on?
Thank you, Madam Chairman. I am Len Smith. I am Chairman of Lee County
Board of Education and I’m here to oppose this bill. Currently, as the
bill indicates, the school resource officers work for our schools. They
answer to the principals and to the administrative unit. We find that
that’s working quite well, and obviously school safety is a huge issue
at this point. Certainly Newtown brings to attention what a huge issue
that is potentially, and we feel that the school resource officers
employed by the school gives us the best opportunity to protect our
students. Obviously if we move them to the Sheriff’s Office, they’re
going to spend a certain amount of time outside of our schools. Perhaps
more importantly, I’m amazed that we’re standing here discussing this at
the state legislature when there’s been absolutely no conversation in
Lee County between the local government people and the School Board
and/or the administrative unit. This seems like it’s a local issue, and
to discuss it in the legislature having no discussion at home in Lee
County just amazes me, and I would ask the committee to oppose this
bill. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, and Representative Stone,
would you like to reply? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a quick comment, real
quick. This bill, I’d remind you again, did come to us in the form of a
resolution from the County Commissioners. I also want to echo one of the
other things that Chairman Smith spoke about. School safety is
important. It’s probably one of the most important things we’ll look at
as we move forward public education, and I don’t know that we can put
anyone more qualified in our schools than a sheriff’s deputy that has
not only rights for the campus, but he can actually go off campus if we
have an issue where an individual goes off campus, and I’ll give you an
example. Currently we have people direction traffic in front of our
schools that don’t even have jurisdiction in the highway out there, so
there multiple problems by not having a uniformed officer in those
classes that could help in multiple ways, and I did talk to our sheriff
about making sure that we had our officers in our school, and he said to
me that that would be his top priority, to keep those officers in the
schools. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We have another speaker in the back. Your
name and who you’re with. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Jeff Moss, Superintendent,
Lee County Schools. I think this would actually make our schools less
safe, and I’ll give you some prime examples. There is some
misperceptions. First off, the state funds SROs to us and we have our
special police for ten months. That does not allow those individuals, if
they’re employed by the Sheriff’s Department, any additional time. They
cannot work outside of the hours unless they’re not working in our
schools, so if a Sheriff’s Department decides</p>

<p id="75:00">
to use those individuals, outside of the state funding, as it currently
exists, they would have to take them out of our schools.  If an
emergency occurs, and that is the officer that is closest to the
disruption, whether it be a domestic issue or anything else, they will
be pulled out of our schools, because that's the sheriff's number one
responsibility, to provide safety and security for the entire county.
When that officer leaves, if you're in New Town or if you're any other
school, without that office around campus if I'd truly wanted to cause
harm, I could create a distraction, pull that officer away and then go
in and do whatever I wanted to do.  Right now, that could not happen,
because that licensed law enforcement officer, let me repeat that,
licensed law enforcement officer, they have the same training that a
sheriff's deputy has.  They have the same credentials.  They're carrying
a weapon.  They're on our campus, and they're in our buildings the
entire time.  They're doing our extracurricular activities, they're
doing everything for us.  So they are positioned to provide a safer
environment than anything else.  So it would not make our schools safer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  That has brought us two more, three more questions.
Represent Shephard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mrs. Chair.  I just wanna make a comment.  In our county, our
schools are using resource officers that are furnished by the county
sheriff's department.  And I don't know the situation in Lee county, but
in our county that works quite well, and those resource officers, as far
as I know are there the entirety of the school day.  They go in the
morning when the school opens, and they're there until the school closes
in the afternoon.  And some of these same resource officers are there
also to support football games and extracurricular activities and so on
and so forth.  So I can't speak for Lee county, but I can say in our
county the sheriff's department and the school system works quite well
together, and it's a very good setup in case there is an emergency,
because sometimes when incidents happen, they have to take people
downtown, and so that's already covered.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, madame chair.  I have a question for the superintendent or a
board
member.  I don't know which of the
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK.  He's available.  Which you like to ask your question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
See they're both there, maybe which, would like to respond.  Yes ma'am.
My question is, to what extent the county commissioners consult with you
before they pass this resolution.  What kind of conversation did you as
a school board or school superintendent have with the board of
commissioners.  Can you explain that process please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We've had no consultation.  We have no conversations.  There's been no
communications whatsoever between local government and the board, to my
knowledge.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And that goes as well for us, from the county manager.  We realized the
resolution was passed after it was passed.  There was no consolation
before, and there's been no discussion after they passed the resolution,
either.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, just quickly to make a statement on the bill.  Representative
Stone, I'm astounded, truly, and this is not personal, but I'm astounded
that a representative would move forward like this without any
conversation between the school board, school superintendent and the
county commissioner.  It's just astounding to me.  It's just more
meddling.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would you like to respond?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yet, I don't find it surprising, at all, representative Luebke, how you
feel.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Iler.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, madame chair.  I may be redundant with what represent
Shepherd said, but in our county, the Friday that New Town happened,
Saturday morning, the sheriff and the superintendent had already made
the decision to put a resource officer in every elementary school.  We
already had them in the high school and middle school.  We have 17
schools on ?? county, and they were talking to each other, I'm sure
Friday night.  And Saturday morning they had already made a decision,
and there's a big black car and a resource officer in front of every
elementary school, and they're still there.  And they're gonna be.  The
county commissioners fully support with appropriations, and all that's
needed to keep them there.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Speciale.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mine was already answered.  I was just kind of astounded that the school
board and a county commissioners are not talking about the safety of the
schools.

Change speaker: yes,anyone in the Baptist
Change speaker:
good morning again William minor with the school boards Association. we
have two concerns about this bill as well on the first is that this bill
is precedent-setting. this will be the firsttime that I am aware out
that this General assembly directly appropriates money from the state to
local administrative units and then requires them to make a direct
transfer to anothergovernmental entity. we believe that that is a bad
precedent to set, and that you will start to see lots of bills, not just
dealing with school resource officers coming from differentlocalities
shifting funds off in different directions to which you have given to
local school administrative units to operate their school system.
secondly, we do have concerns about thisfrom a safe</p>

<p id="85:00">
The aspect there is a fairly robust conversation going on amongst school
districts, across the state as to how to best staff their schools to
provide the safest invironment possible, and to make sure that those
officers are not only trained to the standards to be sworn law
inforcement officers, but the deal with some of the extremely unique
situations within schools. One of the areas that we have a number of
issues is dealing with children that are special needs, and that takes
very special training both of teachers and of law inforcement to be able
to deal with those types of situations where they escalate. And so we
have a lot of districts who are having this conversation, we actually
have 2 districts in the state that have special legislation creating
their own police force, which goes a little bit beyond what Lee County
is currently doing. Both Moore County and Charlotte Mecklenburg have
their own police force. A lot of districts are now talking to them about
the advantages and disadvantages of that model. We would ask that you
leave this to the Lee County Board of Education and let them make the
decision that is best for their school community, thank you. [SPEAKER

really want to make this fairly quickly. I think every couple years this
is something that you ought to ask yourself and there ought to be some
discussion about, so that's the purpose of this. My bill recommends
raising the age from 16 to 17 in North Carolina. Just so you're aware
that states all around us are changing the age and increasing the age.
All our border states have ages that are 17 or 18. There now are 35</p>
