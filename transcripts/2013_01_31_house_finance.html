[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank our ?? of ?? Mr. ??, Mr. ??, Mr. ?? and Mr.
Brandon. Thank you for being here. Members of the public, thank you for
your endurance. Members of the committee it's your responsibility to
endure. At this time we will hear house bill number 4. Representative
Howard, please come forward and explain this situation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you Mr. chairman and members of the committee.
I hope that everybody had the opportunity, like yesterday afternoon to
go over all of the information that we sent to you. So, you would have
it before you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Representative Howard, excuse me, representative ??
makes a motion for the ?? before for discussion purposes only. Any
discussion on the motion, all in favor say Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: ?? oppose motion could ?? chairman ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Again, I hope everybody had the opportunity to go
over all of the email information that we were able to send out to you
like yesterday afternoon, and the reason it was late is because we were
trying to be sure that everything in the bill was correct and implies, I
can give you the long explanation this morning or I can give you the
short explanation, we'll do it either way. The long explanation is the
13, 14th pages that you received last night, it is in your pocket.
Then I start with the shorter explanation, and then we can move out to
the long explanation if you want to go there. This bill was developed,
and I want to say a special appreciation to representative Harry Warren
and representative Edgar Starnes. We didn't go looking for trouble or
looking for a problem, but it was presented to us, and this bill is an
alternative, it's an option, and I will be the first person to tell you
it is not perfect but it is absolutely the best proposal that we could
developed after about a 14 week, 3 days a week being ?? with our staff.
The issue is fairly simple, the issue is this I did of $2.5 billion that
is currently due and payable to the Federal government, and this is not
a State ??, this is not something that our State or general Fern has to
address, but this is a ?? about all the employers in the State of North
Carolina.
The next question to ask ourselves, the consequences of this ??, and I
can tell you first hand the ?? is creating a real disadvantage with
respect to recruitment of new industries and new jobs for the people of
North Carolina, and when our economic developers, your economic
developers are trying to attract industry into North Carolina. One of
the first questions that these folks are going to ask, if we come into
North Carolina do we become a ??, and the answer to the question is,
yes. So, you can see that we are not on a even playing turf,
incidentally we are 3 steps behind all of the surrounding states.
Again, this proposal simply offers an alternative to the current
repayment plan which has a final payment date of 2019. If we do not do
anything, if we do not pass this legislation or some part of it</p>

<p id="005:00">
It will be 2019 before this debt is retired and we have a stable suiter
fund, and that suiter fund is what pays our benefits, and we can have $1
billion in our suiter fund and have the debt retired by the last quarter
of 2015, early 2016, so that's the reason we're here and the bill is
lengthy, not as lengthy as it was before the night before last because
we tried to combine a lot of the pieces but it's still a 39 page bill
and basically this is what it does, there's an employment security
reserve fund and it restricts the use of the dollars that's in that
reserve fund and it will cap the fund at $50 million or any amount of
interest paid or the amount of interest that was paid the previous year.
Now that reserve fund comes from the 20% surcharge that all employers
pay into the fund every year and thank goodness we've had that money
because if we had not had it then we would not have been able to fund
the amount of dollars that we needed to pay the interest on the debt and
we have made interest payments in the last three years. $80 million, $83
million, $77 million, it's big dollars, but we have used that fund. The
first thing this bill does is restrict that fund. That is the only
reason that we can use those dollars. We found that in the worker
training trust fund and training and employment account there were
little pots of money in the Division of Unemployment, so we are
eliminating these accounts and transferring all of the balances of all
of these accounts into the UI fund. Those dollars will be used to help
retire the debt. We also found a special employment security
administration fund that had approximately $16 million that was over at
the Division. We are appropriating $10 million of the $16 million in
that fund, and that too will be swept toward debt repayment. Nobody
really likes this bill. Everybody is coming to the table and being a
part of the solution and that includes the business community, that
includes the folks who are currently on the system and it also will
include the people who will be looking to go on the system. We changed
the suiter charges and increased the minimum and the maximum
contribution rate by .06 and we moved to a formula as opposed to a very
complicated tax table. The 20% surcharge that I just mentioned, those
dollars being put into the trust fund that pays the interest, we now
have a trigger off of the surcharge when the UI fund equals or exceeds
$1 billion and this is something that the business community, all of the
business community has been forced to pay for many, many years with no
end in sight, there was no trigger. Basically they just continued to pay
20% of the surcharge and that was tied to their suiter payment. This was
something new that we found that I'm sure that many of you are not aware
of, I certainly wasn't, but there's a special provision, it's a federal
provision</p>

And we have three groups that are not required pay ?? tax, and they have
the option to do a direct reimbursement of any claims that are filed
against them. And it includes all governmental entities. Us, the State
of North Carolina. Unfortunately when we have layoffs we're relying on
the backs of the private sector. The benefits are paid because that's
the way it should be. The folks are eligible and need the benefits. But
some 22 months later, and that's an egregious number, but some 22 months
later the State of North Carolina gets an invoice that says, &quot;You
owe X amount of dollars from the year before.&quot; Not the current year
before but one year, one year back. So that includes the State of North
Carolina, all of your cities and all your counties that do this direct
dollar for dollar repayment at some time in the future. But they have no
money in a reserve account to pay those benefits. A major change in this
bill. We are not saying that all of these entities, the State of North
Carolina, all of your cities, and all of your counties will now have an
escrow account. And they have the dollars in that account. And instead
of using a credit card, and I take this from my friend Representative
Starnes, they now will use a debit card. They have money in the bank
that these benefits will be drawn from. And they will be required to
have 1% of their taxable payroll in reserve, opposed to riding the backs
of everybody else. I told you that this is a very complicated bill. It
has a lot of pieces and a lot of parts. We actually had a pie chart that
we used to work off of, and one of the other sections that we looked at
was the benefit duration. And we reduced the maximum duration of
benefits from 13 weeks - we currently have 26 weeks. We are now
developing a sliding scale, and it's tied to the current unemployment
rate of the State of North Carolina, which is looked at twice a year. We
are reducing the duration from 13 weeks to 20 weeks, and that is based
on what our unemployment rate is. And if we could ever get to 5.5
unemployment rate or less, the range would be between 5 to 12 weeks. And
that makes sense because the folks don't need the duration if there is
full employment. We also addressed the calculation of the weekly benefit
amount. Currently it is a rather complicated process, but we changed it
to be based on the average of the last two quarters worked, rather than
the highest quarter. The maximum weekly benefit - and that's something
that has been discussed out in the community and seems to be a real
issue with a lot of folks - but I ask you. If you do not have the chart
before you, this information has been available since last November.
That the State of North Carolina is the highest benefit state in the
Southeast. We are well outside the bell curve. To give you an example,
the maximum weekly benefit amount in Alabama is $265. Florida, $275.
Georgia, $330.</p>

“Kentucky, 415... North Carolina, 525... and that is indexed, meaning
that changes every year.  South Carolina is 326, Tennessee, 275...
Virginia, 378.  There was nothing magic, about how we came up with this…
350.  Take that column of numbers and divide and you’re going to find an
average… and that’s how we came up with the number of 350 dollars.  Some
of the other changes that we made… the partial weekly benefit… we have a
disregard… 20 percent of the weekly benefit amount rather than 10...
another change, is the waiting week… this plan will now require a
waiting week for all new claims… and we removed all the wavers regarding
that waiting week. The extended base… we are repealing that section.
The extended benefit trigger… we removed those triggers and it simply
reads that we will accept extended benefits if it is 100 percent
federally funded… it’s another little term that I certainly wasn’t
familiar with, but many of you may be… it’s called attached claims… and
we found that probably 50 to 60 percent of the debt that we owe stems
from attached claims… and this is when an employer wants to keep his
chief cook and bottom washer, but perhaps it’s not the best of the
season, so employer says to employee: “I will file an attached claim for
you”…  and that means that, that employer, does not have to be compliant
to look for job to meet all the other requirements, because he is
somewhat attached to that employer.  There is a promise that, that
person will come back to gainful employment within possibly 6 weeks…
that can be extended to 12 weeks, 18 weeks, or 24... so that person, is
receiving benefits through the fund, and still tied, to that employer.
We made a provision for attached claims… that employer must have a
positive credit balance and must reimburse the fund, for those number of
weeks, that those benefits are expended.  It will be limited to one time
per employee, for not more than 6 weeks. There’s problems… everybody is
a part of this problem… with all due respect, I say that the business
community can no longer use the unemployment fund as a business model…
that will not happen any longer in this bill.  There’s the issue of
disqualification… they’re very subjective currently, but now that is
going to be based on each application for UI… you are qualified or
disqualified.  We are removing substantial fault, and most of the good
cause provisions. They have continued to increase over time.  We are
retaining the domestic violence and spousal relocation due to military
reassignment.”</p>

other than that, we are eliminating substantial fault and eliminating
most of the other good cause provisions unless they were federally
required.  We have a clear definition now to define suitable work and
that definition is suitable work is any work after 10 weeks of UI
benefits. That is the short version of the bill and now if it is your
prerogative, I'm going to ask staff to go through the long explanation
because I know they can do it more succinct than I can do and we will go
through the long explanation of the bill, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Howard.  Before Ms. Averitt speaks on the
bill, I would like to tell the committee and the public that we are
going to vote on this bill and we will vote on this bill at 11:30 so
barring amendments we can take up and committee discussion, at 11:30 we
will take a vote.  Just for information purposes for all that can hear
this committee meeting.  Ms. Averitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I will be happy to answer questions and offer more
explanation on any part that a member has a question about but I feel
that Representative Howard's summary was, I don't have anything to add
at this point to her summary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  Representative Warren.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would like to thank Representative Howard
and Representative Starnes, and Ms. Averitt, Mr. Bizell and the rest of
the staff for the fine work they did on this and for the opportunity to
have worked on this bill.  Ladies and Gentleman, the bill addresses a
problem that actually some folks try to assign back to the 90's at which
point the General Assembly relaxed the pseudo tax on businesses in the
state and some people tried to put this debt on the business community.
I'd like to point out that a lot of people who are in business today
weren't in business back then.  This is an existing problem that I
believe really is here because of our failure to respond to recessions
appropriately in 2001 and again in 2007.  When our surplus fund was
being depleted, we took no action, the General Assembly at that time,
took no action to put the taxation program back into effect and to
address it properly then.  Had that happened, we wouldn't be in this
situation today, but where we are is in a position that puts us as a
state, non-competitive, not only with the southern states but nationally
as well for companies who either want to start up, expand or relocate to
North Carolina.  In essence, this is going to cost us jobs, particularly
if we don't act because to let the business community carry the full
weight of this, we will not be able to alleviate this debt until 2019
and we cannot wait until 2019 to attract business, to create jobs and
for our business community to be able to function more profitably.  This
is something we have to address today and it's not an easy solution.  I
think we all recognize that and it may not be a popular solution but we
all came here to do the right thing and address the problems before the
state.  I believe this bill is one of the best bills that I have seen in
the 3 years now that I have been here.  I encourage you to look at it
objectively and to evaluate it in the right light and I, at the proper
time, Mr. Chair, would like to make a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
State your motion, for the record.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would like to make a motion that the bill be given a favorable report
and sent to the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Unfavorable to the original bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.  Favorable to the committee substitute.  You know the drill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You got it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you don't mind, give it in full form.  We have a lot of freshman here
so they can hear it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure.  I would like to give a favorable report to the original bill,
unfavorable to the PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Backwards.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The other way around, excuse me. Let's try it again.  I'd like to give a
favorable report to the PCS, unfavorable to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  We will hold that motion.  We'll hold that motion for the
time being.  Any further discussion from members of the committee? If
not we will go into amendments.  Representative Hall?  Representative
Hall.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay and this is discussion, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just wanted to make sure we got a good history of this and I will come
back to questions for staff. Representative Warren referenced</p>

<p id="025:00">
[speaker]
and briefly that we werent in this situation when we had a reserve fund,
and that we did reduce in part to lower the burden on business
i also want to make sure we recognize that businesses do not pay into
these taxes if the do have employees, so it is considered as part of the
labor cost ,that they do and they very intelligent , have well paid
accountants and business planers etc.
so we dont think that this is somehow, funds that are given to the
genral public and not considered in the business plans of those folks
who operate in our state
so again i want to emphasize  business cost has been paid all along by
the employees, who have their overall compensation, reduced as far as
take home pay   because of the business model the businesses use when
considering their labor cost,
so i just want to make sure we do have a fair discussion of what our
problem is, i also want to make sure we understand where we currently
sit
all states as representative Howard said, are facing this problem , all
states deal with it differently, some of the numbers, index numbers that
representative Howard talked about, are in favor of North Carolina
regarding the amounts of compensation and weeks , some of the number
differ, but one of the things we do have to recognize ,
we going to have to have some balance and responsibility in this, is
North Carolina with this and other factors considered ,
continues to be for about 12 years in a row, the best place or one of
the top ten, 5, or 2 best places to do business in America,
so alot of things go into that calculation , i want to make sure we have
a clear discussion of this so we understand where we come out, lowest
state and local tax burden on business in 2011 according to the council
on state taxation.
the best state for business number 2 in 2011 according to chief excutive
magazine, the number 2 most favorable business climate in 2011 according
to the developments council international, the number three best
business climate in 2011 according to site selection magazine , the best
state for business number 3 according to ford in 2011, America's top
state for business number 3 in 2011, number 7 as far as the top state
for doing business  according to area develeopment magazine, number 13
for doing business according to technology and science capabillities,
??? to go along with what im saying is with this issue and this problem
, we might want to take more then an hour and a half to discuss it, and
we have ben able to function , although not as well as everbody else but
certainly competively
and we need to have a ballased approach , so i do want to make sure we
understand, employees have ben paying into this all along , some people
think that its only something that business does without considering
their labor cost
and that we do need to have a comprehensive  solution to this problem ,
and we may need to take more than an hour and a half to discuss it and
come out with something thats fair, fair for everybody
[speaker changes]
mr. chairmen, mr. chairmen, would representative Hall yield for a
question , representative Holl
[speaker changes]
representative Hall
[speaker changes]
be glad to yield
[Speaker changes to representative Hall (there are two listed with last
name)]
i think the reprenstative you have stated that these contributions paid
by the
employers are actually part of the compensation paid to the employees,
that they will be recieving more money if this was not paid into the
state
using that logic would you accept that if we increase the contribution
required of the employers that to hold their labor costs constant they
should be able to recover this increase duction from the employees,
[speaker changes]
well no i wouldnt say that what i would say is that the employers,
whatever we do , the solution we come up with, employers are going to
continue to just their business models and decide what their profit
margins need to be for them to stay in business , we are going to
continue to do things to make it possible for them to  do business in
this state , including incentives of both state, local, county and city,
that we do to do that
and we're going to continue to maintain infrastructure in this state,and
do publice private partnerships with  universities and all the other
things we do to go into their business model to decide
so again its a partnership among many different factors this not being
the only one that imsure they take into consideration, i dont think we
could narrow it to that solution</p>

Follow-up, would the gentlemen yield for a second question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, I don’t want to yield to too many questions because I know we
have some amendments that need to be done and again we only have an hour
and a half to do this so I prefer if it’s not germane to the deal that
we discuss it afterwards.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ll tell you what, I’ll accept that. I realize that you would like the
opportunity to present some amendments so we’ll discuss this on the
floor. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Very well, Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It’s hard to know where to start on a bill. The
public should first of all know the public concerned about this or just
interested in this should know we received a copy of today’s bill thirty
minutes ago. It’s also true that we’re going to be voting in an hour and
a half. These are the most significant changes to unemployment benefits
in decades, maybe ever in the history of the unemployment system in
North Carolina. Representative Howard’s presentation was not balanced.
She did a good job but she represented the perspective, she did not
represent the perspective of the unemployed who are losing benefits
substantially under this bill. There were other things that weren’t
mentioned, for example, North Carolina in fact has an average benefit of
288 which is exactly in the middle of the 50 states. The assertion was
made that we are so different from other states in the South East, the
fact of the matter is Virginia and North Carolina are within $3 of one
another. North Carolina has a 288, Virginia has 288 dollar average
benefit and North Carolina has a 291. So it is just simply misleading to
suggest that we are out of sync with everybody around us. The other
thing that has not been talked about is what is the impact on a low
income family where a worker is laid off? What is the impact on a middle
income family where the employee is laid off? One third of the people
here make more than $37,000 who are affected by this bill and their
benefits will go down and I want to ask first of all if I might, Mr.
Chairman, a question of staff. Can’t staff tell us, first of all if this
bill had been in place, how many workers in North Carolina last fiscal
year during the recession, great recession, would have had their
benefits reduced?   And Mr. Bizzell, maybe Rodney Bizzell address that.
How many thousands of workers would have had their benefits reduced?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Bizzell
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, as part of the information that we provided in the packet
we looked at the number of the claimants during the great recession who
would have been impacted by the impact of the reduction in the maximum
weekly benefit and that number was 132,000 over the course of the
recession.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, a follow-up question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Bizzell can you tell us the cost to the benefit loss, the millions
of dollars lost by the unemployed in North Carolina beginning July 1st
if this bill becomes law and it seems to be on a fast track to become
law so what is the impact in terms of millions of dollars lost to the
unemployed and their families?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m not sure I understand the question. Was that in regard to the
federal benefits?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir what I mean is we’ve got current law right now that sets out a
certain amount of benefits. We have a proposed law that’s going to
reduce the benefits to the employees of the state. These are employees
who are Republican, employees who are Democrats, who have been laid off
from work and my question is with this bill coming into effect how much
will that reduce, in millions of dollars, the amount of dollars
available to those unemployed workers? Or putting it another way, how
many millions of dollars are not there for those unemployed workers to
put back into our consumer economy? We will be losing millions and
millions of dollars because those who are unemployed spend virtually
100% of the compensation they receive.</p>

<p id="035:00">
they spend it in the economy. So my question Mr. Bissel is, what's the
cost to the employees? What's the reduction in terms of available
millions of dollars with this bill as opposed to the current law?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. chairman, I think we have an estimate for that.
The first six months... we estimate that it's about 225 million.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. So that means that we, we need to hear and
understand we're taking 225 million dollars out of the pockets of the
unemployed in this state. Remember, contrary to what Representative
Howard has said, this problem was not caused by the unemployed. It was
caused by the business community which six times between 1992 and 2000,
six times asked to have the unemployment tax reduced. And never after
that during the years 2000 to 2008 did the business community come to
the general assembly and say please raise the tax just in case. No sir,
no ma'am. All they wanted was the tax to go down. That is what's causing
the shortfall. And to take it out on the unemployed of North Carolina is
just to me is totally unacceptable. It.s reprehensible to do that. And I
ask you, any of you who say we're going to support this bill, if you can
really go home to the unemployed in your district and say &quot;I'm
really sorry I had to reduce your benefits but I did&quot;? You didn't
have to do that, there's a chance to have a balanced bill that may have
a ?? that may have a small reduction on benefits and a higher tax on
employers to make it more balanced. Right now we have a one-sided bill
with a huge hit, 200 million dollars in six months, so that's 400
million dollars in a fiscal year that people are not bringing home.  My
second question Mr. Chairman for the staff along, along these lines is:
What is the total amount of higher taxes that the staff estimates total
that employers will pay additional, compared to what they're paying now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] They'll be with you shortly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, if we look at the period at which the
debt would be paid off which would be 2015, employers would have paid an
additional 20 million in ?? taxes and 800 million in ?? tax increases.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But, Mr. Bissell,  what we're talking about here ??
... follow up. Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Of course.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The key figure here is 20 million dollars, because...
we're... our bill is about the state taxation. It's 20 million dollars
for employers, 200 million dollars for employees. That is simply wrong.
And I don't see how anyone can vote for a bill that has a 20 million
dollar hit on employers, and a 20 million dollar hit on unemployed
employees. Just seems to me that is so wrong. Twenty million versus
two-hundred million. It's been asserted that the employers are paying
their fair share... employees are paying their fair share, the
unemployed are paying their fair share. First of all, the unemployed had
nothing to do with this, but, second of all, that clearly is not true.
According to staff, not my numbers, staff's numbers, 20 million dollars
hit for employers, 200 million dollar hit for the unemployed workers and
employees of the state. Now, Mr. Chairman, if I might at this point
offer an amendment to this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If you don't mind, I have several people that have
questions and we'll come back to the amendment. Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I might ask Representative Luebke a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke, you said that the employers
came and asked you for these tax reductions. I know you were here during
that time. Could you tell me which employers asked you for those
reductions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well the... I can tell you that small business and big
business went to the leadership of the democratic party..</p>

and I think the democratic party needs to take responsibility for having
done that, for having listened to the business lobby there. I think we
should have all stood up more. I would have to tell you I was not in
favor of those kinds of cuts for the reasons that I feared but I was out
voted by my democratic colleagues and so the mistake was made by, I'll
own up to it, from a political party perspective, the democrat party did
it but the source of the request came from the business community
representative, representative Brawley. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke. I was chair of the finance committee during that
time and no business ever came to me and asked for a reduction.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you representative Dollar. Representative Alexander.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Temporary. What the change is to our unemployment compensation system
become permanent and if we were really going to deal with this and say
that the cuts in the past were excessive then we should have permanent
increases in what we put away for a rainy day and this should be
balanced on both sides but I think it is extraordinarily
disproportionately unbalanced for working families in North Carolina and
I want to talk a little bit about cutting the amount of the weekly
compensation down to three hundred and fifty dollars. As representative
Luebke said, a average payout is consistent with what goes on in other
states and some of our surrounding states so we do have some people who
get more than in other states but if you average overall our unemployed
it's consistent with surrounding states but five hundred and thirty
dollars for a middle class family is not going to sustain them when we
have a recession like the recession that we had. And let me tell you
what it's going to do to the economy. People who make between thirty
seven and fifty, sixty thousand dollars have mortgages in general. They
are usually people who have been in the work force for a longer period
of time and maybe in their fifties or in their sixties. They may have
children in college or in community college and so these are people who
are going to have more difficulty going back into the work force. We've
seen statistics after statistics that if you're over the age of forty
five it's much more difficult to get another job because of who you're
competing with and there are about three people competing for every one
job that is available so by cutting that higher rate we're basically
telling people who are between the ages of forty five and sixty, well
sorry you're not going to be able to pay your COBRA anymore. Sorry,
you're kid is not going to be able to go to college anymore. sorry. You
may go into foreclosure. All of those things not only affect those
families but they affect our economy and to say that making sure that we
sunset these minimal increases is more important to our economy than
thinking about those families I think is highly misleading and
heartless. I'll have my amendment after my colleagues have done theirs
because like I said if under a miracle one of their amendments passes,
I'll have to make an amendment to mine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes maam. Thank you. Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think we're focusing somewhat on the wrong thing here. The title of
the bill , I think, points out an obvious emphasis change that we need
to make here in North Carolina. We need to emphasize putting unemployed
people back to work rather than compensating people for being
unemployed. I think that's what a lot of this bill is all about. I know
there's been a lot of changes in my lifetime but one of the changes that
I've noticed has been that many times now  when people lose a job, and
I'm not saying every time, but in a lot of cases it has become customary
and I know people have told me this that and they've told employers this
and employers have repeated this back to me that people now begin to
look for a job when their unemployment is getting ready to run out
rather than when they lose the initial job. I think we will more than
make up for the losses to the economy that has been mentioned before by
employers- by employees getting back to work. I think this will help
them get to work. It will make our state more competetive for drawing
businesses in like we say we shouldn't expect new businesses to pay old
debts and</p>

<p id="045:00">
Putting, putting claimants back to work should be our major emphasis.
Helping those people get back to work should be our major emphasis. I
consistently hear employers tell me - and have since I ran for office in
2010 - that the biggest competition they have for getting employees, for
hiring people that they want to hire, is not other competitors in their
business but is the unemployment check. I had an employer who - if I
told you his name you'd see his equipment all over this area as well as
a lot of our state - was trying to hire forklift operaters in 2010 at
the height of the recession at $14 an hour. Didn't have to have any
education, didn't have to have any skills they train them on the job.
That's $560 a week. He said he couldn't hire anyone because they were
telling him they could make $500 a week on unemployment, why would they
work 40 hours a week for $60? So that maximum benefit is a problem
getting people back to work. Same year I talked to one of our
pharmaceutical manufacturers in our home town and, while they were
making a presentation to us, they told me they had immediate openings
for 200 people. And I stopped them immediately and I said, &quot;What
are we walking about? Are we talking about chemists here?&quot; They
said, &quot;No, we're talking about factory line employees with a high
school education.&quot; So, our employment compensation program has
built a lot of problems. And one of the problems it's built has been a
disensentive to get people back to work. I don't know why people in
North Carolina should be paid 50% more than every state surrounding us
for the same thing. For being unemployed. It doesn't make any sense,
unless we're saying everybody in the country's heartless and nobody can
survive anywhere in the Southeast besides in North Carolina, I think
we're living in a fantasy world. I think our emphasis out to be helping
people get back to work. I think that's we ought to task our employment
security commission for doing. There's a lot of things that go along
with drawing your own paycheck rather than drawing unemployment. A lot
of advantages to that pride-wise, psychological-wise. I think people
feel better about themselves when they're earning a paycheck, and
anything we can do to help them do that we ought to be doing that. I'd
like to ask one question too. What kind of wage does somebody have to be
currently making now in order to have an unemployment benefit greater
than the $350 max we're talking about?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister Chair? Mister Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Warren?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I could respond to that. In order to make the
maximum benefit of $535 a week in North Carolina, the claimant has to
have made about $55,000-- just a little in excess of $55,000 a year.
Currently in North Carolina, the average income's about $46,000 a year.
And if I could at this time just address a couple other points that were
made? First of all, as far as the length of time to review this bill,
this bill went public - it was rolled out in revenues - on December 5th.
And it's been online since then. There's been plenty of time for all of
us who knew we were going to be elected to review that. It was a public
event. So the bill has been available for quite some time. Additionally,
for the look at hypothetical cases and ask questions like, &quot;What
if?&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Warren. Do it rather in just a sec,
because Representative Collins still had the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are you finished, Representative Collins?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He answered the question that I had.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And I've got Chairperson Brawley and then I will take
your Representative [crosstalk].
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm always thought of as a
warm and kind and considerate gentlemen. And being called heartless and
mean spirited kinda bothers me a little bit. But, you know that cuts
both ways. These people on unemployment would be much better benefited
if they had jobs and opportunity. And when those calling me heartless
are constantly attacking success, constantly attacking achievement,
constantly attacking anything that says, &quot;I'm able to accomplish
something,&quot; and at the same time encouraging more and more benefit
payments. Every time you turn around, billings putting a state, a
federal government into such debt our children and future generations
are going to be in trouble. I don't feel mean spirited. I think I'm
making good common sense. I'm trying to provide jobs. And I think you
should be too.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blust.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just wanna respond to a couple things that
Representative Luebke raised, and there's-- I anticipated a lot of of
demagoguery over this bill and more to come. And already-- and I'm
troubled by the bill too. I don't like doing this. And we can get in an
argument over who caused the problem, how long it's been out here. But
it's been dumped on this general assembly. And it's incumbent upon us
to.</p>

<p id="050:00">
Fix it and it has been anticipated long time, one of the false heards
that Rep Lucas is trying to create  is this first of all is a rushed
job. And we only can get to look at the bill that this is bad and you
are just rushing through. And I can personally attest having been on
revenue loss study commission. This has been around a long time. I
believe last session we even passed a bill to hire expertise to help us
grapple with what is the best way to deal with the horrible problem that
has developed. It’s going to harm the business community, harm future
employees in the state. This has been vetted a long time all kinds of
people with concerns came before revenue loss study commission. The idea
that you couldn’t get this version of the bill to half hour before this
meeting is just not true. This thing a bill gets filed. Now we have a
computerized system in the general assembly. This bill got filed and you
could get it on the internet. I ran off a copy yesterday afternoon of
this version of the bill .They were hours to go last night to study the
new provisions of it . So it was just not accurate to make this a rushed
job. The other thing it’s got to be remembered and pointed out again and
again, the benefit reduction in this bill of prospective is for new
unemployed started I believe July 1st. So no one currently on the
program is going to have the benefits cut. That really isn’t pleasant to
do. But unemployment was never intended to replace a job. I don’ think
anybody most people with jobs are having a hard time  meeting their
mortgage and their cobrids of different payments. So that’s got to be
kept in mind. So it isn’t a pleasant thing. But it’s the best solution I
have seen that’s been actually proposed. But some people want to bond it
this indebtedness. But someone used to in charge of the general assembly
matched out our state credit cards.  So we are trying to do the best we
can under the circumstances and I think this is a reasonable approach
and I think we are just going to have to one by one calmly parry back on
some of the false charges that are going to be out there against this
bill.
[Speaker Changes] Rep Alexander and then Warren and then amendments
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr.Chair. May be I have with the wrong
[inaudible] in doing  these numbers, I figured out I  seem to have  a
lot of constituents. These annual income seem to be between 25,000 and
37000 , which means they are not making $55,640 which would enable them
to get the maximum benefits under our existing system. However we
drilled down in to the numbers. We find out how existing theory is that
unemployment compensation is going to be targeted at 56 and two-thirds
of the average weekly insured wage under the existing system. Assuming
its two thirds, if you assume that it takes 100% to meet somebody’s
obligation, we already have them at least a third down in terms of what
they need to do whatever it is. Whether it’s [inaudible] whether it’s a
mortgage whether it’s a card payment whether it’s food. So the whole
stretch of imagination is our existing system overly generous. I think
to characterize it as being overly generous and to make it seem as if
people are lined up at the borders to come over the Appalachian
mountains to come down the Chandon valley to swim up the Catawba river
in order to get unemployment benefits here in the utopia of North
Carolina, somebody is smoking my medical campus bill. We are not
presiding over.</p>

politicize the bill. this is not a time to think about hypothetical. If
we want to get down that road we could talk about hypothetically what
would have been the impact, where would we be today had the General
Assembly in 2002 or 2007 reacted to the fact that that the reserve fund
was dwindling, we wouldn't be in this situation today but it's not a
time to look back. It's a time to look forward and to evaluate this bill
in all honesty. To Representative Alexander's point, a claimants benefit
is based on their individual earnings. The media and some of us in this
room are focused on the maximum and that's the wrong road to look at in
evaluating this bill. So I would just encourage, again, everybody to
please understand that we are in a little different situation. It's not
every state in the union that is in this predicament. There's only about
30 that owe the government monies that were automatically funneled down.
There's only two that owe more than we do and they out-populate us by
about three and four times, New York, California. We have 9.3/9.6
million people in this state and we owe the third highest amount of
money to the federal government. As far as how this is going to effect
people today also take into consideration how it's going to impact
people if we have to pay this back, take until 2019 to pay this back,
and employers don't come to the state, don't expand in the state, don't
replace employees that they lose through attrition, or decide to hire
one less employee so they can afford the increasing food tax. We have to
look at this objectively. We can't get sidetracked by looking at
individual cases of an individual claimant. We have to consider
everything across the board. So again, I ask you please, let's keep this
non-partisan, let's keep it objective, let's get it passed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, at this time we'll take up the Luebke Amendment.
Representative Luebke, please explain your amendment to the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, if any of you have had a chance
to get through the bill you'll know that on page 21, toward the bottom,
the bill makes a major change in our policy in terms of how many weeks
an unemployed person can receive benefits. 43 states pay out 26 weeks as
do we under current law. Under this proposal, the maximum number of
weeks an employee could have, receive the benefits, is 20 weeks. In
doing so, moving it down from 26 weeks to 20 weeks, puts us below
Alabama and Mississippi. We have a harsher law proposed than Alabama and
Mississippi and it's important also to remember that if you take these
$291, which is our average benefit, not to talk about the $500 and
change, if we take that and multiply that by the six months that 26
weeks represents, that's about $7,500. And these numbers are based on
what Ms. [??] had put in the staff report. So you're talking about
$7,500 is under current law and you want to cut that from 26 weeks down
to 20 weeks. In other words you want to make a 30% cut in the number of
weeks that employees can get compensation. The unemployed were not part,
were not at the table when this bill was developed. Do not let anyone
tell you otherwise. The unemployed were not here. The unemployed would
never have said, &quot;Oh sure, it's fine to cut our benefits from 26
weeks to 20 weeks.&quot; And those who are saying, &quot;Gosh, it's good
for our unemployed in my district to have to have fewer benefits.&quot;
Look them in the face and tell them that. I don't believe you will find
that they'll be very happy when they find out you've cut their benefit
weeks from 26 to 20. So, Mr. Chairman, I want to move forward, for that
reason, an amendment that restores the 26 weeks, puts us back with 43
other states and virtually every other southern state including Alabama
and Mississippi. We need to do better than those two states. So that's
my amendment. I move it to option.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Luebke. Representative Warren?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And Mr Chairman, may I first, I'd like the aye's and no's on this
amendment please, so people are, for the freshmen that means you're on
the record. Anyone in the public can see how you voted on this question,
to cut the number of weeks of benefits. Thank you.

And that is a procedural move that has been here since time in memorium.
You can look at all of the votes</p>

<p id="070:00">
Thank you Mr. Chair.  I have copies of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Sergeant Barns if you will pass them out thank you.
While its being passed out let me just explain a very simple amendment
which would  maintain the formula and the procedure in existing law to
establish what our maximum benefit is.  Currently we do this annually
around I believe its August the first, somewhere along in there.  It
would just maintain doing exactly that.  I believe that if we did that
we would not be physically way out of balance because it doesn't propose
changing any of the other moving parts.
Alright Mr. Chairman I would also like to ask for the [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes sir.  Representative Howard
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I think this takes us exactly back to where we were
with Dr.[??].  Again if this is going into effect when the bill is
effective July one, again this puts us out of the balance and takes us
right back where we are right now, representative Alexander with the
same calculation.  So I would just ask folks to vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If you would like to re-draft it and re-submit it on
the floor, I'd like to pull this amendment as well.  If it pulls the
bill out of balance we're not going to hear it.
But Mr. Chairman
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
I'd like to dispute the notion that its going to pull the bill out of
balance because remember that the formula is a sliding scale.  Nothing
else changes, all of the taxation adjustments the [??]duration
adjustments; all of that remains the same.  So it seems to me that...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Chairman the point of order is  so the debate on a
ruling is not in order unless there is an appeal from the Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Stam.  This amendment is
withdrawn.  The third amendment is the Tine amendment, and if I
pronounced your name wrong,  forgive me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No that's it.  Thank you very much. Yep nothing fancy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I try to practice.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You should have that amendment before we go on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To the revenue laws and oversight committee; I want to
thank you for all your work and apologize for coming so late to the
game.  Obviously you've had a lot of consideration on this and I would
have preferred to bring this type of proposal earlier, but I appreciate
you hearing it now.
As a business owner and someone heavily involved in economic development
in the past; I do take this problem very seriously and agree with your
assessment that we need to clean this up as quickly as possible and keep
to the timeline that you've set out in your proposal.  So therefore I am
offering a compromise amendment that would do two things.  But in my
work with the staff I ask that they keep the same timeline so it would
still pay back the debt at the same time  and build the same reserves
and things like that.  So Ms. [??] staff was very helpful in that.
So it would change two things.  One it would reduce the max payout to
four hundred and twenty-five dollars, and in order to offset that it
would take the pseudo from the proposed six one hundredths increase to
twenty-nine one hundredths increase;  and that way it keeps the same
timeline and it tries to lessen the impact on some of the unemployed
while also... and as a business owner I know that I'm one of the ones
that would be paying this increase, but increase the hurt a little bit
on the businesses on it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And I sincerely....</p>

yes.  We now have the Ross amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank your Mr. Chairman.  And had Representative Tines
amendment passed, I would have had to amend my amendment, so what this
amendment does, is it establishes what the weekly benefit amount is, but
it retains the $350 cap that is already in Representative Howard's bill.
 And to explain this, under our current UI system, we base the weekly
benefit amount based on the highest weekly benefit that the employee had
in the quarter.  What this does is the bill takes it to whatever the
weekly benefit was the time the person was let go, which may be a lower
weekly benefit.  This amendment takes the 2 highest benefit quarters, so
it's still will be averaging that out will be lower to what current law
is.  It basically takes us back to where the law was in North Carolin,
20 years ago in 1993.  so this amendment goes back to North Carolin law
in 1993 for how to calculate the weekly benefit.  Again, weekly benefit
can't go  over $350, which is what Representative Howard has.  It's also
consistent with how a majority of states address the weekly benefit
amount is.  So this is basically calculating what the weekly benefit
will be between $0 and $350.  And so it's to give people just a little
bit more based on their work history during this short period of time
when they'll recover.  And I respectfully move its adoption.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I like to ask a question on either Representative Ross,
or staff, or whoever can answer this question.  I understand 2 highest
quarters, but what is the individual's base period?  2 quarters out of
how many quarters or years, or whatever we're looking back?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Chairman, I would prefer that Ms. Averette answer
that question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Alright, thank you.  Representative Collins, if you
resubmit that question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes.  I was just wondering how the base period is
defined.  2 quarters out of how many previous quarters?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]It's 15 months, so it's 5 quarters.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]A technical question.  I'm looking on page 19, line 48,
and it doesn't look like that's where it's supposed to go.  Can you give
us further accomplice?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I apologize, the line number is incorrect. I believe
it's the page numbers, it should be page 20, line 48, through page 21,
line 2.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.  Mr. Chairman, can we add that technical
amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Are there any objections to adding a technical
amendment to this bill?  Without reprinting it, I hope not.  Surely, any
objections?  Hearing none, it's done.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Any further discussion?  Representative Howard?

this is going to play into the total fees.  I do read</p>

to do is say, employees have come to the state beach and will come to

Term unemployed persons in North Carolina, and that's the second
amendment I , we were talking about offering and just, in the, in the
rush of things didn't get offered. But there are two points that I think
represent the unfairness of this bill to the unemployed of the state.
And members of the committee, I  hope you will all vote no on this bill
because of the fundamental unfairness and the process. I would say
besides the, I'm really, having chaired the committee for 12 years, the
kind of point that my friend Representative Moore put there to keep this
amendments from being voted on seemed extraordinarily unfair. Let us
speak to that as committee members. It really should have happened, and
we shouldn't have had that push, because it did not allow us to have a
full debate on the issues. So for both reasons, members, both for
reasons of process but also because of the fundamental unfairness and
lack of balance to this bill, I urge you to vote no on the bill. And
mister chairman, I request the ayes and nos.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely. Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It never ceases to amaze me whether on the House floor or in committee
doing work how many self-contradictory statements I hear and just
flights of illogic and so forth and today, the thing we're playing
around with is how we're hurting employees rather than employers. On one
hand, we hear that  businesses figure the cost of the unemployment tax
they're paying into their employment package, and therefore as long as
we've got this issue out there, employees are paying it. Now I just
heard that when we get this situation taken care of and the business
owners no longer has this extra tax to pay that somehow or other the
employees are still gonna be the ones to continue to pay, even though
we've made the cost lower on employers for their employment package. So
to me, it doesn't make any sense. The truth of the matter is, by solving
this problem which this bill does, we're gonna help employers and
employees both by helping employment in North Carolina which again is
the purpose of this bill and what we need to be focusing on. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. At this time, for the purpose of public comment,
Representative Luebke mentioned two groups that would like we speak. We
will allow each group two minutes. The AFLCIO, budget and tax center,
and if time will permit, anyone else, but we will vote on this bill at
11:30. Please. And please state you name for the record so we can have
it for the minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chair, members of the committee. I'm Bill Rowe with the
North Carolina Justice Center. I appreciate getting two minutes. That's
one minute more than we got when we were talking at the revenue laws so
we do appreciate the extra time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's our pleasure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This bill does need more discussion. This is a good start. You all are
dealing with really hard issues and really difficult ones and there's no
reason to have to rush it through today. Many of you have been around a
lot longer. Some of you are very new, but a bill of this magnitude could
take a week or two. People back home could talk to you about it. I know
your business interests are talking to you about it because they're all
around the room in here. But you might even go back home and talk to
some unemployed folks who would want to weigh in on this, and that would
be a great opportunity to let this bill sit for a week or so in
committee to hear back from folks. Also to bring everybody to the table.
You've worked with many hard issues over the years. Worker's comp being
one, where all the interests stood in the room together and tried to
hash something out. And we're not doing it on this bill here. I do agree
that, with Representative Blust on probably more things than he may
think but facts are important. Facts are really important. And I think
you really need to look hard at this bill and when you say that it's
balanced I want to clear up one thing that I think Representative Luebke
made a point but to understand the 20 million dollars that is a hit for
employers on this bill is for the whole period until 2016 when the debt
is paid off. If you look at, there's a little one page here that you've
gotten that lists the cumulative fiscal impact on the individual UI
changes and if you look at the pieces, the three major pieces, we didn't
even get into, we're not even scratching the surface on all of the other
pieces of this bill that are going to hurt people. But if you look at
those three major changes, we're talking about billions of dollars.
Billions of dollars. So to say it's balanced when we have 20 million
dollars for the cumulative period for employers, and we could even
include the few to tax credit. The few to tax piece in there. It's not
balanced. Employees will be paying more than 70% of this debt in reduced
benefits. We will make changes that some states have never thought about
before in this bill</p>

and we make them permanent. All under the guise that we have to solve
this problem: the problem of paying off the federal government. The
problem is when the federal government gets paid off and the fund is
back in order, these cuts remain permanent and we've really dismantled
an unemployment insurance system that was by all measures in the middle
of the pact for the rest of the country. Really ask for you all to slow
down. There's a lot to be talked about here. Passing this bill in the
middle or end of February wouldn't be the end of the world. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Yes, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My name is Mike Hocken, I'm here today on behalf of
the North Carolina State--
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? Mike. I can't hear--
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You may have to hold the button down, Mr. Hocken.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry. All I'm saying is we want the system to
work. And for 30 years, as the people and the employment security
division of the department of commerce would know, we've been involved
in the conversation of how to try to make it work. We haven't always,
often rarely or listened to. For example we opposed the tax cuts in the
90s. But we were involved because we have a perspective about what it
does. And this is the first time that I can remember that we haven't
been involved in the discussion at all. I just want to re-iterate what
it does to people. When you lose your job, especially you're the support
of your family and you've been working a long time, it's traumatic.
Putting aside the money, it's traumatic. What about my family? What are
my friends going to say? What am I going to say in church? Out of this
amount you get you've got to pay your car payment, your mortgage. That
right there will take care of most of it. Your health care, your
medicine, your food for your children. And these are people that did
nothing wrong. They're out of work through no fault of their own. And I
do want to address one thing, is that the question about whether people
are not working because they'd rather get an unemployment check. I can't
say that that never happens, but we have good workers in this state. And
I hope that we're not trying to send the message that we don't. People
want to work. Indeed, when our county was found in the 90s, we had
either the first or second every year, rate of quick return to work. Our
people were going back to work more quickly than any other state when
they lost their job, and the benefit levels were proportionally the
same. People want to work. They're just stuck in the situation where
there are no jobs or not enough jobs. And so I would just echo Bill that
I think that we are solving this problem disproportionally on the backs
of workers and unemployed people who didn't do anything wrong. And it
wouldn't hurt to slow down and hear from everybody about suggestions
about how things might be fixed. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. At this time, we have the motion on the

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill Number 4 passes; 23 Yes, 13 No. I would like to thank each of
