  The Senate will come to order. The sergeant at arms will close the
doors. Members will go to their seats. Members and guests in the gallery
please silence all electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer is
the Reverend
Peter Milner, Senate Chaplain. All members and guests in the gallery
please stand. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Please bow your heads in prayer.
Almighty God whose power is infinite and wisdom infallible, order this
day, these hours, these soldiers so that we might see, we cannot see,
Lord, and we often carry around thick burdens. It&#39;s hard to love our
neighbors as ourselves. We&#39;ve forgotten how to love you, oh Lord.
All of us are in need of your grace today. We need a place to dwell from
the cold of this world in safety, in the shadow of your wings. Lord, so
that we might dwell in a place where arrows that fly by day and
pestilence that walks around the darkness find no place, and so I pray
that we might dwell in the shadow of your wing this day as we move
forward together as a legislative family. In Jesus name I pray. Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Berger is recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. The journal of Tuesday, February 17,
2015 has been examined and found to be correct. I move that we dispense
with the reading of the journal and that it stand approved as written.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection the journal for February 17th stands
approved as written. Senators we have leaves of absence granted today
for Senators Tucker and Bingham and we have one item on our calendar
today, Senators. We have a public bill second reading roll call bill.
Senate Bill 15, the clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 15,
Unemployment Insurance Law Changes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho is
recognized to speak to the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
President and members of the Senate. Senate Bill 15 was put together 15,
16 and 7 all UI, unemployment insurance changes and I&#39;ll just
briefly go over some of the areas that were changed. We had a very good
discussion and a lot of great questions during the finance committee and
I believe every question was answered, but part one of the bill, which
enhance program integrity and it helps with GDAC and the DES, Division
of Employment Security, to better identify the individuals that may or
may not be eligible for benefits. It seems in the past the Division of
Employment Security tended to just make a payment and then have to spend
man hours, a lot of revenue, to try to recover it if it wasn&#39;t
accurate or if the amount was not correct, so this will move in the
direction of improving their efficiency in getting the correct amount of
benefit to the individual that indeed deserves it. Section two or part
two dealt with some of the issues that were not able to be completed
during the short session and they include the Division of Motor Vehicles
disclose Social Security numbers to DES to verify employer and claimant
identity requires UI claimants to contact five potential employer a week
which helps the beneficiary to better understand what their
responsibility is and allow them to efficiently look to find a suitable
job. Eliminate procedures to request reconsideration of the DES
decisions. This was a redundancy in the appeals process that allows for
a more efficient management of any claims that are up for appeal and it
also goes well in line with our commission which is the independent
commission, who&#39;s away from DES completely, to allow the beneficiary
to have a fair and just hearing, an impartial hearing as to whether or
not they should or should not get the benefit that was set forth.
We&#39;re talking about allowing garnishment

  To credit cards of delinquent taxpayers. There is a requirement of a
photo identification which is there to codify existing agency practice
and allows our professional employees of DES to be assured of the fact
that they are indeed giving that beneficiary or the correct beneficiary
the benefit that they may deserve. We&#39;re talking about extension of
deadline adoption rules, which the division of employment security has
been working very diligently in trying to get those through the rules
review commission. And then part three we&#39;re, we have the clear
understanding of what is involved with the, the oversight commission,
the in division review board, which is the oversight commission on the
employer, excuse me, the beneficiary&#39;s, the beneficiary&#39;s
claims. This has been designed just like the utility commission, the
banking commission, and the industrial commission where they allowed for
staggered terms, which was something that was omitted originally. We
tried to correct it last year. It couldn&#39;t get completed, so this
year we&#39;re trying to set the staggered terms up and, of the board of
review, and then also ratify their past unemployment appeals decisions
so that everything will work as it should in completed format. There are
three other companion bills that will go to another committee, but those
are for the confirmation process of the three members of the, of the
board of review, and that is not for this bill. Mister President, I hope
that clearly explains what this bill does. It is a good bill, and we
hope to move it forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator. We have any discussion or debate? Senator
Smith-Ingram, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister President, I rise to see if Senator Rucho will yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma&#39;am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, can you give me any background on to, as to why the
number of contacts was increased from two contacts to five contacts?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think, if I&#39;m not mistaken, it mostly deals with the fact that it
was two contacts over a certain amount of days, and apparently this is a
more, or a fairer way for those beneficiaries that are out looking for a
job to actually get it done in a, in a week&#39;s period of time.
That&#39;s my best recollection about that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Mister President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In terms of cleaning up the integrity that Senator Rucho explained with
the bill, I can understand that, but when I look at the counties that I
represent where the unemployment rates all exceed the state unemployment
rate of 7.5%. You have Bertie at 10.3. You have Edgecombe County at
13.0. You have Washington County at 9.5, and Washington County, one of
the eight counties that I serve, does not have an unemployment center.
Bertie County has a population that has 30% internet access. I&#39;m not
sure all of the, what all goes into making this contact of five, but in
your rural counties east of I-95, it is very difficult. Number one, you
don&#39;t have that many employment centers. Number two, you have all
eight counties that are tier one counties being economically distressed,
and they are that way because of the job market and their limited job
and employment opportunities there. I think it is overly burdensome to
raise that number from two contacts to five contacts and I want to know
if you&#39;re amenable to an amendment to at least take it down to three
or four. Okay. I, I accept that, but you do realize that that places a
burden, an unusual burden for those people who live in areas where there
is no transportation. We don&#39;t have public transportation in any of
the eight counties. There&#39;s a CPTA van that will transport  people
for their health services, but outside of that, there&#39;s limited
transportation. It is overly burdensome. I would ask my colleagues who
represent areas of counties that have the similar demographics that mine
have. If you would consider the unemployed, and you&#39;re kicking
people when they are down, and I don&#39;t know if that makes you feel
good about yourself or not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question before the
Senate is the passage of the committee substitute Senate bill 15 on its
second reading. All in favor will vote aye. Opposed will vote no.

Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 15 passes its second reading. It
will remain on the calendar. Do we have any notices or announcements for
the day. Senator Apodaca for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, a motion, please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca has
the floor for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, currently
Senate Bill 2 is in Judiciary 1. I move that it be removed form J1 and
rereferred to Judiciary 2. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection so
ordered. Any other notices or announcements? Any other business to come
before the Senate? If not, the chair recognizes, Senator Apodaca, for
what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, I have a
quick announcement, please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca has the
floor for an announcement. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The Ways and Means
committee will not be meeting this week. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Tillman, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask Senator
Apodaca a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] In the event you do meet do
you promise to take up the bills in ways and means. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir, I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, for what purpose do you rise. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Apodaca would yield for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca do
you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca
when you do bring that committee along, would you please be kind enough
to make sure that Senator Jeff Jackson, you know, is available for that
committee meeting. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh, absolutely Senator, we
won&#39;t do it without him and I hope Senator Danley can come back and
join us as honorary co-chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To see if Senator Apodaca will yield for a question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] One more, Mr. President. It&#39;s my fault. I understand that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, in the last decade has the Ways and
Means Committee ever met because I don&#39;t ever recall a meeting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Not to my knowledge, Senator. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any
further business to come before the Senate? If not the chair will
recognize Senator Berger for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.

February 19, 2015 at 11:00 AM. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The motion is the
Senate do now adjourn subject to the standard stipulations to reconvene

favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed, no.
The ayes have it. The Senate stands adjourned.
