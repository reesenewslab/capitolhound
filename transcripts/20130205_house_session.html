And think much more damage is going to be done than we've talked about,
either in Finance or here because of it. I am going to talk about the
substance of law of eligibility of benefits that changes under this act.
And I believe the act encompasses an acrobatic leap that my friends in
the majority should have had the prudence to restrict and resist. But I
think before I talk about the
amendment and I'm trying to do it all in one, Mister Speaker, it's
really helpful to return as I try to do to the legislative history and
the history of this state as it relates to the act because I think it's
important. North Carolina, unlike a lot of states, has a special
interest in unemployment compensation because it was one of the few
states which pioneered the investigation of the causes of unemployment.
I went back and looked in the old journals and in 1933 during the depths
of the depression, the General Assembly authorized the Governor to
appoint a commission to investigate the causes of unemployment and
Governor Ehringhaus appointed a commission to do that. That commission
met and developed a report and at the same time that was happening, in
1935 Congress passes the Federal Social Security Act which we know
provided the requirement that there would be assistance for the
unemployed provided that the state passes an appropriate statute. And in
order to qualify for the federal grants, the state had to establish the
agency and levy a tax on employers in order to create the fund.
North Carolina did that by special session right before Christmas in
1936 on December 10th. And the General Assembly attempted then to
utilize what were extraordinarily harsh lessons of the depression to
prepare for future lean times of high unemployment due to the
unavailability of work by setting up an insurance fund composed of
federal contributions and the employer tax. And what I think we've
missed to some degree in the debate is the declaration of state policy
that was contained in that act and has survived until present law with
just a few amendments and changes. Because when we're making very tough
decisions, we ought to resort back to the reason the law exists in the
first place.
So, a provision that we're keeping, in even the rewrite, is 96-2, the
declaration of state policy of the unemployment act. And although it's
only a
paragraph and I'm not trying to read to everybody but I do think it's
really important. Here's what it says: Economic insecurity due to
unemployment is a serious menace to the health, morals and welfare of
the people of the state. Involuntary unemployment is therefore subject
to general interest and concern which requires appropriate action by the
legislature to prevent it's spread and to lighten the burden which now
so often falls with crushing force upon the unemployed worker and his
family. The achievement of social security requires protection against
this greatest hazard of our economic life. And it goes on from there.
Consistent with that purpose, the scheme has been set up and although it
has been amended a number of times it has served this state through a
number of recessions, finish of the Great Depression, and for the most
part until the last few years through this recession. And consistent
adherence to the guiding principle and all of those amendments passed in
generations has been that the system has been designed to alleviate
human suffering caused by the crushing force of economic insecurity and
short as well as long term unemployment highlighted by exactly what
happened in the Great Depression that caused this state to pass the act
to begin with. I think it's important to say because an argument can be
made, well that was then and this is now.
And so I went back to look at what happened in my first term as a
legislator here and Representative Linda Johnson can speak more
eloquently to this than I, but that was the Pillowtex situation. Those
of you who live in that part of the state know better than I. But on
July 30, 2003 Pillowtex, based in Kannapolis, filed Chapter 11
bankruptcy and announced the cessation of all United States and Canadian
operations at 16 plants, laid off 7,600 workers, about 5,000 of which
were at the Pillowtex facility in North Carolina. It was the largest
mass layoff in the history of the state. The state had a little bit of
warning and through a lot of efforts, including those by Representative
Johnson and former Representatives Barnhart  and colleagues, with
Senator Hartsell as well</p>

? house in dealing with and military spousal relocation. But here are
the reasons that were eliminated that are part of the current law:
bankruptcy, impending closure of the plant, spousal relocation unrelated
to the military, and disability or health concern of the employee. My
amendment will not deal with any of those because while I agree they
should stay in the act, they are secondary to the last two that cause me
the most concern. The two that cause me the most concern that were taken
out of the act in this bill are the disability or health concern of a
minor child, an aged or disabled person or parent in the immediate
family or the inability of the worker to accept a particular shift work
because they had to care for their sick child or their dying parent.
Now, good cause allows a worker, often a committed long-term worker for
a company, to maintain economic security when they lose their job due to
serious, not trivial, and unexpected life events. It is, as I viewed it
-- as an attorney for years in the field -- part of the societal
contract that was part of the creation of this act during the Great
Depression. Here's the example -- and I could give you hundreds --  but
here's the example, quintessential, that this act bars: I work for a
shift. I have a severely disabled adult child with traumatic brain
injury as a result of a car crash. Or substitute to that: an elderly,
infirm parent dying of Alzheimer's or dementia in their last weeks of
care. Or a spouse dying of terminal cancer whom I provide the primary
care for when I'm not at work. My employer tells me I must work the
third shift. I try to find care for those members of the family and am
unable to. I tell him of my situation, and I cannot work because of that
at that shift. And he says, &quot;I'm sorry. You're out of a job.&quot;
Under current law, we would pay unemployment benefits to that person.
Under House Bill 4, they are ineligible. The majority's decision in that
drafting of that part of this bill to do that is as unwise as it is
profoundly unfair, and to me, it deprives the doctrine of employment
security of any value for the citizens of this state. Now, I could
understand that and not be proposing this amendment if it was a major
contributor to the economic issue we face. But only one tenth of a
percent of the claims fall in that category of family hardship. There is
not economic hardship to the state or employers to keep those provisions
in the bill, but they do a profound disservice and create profound
economic and moral consequences for the families that are
disenfranchised from these benefits. There was no hue or cry from the
public to make this change. There was no mandate. And there is no
necessity to dismember the eligibility benefits of this part of the
bill. Our concern consistent with the crush and burden that this whole
statute was set up to alleviate should be on the most vulnerable
citizens at the most difficult family time they will ever have. So I
offer my amendment to place a bit more compassion in this bill and to
suggest a bit more faithfulness to the purpose of the act. Mr. Speaker,
with that in mind, I move the adoption of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Ross, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentleman, this is a commonsense, good,

Carolina do not only in the workplace but at home.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s definitely difficult to follow Representative Glazier, a person I
have great respect for and I know is never frivolous with amendments and
he thinks through what he’s offering. We spent about three full days
looking at these Good Cause provisions, and we tried to go back and even
do in depth research of where the provisions came from. Number Four, the
Undue Family Hardship… last night, I told you that there was enough
blame to go around all over the city of Raleigh. This one came from an
individual that requested this. It was offered by one of the Republican
Senate members. It passed in the Senate, came over to the House, and we
passed it.
The Family Disability or Sickness is a hard one to argue against, but
the only thing I’m going to continue to say to you is over the years,
piece by piece, we loaded that wagon. Somebody just came and asked me
“what is the fiscal impact of these two pieces?”. They’re in the
notebook in my office, and I can’t tell you today. But this is what
happened. When you read Family Disability or Sickness, the next two
words, “leaving work”. They were not fired. They were not laid off
because there wasn’t work. I just want to remind you what this plan was
originally developed to do.
We sent this bill to the US Department of Labor to allow them to have
the opportunity to scrutinize and tell us what we couldn’t do or could
do or what we could take out. They looked at the Family Leave provision.
They also looked at the Undue Family Hardship provision. Understand that
the Family Hardship provision is very unique. We may be one of just
maybe three or five states that have that. The other one is more common,
but when we sent it to the US Department of Labor, we were told that
there’s no penalty. There are other states that do not have these
provisions.
Part of the provisions were tied to the Modernization Grant, and if you
know how those grants work, it’s called a stick and a carrot. Federal
government sends you some money, and you have to do certain things in
order to accept that money. This was, some of these things were part of
the Modernization Grant of years gone by.
I reluctantly stand again to ask you to vote “no” on this amendment
because we need to keep this bill intact and let it go into effect, and
then we can surely go back and look at all the consequences, and there’s
going to be a lot of things that we haven’t even thought about. But the
focus of this bill, remember, is to try to retire this debt, become
solvent, and put people back to work.

Representative Adams, would the lady wish to ask a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I would.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you representative Howard. You mentioned that you had some
discussions with the labor department. I'm curious about the fact that
we have so many women who are actually heads of households. Single
families. fifty one to fifty two percent of the population. Do you have
any information about what the impact would be on the women?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Adams, we spoke about the fact that we had sent the
entire bill to the US department of labor to- for them to give us a
clear ??. No maam, we didn't ask for- or they're not in that position to
give us that type of information. I'm sure that we could get the
information as we go along from some of the companies- some of the
simulations that we've had run, we could pick out how many are female.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
State your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak briefly a second time on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much and this is representative Jordan at my side. I
appreciate it mister speaker. I just wanted to highlight two points in
the amendment that I didn't speak to. So, just so that it's clear. One,
I put a sunset in the amendment for 2015 so that if there were any
unanticipated financial implications that don't appear in the data up to
now on the usage of this hardship provision that we would track it. And
you will see in the second section of the amendment a reporting
requirement on that data that requires the data to be reported on every
time this exception is used. So that if there is a a problem it can be
exited out when the commission meets over time. But we wouldn't be
disadvantaging all of these people and all of their families while that
is happening and we're collecting the data again because only zero point
one two percent of all claims fall in these categories combined. Or not
combined but the hardship category. Even less when we take out the
other.
I can't see and I think fiscal would agree there's minimal fiscal effect
here. But should that change for any reason, that's why I put in the
sunset provision in the amendment.
Thank you mister speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the amendment?
Representative Hollo, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker. Very quickly, and I appreciate representative
Howard's comment to let this go forward and- I do want to make sure we
acknowledge that we don't determine what happens to this bill once it
leaves this house. It goes to the senate. There's no guarantee to the
bill to think about the things we think are important and there's no
guarantee that they won't do some things to this bill we don't think are
important. So we have it in our hands right now to address this issue
that has minimal financial impact but has a great impact on the families
and the communities in our state. And so, again, we have this authority
in this chamber and we have the responsibility that goes with it to use
it wisely.</p>

[Speaker Changes] And I would submit to you this is about as wise a use
of your power and discretion as you could have. And this is about the
best situation and the most defensible situation you could us sit in.
And I would probably say if we surveyed the chamber everyone of us
individually would say this is the instance where help should be
rendered, where someone is taking care of family members, whether young
or old in our society. So again, I would ask that you would support this
amendment. Lets do the right thing by those North Carolinians who
clearly, through no fault of their own are trying to support the sick
and infirmed in their families. So I would ask that you would support
the amendment, as little effect on the bill, has a great effect on the
lives of many North Carolinians.

[Speaker Changes] Representative Howard, does the lady yield?
[Speaker Changes] Yes sir.
[Speaker Changes] The lady yields.
[Speaker Changes] I have sat here and I’ve read the amendment. I was
wondering what would be the impact of not passing this amendment. What
would be the fiscal impact on a family on another agency if this family
has to take this sick person to another facility, group home, whatever,
and state agency. What would be the fiscal impact of that person being
there, versus the fiscal impact of that person drawing unemployment and
staying home with that individual.
[Speaker Changes] Ma’am, I honestly can’t give you those numbers because
we haven’t looked at that. Theres always those questions, person staying
at home for home care, opposed to being put into a long term home care
facility. There are lots of studies over the years about those two
competing things. But I don’t know. I couldn’t tell you. Is short term,
long term? I honestly can’t tell you that, I’m sorry.

[Speaker Changes] The gentlemen is recognized to debate the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker, I am sending forward an
amendment that I ask my fellow members to consider. It connects to the
story you just heard about situations in our state like ??. In my home
county of Haywood, a decade or so ago, we had a large plant layoff at
Champion over a thousand jobs were lost in a small rural mountain
county. These are situations that our communities face from time to
time, they’re not predicted. They’re quite unpleasant. And each of you,
as members, if they happen in your district, you will be asked what
you’re doing to do about it. And this amendment offers just in the
scheme of things an option, its called the, let me put my glasses on
just a second, its called the workers adjustment and retraining
notification.  When a company of 100 or more announces a closure or a
layoff of 50 or more employees in your community, they are required to

<p id="040:00">
file this notice and this notice would trigger this provision which
would basically add, in those cases, 26 weeks would be the number of
weeks of regular unemployment benefits pertaining to that case.
Whenever you have a massive layoff or a plant closing in your
communities you get not just one or two folks losing their job, but you
get 50 to as we heard, 4,000 or 5,000 being laid off.  This is a
situation where work cannot be found, there is no reasonable person who
could tell you you can place appropriately those folks.  It is not only
those individuals who are distraught and their families but it is the
whole community so this is really a community response that each of us
needs to have in this bill, a provision which we can work toward if this
does indeed happen, which it will from time to time in the future, so I
recommend this to you.  Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.  Yesterday we did so many amendments
there weren't actually that many people who talked about the bill in
full other than Representative Howard who did a good job of explaining
the entire bill and as a matter of fact I wanted to commend
Representative Howard for doing that.  So many times on this floor we
will have a long, complicated bill and the bill sponsor won't take the
time to tell us what we are actually voting on and she did an excellent
job of setting an example what we should do when we are going to make
large public policy decisions.  I also wanted to thank Representative
Blust for his honesty and his candor.  He knows exactly what's in this
bill and what a difficult choice it is to make about what to do with
this bill.  He might make a different choice than I do but he did not
mislead this body in one sentence that came out of his mouth about what
the affects are going to be on the people in North Carolina who are
going to lose unemployment benefits and he shared his concern for them
and for that, I commend him.  But I would like to share my concern for
them and what different parts of this bill will do to them.  I want to
remember, all of us to remember, from the outset that under the current
unemployment system, nobody gets unemployment if they are at fault so
everybody who is unemployed under our system had a job before and I can
guarantee you, they wish they still had that job.  They had a job
before, they lost their job through no fault of their own.  They are
innocent, truly innocent, but several of the changes in this bill not
only are going to hurt all people who file for unemployment but they are
going to hurt a segment of our population in particular and that segment
is workers who have been in the workforce, sometimes for more than 20 or
30 years and those are people between the ages of 50 and 65 and given
the average age in this room, I assume everybody knows at least one of
the people I am talking about</p>

<p id="045:00">
[Speaker changes.] People between the ages of fifty and sixty-five are
more likely to make more money. They're in the middle class.  They've
worked for their careers.  They're earning more than 35,40, 50 thousand
dollars. They're the people who would be able to get the higher
benefits. Higher than $350 a week. They're the people who would've
benefited from Representative Tine's amendment. They're the people who
get the $535 a week under unemployment because they have worked for this
long period of time and have gotten to a certain salary. They will lose
out because of the reduction of benefits. They will also lose out
because of the reduction in time to find another job. Last Friday, the
US Department of Labor issued a report that said that people over the
age of fifty, in general, take fifty-three weeks to find employment. And
only one out of six is ultimately successful...most of them end up
taking jobs for less money than they were originally earning. We know in
North Carolina, for every three people there is only one job opening.
It is more difficult for people in that age group to get training and
then get hired as an entry level person for a new job.  I know not
everybody here reads the New York Times. I read The New York Times and
The Wall Street Journal. On the front page of The New York Times on
Sunday were all the statistics and the stories about what happens in
this cohort????  and what they do is...many of them have some
disability, they end up going on disability rather than working. They
take Social Security early, at at 30% reduction. They're foreclosed on.
They can't pay for their children's tuition. So I just want you to know
that these middle class families will be disproportionately hurt by the
changes in benefits in this bill. People who are low wage workers or
younger workers, they'll be hurt some too but they generally can find
another low wage job in a quick period of time. So you will be hurting
the middle class and their families. So what's the balance for that?
What could you do about it? Well, under this bill...$21 per employee per
year, that's one penny for each hour an employee works per year. One
penny.  I don't know...there's some proposals around here to raise tax
on medication by well more than a penny. One penny for each hour that
somebody works so, if they got paid ten dollars an hour, the employer
could think of it as paying them ten dollars and one cent an hour. I
don't know. That doesn't sound unfair to me.  What else could we have
done in this bill?  We could decide not to cut off the new long term
unemployment benefits that were approved in Congress by a bi-partisan
majority. We could allow people to have that extra 26 weeks and we could
have that money come into our economy. And what would that do? Well, it
would reduce foreclosures.  It would immediately go to grocery stores.
It would immediately go to pharmacies.  It would immediately go to buy
school supplies for children. I don't know.  I don't think it's so bad
to take that money and do that with it. It's certainly gonna help our
convenience stores and our grocery stores and our Realtors. They could
use that money to produce more jobs immediately. That, to me, would be
more balanced. I understand that everybody here doesn't agree with that
but I think we need to look at the whole picture and I think we need to
put a face on the unemployed. And we need to put a face on the long term
unemployed. They are us. They are our neighbors. And, after we vote on
this bill, we hafta go home and look at them. I urge you to vote no.

by mistake on this bill. Now that I’ve told you that, I’m going to tell
you why – why it is important that I vote no today, and I’m glad that I
have an opportunity to do so, although my vote did not change, would not
have changed the outcome. Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a balanced
approach. Without exception, people affected by this bill are unemployed
through no fault of their own. Yes, I repeat, unemployed due to no fault
of their own. Being responsible stewards of state money is very
important, and we should make every effort to pay down out debt and
avoid adding interest payments. We owe it, however, to families
struggling right now, to be responsible and do so in a manner that does
not devastate our economic recovery. In my opinion this bill, Julia
Howard and others, will promote more people being in jails and prisons.
Yes, it will increase the crime rate. It will increase homelessness,
domestic violence, alcohol and substance abuse, the need for counseling,
and indeed could cause more suicides and mass killings. I urge you to
protect these unemployed benefit funds by delaying the implementation of
this bill. There is a financial impact that has not been looked into,
and I contend that that’s going to be because of the social ills that
passage of this bill is going to create. Ensure the 25 million dollars a
week continues to flow to North Carolina, and most importantly, be spent
in North Carolina with North Carolina businesses. I ask that you vote no
on House Bill 4. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, upon motion of
Representatives Rayne Brown, Jerry Dockham and Marcus Brandon, the Chair

Speaker, for allowing me this time. My seatmate spoke so eloquent, but I
just wanted to share because I promised the 80 thousand voters of
Scotland, Hoke, Robeson and Richmond that I would always stand on their
behalf and speak to issues that affect their lives. I have the honor… I
don’t know if it’s an honor, but I have… that Scotland County is the
poster child for unemployment, one of the top two in the state of North
Carolina for unemployment, and I see the issues that are going on at the
present time, and I think about the collateral consequences that this
bill will bring to the district in which I serve, and I think about
somebody talked about the health and human services and how the Scotland
and the areas that I served, and think about how they’re having tough
times now. I know that many of you are Sunday school students, and many
of you, we pray every time we open up these chambers, and we think
about… and many of you who are Sunday school teachers, our students know
about when the Galilean cobbler talked about when you did it to the

the pain</p>

and we will bring these families, that this bill hits the Governor's
desk, and he signs it.  And I don't know sometimes how we can really go
to sleep at night, knowing that we have affected so many families.  And
as Dr. Adams said the other day, sometimes we have to put people before
profits, and I think sometimes we have overlook people are hurting,
they're hurting now.  They're going through difficult times now with the
unemployment check.  Can you imagine the ones, if we can get to July,
that will know that there will be cuts.  I think we could look at that
ladies and gentlemen.  We really need to think about what we do, and
we're all fine members, there's no doubt about that.  But sometimes I
think that we put so many other things ahead of people.  And the thing
is, when we're campaigning, we promise folks we're going to do this,
we're going to do that, but as soon as we get in these golden doors, how
soon we forget about those folks that we talked about.  And how is it
that we're going to go back home, and be able to walk passed some of
those folks.  How are we going to passed them and know that they're
hurting, and know that they're going through some difficult times.  But
even though we have people who are poor, who are facing poverty issues,
a lot of them are still proud people.  And as so many have already said,
they are unemployed, and will be unemployed, no fault of their own.
What appears that why it is no fault of there own, because so many
businesses, when they think about how they can make more money, how they
can close their doors, how they can take jobs to other places, they soon
forget about those workers who labored with them for many years, and
they have no, they don't think about that.  But the collateral
consequences of this bill are going to be dire, it's going to be very
difficult in our communities, and I just ask if there's any way.  And
I'm going to appeal to the Governor, I'm not through with it yet.  I'm
going to ask if there's any way he can think about his commitment to the
citizens of North Carolina.  But I want to encourage you, and I would
ask, I voted no on Tuesday, or Monday, and I would vote no again.  Thank
you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]For what purpose does the lady from Guilford,
Representative Adams rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker, to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The member is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.  I'm joining to join Representative Garland
Pierce in voting no again.  But you know, I had an opportunity, ladies
and gentlemen, to see a few more people today, heard from a few more
people today, had an opportunity to listen to some stories, which really
disturbed me.  And we talked about how long would be able to wait.  I
think currently when you lose your job, you wait a week, then you can
apply for unemployment, and then you wait another week, so you're really
2 weeks before you're able, maybe past 2 weeks before you're able to
even get anything.  But I was told, for example, people who worked for a
private company, and I'm thinking about a bus company now, Wolfline,
where employees who served that company, for example, when school is
out, for 2 months, they can currently, with the way the law is now, they
can draw unemployment, and of course that helps them to maintain their
families.  Now, the way this bill is drafted, and what's proposed here
would mean that those individuals would no longer apply, and I suspect
there are probably many, many companies, many other employees across the
state who will be impacted in this way.  So this bill requires a 2 week
waiting period, so you're really talking about 3 weeks and beyond.  And
if you can imagine not having any income, and in some cases for some
these folks, this is all that they have, and they'll not even have that.
 So I just want to appeal to you again today to have some compassion.
This bill does add to the financial hardship of families who are already
unemployed and who have to endure that hardship without having a job.
We say that we want to be competitive, but it seems to me that people
are beating people down who already sunk to the bottom.  This bill in my
opinion is short sided, and it has been said, these are individuals who
use these dollars for the basic necessities, each and every week to
provide food, clothing, medicines, and those kinds of things.  And so,
they're putting that money back into the economy, so you could think
about this as a bill that basically has sort of a</p>

<p id="060:00">
The fact that it's also going to impact employers to that degree,but to
take a $175 cut from $500 which gives you $300 or $350 that is really
severe for some people. A reduction of 26 weeks to 20 weeks that is
severe. Total elimination of the federal emergency funds is also severe.
Now I received, I'm sure you did as well, a number of emails about what
were about to do today. About the devastation that were gonna cause on a
lot of families and I've had some mail, some mail, that is quite
disturbing. I wanna just share a couple of comments with you and this
one individual writes that she was recently layed off due her first week
of compensation $520. I whole heartedly agree that $520 a week for being
unemployed certainly sounds like a lot of money at first, however once I
pay my rent for a two bedroom and $850 utilities and $100 car payment,
an insurance at $400, I'm at $1350 a month before I buy any food or put
gas my car so that I can get to job interviews. That leaves me with $650
a month to live on to pay the remainder of my monthly obligations. Quite
simply she says cut the compensation to $350 a week I will be evicted
from my apartment very quickly. To me that's a sad story. This woman
says that she wants to earn her way in life, she's had a job all her
life, she doesn't want things given to her and she realizes that some
people take advantage of the system sometimes, but she goes on to say,
please to punish the innocent many for the sins of a guilty few. This
person along with others who've written to me have indicated that losing
32% of their unemployment money would basically make them homeless.
Again I would appeal to you to think about the people of this state who
sent us here who are not doing as well as some of us. They have to
provide for their families and what were doing to them is cruel, cruel,
and unnecessary. There trying to make the ends meet. And I would ask
that you vote against this bill and again let's put people over profit.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. speaker. Thank you representative Howard for taking the
time to take up this very important issue, it is a very important issue
and it's a tough one to discuss,but is one that needs to be addressed
and that's what the minority party attempted to do with the amendments
that were put forth, putting forth the minority's best ideas forward to
match with majority's best ideas to protect workers and business. Now
yesterday my colleague, representative Duane Hall, proposed a very, very
reasonable amendment, one that did not increase taxes in the bill, did
not eliminate the benefit cuts in the bill, while we were working down
this debt. Very reasonable and yet his amendment received no majority
support. Today, representative Glazier purposed a very thoughtful
amendment and received no majority support. Now may have received one
vote ??? three votes. Now I'm a country lawyer by trade know when to
negotiate, know when to compromise, know when to reach out to reach an
agreement, but in order to do that both sides have to want to make a
deal and the way that this current bill stands it is a bad deal, a bad
deal not only for the minority party, it's a bad deal for workers, ti's
a bad deal for families, it's a bad deal for these little children
sitting up in the gallery today, it's a bad deal for their parents, it's
a bad deal for the state of North Carolina. Now when you have
individuals that want to find a way to say yes, but are shut out at
every single opportunity they cannot in good faith . . .</p>

monopoly on good idea and neither does the minority the voters send us
here to work together obviously that's why there's not a 120 member
majority we have to work together and we can work together we can debate
we can dialog without all of the bluster and name calling now in that
vein I want to thank my colleague from [??] where representative
Steinberg for the tone and the nature of his remarks over the phone last
night and in closing there will be several more thoughtful considerate
democratic amendments put for maybe not on this bill but on bills in the
future and I just ask that you give them the proper and careful
consideration that they deserve thank you Mr speaker.
representative Hawley is recognized to debate the bill.
thank you Mr speaker and my colleagues and representative Howard for
explaining the bill so [??] she said several times that this was a
business bill and she was right it is a business bill but there's some
things about business that we have not thought about and that is the
[??] for business and is called the human capital now I spoke with a
number of people last night who were equally upset and one of them said
tell them about the american dream I don't know if you all heard the
american dream most people in the american dream says they wanna work
hard they went and got their education they take care of their families
and they taught their families how to be self sufficient and they give
back to their community well these are the many people who're caught in
this unemployment process right now they're the ones who are trapped in
this goal a friend last night said [??] tell my story of losing my job I
have a masters degree I'm 52 years old this what she said she said first
went the house then bankrupting now you're asking me to make a decision
between taking my diabetes medicine or giving my son a pair of shoes
that he's going out of rapidly for he could continue to go to school
when the majority community is in a recession my community is in a
depression when your community is in depression my community is in [??]
and this bill is putting people into [??] so let's look at the cost of
bankruptcy the cost of [??] the cost of healthcare in the emergency room
as part of this bill let's look at the price of what it would cost these
people to be put on public assistance for housing and food we're not
saving money we're just shifting it from one part to another let's call
it what it is let's keep them and allow them to have their dignity
unemployment is a hand not a handout and let's keep in thinking terms of
those things while we're trying to do things with some of these people
now who've been caught in the mix and please vote against this bill
thank you for your time.
representative William Brawley please state your purpose.
thank you Mr speaker to debate the bill.
the gentleman's recognized to debate the bill.
and I would ask that if someone has questions for me that they hold them
to the end of my points and I will accept questions at that time this is
a tough situation I am really wish that my little girl was right when
she used to put on a tiara and pick up a stick and say it was a magic
wand and she could go biing and solve anything but I don't have a magic
wand so we have to make some tough decisions part of the difficulty we
have is that the benefits we currently pay with the situation we have
are not sustainable and we have to make some tough choices we will
reduce our average benefit under this bill to 291 dollars the maximum
will fall from 525 but currently to qualify for 525 you had to be making
56 thousand dollars a year or more so the least of us are not being
touched by this it's only those of us that are a little better off and I
[??] should've said.

Some money be used to supplement our unemployment and also would tend to
be higher skilled individuals that can gain employment more quickly. But
there’s also the question of the interest. We’re paying interest on
this. Currently at the rate of 2.6%. I’ve done a little calculation.
That’s 65 million dollars a year 178,082.019 cents a day or 7,420
dollars, nine cents an hour. Or to put it another way an hour in
committee and the three hours that we will have spent on the floor
debating this bill we will have incurred interest expense on our debt of
twenty-nine thousand six-hundred eighty dollars thirty six cents. Folks,
that’s a job. And that’s part of the problem we’re facing here.
Unemployment is a transfer payment. It is true that people who receive
unemployment benefits spend the money and it echoes through the economy
and creates demand. Unfortunate we leave out the part that the people
who pay the money in that is used to pay that benefit now have less
money to spend and that lack echoes through the economy and the two
cancel each other out. But the interest that we pay on the debt leaves
us for Washington so we are in fact worse off the longer we leave this
debt accumulating interest. The other problem is while we add these
expenses to businesses that means the total labor cost for the current
workforce goes up to maintain costs, to keep to keep the business open .
that means by raising even more what businesses will contribute we will
cause some people to lose their jobs and we will say it is through no
fault of their own and it will be true and it will also be no fault of
the business but it will be the fault of ours because we took that money
out of the funds available for payroll. There are two groups of people
that are hurt by decisions like that. One; the people in jobs who’s
marginal productivity is so close to cost there in danger of being laid
off and also those with the lowest skill levels who are trying to be
hired and cannot be because the additional cost of adding them to the
payroll is greater than the benefit they can bring to the business. And
the answer we truly need are not higher unemployment benefits we need
higher wages from, or more wages from employment by people who can get
jobs paid for by the money no longer being pulled out of the businesses
for other reasons. The thing we are trying to do is not penalize anybody
but to increase the number of jobs that can be created so that people
who are currently drawing unemployment benefits for less than their
weekly wage can have a full weekly wage and not have to worry nearly as

a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Holly, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady wish
to ask a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] yes, I wish to ask a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Then the gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] At what point, we’ve been told this is a jobs bill.
When do you expect to see jobs from this bill materialize? One year? Two
years? Or when the debt is paid off or how many jobs are expected from
reduction and savings to businesses. When are they gonna materialize.
The people want to know. [SPEAKER CHANGES]I can’t trace you the specific
jobs but I can tell you that macroeconomics scales well. If you and I
are the only two people in the world and you are drawing unemployment
and I am paying it, the net money between the two of us is the same. If
at the same time I’m paying interest out, the total money available to
both of us is less and we scale that up I will concede I cannot trace
every resulting transaction but I do know that businesses that are
losing money</p>

Eight people off. That businesses who are expanding need more people and
they hire, and the, anything that we’re doing that makes it harder for
businesses to maintain the working capital they need to continue
employment to even bridge small gaps will increase unemployment. And
that as businesses are able to expand their business expand their
workforce they will. Specific numbers I cannot give you. But I believe
in the effects that I have put forward and in the numbers I have given
you today. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Queen please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] As a
freshman of this body I have a little history within the General
Assembly because I have really been in the Senate for some time. So I
was here whenever we had opportunities to raise the tax or to raise the
insurance premiums for our businesses. But there was never really a
consensus to do that. Not from, not from the Republican party or not
from the Democrat party because we were basically starting in a big
recession. And we felt the better approach the wiser approach and I
still think it was the right thing to do was to, to ride this out and
see where it goes. Cuz none of us could predict how deep and broad and
difficult this great recession has been. And we’re still in the recovery
of this great recession. In, in appropriations we, we heard the day that
there is 180,000 fewer jobs today than when the great recession began.
We’ve heard from our research folks that there are about half of the
people, a little over half of the people that have been receiving
benefits under our existing plan exhaust their benefits before they find
a job. This is a hard recession. I have lots of constituents that are,
that are struggling in this recession to find a job and to make things
difficult, that make difficult things better for themselves. Why I want
to speak to is the social contract that we’ve had in this state and in
this country since 1935, since the social security act and the
unemployment act were in, were conceived to, to deal with the crushing
burden as Representative Glazier alluded to and spoke to so eloquently
earlier. The crushing burden that sometimes falls upon citizens from
economic forces that they have no control over. No control over at all.
Well what we have done in this bill that social contract was that
unemployment insurance would be a responsibility of an employer to
provide for their employees. It was an obligation of an employer in this
country, in this state, from 1935 on. It wasn’t, and it wasn’t great.
I’m an employer. I’ve been paying $42 a year for each employee I have in
my staff and business in my home, my home county. $42. It’s doubled to
$84 now. And it will, it, it could double again if we didn’t do anything
and just let the, the, this, this rabbit lie and let the, the, the plan
that the federal unemployment tax has in hand/g, it might, it might
double again to be $168. And then it would go away. $168 to protect an
employee’s right and to a decent unemployment insurance situation if I
as their employer go south for some reason to, to no fault of these
employees which I feel a great obligation to because they have made my
business what it is. I don’t think $168 and that’s at the end of this,
that’s the last time is, is a significant amount. I think we did, we
have done some good things in this bill. We’ve raised the state tax just
slightly. But we have changed the contract. It is no longer the employer
who provides this insurance as modest as I contend it is. We have now
shifted it entirely to</p>

<p id="080:00">
almost entirely 100 to 1, with the obligation that we have. 2 billion,
700 million dollars worth of this loan repayment comes from workers
benefit cuts. $24 million, we add at the state level, the feds
discontinue their program as it's been all along. So, I contend that
this is not fair and balanced. I contend that it is not smart economics.
I appreciate every member of this body, Republicans and Democrats want
to do the best they can for their citizens. But we're putting the burden
entirely, almost entirely, massively 100 to 1 on workers and worker's
families and not just ever worker, but the workers that are in the
greatest distress with the crushing burden of unemployment. This has an
effect. It really is a shift from the employer, which I would contend
tend to be wealthier, to the worker, who tends to be poorer or lower in
the economic ladder. So this is really one of those equity issues we are
hearing more and more about, that have real social consequences when you
change the social contract. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
And that's just exactly what we're doing here, and we do have options to
not do this in this harsher way. I plan to vote no on this bill again
because my fundamental tenet, a tenet I share with most of the members
of this body. It is &quot;Do unto others as you would have them do unto
you,&quot; or if you like the negative, &quot;do not do unto others what
you would not want to be done unto you.&quot; So I ask you to vote
against this bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Stevens, please state your purpose.

To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the House, I did not plan to speak, so everything you hear is
going to be somewhat impromptu. I am from an area where there was lots
of mill jobs, and there have been lots of job losses. We've suffered
them regularly for the last 12 years. I will vote in favor of this bill.
I wanted to dispel a few myths that I've heard both in committee and on
the floor, that there are no jobs out there that people will not take.
I've talked to employers who say, &quot;I'm a little bit tired of the
people who come in and say 'Will you just sign this and tell me you
don't have a job? Because I really don't want one. I'm going to continue
 to draw my benefits.'&quot; That's not anecdotal. That's directly from
an employer. I have talked to people who are drawing benefits who have
been given job offers and they say, &quot;I can't take this job. It's
foolish for me to take this job at $10 an hour when I'm making $500 a
week for staying at home. And I really have to do that. And I do know
people who have done that. The last thing I'm going to say to you is
that do you think that we in the majority don't understand this concept?
Do I know the faces of unemployment? My husband has been long term
unemployed twice in the last 12 years. And I'm talking a year and a
half, 2 years at a time because of his limited skills. I do understand
the face of unemployment. And I have talked to various people in my
community since this bill was filed, who said &quot;Wait a minute, what
are you going to do, cut unemployment benefits?&quot; But when I
discussed the problem with them and where we need to go, they then
respected that opinion and undserstood that I was doing what's best and
what had to be done. It wasn't easy, it wasn't an easy decision. The
easiest thing would say, &quot;Let's just spend more money. Let's just
print more money.&quot; But that's not the responsible, sensible,
community thing we were hired to do. Thank you.

I don't very often get up to speak in this chamber, because I learn by
listening what others say and how I can respond to my constituents from
time to time when I return to my community. I received a call on
yesterday from one of my constituents about this particular bill. He
stated that he is being outsourced after 38 years on his job. The job
was going out of the country</p>

Representative: …now he may not have much of a problem because he could
possibly retire; he could possibly receive the maximum benefit allowed
per week: $500 and some, which is still not a whole lot of money, but I
think about those folk who cannot receive that amount. Who will receive
w$100-200 a week, trying to support a family of 3-4 children, husband
and wife. Then, I reflect back and think that I have been blessed, as
many of you have, who have not ever had to received unemployment: that
is a blessing. Who have never had to receive from any of the programs
that are offered: that is a blessing. A lot of this is being cut out,
and people are being turned away,. You listen about the devastation that
is taking place in our state, and in our U.S., with regard to children
and families. I don’t know how I would react if I was told that I no
longer had a job. I have always worked. Those of you that are
sharecroppers children, or grandchildren, as I have been, know what it
is to work, and appreciate work. But I tell you, it hink that I would
just love to hear of a time when we could actually talk to one another
across the aisle and agree on some things that we have not been able to
agree on these past couple of days. You say that of the amendments, some
of them are good; you can support it, but then turn right around and
vote against it; not only from across the aisle, but some of our very
own. So it is not a matter of voting with your party all the time, but a
matter of voting for what is the best for your constituents. I, like all
of you, made a commitment that I am going to vote for what is in the
best interest of the people who voted for me to come here. This tells me
that it is not good for the people of my community, therefore, I will be
voting against this bill. Thank you.
Speaker: Representative Lukegate, please state your purpose.
Representative: To speak briefly on the bill.
Speaker: The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker and members of the house. We had a
great debate , I think, on this bill last night, and in many ways,
today, because of the eloquent statements from those who know about
people who have been in such dire straights because, already, before
having even looked at the implications of this bill or others after July
1. I just want to share – what I would like to do is follow up on that,
and just share two comments that I received this morning when I was in a
convenience store. There was a news observer there, so I picked it up
and showed it to one person and actually, she was the clerk in the
store, and I asked her what she thought about it, i.e. the jobless
benefits being cut? She said that well, there are no jobs out there, so
why are they cutting benefits? That was her comment. Then, as I was
walking out the store, another gentleman walked in, and I just thought,
okay, I will show him the paper too. I did, and I told him what this was
about – I showed him the headline. He said that was a bad idea. Now,
that is not a scientific sample. It is two stories, but I think that
most people in this state are. In terms of the vote, we saw the votes
overwhelmingly along party lines, and I would say, my friends on the
republican side, you have the votes but you do not have public opinion</p>

..The stories that have been told here have primarily come from
Democratic members. [??] There has been tremendous silence on your side,
even though I am sure many of you have stories to tell just as poignant
as many of those we have heard today from the Democratic side.  And so,
the question is, where is that concern? Where is the ability to
empathize  with the cuts?
Remembering that the cuts are, as has been said today,and that has been
said yesterday,last night, are a hundred times more serious.  2.7
billion on the unemployed, and 24 million in terms of the [??] suda acts
the state unemployment tax increase between now and the end of 2017.  So
where is the compassion?  I am disappointed that it's not there.
Apparently it's not there in terms of the vote.
But I did do a little research on the vote from last night, the second
reading, and it does tell us that sometimes representatives do know how
hard it's hurting their community.  Or at least they get in touch with
how hard it's hurting their community.
There were three of my Republican friends who voted, &quot;no&quot;, on
this bill.  One from Gastonia, one from [??] Cheroville, and one from
[??] .  What do those three Representatives have in common?
Freightliner.  They represent in their districts, many workers at
Freightliner.  And if you have been following the news, Daimler Benz,
Mercedes Benz out of Germany has made decisions, major layoffs at their
plants. Rowan County and in Gaston County. [??] right next to that plant
in Western Rowan County.
So, I say, we do have some folks in the Chamber on the other side who
know exactly what will be the situation after July 1.  And recognizing
the direct impact, because it is a large lay-off.  They have seen fit,
and I applaud them, to vote no on the bill.  It's not as easy for the
rest of you, because it's on a point here, on a point there. It's not
focused on one corporation.
I say to you, think about all the people in your district who are going
to be hurt by this bill.  Whether Republican, Democrat, unaffiliated,
voter, non-voter.  Lots and lots of people will be hurting after July 1.
 And I urge you to have the courage to vote &quot;no&quot; on this bill.
 Thank you.  I certainly am voting &quot;no&quot; on this bill and I
urge you to do so as well.
Representative Steinburg please state your purpose.
To address the bill, please.
Gentlemen, it is recognized to debate the bill.
Ladies and gentlemen of the Assembly.  There are those of us who are
supporting this bill who understand very well, what is at stake here.
Many of us have visited with constituents who are unemployed.  We have
heard the stories. We see it first-hand.  But, how many of us have
actually lived it?  How many of us have seen it in our families?  How
many of us have actually seen the pain, the embarrassment, the
frustration?  It can often end in death.  In 1975, my father had been
unemployed for about 10 months.  We in the family who loved my father --
my best friend-- could see him deteriorating.  Every week, every month
he was failing.  There was an opportunity, a plant that was moving to
our town.  And he felt like he had a shot at getting a job. He said to
me, &quot;Bobby, I am a good man. I know this company will hire me if
they can just hear my story&quot;.
Well, we went to the plant, and I decided that I would accompany...</p>

Representative: …and, I firmly had to conclude, that one of the reasons
why I cannot support the measure, revolves around the fact that every
amendment, offered by my democratic colleagues, to soften in some form
or fashion, the terrible blow that is going to befall the unemployed
when the maximum benefit goes from somewhere in the neighborhood of $500
all the way down to somewhere in the neighborhood of $290. There is o
way that we can put a bow on this and make it seem better than it is. It
is  a devastating change. We will have tried, from my side of the aisle,
to suggest many, many things that could in some form or fashion, help to
make that blow less devastating. I am not going to recount all the
various proposals that have been put forward, but the bottom line is
that none of those proposals have been found to be something the
majority would accept, or dare say, negotiate over, but the majority has
decided that this is what it is going to be. Now, I understand politics,
and I understand that some of you have sat in this chamber in the past
and had measures raiulroade that you did not like. I know that it hurts
ot have a train run over you and you have no chance of winning, but this
is not about party politics, this is about the people of NC that will
lose when you win. That is what I want you to think about. In many of
these debates, folks have been talking about the business community.
Well, businesses are made up of people. Sometimes businesses win,
sometimes businesses lose. Sometimes people find themselves, through no
fault of their own, on the wrong side of unintended consequences. The
benefit that this measure is going to en shrine in law is an unfair
outcome for the citizens of NC. I urge you as you sit at these desks, to
rethink this proposition. We are early in our session, so this train
does not have to go shooting out of here today. The people of our state
will be better served with a more humane change in our unemployment
compensation scheme than that before us today. I will be voting no and
hope that some of my GOP colleagues will join me in voting no. Thank you

Speaker1: Not just in the last few days, as we have witnessed  in the
last few years, now about three or four years, right at 10 percent
unemployment in the state and I would submit to you that neither side of
the aisle is pleased with 10 percent unemployment. Yes, we all agree on
how to arrive at lesser employment and more employment and higher wages,
but we all are in this together. We are here together. And it is more or
less the educational philosophy that would say if we keep on doing what
we have been doing we keep on getting what we have been getting.  And
that’s not what any of us want. We all want to do better. We have had
great ideas on how to do better. I just wish we could collectively do
better. We have had some amendments on this side some that x difficult
to support some that should have been easy to support. But the one
common element has been that they have all been turned down. So I am xx
to feel that it’s going to be an operation not a sense of co-operation.
And I wish that we could get more co-operation as we attempt to solve
this dilemma for our state. Thank you.
Speaker changes: Representative Cunningham please state your purpose.
Speaker changes: To speak about the bill.
Speaker changes: The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
Speaker changes: I usually would not say anything but I am a registered
nurse in the state of North Carolina and I have been unemployed three
times in 2010. I put in six applications in those three months and got a
job just because I am a registered nurse. We are needed everywhere,
everywhere all over the state you hear people saying they need nurses
but they don’t need everybody else like that. We need job re-trainer so
that people can go to work. But I would let you know in 2009 and when I
first took my lay off to take care of my sick husband who was sick for
two years, and then my mother got sick she had glioglastoma cancer she
died in five weeks; my husband dies two months later. That’s why I can
always withstand it, the sadness,  that we are just going to turn our
beds and walk away. We can fix some of these but we don’t have to get it
all the way. Can we fix it some of it, a little bit at a time, poverty
in the state our children our future what are we going to leave ? what
are we going to have ?; people can’t buy Asthalin, people in the
Emergency Room, children can’t get asthma medicines because it costs
$200 dollars anyway. I will vote no and will continue to vote no because
my compassions are for the people of the state of North Carolina that
are employed, unemployed , poor and still be unemployed and to some jobs
come in here. Let’s continue to vote no. Thank you.
Speaker changes: Representative Robert Brawley please state your
purpose.
Speaker changes: To speak on the bill.
Speaker changes: The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
Speaker changes: Thank you Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentleman this bill
here has created a lot of discussion around the Brawley household; we
are very fortunate, we have five children . My baby is thirty nine, my
grandchild is , that’s how we wanted but much younger son forty one
years old got married the past year and moved into a new home. And
because his daddy told him to speak up when he has a problem, I’ve been
hearing about this bill for at least last two weeks every Sunday  when
xxx told the employees xxx because my son works for xx. So I know what’s
going to happen out there. But I also know what is going to happen if we
don’t get this economy turned around and start creating jobs. And it
really bothers me that I keep hearing this, the unemployed are paying
the bills. This is an unemployment anathema??</p>

benefits don't pay for anything.  Those benefits have to be paid for
through a tax on employers and those same employers are being taxed a
percentage of their payroll to pay off the two-and-a-half billion
dollars in debt that we already have.  Now, well I appreciate what
Freightliner has brought to North Carolina.  They've done a very good
job but they've got some smart people over there too, and I bet you
they've look at the fact that that tax is based on their payroll.  And
when they lay these people off the burden on the rest of the employers
in North Carolina is going to go up a little bit because we've already
lost the payroll from one employer.  Lets think about the total impact
and lets see if we can't do something to encourage people to employ
people and put people back to work and see if we can get out of this
mess.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Blust, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  To speak on the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  The gentleman is recognized to debate the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you Mr. Speaker and Members of the House.
We've had a lot of debate on this.  Certainly, it's an important
subject.  It should get a lot of debate and I understand the angst.  I
don't feel totally comfortable with my vote.  I don't think there is a
way to handle this subject in a way that would make anybody totally
comfortable.  We've got a terrible problem on our hands.  A debt of 2.5
billion has been run up and it's got to be re-payed.  Now, if we do
nothing, the way it's gonna be re-payed is the Federal Government is
this their proclivity is going to come in and they are going to
heavy-handedly take the money through a scheduled increase in feudal
taxes.  Feudal tax is a tax directly on employment.  So, if you want
less employment in this State there's an easy way to get it if you want
to talk about the causes you can tax something and you're gonna get less
of it.  That's an economic fundamental and part of the problem is in
this country and in this state we've gotten away from sound economic
fundamentals.  Now, what this Bill is designed to do is to keep those
huge taxes on employment from happening so that some certainty is
restored to our business community so when they project they can feel
more comfortable about hiring.  Now most of the benefit provisions are
prospective.  They don't occur unless someone is becoming unemployed
after July 1st of this year.  We don't know who or whether those people
will be unemployed or who they will be, but we know from history even if
the economy is good there's always some new unemployed people in an
economy.  So, the idea that somebody's benefits who's on unemployment
their suddenly gonna lose some money just isn't factual from the Bill.
I was disappointed to hear again that 100 to 1 figure recited and that
troubles me to hear that again when its been debunked.  It's not
accurate but so much of the debate in this country is no longer accurate
and you can't seem to make a fact anymore and get it accepted as a fact.
 So, it isn't that out of balance.  I don't know what the exact correct
balance is, probably 120 people in this Chamber if they chose
independently the balance would fall 120 different places, but the main
reason I rose was to deal with facts, self-appointed, we're putting
people above profits and you meanies over there just aren't doing that.
You don't care.  Some people said we look over there we don't see any
compassion.  This was said to be causing suicides and mass killings and
all sorts of other things, and that's another thing about the debate in
this country that I hate is that so much is designed to try to provoke
an emotion instead of a cold analysis of the reality, and lets look at
that people above profit because that false notion that some are putting
people above profit is, I believe, the very reason we have the economic
problem we're in.  People above profit was the notion that we're gonna
get everybody into their own house whether they can pay it or not,
whether they can pay the payments or not.  We're putting people above
profits so everybody should have a house in our world</p>

<p id="125:00">
World if you don’t like that then you’re for profit above people. So we
lost sound economics and we created a trillion or two trillion of bad
housing debt that was spread throughout the economy. It was repackaged
by Wall Street and the risks were spread about the economy. And then a
panic hit and the credit market stopped functioning and so layoffs
started. That’s when our debt started running up. So we had this bad
situation we had the uncertainty but the people above profit false
mentality is the reason we’re not coming out of this. We wanted people
above profit so we didn’t let the housing correct like it should have
and find a bottom for four years. I can name you instance after instance
where the people above profit false mentality is the very thing that’s
keeping our economy from bouncing back and it is ironic and it is tragic
that some of the very people that purport to represent the people above
the profits are the ones who are hurting those people and creating the
conditions in which so many people are suffering and if we were really
serious we would know that people really need profits. If not one person
in here would have an article of clothing on if there weren't profit.
There wouldn't be desks in the chamber. There wouldn't be a chamber if
there weren't profits. Mankind would still be hunter-gatherers. And
we've made profit into a bad word and we've created policies in this
country and in this state because we think that’s bad and then we
reaping the whirlwind. We’re reaping the bad realities. And this bill is
a small step toward getting back to the real reality and not taxing
additional employment and not causing future unemployment and future
people to suffer so I stand proudly supporting a bill that I believe is
going to stop more economic misery than it effects and I understand it
will effect some people. I wish there was a way to structure it to what
there would be no person in this state adversely effected but there’s no
way to do this but I think this is going to stop even more misery from
being created in the future and I think it’s something we have to do
given the debt that’s been put in the laps of the general assembly so I
urge a yes vote. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, it is the intent of the
chair to allow any member who wishes to speak on the matter to speak on
it. However, we have two in the queue now. It tends to roll up after we
get to one. If we go beyond four-fifteen the chair is considering a
recess. Representative George Graham. Please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] to speak on the debate sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you
very much Mr. Tillis, Speaker. I just want to say that I’ve just gotten
here, a freshman. I've served as a county commissioner for the past
thirty years. My resignation was effective December 31st and ever since
the election was over I’ve been excited about coming to the General
assembly, coming to Rawley, to be a part of the decision making process.
To do good things for people all across North Carolina. I couldn't wait
to be a part of this awesome body. But I witnessed over the last couple
of days that we have some serious issues. Some issues that definitely
need to be addressed if we’re going to continue to move North Carolina
forward. Now back where I come from our way of life had been corn,
tobacco, soybeans, and livestock. People made a living and we have seen
our county or counties transform themselves by hiring people, by
training people, by creating jobs. Although we are in the poverty belt
we have a very high poverty index and we have that all across North
Carolina. In the western part of the state in the eastern part of the
state. People need to work. People need jobs. We've created ten thousand
jobs over the last ten years and we've lost ten thousand jobs because
they've gone overseas. That’s no fault of the people. I’m here to say to
you this afternoon we need to make certain that our citizens are trained
and retrained. We need to continue to do what we are doing in economic
development to try and bring jobs to our counties??</p>

and have decent places to work. But more importantly, we, as a body,
need to come together and have a clear understanding of what the needs
are and recognize that poverty runs deep in eastern and western North
Carolina. Now, my mother worked at a shirt factory all the days of her
life with an eight grade education. She raised her children. And you
will find that all across eastern North Carolina as well as western
North Carolina. People have sacrificed. Have tried to make a difference.
Have done well. And we need to be that body that continues to strengthen
and uplift our citizens. I beg of you, do the right thing. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Insko, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak briefly on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the house, this bill
isn't going to bring a rush of new jobs into the state. Already, North
Carolina is ranked very high in one of the best places to do business.
We already have a very high positive business ranking. We all support
our business community.
I do think we shouldn't talk about business before, or profit before,
people so much except that just like there are welfare queens there are
also Bernie Madoffs. Just like there are probably people who misuse the
unemployment insurance, there are also Ken Lays.
The housing industry probably partly started by profits over people
because of the London inter bank offer rate. They kicked up mortgages
and caused a lot of people to have too high mortgages. Then lose their
house when they couldn't pay their bills and they lost their job.
The thing about this bill is that it could be better balanced. We have a
committee process so we can take a bill there and work through a bill in
committees and make them better. So when they come to the floor we don't
have these big long debates. We have a lot of really good amendments
that were offered that would not hurt the business community but they
have been rejected. And I think for that reason, many of us can not vote
for this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion? Further debate?
We will allow a few moments in case one or two members need to return to
the chamber.
Representative McManus, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was confused about this bill in the beginning and I realize this bill
has been out there but there a lot of freshmen in this chamber who have
not had the opportunity to read a seventy page bill. And I still haven't
found slides and documents that were supposedly attached to it. That's
probably a freshman thing and they are there and I just haven't found
them but I'll get there eventually.
But what confused me most was where the jobs where coming from in this
bill. And I honestly ask someone to confirm that the only part that was
going to create jobs was reducing tax, unemployment tax, on employers.
I'm an employer. It's a small business. It's all women except one
difficult man that I'm married to. But I manage this business. And it
takes a certain number of employees in this business. And I know pretty
much what that takes. Occasionally, we have to add on someone part time
but it would never occur to me to do with less employees because of my
unemployment tax or to add employees because I'm paying less
unemployment tax. It's not even a function in the way small businesses
work. Maybe large businesses but not small businesses.
I heard a lot of talk about freight liner which I found really
interesting because I'm from Gaston county originally and I still have
the majority of my family in Gaston county and I have extended family
members that work for freight</p>

[Speaker Change]
Lost jobs. And one extended family member that was hired to go to Mexico
to train Mexican workers to do Freightliner jobs. It wasn’t because of
the taxes here. It was because they could pay people such low wages in
Mexico that Freightliner decided to outsource their jobs. I don’t think
unemployment taxes were going to figure in significantly in that one way
or another. It was they could pay Mexican workers so much less. What
they discovered waste workers they were paying so much less were also
not doing a very good job and so they brought a lot of jobs back. It’s
probably oversimplifying it some but it still didn’t get down to taxes.
I still don’t quite see how this unemployment tax difference is going to
create very many jobs. I think it one of those areas where, we as
employers just bite the bullet. We pay a little more. We’re happy if we
pay a little less. It doesn’t make me hire more people. And it doesn’t
make me fire people. It’s just part of being an employer. You roll with
it and you make adjustments in other ways. I still struggle, and I’m
hoping somebody can really help me see how this will make a big
difference in jobs in this State. Thank you.

Further discussion, further debate. If no the question before the House
is the passage of the House Committee Substitute for House Bill four on

seven having voted in the affirmative, forty two in the negative. The
