Good afternoon, we'll call the meeting to order. Welcome. While I'm
welcoming the- and announcing the names of the sergeant at arms, staf- I
mean of the sergeant at arms and the pages, I will have the sergeant at
arms staff please distribute any material that they have, if 2 or 3 of
you could help in the back of the room, I'd appreciate it.
Our pages today are Maggie Powell, from Wilmington, Sen. Goolsby,
Jelissa Murray, Raleigh, Sen. Blue, Daniel Randell, Greensboro, Sen.
Berger. Welcome, Daniel. Ashlynn Murray, Laurenburg, Sen. McLaurin,
Spencer Zachary, Taylorsville, Sen. Allen. William Zachary,
Taylorsville, Sen. Allran. Tyler Hendricks, Greensboro, Sen. Berger.
Welcome, I hope you have a lot of fun today. I think you will, I hope
you learn something today, and I'm sure you will. And thanks of course
to our Sergeant at arms staff.
The agenda today is Senate bill, sorry, House bill 998, we have a PCS,
is there a motion to hear the PCS from Sen. Brock. All in favor of the
motion please say &quot;aye&quot;.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Motion carries, Sen. Berger will explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. It's a pleasure to be back with you and members
of the committee, and Sen. Hunt, and those socks, and Sen. Tillman with
his socks. so it's always a treat to come to finance committee.
The PCS you have before you is basically the same as the bill that was
discussed yesterday. The only change is in the provision dealing with
the local food tax and the change in the PCS repeals food from the local
tax base Nov. 1, 2014, gives counties the authority to levy a local
sales tax on food effective Jan. 1, 2015. The bill that we had yesterday
took the 2% tax on food off, which over time, it was 1% in 2014 and
remaining 1% in 2016. So that's the only change in this bill. And Mr.
Chairman, if it's appropriate I'd just like to just, with reference to
the issue of tax reform, the bill you have before you is a comprehensive
tax reform bill that addresses the needs of North Carolina in connection
with
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Meredith has a problem.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Now is this a PCS?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So did we move to hear it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes we did.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I apologize, I'm sorry. I'm sorry Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So we've been talking for years now about the need for tax reform. When
the Democrats controlled the General Assembly, they talked about the
need for tax reform. When the campaigns were waged in 2010, 2012, one of
the issues talked about was tax reform. We have since January been
discussing tax reform. In the Senate, one of the reasons that we have
been able to move as far as we have and to keep this issue in the
forefront is because of the efforts that have been made by the finance
committee, by Sen. Bob Rucho, by Sen. Bill Rabin, and by the staff of
the General Assembly. Before we get into this bill in any real depth, I
think that whatever this General Assembly does in connection with tax
reform is due in large part to the groundwork that's been laid over the
years by members of this body, and members of the house, and
particularly this year by Sen. Rucho in connection with bringing this
issue forward. This bill will bring North Carolina into the 21st century
in terms of our tax policy. It will bring us to the point where the
competition among states will be such that</p>

<p id="05:00">
[SPEAKER] North Carolina will be in the forefront of states in the
competition for jobs and in the competition for growth as the economy
expands. Now, the important thing for us to remember is that this is an
issue that has been discussed and pursued by many people.
When the Democrats were in the majority, Senator Clodfelter was pursuing
the issue of comprehensive tax reform. He and Senator Hartsell
introduced a bill this year that addresses the need. So I don’t think
the debate at this point is about the need for tax reform.
What we’re talking about at this point is exactly what it looks like.
And I would invite the Committee to look at the details of this plan and
would be more than happy to hear the debate and answer any questions.
And, Mr. Chairman, from time to time, I may need well, at many times I
may need help from staff to answer some of the more technical questions
that get asked. But with that, Mr. Chairman, the bill is here and I
would urge the Committee to pass it with a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator Burger. Members of the Committee,
questions? Senator Brunstetter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to stand for an amendment please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Do the members have copies or are they
going to be passed. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is the Committee good to go? We still have some more
in the back. Okay.  In the back. Now, does everyone have a copy? Senator
Brunstetter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’m sorry for that delay.
What this amendment does is it basically adds a year and another tier
into phasing on the treatment for the sales tax refunds for non-profits.
Essentially the impact would be that the larger non-profits have a
little bit more time to adjust to the impact of this change. I ask for
your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Senator Berger, you care to comment on that
amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think it’s a good amendment
and would urge the Committee to adopt the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Berger, further discussion from the Committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I want to thank Senator Brunstetter for this
amendment. It will help our hospitals. And all of us have been hearing
from him and others to transition into the removal of sales tax
exemption and I think this is a good move and a sound move. And I move
that we adopt the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And so, motion to adopt the amendment. Any further
discussion? All those in favor of . . . how could I have over look you,
Senator McKissick.  I’m sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s all right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just want to make exactly what the revisions are.
It looks like it started out at what $7.5 million now and going down to
$100,000 over a four year period? Is that  . . .
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Correct. Correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. I just want to make sure we’re reading
correctly. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate? Hearing none, all in
favor of the amendment please say aye. [aye] Opposed no.  The amendment</p>

<p id="10:00">
Thank you. The bill is back before us, as amended. Any discussion on
the, or questions from the committee on the bill? Senator Blue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just one quick question. I was looking at a document
from the North Carolina legal municipalities that shows a tremendous
impact based on, at least the way they analyzed it, on local
governments, because of the change in their sales tax, the food tax. I
guess you've seen this, Senator Berger?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Blue, I saw an e-mail from the league on my
e-mail account this morning. I have not had time to read it so I think I
know what it says, but I could not represent that I've read it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, it says that in some instances some of these
smaller governments would have to, that it's decreasing their revenue by
a huge amount so then they'd have to increase their tax bills by up to
50% - 60%. I looked particularly because it says with respect to two
places that I represent, Raleigh County with respect...I had Wake
County. With respect to Raleigh, it was a 10% increase. I just wondered,
can you address that because we talked about it yesterday you were
saying that most of the local governments would be left pretty much in
as good a position as they're in now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Blue, the bill repeals the State authorized
food tax that gets sent to the localities. It allows the counties to
reinstitute that tax if that's something that they need. What I would
say is two things. With the food tax included, the overall revenue is
pretty flat, it's just pretty much a swap as far as the various
differences. Individual counties may do a little bit better, some
individual counties may do a little worse. Same with municipalities.
You also have the repeal of the privilege tax, which affects the
municipalities more than it would the counties. I would say there really
are a couple of choices that are available to the local governments. One
they could prevail upon the counties to reinstitute the food tax if the
revenue is that much needed. The second option they have, as we have
here, is to reduce spending and absorb any loss of anticipated revenue
in that fashion. I would say that those are the options that would be
available to them. They can ultimately be held harmless as a result of
action by their county.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Senator Blue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In conjunction with this, if you really are going to
pursue it, would you be amenable to, as a trade off, giving local
governments more self-governing power so that they could in fact
determine the sources that they needed to go to to generate the revenue
to make up for this revenue that they say you're depriving them of?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Blue, without committing to anything in
particular as far as what that would be, I think we're always welcome to
talking to them about the options that would be available and possible
options that we would have. I mean in the bill, we give the local
governments the option to do something that will address that revenue
issue for them. But if there are some broader things, clearly we can
talk about that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Very good. Senator Jenkins?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Berger, first I'd
like to say I thank Senator Brunstetter's amendment. It does put off the
pain a little bit for one more year. But the two areas I want to look at
is, you all know, I represent one of the lowest wealth parts of this
State. I represent eight counties in northeast in North Carolina. The
main healthcare provider up there is Vident. Vident has eight or nine
hospitals. This morning they sent me a recap of what the sales tax
refund would do with the five rural ones. The bottom line is, and this
does not change it, it would just push it out one year, is they would
lose $2.2 million, not in revenue, but the bottom line would be negative
$2.2 million as a result of losing this sales tax refund. Which would
equate into a loss of over 250 jobs, it would equate into a loss of
money given to the Brody School of Medicine. Interns who are working up
there...</p>

<p id="15:00">
And also the docks that would be gone from that area in health care to
the people.
Another little item for rural North Carolina is the sales tax increase
on mobile homes and modular homes and I ask the association to tell me
what it was.
Mobile home tax increase would go up 300% modular home tax increase
would go up 95% and I just ask that you reevaluate the adverse impact
you gon' have on the rural, lower income parts of the state whether in
the east west north south or the central.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman if i could just ask the staff to let us know what total
revenue were talking about with reference to the mobile home tax
revision.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you senator.  Oh you asked staff, excuse me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The change to the modular homes when its fully implemented will be an
additional 300 million dollars to the state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator Clodfielder
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank  you mister chairman this is a question for whoever you and he
choose and I am trying to follow some of the transition provisions here
and i want to make sure i understand them correctly so as i see it here
the new business privilege tax will go on in 2015 and the repeal of
existing local and state privilege licenses goes off in january and july
of 2018 am i understanding correct that for that three year period
businesses subject to this new tax will pay the old tax and the new
privilege tax as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thats correct
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator the total amount payed would as i understand it theres a phase
out and a phase in so what you have is a situation where while you have
both the old franchise tax and the new tax the amount of the new tax
goes up as the amount of the franchise tax goes down. Id ask staff to
confirm that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wasn't asking about the franchise tax senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are we clear?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. Thats correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mr chairman.  Question for staff. Am i right that right now
all social security benefits are not taxed at all at the state level?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct at the state level.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And am i also right that this bill will impose a tax on social security
for north carolinians to the extent that its taxed at the federal level.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It would be in the income tax base yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Comment if i may mr chair.  This bill really writes a blank check into
the future.  The tax revenue losses this cycle is 600-700 million this
biennium.  The next its 2.3billion and its at least 1.3 billion every
year thereafter. Thats 2.5billion were taking out of the budget and so
then we ask ourselves well who's paying for that money. From the
questions we heard today we know property owners are going to pay
because localities are going to have to raise property taxes to offset
these losses. We know patients are going to pay because hospitals, these
are hospitals that didnt benefit from medicaid expansion, they are
having to deal with the affordable care act and in a time of
unprecedented change in the way they do business you are imposing new
taxes in a way, ive heard from all three of my hospitals in wake county,
more than 10 million from each one, thats lost jobs lost services for
patients, we now know that people on social security are going to have
to pay for this. School kids are going to have to pay. And this budget
that we're facing today that we passed out of the senate a couple weeks
ago was only 770 million.  And yet we've fired 4500 TAs weve eliminated
4800 teacher positions. What are we going to do when there is a 2.3
billion dollar hole next session. We are going to have a blank check
that the people are going to have to pay. Well i just got an analysis
from.</p>

<p id="20:00">
Budget and tax center, I don't know if you've seen it yet senator Berger
but 75% of the benefit of these tax cuts go to the top 5% of earners,
50% goes to the top 1%. So we are doing a massive tax reduction to the
wealthiest on the backs of school kids, sick people, people on social
security, and I think this is a wholly misguided policy and I hope this
committee does not advance this bill today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Berger.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Senator Stein first I disagree
with your premise with reference to the revenue issue because what
you're talking about is a diminution of projected revenue. What we need
to concentrate n is the fact that this bill would provide revenue growth
for the state of North Carolina that is consistent with what we feel is
the need for government growth in North Carolina. And so when you're
talking about growth in revenue that is two, three, four times the
inflation rate, and then you're saying we are not going to collect that
money. What I would say is that means we're leaving more money in the
pockets of average people, in the pockets of North Carolinians so that
they can spend that money as they wish. And you're right if someone
thinks that the government is going to get a certain amount of money and
has ideas on how to spend that then they're going to be disappointed if
they don't get as much as they thought they were going to get.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator Berger. Senator Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman and members of the finance
committee. I will first of all say to you last night was the best night,
best sleep night I've had in nine months. And more importantly, senator
Rabin won't be getting my 3:15 a.m. texts and emails.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I miss them already.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But first lets think about something. I don't agree
with what senator Stein just said. I think what we've learned form all
the study on this issue, and what we've learned from a lot of experts is
that the present system is dead, busted, and we can't continue doing the
way we do business. That is a given. We know it doesn't work, nibbling
around the edges doesn't work. And very simply we need a comprehensive
tax reform package. If you'll think about what happened yesterday that
was a very rare occurrence yesterday and some of you I think in the
finance committee were in attendance when we had four expert economist
present to us what a good tax reform package, a pathway to the future.
And senator McKissick brought up the question that I asked them to
address yesterday and that was what do we do to follow and what pathway
should we take to we can assure the fact that we have economic growth,
we have jobs and we have prosperity for all senator McKissick, not just
a certain few.
And in that sense those folks laid out a plan and a pathway with
certainty, with simplicity, but it was a balanced approach of how you
set the taxes into place. You also have to have the ability to dial up
or down which there are ways of accomplishing that that we can take
advantage of base don the revenue stream without locking you into any
errors. You also try a balance approach which doesn't put certain areas
at zero until revenue stream is actually achieved, and I think that is
very critical to win the confidence of not only members of the general
assembly on both republican and democrats sides but more importantly of
the public in the business community.
But that session yesterday was very rare because you find economists
rarely offer you direct input on how to solve a problem, and that's what
they offered to us yesterday. And if you look at it you're talking about
comprehensive tax reform should include lowering rates, and the rates
aren't the only issue, changing the way you do business is very
critical. and I will say to you that the bill we have before us does not
accomplish that. And also looking at finding a way to provide the
revenue growth in the long term by actually turning on all parts of the
GDP not just...</p>

<p id="25:00">
the part on sales tax that deals with just on goods, and if you don’t
make the transition over to a comprehensive broad-based plan similar to
what Dr. Roby Sawyer said yesterday and also Dr. Russo, then you are not
achieving comprehensive tax reform. You have to look at the models that
have been very successful. You look at Texas, you look at Florida, you
look at Tennessee, and yesterday Mike Walden was talking about
Tennessee, who happens to have a zero income tax, who happened to lead
the southeast in job growth. We were second to them because of the fact
that certain good things have happened, but we’ll take and learn from
their successes and actually create something better for North Carolina,
but that means actually doing something that will make a difference and
not just a stopgap approach that actually works against the direction
that we want to move as was related to our economists yesterday. What
we’re actually doing with this bill is finding a stopping point, or
actually taking a step back or two steps back. We should be passing the
tax bill that is comprehensive and achieves the goals of economic
growth, jobs and prosperity. We as elected officials need to do what is
right because the people are counting on us to listen to them rather
than the special interests. For too long special interests have run this
system, and by making the right and tough decisions, and tough decisions
mean maybe not coming back and getting reelected, but if reelection is
the only issue and not doing what’s right, then maybe none of us should
be here to return or even should be here for that reason. So that being
said, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I will tell you that I
don’t believe that this bill the way it’s written now – this is not
against tax reform; it needs to be done – but this bill is not fair and
a right pathway and should not be supported, and under those
circumstances it hurts me to say to you, but I cannot support this bill.
I will not vote for this bill because of the fact it doesn’t achieve the
goals of economic growth and job success, and in that sense, I would
hope that we would find an alternative way rather than moving forward on
this bill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator
Rucho. Senator Tillman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank
you, Senator Berger. I’ve got to go back to Senator Stein’s political
speech a little while ago and remind us history speaks loud. When we
came down here and took a hold of the budget that you all had left us,
nearly three billion dollars in the hole by their financing plans, which
just go ahead and take more from the people and spend it on all these
feel-good programs and get us in debt, and take one-time money and spend
it on recurring expenses; we’ve done away with that. We’re cutting taxes
and in this tax plan, instead of taking the money and putting it in
these programs that you would like to do, Senator, we’re giving it back
to the taxpayers and letting them decide what to do with it, and this
will put a billion dollars or more in the taxpayers’ pockets while
cutting government spending and getting our budget in line where we can
handle the finances of the state without going into deficit spending,
and there’s not 45 hundred teachers been fired. Not a single teacher
will lose their job as far as the state money goes in this budget, but
teacher assistants is… we’re still debating how many of those would be
gone. Yes, there may be several hundred of those gone, but when you’re
going to tell this story, let’s tell it right. We’re not firing 45
hundred teachers. Last year you remember we devastated the budget and
fired nine thousand teachers. Those are numbers that scare people to
death and they’re not correct, and if the NCA or you or anybody else
wants to publish that, we’ll ?? and I’ll give you a ten-day headcount
next fall. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, I promise my point has
nothing to do with the budget. It has to do with this bill. One of the
principles that I’ve brought into and I think most of the proposals I’ve
seen have tried to work on, it’s very hard to work on, actually – it’s
really hard to work on, is the idea that you want to have your sales tax
not pyramid on you and not compound over supply chains through putting
the sales tax on transactions between businesses on business inputs, and
that’s very, very hard to do. You can’t get it perfect, but I think to
some extent or other, all the bills that I’ve seen so far this session
at least until today try to move in that direction. One of the things
that sort of interests me about this bill is section 11.1, which repeals
current sales tax exemptions that apply to a number of business to
business transactions.</p>

<p id="30:00">
In our current tax code we’re trying to endorse that policy of not
pyramiding the sales tax down through the supply chain.  That’s why we
have created a number of these exemptions.  And I thought the goal of
reform was to try and move even further in that direction so end sales
tax on the end product was as low as possible.  And so, here I see
though in section 11.1, we are in effect putting the sales tax for the
first time on a number of business inputs for a number of business
transactions.  I am disappointed in that and I am not sure why that is a
good direction to move in.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you, Senator Clodfelter.  Senator McKissick, this is the last
question from the membership.
[Speaker Change]
Okay.  The thing I would have really liked for us to have done is to
spend a little more time and thought on what we are doing.  I know we
had several plans before us.  I am going to refer to them as the House
Plan, the ?? Plan, the Clodfelter Plan.  I would have really liked for
us to have spent some time trying to identify the common elements among
them that would really create the best plan for this state.  I think we
all agree that tax reform is imperative and is absolutely necessary and
we don’t want to put ourselves in a position where our income stream is
particularly volatile when we go through a recessionary period.  So I
think that is something we can all agree upon regardless of our party
affiliations and our backgrounds.  But the direction that we have here
now leaves us with not a plan that is perhaps revenue neutral but it
creates a $1.5 billion to $2 billion gap, a shortfall.  That deeply
concerns me.  I would rather see us come up with something that was
closer to being revenue neutral in its impact and in its design.  It
concerns me when we talk about a flat corporation tax.  It may not be
called a tax.  You may call it something different, but it’s $5,000 for
C Corporations.  And regardless of whether you are a 5 person
corporation making $100,000 or $200,000 a year or whether you have 500
employees and making $20 million a year or a 1,000 employees, you all
pay $5,000.  And I think you need something that is tiered.  I think
it’s the wrong approach to take.  Something that would be more
thoughtful I could support.  I don’t like the fact if you are a family
of four and you are meeting the federal poverty guidelines and you are
up there around $27,000, $28,000 a year you are paying significant taxes
under this plan.  That deeply troubles me.  And when I looked at the
impact on cities and non-profits, I just looked at a chart to try and
identify the impact this has on small towns.  I know in my district I’ve
got Creedmoor, Oxford, Butner.  Oxford and Butner are going to have to
increase their property tax by approximately 11 percent to offset the
impact that this bill would have upon them.  And they are small rural
counties.  If you look at some other cities like Calabash they would
have to increase their property tax by 63.7 percent.  Carolina Shores
28.8 percent.  Connelly Springs 49.8 percent.  Rosman 40.6 percent.
Boardman 908 percent. These small towns it’s going to have a devastating
and profound impact.  And I think we have to think about how we address
those types of issues moving forward.  So I do have concerns about the
plan that is before us and its impact our towns and our communities, the
non-profits that are there, our hospitals.  We have hospitals in rural
areas that are already struggling.  This could be the one thing that
gives them the death blow that I don’t want to see them take.  These
people are underserved in these rural areas.  I would like to see us
take more than an hour of reflection and really give it some thought.
And maybe even pull a house committee, finance committee members and
senate committee members together and try to look at ways that we could
jointly identify something that people can embrace.  Yes, arbitrarily
looking at a deadline that’s on a calendar and saying we want to get out
of here by then, letting that be the guidepost by which we decide upon
tax reform has the potential to create some profound public policy that
is not in the best interest of this state and could have some
devastating impacts on those of low and moderate incomes and upon our
towns and cities.

in the rear of the room. If you need assistance, please call on the
Sergeant at Arms. And each person will have a couple of minutes to
speak. And please limit your comments to the bill as at hand. And, with
that, we will open the public comment. The first speaker is going to be
Mr. Lou Ebert, North Carolina Chamber. If you'll come forward please,
identify yourself. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman, and
good afternoon. My name is Lou Ebert. I am President and CEO of the
North Carolina Chamber of Commerce. We're the state's largest
broad-based business organization, representing companies of all sizes
and shapes and all SIC codes across the state. And I'm pleased to be
here to talk on behalf of this legislation. You know, it's interesting,
in traveling the state, as we do often, there's not a day that goes by
that we're not talking about how to create more jobs. And there's not a
day that goes by where you're not talking about how to modernize the tax
code. I think, as you're talking about today with this legislation,
you're finding out they're inseparably connected. You can't create more
jobs if you don't have the right tax climate. So, in forecasting the
economic future for our state, employers understand that tax policy is
de facto economic development policy. With the input of companies of all
sizes across the state, we've had a chance to look at a wide range of
proposals, not just this year but in past years [SPEAKER CHANGES] ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] and we've been very consistent. We've said five things
were important for us to support tax reform in our state. It needs to
improve our competitiveness. It needs to have equity. It needs to be
efficient, simplicity, and add certainty. After reviewing all these
proposals, we feel that house bill 98 most effectively achieves these
five goals. And we're pleased that Senator Berger has brought this
forward. You know, my job, I get a chance to travel around the country
and talk to other states and other state chambers. And I don't have to
tell you the competition for jobs has become fierce. When you see
governors like Rick Perry running full-page ads in California and
Illinois, telling businesses in those states that their governor is
working to put them out of business, you know the competition is fierce.
I don't have to tell you that North Carolina's been at the receiving end
of the wrong end of the jobs equation too. We've lost 330,000 jobs since
the downturn, and John Connaughton, the UNC Charlotte economist, told me
yesterday that we've added 27,400 net jobs in the first ten years of
this century. If we're serious about jump-starting the job creation
machine that used to characterize North Carolina in the 90's, we know
what we have to do. The Tax Foundation, as you heard yesterday, I think,
sends an important signal that North Carolina is serious about competing
for jobs. To move from 44th to 6th I think sends a signal in North
Carolina we're serious too. We think the Tax Simplification and
Reduction Act creates a simpler, fair system that tax payers who
understand and easy to comply. Thank you very much for your leadership.
Look forward to working on tax reform. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Lou.
Our next speaker will be Mr. Herman Stone. Mr. Stone, welcome. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, President Pro Tempore,
and the committee. My name is Herman Stone. I'm a small business owner
of Stone Theatres and resident of Mecklenburg County. I applaud Senator
Berger and the members of this committee for their interest in reducing
the taxes for North Carolina businesses and individuals. Unfortunately,
the bill before this committee targets a specific industry. It raises
taxes on my businesses and my customers and ignores the unintended
consequences that result from raising taxes on movie theaters. Going to
the movies is the most affordable form of out-of-home entertainment,
drawing substantial numbers of fixed and lower-income people, including
senior citizens. Increasing admission taxes is regressive and could put
the cost of going to the movies out of the reach of those least able to
pay for it. Movies have traditionally been the most affordable choice of
entertainment in America and have especially valuable during difficult
economic times of this country. Unsurprisingly, ticket prices for movies
have increased the least among all the major forms of entertainment over
the past decade. We do not want to collect higher taxes on consumers
simply because they walk through the door of a movie theater. Three out
of four families with children regularly attend movies. Of the movie
patrons, fifty-nine percent have household incomes</p>

is Alexandra Sirota director at the budget and tax center or project of
the justice center. the long called for the state to address the
problems with our tax system more grateful for this opportunity to weigh
in today. certainly we are very concerned with the proposal before you
and we oppose this plan because it does represent bad choice for the
state 's economy, women walk through some of our recent analysis that we
just released in the past half-hour on this tax plan delivers the
greatest benefits to the wealthiest taxpayers are analysis, which uses
an economic incidence model finds that forty nine percent of all the tax
cut that's less income, sales of everything and there goes to the top
one percent of those who have incomes on average, almost him dollars in
revenue loss that will result with raising local taxes will likely
result in either raising local taxes on sales and property taxes. as
we've heard are cutting services. the children, seniors and families. I
you and I think it important to note that not everyone will accept from
the income tax changes in this plan fully on the quarter and oversee the
tax increase under this plan. finally, as I said this is bad for the
economy. the more than one billion dollars loss will require cuts to
schools, public safety, which support our competitiveness and quality of
life. moreover, we know that with the elimination of the corporate
income tax. the vast majority of those cuts will be exported to
shareholders outside of the state only as few as ten percent of state
residents will benefit from that, for income tax cuts and businesses
care about more than just taxes. they care about an educated and skilled
workforce quality infrastructure, transportation networks and attractive
quality of life for their employees, all of which are at risk with the
revenue losses in the spill over the long term. the adoption of the flat
tax will also jeopardizes the ability of the state to benefit from the
growing economy with that. I close my remarks and argue lots of the

think is needed, and however I wanted to share a few a few red flags
that we certainly on what you think your attention relative to the bill
under him him as you have heard that Social Security benefits are taxed
under this plan. now, we haven't completed our analysis on this and I
haven't found them to Berger, you said that you donate beyond tax staff
available to help. posted to do that so we appreciate that, but we do
have some red flags on when it comes to the overall tax burden than a
date of people on Social Security. even with your tax bracket that would
like to see what the analysis shows me did they get my beds with no
income might be most impacted by tax and Social Security. as mentioned
earlier, most states do not currently taxes and security at that right
now in arthritis with thirty six states, it does not. the second issue
is that we are concerned that the proposal may not generate enough

...Chair, already has 16,000 people on the waiting list. We're serving
7,000 less people today under that program than we did 10 years ago just
because the cost of service delivery is going up. With the increase in
the population for seniors, right now we've got 1.3 million people 65
and plus. In 20 years it's going to be 2.3 million. If we don't have
these basic services to help people stay in their homes and help support
their families, many of them are going to nursing homes and we're going
to pay a huge fee with Medicaid because it doesn't take long at $70,000
a year for most folks to go through a nest egg. So we encourage you to
look at what the long range ramifications are this and whether or not
those critical services that we need to help folks are there.
And the last thing that I just want to mention is that it's already been
raised about the issue about what will happen with increase in property
tax and things like that. We certainly echo that. Most seniors in North
Carolina own their homes, or many of them own their homes and we often
hear the saying that a lot of seniors are house rich and cash poor. And
the property taxes go up in addition to some of the other tax burdens
that we could potentially happen, it is going to be a double whammy for
lots of folks.
Again, thank you for allowing us to talk. We applaud you on the efforts
to reform taxes and look forward to being part of the dialog for a
solution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, ma'am. Senator Hartsell? You're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have an amendment. I think
it's been distributed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Do the members have a copy of the
amendment? Senator Hartsell, will you please explain your amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually, this is, it's sort of a clarifying matter,
but for many years we had a cigarette tax stamp requirement. We repealed
that but at the time we repealed that stamping, we did not repeal the
discount that's available. There's nobody else out there that we pay to
file tax returns and what this does is simply say that hence forth,
those stamps. This doesn't require the imposition of a stamp, it simply
says we're not going to pay for a discount, which is actually created a
windfall in some cases and just eliminates the discount for filing the
return. That's all it does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Hartsell. Do I hear a motion to
accept the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is that a motion, Senator Jenkins?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, motion by Senator Jenkins to accept the
amendment. Any discussion? Hearing none, all those in favor of the
amendment please say aye. Opposed no. Motion carried.
That brings us back to the original. Any further comments or discussion
on that? Senator Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll try to make this as
brief as I can. Several years ago I know Senator Jenkins and Senator
Clodfelter and Senator Hole tried to propose a new tax plan. And I
remember, Senator Jenkins, you remember, I'm sure well, just how hard it
was to move that plan forward because it seemed like you could never get
a consensus because any time you change the status quo with any kind of
plan, there's always going to be winners and losers. We have to I guess
admit to that, but the losers always got loud and it always stopped what
you were trying to accomplish. And I think as this year's progressed,
we've seen, this may be about the fourth plan I guess we've looked at
this year, to try to find some tax reform. And it's pretty much a
repeat, I guess, of what we saw four or five years ago when we looked at
tax reform because, again, any time you try to move the needle you're
going to have someone that opposes what's trying to happen. Because,
again, on the front end there seems to be some winners and losers,
because I think most can't see the long term effect of what it will do.
I think it's what do you do to me now is kind of the mentality. I think
anytime you look at any kind of tax reform. I think it is difficult for
anyone to look out four or five years to see what happens at the end of
the reform and what it will mean to the State or to an individual or to
a business, or to a certain group of people. And so that's when you have
people line up against pretty much any plan that I think you bring
forward. And I think anybody in this room can sit down and spend three
years to come up with a plan, propose it and you would probably have the
same opposition that we've got today from maybe a different group, but
the same type opposition. Because that's just the nature of what tax
reform does, I guess. Because most can never look four or five years
down the road.</p>

That can only look at a year down the road or 6 months down the road.
One thing I do know is, the state of North Carolina now  with its tax
structure is the most uncompetitive I guess in the southeast when you
look at the rates. Our corporate rate’s the highest in the south east,
our income tax is the highest in the south east, our sales tax rate’s
right there with anyone.  And this is a great thing that we’ve got a
great state otherwise because I don’t know that we could compete with
anyone otherwise if it was based just on our tax. Because that’s how
uncompetitive we are with our tax structure. And I think all of our
plans have tried to address that issue. And I think some states have
done it quicker, have moved forward quicker.  I think Texas is probably
the biggest example in the state. You now Texas’ economy is on fire
right now, you know everybody wants to be in Texas it seems like and
it’s basically because of their tax structure.  You know they have the
best competitive rates in the nation, or some of them, and I guess their
quality of life is good as well. This plan’s not perfect. I don’t think
any plan will be perfect for everybody. You can’t make one that’s
perfect for everybody.  But I’ll tell you what it will do.  It will
finally get us competitive, not just in the south east but in the nation
when it comes to tax rates. And I can say this.  When you look at
recruiting across this county and trying to bring businesses that bring
jobs to whatever state.  If you’re not competitive on the front end with
a tax policy, you don’t even know what you missed.  Because they rule
you out before they decide anything.  And that’s exactly what’s happened
to North Carolina. We’re so uncompetitive tax wise, that many companies
look at us with our tax policy and they say, why do we want to go there?
 Let’s look somewhere else.  And I’m in the car industry and I can tell
you I think a good example is the car manufacturers.  Look around us.
They’ve located in South Carolina, they’ve located in Tennessee, they’ve
located in every other state in the south east but North Carolina. And
why do you think that.  It’s because we’re not competitive.  It doesn’t’
make sense to locate in North Carolina.  That’s just a fact. And yet you
know we get into this debate today and you know I’m afraid and I’m not
sure it’s not going to help my business.  I don’t really help anybody’s
on the front end I think everybody’s trying to figure it out.  But I can
tell you this, doing nothing. Doing nothing is no answer. Now that’s the
easy thing to do. We can sit here and keep the status quo.  And that’s
what seems to be the case over and over up here when it comes to tax
policy is let’s not step on anybody’s toes, let’s not do anything. The
status quo’s working okay. Well you heard the stats earlier today. The
status quo is not working in North Carolina.  That is a fact.  Look at
all the numbers. It is not working in North Carolina.  Look how many
jobs that we’ve lost compared to every other state in the nation,
particularly south east.  Look at what the other states are doing to
bring industries to their states. They’re all beating North Carolina.
North Carolina has got a broken plan that is not working.  That’s fact.
And anybody that sits in a room denies that is flat room.  You can’t say
that. It is time we move forward. This bill again, is not perfect. And I
can tell you next year we’ll be back probably tweaking this bill.
Trying to do something different.  Just like al legislation.  We pass a
lot of legislation that’s not perfect on the first time around. And we
have to tweak it and we have to look at it and we have to work number
and massage it. But if you do nothing, you don’t’ even have that
opportunity. And I think a lot of people in this room that are satisfied
to do that again. Do nothing.  But to me that is a poor answer.  And up
here is not easy at times. Up here you have to make hard tough decisions
at time. And I think this is that time. I think this is one of them. And
if we’re not willing to do something this year on tax reform, I’ll
predict that tax reform will go away for the next ten years because
nobody will have the nerve to bring it back up and try it again after
what’s gone on this year.  Now if that’s the answer you want, if you
want to put it off another 10 years and let us stay the status quo then
I say let’s do that. But that is a poor answer and that’s not the way I
feel about this issue. I think we’ve got a good bill that we can
continue.</p>
