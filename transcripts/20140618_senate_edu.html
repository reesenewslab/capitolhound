the well colonel senator honored senator it's yours.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess I could say it's crunch time no first I'd like to thank the
staff and help all they have done a great job on this bill of
synergizing all that we had during the proceedings of the joint
legislative research commission that worked on this issue during the
past several months they worked with both the military they brought the
military folks in [??] educators in to try to then come up with a way to
look at this problem so that we would do the right thing for the
military and for civilian work force the bill is good for work force
development and it also follows through on the idea that we're a
military friendly state we'd like to keep their skills aboard when they
get out in essence it enhances the effectiveness of the original bill
the original bill was a tad short in terms of having date certain for
things to happen the application process was in place there weren't very
many applicants and some areas were a lot than others but this the new
bill flushes that out a little bit and causes other things to happen.

<p id="05:00">
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a question about the childcare piece, if
I may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You may, following up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Help me understand what we're doing here. Are we saying that
childcare facilities that don't receive public funds through either NC
Pre-K or childcare subsidy no longer have to be licensed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff would you, would you take that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, if they are operating a childcare facility for more than
six and one half hours a day but they do not receive NC Pre-K or
childcare subsidy then you're right, they would not have to be licensed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Question for the bill sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, sir, following up. That will be a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. What is the public policy rationale to have, to de-license or
to not require our childcare facilities to be licensed. Even private
schools need to get licensed even if they don't take public money.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well the concern I have is, is that under our statute as it is now when
they're licensed the before and after school programs become problematic
and so what this bill is attempting to do is allow the before and after
school programs to occur. We also have, do we have anyone from the
non-public schools here that can speak to this? I think that they can,
with the Chair's indulgence, if, Richard Stevens would you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Richard Stevens,
Smith Anderson law firm. I represent the North Carolina Association of
Independent Schools. Here's the situation. A lot of independent school,
non-public schools, have operated for years programs where the parent
drops off the child in the morning when they go to work, pick them up
when they get off work. And so they're there longer than six and a half
hours. Recently, in the last year or so, the department has been
interpreting the law to say, &quot;well if you do it more than six and a
half hours of that then for the portion that you are having the child
more than six and a half hours you've got to go through the entire
licensing process.&quot; The purpose here is to allow those non-public
schools, and you see it's narrowed to just those, to be able to continue
to do what they've been doing, which is to have the child there all day,
it's a very family friendly bill, without having to go through the
entire licensing process. We're talking the same children in the same
building with the same faculty where they've been all day in school so
they be before school or after school without going through all the same
process that the, some of the department think they should under the
current statute. It's clarifying.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Question for the speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Family friendly can be interpreted one of two ways, family
friendly may make it easier for these schools to operate in the way they
may have been operating in the past without being licensed but family
friendly could also be insuring that programs meet certain basic
standards to ensure the health and well-being of children. What is it
about being licensed as a childcare facility that is onerous that these
folks want an exemption?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
When I served in the Senate I had a similar provision involving after
hours programs and the YMCA's were coming in and doing programs outside
with the same playground equipment that the schools have had for years
and the children play on every day came under different rules in the
after hours. Same kids, same equipment, same playground, different rules
and the General Assembly saw fit three years ago to change that. This is
similar to that. These are kids who are in their same school and many of
them are already doing this, frankly, a number of schools are in a
quandary about what to do with this new interpretation. To go through
the licensing process, as you know, is a very separate system.
Regulations are about an inch and a half thick. These schools are all
non-public schools, which are defined by either those accredited by the
state board or accredited by a national or regional accrediting agency
or a member of our Association of Independent Schools and receive no
state funding. This would not qualify these schools to receive Pre-K
money or any of the daycare slot money. It's just doing what they've
been doing for, frankly, a number of years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Stevens, thank you Senator Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Question over here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just want to get on the list.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant, you're on my list.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you. Thank you. I got you. Well I have two questions. One is
following up on Mr. Stein's question about the licensed childcare and
maybe this would be for Mr. Stevens or Mr. Barringer or the staff, but
is there anything that requires this to be connected with the operation
of the non</p>

in finance, if we can just add it instead of replace it. I don't know
what it would hurt. I mean we got a kazillion over there now anyway, so.
[speaker changes] Alright let's let staff work on that and see what we
can come up with. Good question. [speaker changes] Thank you. [speaker
change] Yea, staff does have a comment on this please. [speaker change]
So, the original license plate never received the threshold number of
applications to be produced. So, it was never produced for purchase.
[speaker changes] That answers the question [speaker changes] Thank you.
Sir, we did have a question or comment. [speaker changes] Senator
Tillman, I think with all the news media going out, lately, on  teachers
and pay raises, that we would probably be able to get a lot of support
for these licence tags and I would think the news media would pick up on
it and let people know that this is a way to support their teachers.
[speaker changes] I'm sure the news would observer and would be glad to
run a front page on this license tag and show it and ask all the PTAs in
this state to support it which we will be doing and will be going around
the state to promote this. If you do this right, I think it will be a
good vehicle. Number one it's a super P.R. thing to say, I support the
teachers, I support education, and I do believe with education in the
spotlight, we will have a successful run on that. I sure we'll get,
cameras will be all over the place. [laughter] [speaker change] Senator
Buffit did you have a question? Staff got it. Senator Robinson? [speaker
changes]  Thank you Mr. Chair. Senator Tillman, I just heard staff say
something about threshold in order to get it issued. Can you tell me,
share with me, what's their bigger threshold. I supported you on this
wheel? [laughter] I want to see it work, so what is the necessary
threshold? [speaker changes] Staff what was the threshold? [speaker
change] In general the threshold is that you have to receive
three-hundred applications for production. However, since this is a
license plate that has a full color background, another step says you
have an additional two-hundred applications before production starts. So
five-hundred applications before the plate can be created by DMV.
[speaker change] If Senator Rucho and Senator Apodaca and Senator Pate
would put one on each of their vehicles we would be half way there.
[laughter] I believe we could make that five-hundred threshold.
Different question. [change speaker] Do you have any further questions
or any motions? Senator Curtis. Alright Senator Curtis does have a
motion. This is going to be a motion that's favorable to the PCS,
unfavorable to  the original bill, with a recommendation to be referred
to finance. Very good. All in favor? Aye? [speaker changes] Opposed no?
The aye have it and the PCS passes with a recommendation. Thank you very
much, Senator Tillman and we have one more bill. I will be handing the
chair back to you. [speaker change] We will call the next senator
bearing ,its yours. Do we have, I have a motion for the adoption of the
PCS. Senator wade moves, second by senator cook. all in favor? aye.
opposed. alright it's adopted. [speaker change] May I have the floor
sir? [speaker change] It's yours. [speaker change] Thank you. The PCS
before you clarifies some of the changes that we need in the
disabilities scholarships that were adopted in the last session. There
are several points that were implemented to be clarified. All the stake
holders have been involved in the drafting and I know of no opposition.
There is a second part to this bill as well and it already passed as
part of senate bill seven thirty-four, the regulatory reform act. [??]
in this actual piece actually was passed unanimously because it was a
minute on the floor so the language in this PCS could conform to the
language in  the reform bill. What hits bill does, as a reminder, it
allows parents to who have children in non-public schools, to have them
in before and after school programs with their faculty and staff ?? its
also been approved by stake holders including the non-public schools and
also the office early childhood development with no, opposition to this
bill and I urge your support. If there are any questions if staff would
like to. [speaker changes] Well,we will, if staff needs to with
questions. Senator Barefoot had his hand up first [speaker changes]
First I would like to say. Senator Barringer, you have done a great job
with this bill, and I sit on the council for exceptional children and
they are excited about this bill. So I thank you so much and at the
appropriate time I would like to move</p>

<p id="15:00">
We’ll hold out for just a moment. Any clarifications from staff needed?
Senator Stein. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ve read the
bill and the write up and I still don’t understand what we’re changing.
Does… I know that we moved from a tax credit to a voucher when we...
last year, two years ago. Does this allow the voucher to go to different
schools? For instance, does it now allow people who home school their
children to get the voucher? I just don’t know what the purpose of these
changes are, what the effect is. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, we also
have Representatives of the ARC here as well if they can help with
staff. Sorry, I just want to make that clear. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We’ll go
to staff first. I know Julia Adams is here but we’ll go to staff first
on that one, Senator Stein. That’s a Harvard Law question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] What are we doing different here and what are we doing?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m happy to walk through all the changes if you’d
like me to. On that specific question, students who were being
homeschooled were already eligible for the scholarship grant for any
related services, though one limitation that was placed on is that
parents could not be reimbursed for education the provided themselves,
but that grant could be used under the prior, so it does not change
that. It could be used for related services that the students were
using. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What are related services? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Stein, this is Patsy Pierce from Research. Related services are defined
under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, and under
Article 9 of our general statutes. We concur with that definition, so
you would have to look under IDEA. There is quite a comprehensive list
of related services. Related services are used to help a child to access
their special education, so it could be anything from adaptations,
accommodations, specific transportation, ability to help a child who is
blind have mobility training, so there is quite a comprehensive list and
we could send you that citation from IDEA if that would be helpful.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If we don’t have another
hand, I would ask Julia Adams to come to the mic in the back and expand
a little bit on why we’re doing what we’re doing to make sure we include
the handicapped. Julia, if you would, name and organization. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Tillman. My name is Julia Adams. I am the
Assistant Director of Government Relations for the ARC of North
Carolina. I am also the lobbyist for the autism society of North
Carolina. Senator Stein, thank you very much for your question. We
appreciate it. Some of the language was not exactly the same as our
previous tax credit, and once it went to a new agency under the state of
North Carolina, there was some confusion about the interpretation of
related services for parents who had qualified for the grant, and what
this bill does is basically put definitions back in that were originally
in the tax credit bill that you passed to provide more clarity and more
directive to the new agency within our state government that is
overseeing these grants so that individuals who apply and receive the
grant can actually get the proper reimbursement at the end. In addition,
it adds the section dealing with assistive technology. For many students
with intellectual development disabilities and disabilities across a
wide, broad spectrum, we had not clarified the assistive technology
portion of the original two bills. This does it, and it also allows
individuals in nonprofit organizations to sit down and assist with
clarifying changes as we move forward with the program. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Stein. Thank you, Julia. Thank you. And stay there in
case you’re needed. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Very
helpful explanation. Appreciate that. How does this fit with the general
vouchers that we authorized in the budget last year? I know there was
about 10 to 11 million of money for the general vouchers. Do these
special needs vouchers come out of that 10 million, or is there a
separate allotted amount of money for them, or is there not a cap to the
amount that goes to this program? [SPEAKER CHANGES] You want staff to
tackle that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like staff to take that please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, this
is ?? with the Research Division. It is a separate appropriation in the
2013 budget bill. I’m going to be a little off, but I think it was three
and a half million and then four million the second year of the biennium
for these scholarships that was appropriated in the 2013 budget.</p>

<p id="25:00">
Non-public school or could they just at some other time when the
non-public school is not operating just basically operate a childcare
facility without it being licensed? Is there anything that says it has
to be the same students in the school or while the school is operating
or how would this, is there any rule that can relate it to this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let a staff member have a crack at it to start with.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant, so non-public schools who operate
childcare facilities in general for more than 6.5 hours per day, they
have to be accredited by national or regional accrediting agencies that
have early childhood standards and they have to be licensed in general,
but for this particular bill if this was passed it would exempt those
non-public schools who don't offer NC Pre-K classes or who don't accept
childcare subsidy from being licensed, but otherwise non-public schools
who do operate a childcare facility for more than 6.5 hours a day, they
would still have to be licensed. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And this is something
that I just don't understand. So is this something that the non-public
school is doing in addition to the schooling, to it's schooling function
already? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Senator, that's correct. Many non-public
schools who operate a childcare facility, they offer wrap around, or
after school care, other kinds of activities beyond the school day. A
school day is usually defined as 6.5 hours. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK, and
one more follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK,
so what is now, is now they allowed to operate these programs within
that 6.5 hour window, and if they go over that window they get a
license? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Correct, except for the ones who would be
exempt now if this bill passes? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I have one more
question in a different area, Mr, Chair. But I'm open, I'm interested in
your help. You were going to make a comment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I was
going to tell you we're separating, we've got two different things going
on. You've got your school going on, which is accredited, all right,
both nationally and regionally in most cases, you've got a before and
after school program, same facility, same people there, same people that
are already licensed are doing a before and after school program. We're
just exempting them from those regulations if they don't have any of the
state funded programs, like basically the preschool, you know the ??.
That's two different things there. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So I have one other
question on the other end, and this is I guess in sections maybe 1 and 2
or something, we're changing eligibility and it looks like I was asking
staff to review what we're changing, but I see in particular I have a
concern that there's no need for IEP and there's no need for daily
special ed services. Can somebody explain why that's the case, and then
what else are we changing in terms of eligibility for the scholarship?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll let staff take that because it's very technical,
but I think we can get you comfortable with that. Staff would you help
with that because we actually made, I looked closely at that. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The eligibility criteria are changed in the following ways: you
do notice on line 20 where it strikes out requires an individualized
educational plan and replaces that with is a child with a disability.
The concern that was raised in implementation over the first year is
that students once they go into a non-public school setting no longer
receive an IEP. An IEP is only done in a public school setting, instead
they receive something called a services plan and that's provided for
under IDEA. In terms of initial evaluation for a child who's never been
in a public school setting, they also would never receive an IEP,
because that's done in the public school. They receive, and if there's
anyone from DPI who wants to explain this in more detail, something
called a deck, and there's different levels of the deck that go through
that are the evaluation process that determine if the child is a child
with a disability under Federal and State laws. So this was changed
because there were concerns because these students as they leave the
school system and are reevaluated over the years would never actually
have something called an IEP, but they would have appropriate
documentation to show they are a child with a disability. The next
change where it says receives special education and related services on
a daily basis, if you go over to the next page, page 2, to the new
definition of how scholarships is defined, it's</p>

Now change to say students would receive special education on a daily
basis. I'm sorry, it's line 20 on page 2. So funds awarded by the
authority to students to be used to receive special education on a daily
basis while attending either a non-public school or north carolina
public school for which payment of tuition is required. This was another
thing as they began implementing it. Related services because they are
sometimes those bridge type things are frequently not provided on a
daily basis, perhaps twice a week or something. But special education is
what qualifies you under the federal law and so it was special on a
daily basis was what it was changed to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And thank you for your question
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Seeing one other hand, two other hands, Senator Robinson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mr. chairman. Senator Bryant question then brought up another
question for me. I don't see anywhere in here where it says that that
other eligibility criteria form is required. Is that in here where it
says that that evaluation has to be done and has to be documented,
senator ?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll take that and then staff can follow up if we need more detail. I
actually worked on the p.c.s yesterday and if you look on the first page
on line 13 it says disability as defined in gs115c10632. If you go to
that statue it actually talks about either an i.e.p or I don't have my
notes here but I'll refer to staff but that whole process, the federal
process,  of applying a child for disability because I was concerned
about that as well because having been a foster parent all those years I
recognize that there are many children with disabilities but we want to
make sure the right children are getting the right benefits. So if staff
if you will read further clarification I will yield to staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson of the s.e.a.a as part of it's rule making authority
because the eligibility criteria that are set out on page one does
require the child to demonstrate they are a child with a disability,
does require them to provide the appropriate documentation. There is
another change on page five to help facilitate this to ensure because
those deck forms and i.e.ps and service plans are provided by the local
education agencies, the l.e.a.'s. To parents it's their responsibilities
under i.d.a to do those. So there is a new revision to require the state
board as part of it's monitoring duties for i.d.a to ensure that those
leas are conducting evacuations for parents who believe there child may
be a child with a disability within a timely manner so that they could
vilify if the chose to and then secondly because they do have to re
qualify every three years to ascertain wether they still qualify that
they would have too provide those re evaluations
{SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, thank you. One follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, Senator Barringer are you indicating to me that you are going to do
amendment to make that clear in  here or what are you saying ? Because
here it says conduct evaluation requested by a child parent or guardians
and than some cases, I don't think that we can always count on parents
to, even if a child has a regular disability in a school system. Often
times it's the councilors and the teachers that recognize that something
here isn't as it should be and then to get that evaluation done to get
the e.i.p exedra done  so additional services and so in cases of other
children who are in non public setting I think we owe them the same
concern that if a parent can't recognize that, that they're is something
that says that we should have that done or some language to make sure
parent or who ever understands that we ought to make sure that that
evaluation documentation is in place.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, may I ?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barringer
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I didn't indicate that I planned to amend. What I said was, that I
actually added section 2 of that statue to make it clear that we are
following those guide lines for disability that we're making sure that
these funds are used for children with disabilities. I will refer to
staff but I don't think it's necessary to amend this bill. I think that
we've covered the water front and I know with the stake holders that
they have the same concerns and I think that this bill goes about as far
as it can to protect those children with disabilities. If you have a
specific question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any institution  should worth there souls is going to consult with
parents and you're going to do that and you're going to let parents know
that's needed. I don't think we need that though if you wanna try a
floor amendment.</p>

Senator Robinson, you’re welcome, too. Senator Jenkins had a motion. No
comment, okay. Staff? ?? Let’s have it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson, one thing that, it’s not covered in
this bill because it is separate, but it is covered under federal law.
There’s a process already in statute both under federal law and state
called Child Fund that actually does require LEAs on an annual basis to
reach out to non-public schools and other settings to identify children
with disabilities and to work with those locations; so, it’s not part of
this program, but it already exists under law that there is a mechanism
for that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jenkins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I move to a favorable report
of the proposed committee substitute. I assume it’s, what it is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah. We've got the PCS already included and that’s
your motion. Do I have a burning question back there? Senator Raven,
your hands been, I don’t know, what’s up or, is it up? I’ll take ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, it was. I've got ?? ??. I've got three quick
questions to Senator Barringer. Does the bill the way it’s written now
improve the quality of life of the children for which it’s aimed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does it make it, the kid, the children less safe?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Not in any way.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do the parents make input into the decision process?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Every step of the way.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Hearing and seeing no other hands we have a
motion from Senator Jenkins. All in favor aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any opposed? Motion carried. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And now that it’s passed we’d like to say thank you.
Thank you for your difficult questions because this is important,
important legislation. I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No other business. The committee is adjourned. Thank
you, all of you.</p>
