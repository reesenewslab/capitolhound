<p id="00:00">
welcome to the June 5th meeting of the commerce and job development, my
name is tom murray, I'm the chair of the committee, we have some pages
with use today, pages when I say your name will you please stand and
wave so we can see who you are, We have Cole Curpatrick from Moore
county, sponsored by representative bowls, Marcus Mitchell from Wake
county sponsored representative stan, Raschonda Herst from Wake county,
sponsored by Representative Stan and Lindsey Jackson from Wake county,
sponsored by representative Jackson. We also have sergeant at arms
helping us with operations today, we have Bill Bass, Joe Crook, Doug
Harris, Martha Gadston. Thank you for your service today. Members we
will be taking a vote on senate bill 76, there is a proposed committee
substitute for the bill and Representative Katlyn moves that the PCS be
probably for us, all those in favor say aye, all opposed say no. The
ayes have it and I will recognize representative Stone to begin, Senator
Buck Newton is here with us, Senator Newton, welcome to the house
commerce and job development committee, thank you for your presence,
thank you for this legislation and I recognize you to debate, present
the bill. Representative Stone and Representative Bowls will likely join
you, and representative Hagar.
[Change Speaker]
The more the marrier, That's the way we do this business
[Change Speaker]
Its a group effort
[Change Speaker]
its a group effort, North Carolina, thats exactly right. Thank you mr
chairman, members of the committee I appreciate very much being here,
this is the result of a lot of effort buy a lot of different people, to
try to do whats right for North Carolina. North Carolina needs the jobs,
North Carolina needs the jobs and America needs the energy and that's
what this senate bill 76 is all about. That's the reason why we started
working on this as a phase two to get North Carolina ready, and to get
these companies down her investing in this state and hiring our citizens
and paying royalties and generally speaking ramping up our economic
activities, that's the purpose of this bill. Why did we need to do this
bill? let me go through a couple of key points and I'm going to try to
be brief, I understand that president Johnson use to have a comment
about speeches, you have speeches that are the mother hubbard speeches
and they cover everything, but they don't really touch anything and then
you have the french bikini style, which only cover the essential points
and I'm going to try my best to just keep it on just the essential
points and hope that we move forward. I understand that we have several
committees after this and so I welcome comments and efforts to see if we
can't get this right. What does this bill do? The first thing that we
want to do if we're going to have jobs in North Carolina is we need to
create an environment where there's certainty, so that the industry
that's going to come here and invest their millions and billions of
dollars, understand what kind of environment they're getting into. They
need to understand that we have a clear date of when they're going to be
able to begin operations, in other words they need a clear date as to
when the rules will be in place, and when they'll be able to start,
because it takes years for them to ramp it up and plan all of this in
order to get it started, the second thing we need to do is we need a
good economic environment, in terms of a clear cost structure of the
bill, rather it be a regulatory cost structure or rather it be a tax
cost structure, so the original version of this bill set out a very
forward thinking tax structure, that when we surveyed industry they were
very excited about it, they thought it was very forward looking and
hopefully we will be able to continue to work on that part. The other
aspects is as I said, they want a clear regulatory environment, so we
have to have a clear set of rules and we have a great opportunity here
in this state to take the best of the best and take our time and do it
right. We don't have any history of doing this in North Carolina, and
we've got multiple other states in this country that have been doing it
for decades, we can learn from their mistakes and we can learn from
their good lessons that they have done, and I appreciate being able to
work with representative Stone, and representative Bowls and
representative Hager and others and staff in trying to put this forward,
now there have been substantial changes in this PCS that I understand is
before us, and I'm going to try not to, because I'm still studying some
of these changes to [xx]</p>

Too much on that if I could Mr. Chairman if it’s appropriate, could I
ask for staff to kind of hit the highlights on the PCS?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that would be very appropriate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Then I’ll be very happy to answer any questions and these guys may wish
to chime in.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly, I would defer to Representative Steinburg, Representative
Boles, would you like to make any comments before I recognize staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I’d also like to just briefly thank Jennifer who,
part of staff who really worked hard. I think we’ve already done about
30 versions of this bill.  We try to remember what we said back in
2010-11 session of our commitment to take care of the land, the water.
We’ve put a lot of hard work in this bill. Representative Boles has been
a real strong advocate working for this bill as well as Representative
Hager and I’d also like to thank Senator Buck Newton who’s been a
delight to work with. I will yield my time so we can get into the bill
and I will answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This time Chair would like to recognize Jennifer McGuiness to help
explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Members the PCS you should have before you is
S76-CSRIF-22 version 6.  The first part of the bill of the PCS concerns
issuance of permits.  The House PCS would authorize issuance of permits
for oil and gas activities that use hydraulic fracturing processes
effective March 1st, 2015.  However, the House PCS would prohibit those
permits from becoming effective until the General Assembly took
subsequent legislative action to allow those permits to become effective
and the PCS specifically provides that part of that affirmative action
is to repeal Section 3 of the Clean Energy and Economic Security Act of
2012, otherwise known as Senate Bill 820 which you all enacted last
year.   3d of Senate Bill 820 provided that issuance of permits for oil
and gas activities using hydraulic fracturing were prohibited in order
to allow the Mining and Energy Commission sufficient time to adopt a
modern regulatory program.  And so no agency could issue a permit until
the General Assembly took legislative action to allow issuance. So
again, the House PCS would allow issuance of permits by Mining and
Energy Commission and the Department, however they could not become
effective until the General Assembly takes additional legislative action
including repeal of the provision from Senate Bill 820. Section 1b
amends that section from Senate Bill 820 to basically reflect the
provision I previously described.  The next part of the PCS contains a
number of studies. The first one in Section 2a on page 3 is for MEC with
the assistance of DENR to study development of a coordinated permitting
program for oil and gas activities. So that a single comprehensive
environmental permit could be issued.  That report would be due to the
Environmental Review Commission on March 1st, 2014.  This provision is
identical to the version that came out of the Senate.  The next section,
Section 2b on page 3 requires the Mining and Energy Commission, DENR ,
the Departments of Revenue and Commerce to study an appropriate rate of
severance tax. The provision in the PCS directs the entities to study
relevant portions of the North Carolina Oil and Gas study that was
issued in April 201 and put together by the Department of Natural
Resources and the Department of Commerce. It also directs them to look
at the ongoing study that the Mining and Energy Commission is doing with
regard to funding sources needed and that study from Senate Bill 820
required them to look at funding, needed to address infrastructure
impacts, funding needed to address local government impacts, and funding
needed for the state to administer an oil and gas regulatory program.
The House PCS in addition to this issues would direct the entities to
formulate recommendations for appropriate levels of funding to address
emergency events associated with oil and gas activities. It specifies.</p>

<p id="10:00">
Is that any recommendation that the group comes, comes forward with must
provide that funds would be used only upon a determination that
sufficient funds for corrective action or emergency response could not
be obtained from other sources without incurring a delay that would
significantly increase the threat to life or risk of damage to the
environment. And it would also provide that the state must pursue
recovery of all costs expended for emergency events. That report would
be due October 1, 2013. The next section, section 2C of the PCS would
enhance a study requirement enacted as part of Senate bill 820 that
again tasked a number of entities including the mining energy
commission, DNOR/g, department of transportation, and league of
municipalities and the county commissioners with looking at appropriate
levels of funding and potential sources for that funding necessary to
support the local governments that would be impacted by oil and gas
activities. The House PCS would add the department of commerce to those
entities who are tasked with the study. It also would direct all the
entities to specifically issue a recommendation for imposition of an
impact fee or dedication of a portion of any severance tax that was,
would be imposed on oil and gas activities, that would be sufficient in
amount to cover all costs that would reasonably expected to accrue to
local governments as a result of oil and gas activities occurring within
their jurisdiction. And in, in formulating that recommendation the House
PCS directs them to look at information data received from conduct of a
comprehensive survey of local governments in other states where
hydraulic fracsure, fracturing are currently occurring. And that groups
needs to report their findings to the environmental review commission on
or before March 1, 2014. The last study that is part of the PCS on page
4, section 2D would require Mac DNOR/g and the consumer protection
division of the department of justice to study creation of a restitution
fund for landowners who have suffered damages as a result of an act of
fraud, deception, misrepresentation or knowing admission of material
facts related to oil or gas interests. At a minimum the recommendation
would need to include sources of funding, criteria to award restitution,
and factors to assess appropriate amounts. That, that report would be
due to the environmental review commission on or before March 1, 2014.
The next part of the bill part 3, section 3 would make a modification to
the mining and energy commission. The first change under the House PCS
would be to eliminate one ex officio member of Mac and that would be the
assistant secretary for energy of the department of commerce. The next
change would be to add a member appointed by the Governor who owns land
in the Triassic Basin. The PCS would also modify the provision, or the
member that is designated as a commission for public health member to
eliminate a specific acknowledge requirement concerning principles of
waste management. And finally the House PCS includes language providing
that membership on the mining and energy commission is an office that
may be held concurrently with other elective or appointed offices. The
next part of the bill concerns miscellaneous modifications to the oil
and gas conservation act under the general statutes. The first section
under part 4 section 4A would eliminate language under existing law that
requires the mining and energy commission to limit the total amount of
oil and gas produced in the state if the total amount that can be
produced from all pools exceeds that that the state needs, reason, that
which is reasonably required to meet the reasonable market demand in the
state. Instead the PCS would allow max/g, the mining and energy
commission to fix an amount that may be produced which under the statute
is characterized as an allowable and would allow the mining and energy
commission to formulate those rules. The next section of the PCS section
4B would amend the Landmen Registry which was enacted in 2000</p>

<p id="15:00">
12 is part of Senate Bill 820. This provision regulates persons who
acquire manage oil and gas interest, perform title or contract functions
related to oil and gas activities, negotiate for acquisition or
divestiture of oil and gas rights and negotiate business agreements that
provide for exploration of oil and gas.
The House PCS would amend the landmen registry to provide that
violations are punishable by a penalty not to exceed $5,000 per
violation, and upon conviction a person would be guilty of a class one
misdemeanor. In addition, the PCS authorizes the Department to seek
injunctive relieve for violations.
It also adds language that any agreement that is executed on oil and gas
rights, which results in any manner from negotiation with the landmen in
violation of the statute would be null and void as being against the
public policy of the State.
The next part of the bill concerns bonding requirements that were
enacted in 2011 and 2012. Sections 5A through 5Z clarify that the
drilling bond that an operator must provide upon registering to drill a
well, it clarifies that that bond runs to the state.
The next clarification is to the Reclamation Bond that was enacted as
part of Senate Bill 820 which runs to the surface owner and basically
needs to cover the cost for reclaiming the property after cessation of
oil and gas activities on a property.
There was little description as how that bond would be assessed in
Senate Bill 820. The Senate Bill 76, the 5th edition had criteria on
which the money and energy commission needed to establish rules for
formulating that bond. The House PCS contains the same provision.
The next part of the bill, Part 6, Section 6, concerns revenue from
off-shore energy production. It requires that any revenues or royalties
paid to the State from off-shore leasing expiration or development would
be deposited in a special revenue fund until the fund reached $500
million. The fund could only be used for emergency preparation response
environmental protection and mitigation associated with a release of
hydrocarbons from off-shore activities.
And the House PCS provides that any point after the fund exceeds $500
million, those revenues would go to the general fund. The provision
contains the same kind of language that was included in the study of the
severance tax and use of those revenues that there needed to be cost
recovery at the State extended monies from the fund to address emergency
events. Again, the monies could only be used if no other sources of
revenue were available to deal with an emergency event. And then once
expended, the state would need to pursue cost recovery.
Part 7 of the Bill, Section 7, concerns the regional interstate
off-shore energy policy compact. And the provision strongly encourages
the Governor to develop a compact with the Governors of South Carolina
and Virginia to develop a unified strategy for exploration of off-shore
energy resources. The provision gives detail on the type of compact
negotiations and recommendations that such a compact should address.
And Part 8 of the Bill concerns the Energy Policy Act and makes
amendments. And in short, it would re-title the Energy Policy Act as the
Energy Jobs Act and reconstitute the Energy Policy Council as the Energy
Job’s Council. It will also reconstitute the membership of the Energy
Job’s Council and move the Energy Job’s Council from the Department of
Commerce where it currently resides to the Department of Environment
Natural Resources.

Provision of the bill is a provision that directs the medical care
commission to modify a rule known as the electrical requirements rule.
This rule provides that emergency electricity to facilities that are
governed by the medical care commission must be, the emergency
electrical must be provided with fuel that is stored on site. The
provision in Senate bill 76 and the House PCS for Senate, Senate bill 76
would direct the medical care commission to replace the rule and amend
it to require that, that facilities may use bifuel generators that
operate with both liquid fuel and natural gas that is not stored on
site. The last provision is the effective date and, except as otherwise
noted, the bill generally becomes effective when it becomes law. I'm
happy to answer any questions, mister Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton, Representative Stone, do you have anything to add to the
presentation by Ms. McGinnis?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I'm just happy to, to answer any questions and, and keep working on,
on seeing how we can get this thing to the finish line.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate. Representative Hager, you are
recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman, to send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman is recognized to send forth amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Chairman, do you want me to continue or do you want me to hold?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let's let the members, let's let members get a copy of the amendment.
I'll come back to you. We've got some other folks in the queue, if
that's alright.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Tine, you are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman. I'm gonna talk about a part of the bill that
probably others in the room are not as concerned about, but I just
wanted to make sure that we're all on the same page as we address this
bill, and that's section six, which is the offshore provisions of the
bill. First of all, just to make sure everyone in the room is very
clear, there is no federal revenue sharing today. That's addressed in
section seven that the Governor would go out and, and attempt to
encourage our federal government to provide some revenue sharing. The,
the part that is particularly of concern when I look at this though is
under this bill, revenue sharing would only go to five hundred million
dollars with a, a backup that if federal money wasn't there or the
company that made the issues wasn't able to pay quickly, that money
would be available for clean up and some mitigation and things like
that. But then it goes to the general fund with any excess dollars after
that. My concern is we have a one point two dollar tourism economy in
Dare and Currituck county. Usually when you take a risk as a business,
you are provided some return on that risk, for taking a risk, as a local
community. Right now there's no provisions in this bill for any local
community revenue sharing. It would all go to the general fund and be up
to us how we decide to, to put that in. So we'd be taking a risk at
this, in this economy that drives all the jobs in our area without any
return on investment or return on that risk for our community. So, I was
wondering if, if you all had considered that in any way, if that's a
piece of the bill that you might be willing to discuss, how revenue
sharing might help with infrastructure or investment in the area that
might offset this, this type of risk.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton, you are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman. And, and I think staff can probably help me,
or correct me if I mistake this, but I believe in 820 we, we indicated,
or we directed that there be studied exactly that, that issue. I would
note that, that whenever that comes about, that the Obama administration
or, or the next administration allows exploration in drilling to go
forward offshore, it is, it is, and I was out at a meeting about this
the other day, there ought to be tremendous economic activity and growth
and benefit to the coastal areas of North Carolina, based on the service
aspect of, of the offshore efforts. Hopefully between the economic
growth and development and the, the results of the study, we would, we
would be able to more than adequately address any of those concerns.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, mister Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are recognized for a second question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My understanding is and, and I was on the offshore legislative study
committee for two years that we did here previously before the Governor
decided to study it further, under the previous administration, and MMS
did an extensive infrastructure study and looked at what ports would be
most likely</p>

<p id="25:00">
the benefit from the development of offshore energy, and none of them
were North Carolina ports, the most-likely one would be Norfolk, which
has the infrastructure and the deep-water port to be able to service the
North Carolina waters. So I'm not as optimistic as you are about the
benefits that we would receive in the area, and also ??? being the only
Port and Oregon inlet, which is not a stabilized inlet at this point,
there would be concerns there also as to whether or not we'd be able to
actually get some of that return.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative, I've seen those same things, I'll just say
that the industries that were in this meeting that I was in the other
day, while the major platform efforts and so forth would most likely
come out of Norfolk and Charleston or otherwise, a great deal they were
saying of the service would typically come out of Wilmington and
Morehead, mostly out of Wilmington. And a lot of the areas that they're
looking at, some of the belief that they have is more toward the
southern waters anyway, not that there's not northern expectations, but
at least the folks that we were talking to, were looking a little bit
more to the South. And the point about Oregon inlet was specifically
addressed about why this would be a reason why we need to stabilize that
inlet, so I think we can, if I may, I think we definitely can, as we
continue work on this, because this is gonna be years in the process, we
definitely need to make sure that these things are addressed and looked
at.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah thank you, Mr. Chair. Just to briefly respond, the first part of
Representative Tine, and I'd like to thank you for the question, the
$500 million, we came up with that number when we looked at the New
Orleans incident and we wanted to make sure we had a number we could
actually work with, and I think that's a fair number to base it off of,
and the reason we looked at also of sending the additional funds to the
general fund 'cause 'course it's being studies, it's being part of the
study, but we didn't want to bind future general assemblies with needs
until we knew exactly what the revenue projections and all the revenue
detail was, and that could be 2, 4, 6 years out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, does everyone have a copy of amendment ARI-42 Version 2? It
appears that everyone has a copy. Representative Hager, you're
recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, this amendment basically is just a couple
lines, when I was looking through the bill I was amazed to see the
Energy Jobs Policy moved to DENR, what this amendment does is actually
move it back to commerce. Let me give you a few reasons why I want to do
that, if you will take a look at Section 8, I think it's page 14, lines
40, and look at the, it's under general duties and responsibilities, is
to protect the economy, to promote job growth, and expand business and
industry opportunities. If you will also flip over to page 12 it's under
section 8 also, lines 32, it again says promote economic growth, job
creation, and it's called the Energy Jobs Council, so I looked at it,
and it seemed a little strange to me that we'd be moving job creation to
DENR, just in respect to I'm sure the DENR folks that are here, I'm not
sure of any privatized jobs in energy except for maybe some cleanup work
that DENR's ever created. So I went and looked at the mission of DENR,
and said okay does this fit with what DENR is supposed to be doing? Well
the mission of DENR says it is recognized that the North Carolina DENR's
primary mission is to protect North Carolina's environment and natural
resources, now that seems to not fit with the charge that we've given
them here for the energy jobs council. Now I believe that that energy
jobs creation should be in DENR, we should find the place for it in,
should be in commerce, and we should find a place for it in commerce,
and that's what the amendment does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the amendment, Representative
Stone, you're recognized.

Question of the amendment's parts.

or the the state.

You are recognized for it.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Unless it has an energy job counsel for the title of the Domestic Energy
Job Act. So do we supersede that by assuming that this piece will have
already passed or do we roll it over into a PCS and the amendment should
reflect the appeal type?

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a question.  I'm not sure if it's
staff-directed or whom ever would have it.  But, if at some point in the
future we do, hopefully not have this happen, but we do have some type
of an accident or whatever, wouldn't Deaner be involved in the cleanup
and the monitoring and the taking care of that? And would that not be a
conflict of interest with this being under them, and them being over it?
Why wouldn't it be put back in commerce?
[NEW SPEAKER]
Representative Stone, you are recognized.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Mr. Chair, do we have anyone from commerce here to make a statement on
this?
[NEW SPEAKER]
I don't see anyone standing up on behalf of the Department of Commerce.
Representative Boles, you are recognized.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I respectfully oppose the amendment with the
restructuring of a lot of the departments.  I understand that in
commerce there is some talk of privatization and that I would have a
concern as far as the regulations with Deaner.  They would be in
consultation with the firms as well as far as issuing permits, and
you're right. If there was an accident you'd have both emergency
management also that would be involved.  But, I would oppose the
amendment and ask for your support.

Representative Carney, you are recognized.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Well I'm going to support the amendment
because I agree. I feel that housing this energy jobs counsel within a
department that is tasked with promoting the energy industry.  I just
feel like when I saw this I felt like there's a conflict of interest
there and I believe that the proper place for it is to be within the
Department of Commerce.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Representative Hager, you are recognized.
[NEW SPEAKER]
I think Representative Carney just said it best.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Representative Bumgardner, you are recognized.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'd just like to also say that I think that
putting job creation and energy under Deaner, I think it's in congruent
with their mission and their stated purpose. If we want to move it later
from Commerce to something else, that's fine. But I support this
amendment.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Representative Avila, you are recognized to debate the amendment a
second time.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  If I could ask Representative Boles, would you
expand on what concerns you have? Why would the direction you're seeing
commerce go in would create problems with them having this particular
counsel under their purview?
[NEW SPEAKER]
I just think as we talked about streamlining, and helping business, and
not having to go through the transportation department to environment
department to all these other departments. My understanding is that
Deaner would have a division in there, as far as issuing of the permits
and work with them, as far as for best practices and policies.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Representative Stone.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  Do we have anyone here from the Governor’s Office
that would like to speak on this amendment? Just want to see if we have
anyone from the Governor’s Office.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Mr. Chairman?
[NEW SPEAKER]
Please state your name and who you're with.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Fred Steen, with the Governor's Office. We oppose this amendment.  The
Governor does agree with Secretary Skvarla that we can house this in
Deaner.  Deaner is not your father's Deaner, and commerce will not be
your mother's commerce in the future.  We are going to change both of
them. So we would appreciate your support in opposing this.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Representative Jeter, you are recognized.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I oppose this amendment and I would like to
echo what Representative Boles eluded to.  The purpose of commerce is

It is going to more privatization. The passage of this amendment would
or could in essence allow this committee which is also on page 14 to
identify and utilize all domestic energy resources in order to ensure a
secure, stable and predictable energy supply and then it goes on to say
while ensuring the protection and preservation of this state’s natural
resources, cultural heritage and quality of life. If commerce gets more
and more privatized you can end up having this committee operated by a
private company, setting policy on hydraulic fracturing in North
Carolina. And for that reason it seems best suited in DENR. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Hager, you’re recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With great trepidation, I’d like to ask the
Governor’s person here a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Steane [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative you’re recognized to propound
your question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Steane, can you name me
any privatized DENR jobs that were created in energy area? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Hager, we’ve had this conversation before.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I know, I just want everybody else to hear it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, we cannot, but like I said in the future this is
going to be different and we support, we oppose your amendment. We
understand Sharon Decker would accept if this was the decision of the
committee, but we want to stick with the agreements that we made with
the bill sponsors. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Brief follow up, Mr. Chairman, not
a direct question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re recognized sir, second
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] With respect to my colleague, Representative
Jeter, the Mining and Energy Commission makes decisions on hydraulic
fracturing. The Energy Jobs Council makes decisions on where the policy
is for the state, not the rules and regulations. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Alb, you’re recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Just a statement. Going back
to page 14, where Representative Jeter talked about the general duties,
and there is a direct conflict between promoting job creation and
protecting and preserving the natural resources. When you’ve got an
industry that may have some questionable things that come up, then
DENR’s going to be caught in the crosshairs of promoting something that
on the other side of their preservation of natural resources, they’re
going to be hoisted on their on petard, as the saying goes, and I just
continue to see a significant conflict of interest and cannot support
leaving it with DENR. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stone, you’re
recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. Ladies and gentlemen
of committee, we had several of the same questions you’re bringing
before us but the main intent as we work with the different
administrations was to get this bill pushed forward. As you know, we’ve
been waiting on rules since the last session and we’ll work with you any
way we want in the future but with the new administration in the
Governor’s office and some new ideas and things that are going to happen
that we’re probably not aware of yet, I’d ask that we not support the
amendment and I’ll work with Representative Hager and anyone else that
wants to work with us in the future, to put this in the appropriate
department. But more importantly, I’d like to get the rules finalized
and get them back to us, so we can start a natural gas program. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Robert Brawley? Further discussion, further
debate on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Floyd.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, maybe I didn’t understand the staff
response to my question, and I didn’t understand the question the staff
gave back to me. When I just simply you know, do not see that this being
this being the same. The amendment. Because it has a different title. So
it just seems to me that the amendment should reflect the title that we
are addressing. Not the new title. If the bill passed, then it would
change to that. But at present it does not and it should. That’s the
concern that I have. It should reflect the title of the bill that we’re
addressing. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And the staff, the title of the bill does
not refer to the jobs commission. I think that’s what the staff
basically said. The title of the bill does not refer to the jobs
commission referred to in the amendment. Therefore the title does not
need to be amended as well. Further discussion, further debate on the
amendment. Hearing none, all those in favor will say aye. All those
opposed say no. In the opinion of the Chair, the nos have it. Division
being called, all those in favor will raise your hand.</p>

keep your hands raised please. all who is opposed will raise your
hand,the amendment fails 22,28. further discussion, further debate on
the amendment representative Torbett your recognised, representative
Speciale your recognised, this is on the bill for for the discussion for
the debate on the bill, representative Speciale your recognised,
[speaker changes] i guess from the east i'm concerned over here about
waste and i don't see that addressed in here fracturing waste from the
hydraulic fracturing, the big concern in the the east is that is where
its going to end up, can you address that? [speaker changes] senator ??
your recognised.[speaker changes] representative Speciale that was just
a connard that was set up by the environmental folks to get everyone
whipped up there on the coast, nobodys going to truck water hundreds of
miles its just not even realistic. [speaker changes] representative
shepard your recognised. [speaker changes] sir mister chair, a question
for the bills sponsors i like representative speciale have been hammered
by the issue of the waste and so i guess my thoughts are if its ok,
maybe it needs to be addressed because i dont think its going to calm
down some of those fears, unless there is something in the bill that is
addressed of where the wastes going whats going to happen to the waste
and that kind of thing cause i'm certainly supportive of what were doing
here but there is allot of concern and it may be unfounded fear but i
think its something we need to look at cause till we deal with it our
people see that this bill covers that theres gonna be allot of that
thank you. [speaker changes] senator nick your recognised. [speaker
changes] thank you mister chairman, thank you mister representative i
appreciate the question you know i have allot of ties with the coast and
i spend allot of time there and i drink well water when i'm down there
and so i understand why people would have a concern when newspapers go
out there and print nonsense and tell everyone to get worried, first
thing that i've noticed is under the pcs nothing about injections is
included in this version so what was in the senate version isn't before
you now, the reason why it was originally in there was we were trying to
create responsible ways and let industry know that we are thinking about
those issues and it did not mandate it, it just was going to allow it
like most other states in the country already do and the epa already
says that is their preferred method with dealing with any of the
naturally occurring brine waters that come out from the drilling process
essentially its would allow it to put it back down where it originally
came from. so what i would tell you is for folks down east right now the
current law in the state of north carolina is you cant put this waste
water back in the ground and this bill is in its current form doesn't
change that, it is something we have to address but for folks down east
who have been whipped up and i can understand why, they really dont need
to worry about these companies going to the expense of hauling water
down there, is going to have to be dealt with from a more localised
basis ether in treatment plants or we should continue to study it
because its going to be one of the logistical things that were going to
have to work though and thats what this process is about and thats what
we are trying to do [speaker changes] chairman would like to recognize
jennifer mcguinness to address this issue as well [speaker changes]
thank you mister chairman, representatives as senator ?? noted the
senate version of senate bill 76 the fifth edition did include a
provision concerning injection, sub-surface injection of hydraulic
fracturing fluids that provision is not in the house pcs before you but
what i would note is that senate bill 820 from 2012 gave extensive rule
making direction to the mining and energy commision on formulating rules
that</p>

Required to be adopted by October 1st, 2014. So extensive rule making on
waste is underway.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Catlin, you are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I am glad this bill has taken out the allowance
of injection of fracking waste water. But it is a concern in the coastal
areas because the only places in North Carolina that are permeable
enough for injection of waste are the coastal aquifers so that is where
they would go. So I think that is something we need to keep an eye on
but this bill does take that out right now but we need to keep that on
our radar and a couple of more things. If I am correct we have retained
the geologist on mining and energy commission. Yes, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The answer is Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you and then we have also protected the property owner's right
through the land man's registry remaining employees.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's correct, we actually put teeth in the land man registry and give
it some strength.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In taht case Mr. Chairman, I'd suggest that we support this PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Roger West, you are recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, I'd just throw a motion whenever you are ready.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dr. Fulghum, you are recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. In section 5C page 9, there is a ?? that
particular section resented viability for water contamination. I can't
tell anything in that paragraph or below that really address the issue
and I'm wondering that the stocks about the bonds being required is a
developer, discloses certain information to the ?? commission and I
assume part of that disclosure would require fracking fluid contents
might ?? confidential information but is there some part of that
paragraph the next ??, center guard still ?? for water contamination.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Dr. Fulghum, recognize Jennifer McGinnis with Staff to answer that
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. Dr. Fulghum, this provision in the PCS before you ?? a provision
and an associative provision in act part of the last year senate ballet
20 which required pre-drilling, testing of water supplies and reporting
and other protective measures for land owners including the reclamation
bond. So since it's amending that provision from last year, that's why
you don't see all the detail because it was included in last year
legislation. As far as disclosure of fracturing fluids, that direction
was also made in senate ballet 20 to the mining and energy commission
will formulate rules concerning disclosure of chemicals associated with
hydraulic fracturing clog process and those rules and underway and due
to be adopted October 1st 2014.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. You are recognized for a second question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So those rules will address who has the information and how the
information is distributed in an emergency or contamination issue, is
that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, It gives a general direction to mining and energy commission to
require disclosure to state ?? and public disclosure of information with
the exception of matters that are determined to be trade secrets. So the
details will be forth coming from the commission which will come back
before the general assembly likely, so you will see those disclosure
provisions in the fall of 2014.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Before any permits can be issued for hydraulic fracturing, the rules
have to be in place and it takes an act of the general assembly to move
forward so you will get a chance to look at the rules from the Mining
and Energy commission and it will take an act of the general assembly to
proceed further.
Representative Fisher, you are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman and I kinda wanna go back to what you just said
and maybe staff can help me with this too. It looks like still from the
bill that permits can be issued but it will take an act of the general
assembly to move forward So what I am asking is, Isn't that a little
backwards?</p>

<p id="50:00">
The general assembly first approve and then the permits be issued.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well that is definitely a policy decision. Language
provides that the permits can be issued but they cannot become effective
until a subsequent act of the general assembly. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
further discussion further debate, we have members of the public that
would like to speak and I would like to recognize Secretary John Skvarla
with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to speak on the
bill. We will alternate proponents and opponents of the bill, so
Secretary Skvarla you're recognized for time not to exceed 2 minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you mister chairman. When Governor McCrory asked
me to run Deener he had two directives, 1 protect the environment and 2
help grow our baldly broken economy. We run that balancing act every day
and I think the issue of balance was raised earlier. With the addition
of the fraud protection and compensation for the local governments we
think this bill is a great step forward in accomplishing all of those
things. So simply put Deener is very much supportive of this PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Secretary Skvarla. Is there any member of
the public that is opposed to the legislation that would like to be
recognized to speak the bill? Please state your name, who you're will,
you're recognized for a time not to exceed 2 minutes. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman, my name is Elizabeth Ouzts Director of
Environment North Carolina state wide citizen funded environmental
advocacy group, and I do want to speak in opposition to this bill. I
appreciate that this bill's much improved over the senate version and I
appreciate all the work that's gone into that, however I want to remind
members of the 400 plus page report that Deener issued last May that was
exhaustive and yet  only scratched the surface of all the issues that
fracking could pose to North Carolina. The issue of what to do with
toxic waste water, the increased air pollution, the threat to Jordan
Lake and our drinking water, the risks to public safety that are
potential. Last year the legislature passed a bill 820 and made a
promise with that bill that the legislature would wait for the Mining
and Energy Commission to fully examine all those issues covered in the
report and fully examine the potential regulations that can mitigate
those risks and this bill, even though it is improved from the Senate
version, still breaks that promise and it does so because of the issue
Representative Fisher raised by allowing permits to be issued but not
allowing them to become effective you create tremendous pressure to
allow fracking to go forward in North Carolina whether or not those
issues are addressed adequately. I do want to say just 1 word about the
off shore drilling piece that hasn't been noted but by promoting off
shore drilling this bill also threatens 67,000 jobs on the coast that
rely on fishing and tourism on the coast a 3 billion dollar industry. So
I want to highlight again, particularly that provision on permits in the
moratorium and I know this bill has some more committees to go to and
hope that that can be addressed but the bill overall charts the wrong
course for our energy future and I urge you to vote against it. Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you. I have Algen Uncash from the API.
Please state your name, who you're will, and you're recognized for a
time not to exceed 2 minutes. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you mister
chairman, members of the committee, ladies and gentlemen of the public.
My name is Algen Uncash, I'm a small business owner who volunteered
several years ago to help launch the North Carolina Energy Reform. Last
year I was appointed chairman of that nonpartisan group and for the past
year I have crisscrossed our great state, I have met with business
owners, community advocates, and families to build awareness about this
amazing opportunity that we have before us to fix our state economy,
restore jobs, and boost tax revenue for our critical public services. I
have lived in North Carolina for 34 years and I firmly believe that our
state is the greatest state in the union. However, our unemployment rate
is 8.9 percent. North Carolina ranks number 47 which means 46 states are
competing better than we are. If you look at the states that are in the
energy business, we're losing. Texas 6.1 percent, Alaska 6 percent,
Oklahoma 4.9 percent, and the number 1 state that is winning jobs tight
now is North Dakota with 3.3 percent. Their</p>

...employment rates averaged together come in a five percent.  So the
arithmetic is clear.  Nine percent is where we are in North Carolina.
And five percent is where a collection of states are who have energy
jobs.  And to my friends in the environmental community, let me be
clear, Senate Bill 76 is not about legalizing shell gas development in
our state.  Senate Bill 820 has already settled that issue.  We are now
at a point where it is important to carefully develop legislation that
sets transparent rules and guidelines for the energy industry, so
companies will clearly understand when North Carolina will be open for
business.  My friends, please join me at the table for a healthy
dialogue about how to use our state's energy resources to create jobs
for families in need of work.  But no longer will North Carolina's
citizens simply accept the word No.  My friends, the word No is not an
energy policy.  In Lee county, the unemployment rate is 10.6%.  We must
say yes to them.  In Moore county, the unemployment rate is 8.2%.  We
must say yes to them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Cash.  I will give you ten seconds to wrap up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm not only pleased to speak in favor of Senate Bill 76, Domestic
Energy Jobs Act, but I'm honored to be working alongside Governor
McCrory and the General Assembly in North Carolina to get us in the
energy business.  Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for your comments, Mr. Cash.  Is there any member of the
public in opposition to the bill that would like to speak?
Seeing none, further discussion?  Further debate? Representative West
you're recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I move that we give the proposed House
Committee Substitute Senate Bill 76 a favorable report, unfavorable to
the original bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative West moves that Senate Bill 76, the proposed committee
substitute to Senate Bill 76, to be given a favorable report and a
subsequent referral to the environment committee, and authorize the
staff to make technical corrections as needed.  That motion being
properly made before us, all those in favor will say Aye, all those
opposed say No.  In the opinion of the Chair, the Ayes have it.  They
Ayes do have it.  This meeting is adjourned.
