There is a fiscal note on this bill and being distributed at this time.
Representative Folgum, you have the floor to explain the bill sir.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.  This is a PCS for a HHS bill that was passed
without any problem that is update to the board of physical therapy
examiners.  The concept of this is to go and update the protection of
witnesses before the board that have to appear in the event of an
investigation, and also outlines the procedures for hearings.
There are six parts.  First part is largely unchanged.  Second part
consists of handling the application violations, privacy matters and the
usual routine functions of a board such as continuing education.  And
the third page of this particular section involves protecting the rights
of the subpoenaed persons and impaired practitioners.  There’s a routine
board matters involving medical practitioners and this is an update to
the existing language.
Section three involves criminal history checks where the applicants are
required to supply fingerprints and other identifying materials so the
board can ask the Department of Justice and the SBI and FBI to conduct a
thorough background check before these applicants are approved. The
remainder of the third section involves grounds for license denial.
Fourth section involving foreign trained therapists, and five out of
state therapists who are here for a temporary period such as sports
teams and performing arts theaters.  And the last part involves a more
detailed explanation for the Department of Justice routine for handling
fingerprint material and identifying that material to the board and
keeping that confidential.
So I recommend this PCS substitute to you.  The fiscal impact as far as
I can see involves costs mainly to the applicant for the application as
well as for whatever it costs the department of justice to run the
criminal background check.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Representative.  Representative Storms, please state your
purpose
[Speaker Changes]
I want to ask a question.  I guess I’ll direct it to Dr. Folgum or
staff, either one
[Speaker Changes]
The gentleman is recognized
[Speaker Changes]
Typically what does the background check cost?
[Speaker Changes]
Thirty eight dollar fee is what we have in the fiscal note from the
department of justice, and this would involve the actual mechanics of
doing the check.  They’re not allowed to charge excessive amounts.  But
38 dollars is what we have the fiscal note.
[Speaker Changes]
And I’ve always wondered, when they do a background check and it says
criminal history background check, do they also pull your driving
record.  Is that a part of the background check.
[Speaker Changes]
It should be.  I can’t imagine why it wouldn’t be.  We’re looking for
all violations, criminal or civil.
[Speaker Changes]
OK
[Speaker Changes]
There’s some representatives of the board here as well if someone likes
to speak to that.
[Speaker Changes]
Representative Holly, please state your purpose
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr. Chair.  I have a question.  When you say confidential
investigation then the physical therapist is unaware that they are being
investigated?
[Speaker Changes]
Representative Holly, this would be confidential to the parties
involved.  So the applicant would have to apply for the ability to be
licensed by the board.  In most cases we’re talking about investigations
conducted in the case of violations of the rules of the board.  But in
all cases the applicant is total aware.  The board is required to keep
the matters confidential.  There are some public records laws that do
apply however
[Speaker Changes]
Follow up
[Speaker Changes]
The lady’s recognized
[Speaker Changes]
OK.  So what you’re saying is the applicant knows when they apply that
they will be investigated.  But in instances of alcohol and mental
health problems and things that you’re going into, are they aware that
that will be also investigated, not just a criminal record?
[Speaker Changes]
Mr. Chairman, Representative Holly.  I think this alcohol and drug use
aspect applies to the applicant seeking treatment.</p>

Through the board, through the entire practitioner’s mechanisms that are
available for professionals. But it would not be part of the criminal
background check. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen, not seeing any
other. The Chair apologizes. Representative Hager. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sorry Mr. Chairman. Ask the bill sponsor a question, please? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Dr. Fulghum, I
apologize. I’m just scanning the bill analysis. Is this certification
already in place? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes it is, Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Jordan, your purpose please? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ask staff a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may propose his inquiry. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I’d like to ask staff, as far as page
2, section 23 about the confidential investigations, is this common for
boards in the state to have the records be privileged and not subject to
discovery, subpoena or other means? [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? to that. I do
know that many other boards conduct background checks but as far as the
confidentiality of the information, the way this bill is structured,
that it’s not confidential between the board and the applicant. But it’s
confidential to outsiders, so they wouldn’t be able to go out there and
do a public records request and then get that applicant’s records that
were compiled by the law enforcement. But I don’t know if you can do
public records requests on other boards and actually get that
information. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I appreciate that.
Let me go further though. This is not just public records requests, this
is subject, not subject to discovery, subpoena, or other means of legal
compulsion. That sounds pretty strong. Is that done in other cases?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don’t know how that compares to what other licensing
boards do. Of course the information, I guess it’s just the source. The
information would still be available to law enforcement or to other
people that tried to compile it. So it, I guess the question would be
you potentially could get that information if you were a law enforcement
agent, just that you can get it from the law enforcement agencies. If
you weren’t law enforcement and you wanted to compile that information
about an individual to the extent that it’s public, and you put forth
the effort, then you could compile it yourself. So it’s really only
preventing people from taking a shortcut towards the information that’s
been, the work done by law enforcement agency. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow
up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jordan, if you don’t mind, if you
could hold only for one moment. We have a representative here from the
License and Board, who I think would like to speak to this bill. And he
may, he indicated he might be able to address your concern. So with
that, the Chair is going to invite him to address the committee. If you
will please, sir. State your name and who you’re representing and then
you have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] My name is, my name is William
Potter. I represent the North Carolina Physical Therapy Association. Ben
Massey, the executive director of the board and Skip Roy, a
representative of the association are also here. To answer the first
question, whether or not this language is similar to other boards, it is
almost identical to the medical board and we worked extensively with
representatives of the medical association to make sure that it is
parallel. The reason that this language is in the statute for the
medical board and many other boards, and is added to this board, is the
peer review process. And a peer review is a situation where if a person
has some concerns, there’s a peer review examination and it is kept
confidential unless and until it gets to the level of a formal
disciplinary case or unless a court involved in the process, goes
through the process. It’s not subject to a subpoena while the board is
looking at it, while it’s under investigation. But once it becomes part
of a formal action, it becomes part of the public record. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Jordan. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I wanted to inquire of
the speaker from the Physical Therapy Association? You mentioned that it
would become public record once it had been entered by the board into a
decision or a hearing, and that’s what the language in here says. But
what if it doesn’t not reach the point of being a hearing or</p>

<p id="10:00">
?? of charge or… other process, I guess, from the board. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Again, if the process is investigated by the board and is
determined to be unfounded, then unless it reaches the level of a formal
decision, it remains confidential. There is a process where the board
itself could be defended in an action and the Justice Department or some
other department could go through that, but again, the problem is in a
peer review process, the system for many years has wanted to assure the
medical providers that their testimony in this should be completely
candid so that the review of the medical process is there and that it
won’t immediately hit the newspapers and won’t develop into arguments
among different members of the profession, and again, it is in the
Medical Practice Act, it is in, I would say, 70 or 80% of the Licensing
Board’s statutes, and it’s not something that has been criticized in
general. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, I might add that this bill is
supported by the North Carolina Medical Society and the North Carolina
Orthopedic Association who work closely with these practitioners in the
peer review of processes. One thing that I’m very familiar with having
been on several committees in hospitals and various other organizations
is the chilling process, that you can’t talk about this candidly and
can’t get raw data, allegations, accusations, discussion in an open
manner in a confidential practice meeting. You’ll never hear it, so
that’s the purpose of this type of language. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jordan. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So final inquiry to staff.
Above and beyond what you’ve already answered, the language here says
these records are privileged and not subject to discovery, subpoena or
other means of legal compulsion. Is that as strong as it sounds to me,
that there is no legal process available to gather this information
unless it’s gone to a board decision? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I think
you’re right that there would be secrecy inside that board, and so
unless it comes out through a formal complaint or you go and gather the
information without going to the board, that that information in there
would stay locked in. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley of
Iredell. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To make a motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Chair will return to the gentleman. Representative
Collins. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Inquiry of the bill sponsor. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman may propose his inquiry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Dr.
Fulghum, unfortunately most of the bills that look like this that come
to us from the medical profession usually represent a turf war that
we’re trying to solve. This doesn’t appear to me on first blush to be
that, but do you know of… is this bill controversial at all, or are
there those that oppose this bill that you know of? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No
sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Are there further inquiries from the committee?
If not, Representative Brawley of Iredell, you’re recognized for a
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My sister is a
physical therapist at Lake Norman Regional Hospital and she said I can
make a motion we give this bill a favorable report. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I apologize for… and I just changed this
earlier, but when… Representative Fulghum, when you said that you hadn’t
heard of any opposition, does that mean there’s no physical therapist
who you’ve heard of who’s in any way expressed opposition? We get a lot
of emails on a lot of thing. I don’t remember one on this, but are you
quite sure that even rank and file physical therapists are okay with
these changes? [SPEAKER CHANGES] They have not contacted me about it and
I’ve had no opposition from anybody that I’ve heard from. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative. Is
there further discussion or debate on the motion from Representative
Brawley of Iredell? Seeing none, the question before the committee is
the motion by the gentleman from Iredell to give House Bill 828 a
favorable report. Those who favor the motion will signify by saying aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Those who oppose the motion
will signify by saying no. In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it
and the motion carries. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, as was announced prior, we will now move to House
Bill 616 – House Bill 616 – and the Chair will recognize Representative
Szoka to present House bill 616. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair,
members of the committee. I’ll start with the bottom line up front:

?? and pass the test.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just...there’s just a little concern if that
person is able to do something that they’re really not skilled to do and
whether the consumer is protected. Nobody else cares.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, but...I probably didn’t explain good enough. If, for example, if
someone works at BBNT, a depository institution, as a mortgage loan
officer and they’ve been for two years, they’ve in fact been originating
loans. They’ve had to follow all the state and federal laws, rules and
guidelines so they know what they’re doing and they’ve just been
overseen by a different body. For them to come into the non-depository
institution is the North Carolina Commissioner Banks office which
oversees them and to be licensed as a mortgage loan officer according to
federal guidelines in the national mortgage licensing system, they have
to take the required class and they have to take the required test. My
personal opinion is I would not anticipate anyone coming from that
environment to actually flunk.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative  Ross.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a final question. Is somebody from the Commissioner of Banks here
or has the Commissioner of Banks said this is a good idea. Have we heard
anything?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They have no problem with this whatsoever. I don’t see anybody here from
the Commissioner’s office. They were at the banking committee and they
had no problem then.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The chair saw Representative Brawley of Mecklenburg. Please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I wonder if the bill’s sponsor would yield for a
couple of questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As I understand this, what we are dealing is taking people that had been
mortgage originators and transitioning them into a non-depository
situation where, in a lot of professions, we might just get...do a
reciprocity and license them. If I understand what you’re doing is
rather than granting a license through reciprocity, you are giving a
temporary license while requiring them to take the requisite North
Carolina training and pass all the exams to prove they are as competent
as we are assuming they are based on their prior experience or license.
Am I hearing this correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is essentially correct and it’s not just to meet North Carolina
law, it’s also to meet federal law because the distinction that the
National Mortgage Licensing System at the federal level is that you have
to take the classes and you have to pass the test to become a licensed
loan officer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I may follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You may sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’ve taken someone over, we’ve given them the transitional reciprocity,
they have to take the classes, they have to take the test, if they fail
the test at the expiration of their license, they’re just out of luck
until they can take the test and pass it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They’re not longer allowed to function so in fact, what we’re doing
instead of creating a loophole for the incompetent to get into the
profession, we are making sure that people that transition over are
competent by making them prove it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that’s a very fair assessment, yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A question for the bill’s sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There’s a line in the bill’s summary and if you could explain it to me I
would appreciate it because I’m not sure what it means. The bill would
also allow license be issued to a person who is registered, but not
licensed in this state or another state. Can you explain what that
means?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I can. Registered, again, would be coming from the depository
institution. Let’s say they work for BBNT in Florida, a state other than
here. They move from Florida to North Carolina, they want to go...it’s
the same thing, it just covers someone moving from another state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But they would not have been licensed as a loan originator in this state
or another state, right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s correct. Again, its the distinction between registered which is a
federal distinction in the National Mortgage Licensing System working
for a depository institution like a bank and license loan officer in a
non-depository institution like the company I work for, it’s a privately
owned firm we originate loans and then we sell them. We’re not
governed...we’re governed by the same federal and state rules in regards
to mortgage ??, but we have different oversight bodies.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up and last, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess, and hope ?? follow up, Chair, but I do agree a little bit with
her on this issue that are we allowing...why don’t we require folks to

Every time it has to be 30 days between each time you take the test and
again it was amended by federal law not by state law but after the 120
days if you have not passed the test then you are out of the industry.
Well you are out of yes essentially all though they could go back to
depositories institution of they could find employment there. They would
only keep you out of nine depository’s institutions and operating as a
license loan officer because it is illegal to originate loans without
being properly licensed or registered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Warren.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes I had two questions if I could. First of all I
would like to know why is this necessary and second part is if someone
fails the test after 120 days. Is it irrespective of humorous question
does that subject the arrangement say during the 120 day period to any
type of levitation by the people bolding those loans sort of like the
prosecutors found guilty of something and all these cases are thrown up
prior to that. Is running liability associate with that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Credit alliance with second part of the question first
and the answer to that is there would be none because there will be
properly wisent as a transitional loan officer so there is no come back
if you will be because they are operating under a license so that it
protects them it protects the company they are operating for and it also
protects the consumer. Answer the first path of your question why is
this necessary right now there is a barrier of you will to employees
loan officers who at the depositories institution want to go work for
non-depositories institutions. In the real world if somebody works today
in the bank and they want to go work at one of these other institutions
so I think it's a good idea. The barrier is as soon as they start these
classes and test their employment fact find out about that in fact have
been some instances where there employment has been placed in japery
should we say. So that's within the state. The other thing and the
reason for it is when people move here from out of the state and it
might restricting crumbling county fort Bragg there are number of
military families who come from many different places in the country so
it's not preventative if especially a military member comes into North
Carolina or just moves here for main or Massachusetts or North Dakota or
wherever and they had a job as a loan officer and they know what they
are doing and they want to be a loan officer here allows them to get
their feet on the ground or get employed as soon as they get here rather
than taking this time where might put them under great financial
strength.

House finance occupancy tax sub committee last Thursday. Essentially
what it does is, it conforms to new guidelines that we set forward and
adopted in the sub committee last week. That also increases their
occupancy tax from 5% to 6%. You'll notice in the bill itself that there
is a cap on the accumulated amount of dollars that can be used toward
beach nourishment of 30 million dollars. The reason that that cap is in
there is simply to protect the fund itself because if the federal
government ever does began to participate in funding beach nourishment
then those dollars will be sent back to the tours and be used for other
reasons. I'll answer as many questions as I can. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ross for an inquiry.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, thank you mr
chairman. The gentlemen said that they've changed the guidelines for
occupancy tax bills. And so since we've had certain guidelines for
occupancy tax bills for years and years. I'd like to know what the
changes are to the guidelines for occupancy tax and why those changes
were made. Because we've been doing things the same way for a long time
and its always good to know why the old way doesn't work anymore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes ma'am the chair would like to point at with all
due respect that this was explained when we first convened. But the
chair would ask that representative Moffit address that again. And Mr.
Cohen could you come to the front please you have the floor.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr chair. As I stated this morning, the guidelines
which have been in place I guess for about 20 years or so   that were
put in place by this committee. Essentially allowed for coastal
communities to use one third of their occupancy tax for beach
nourishment. This was put in while at the same time the federal
government  was also participating and funding some of those beach
nourishment programs. Since the federal government is no longer doing
that, the coastal communities were having difficulties with their beach
nourishment programs. They ask for the change in the guidelines to go
from one third to fifty percent. The North Carolina travel and tourism
coalition took this under advisement. They met about it. They discussed
it. They felt that it would be an appropriate step to change the
guidelines to honor that request. The sub committee discussed it
thoroughly last Thursday we agreed and we adopted the change to the
guidelines. Once the guidelines were changed thats when representative
Mikel Ref presented her bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No Problem.
Representative Brawley. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill and make a
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir you have the floor to speak on the
bill.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Having been apart of the some of the first
occupancy taxes that were passed and seen the benefits derive from it.
I'd like to make a motion we give  house bill 553 a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ok sir. Representative Carney.  [SPEAKER CHANGES Thank
you Mr chairman. I serve on the occupancy tax committee and we did
discuss this fully and the coalition did weigh in and support on it. I
will point that there, we did say is that the chairman of the occupancy
tax sub committee said earlier that there will be a sunset put in, its
not a sunset but its a date certain that Carnig county agreed that this
would end and it would revert back to the original formula. We did
identify those coastal counties that are contiguous to the coast itself.
So we did have that in that discussion.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
Representative Lukey. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you mr chairman. I wanna
follow up on representative Ross's concerns. And let me ask first
representative Moffit and I'm in Carnig county, and I've stayed in
Lantic beach, so I've paid that occupancy tax. If I go down after this
bill becomes law, how much will I pay in terms of occupancy tax.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It'll go up one percent.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you
realize how unusual that is in the state of North Carolina?  [SPEAKER
CHANGES] What is unusual?  [SPEAKER CHANGES] That the occupancy tax is
above 6%. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No its going from 5 to 6. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm sorry, I understood you to say 7%. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I didn't say 7
I said it goes up one percent to 6 percent.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] five plus
one. O. Well to follow up you're saying Carnig county, I've been paying
11 percent not 12 ..</p>

The first same in some senses that serve as a scientist and staff can
turn the thing back in the county had 8% is the only one thing that's
because the man's car museum but to follow this chairman to offer this
lie again led by these guidelines which we have struggled with me for
years and have those headlines in the house finance committee and
subcommittee and a lot of members of thumb for testing for exceptions to
those rules and in this subcommittee has hammered them back and said
nationalism before me some committee's subcommittee with the same rules
questions that so that people can form the rules even have a special

change the rules just before the spill came to hostile 553 to 40¢ and

months of the market on travel and tourism coalition of that with an

happen just a convenience system and several months in the making the
Foot Locker line travel and tourism coalition could not agree with the

taking was the fact that the beach itself is the largest role for the
coastal communities at the beach itself does not have the appropriate
notion in regards to replace as saying that Betsy’s two to leave by
coddle action that's a bit role from a tourist stamp one would go for
naught so they decided that's the best interest of the coastal
communities as number one attraction from the tourist standpoint is the

Thank you. I do believe that when the subcommittee was set for last
week, that both House Bill 260, or Senate Bill 269 and House Bill 568
were properly noticed and that no one from Salisbury or the City of
Asheville made it to the meeting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. With that, we'll move into Senate Bill
269. Representative, you have the floor, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.
This is Senate Bill 269. Senator Brock could not be here. They're not
meeting until later today, but it's companion to House Bill 260. This
local bill has full bipartisan and local delegation support. It passed
the Senate committee and onto the Senate floor unanimously with
bipartisan support. It's passed all the House committees, finance
subcommittee unanimously, and all the property in question is owned by
Rowan county as you'll see by the map that has been passed out. All
parcels are owned by the county of Rowan. Any questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I'm sorry to beat a procedural dead horse or
moose or whatever I'm beating. But I remember, Representative Moffitt
that when you called the subcommittee meeting you did not state the
bills that would be heard in the subcommittee because afterwards several
of us said, &quot;Gosh, we should have asked what those bills
were.&quot; And so you didn't actually notice them by even number.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Luebke, it's not my
subcommittee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry. I apologize then. Whoever, who would it
have been? Representative Stone, you did not identify the bills that
were going to be heard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's neither here nor there, the bills got the votes.
I just want to make that comment for the record. That we did not know
what bills were coming up in the subcommittee.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Luebke. Representative Ross
on the contents of Senate Bill 269.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is actually on a remark
made by the gentleman. He said that it had full bipartisan support. I
assume that means among the county commissioners?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, ma'am. County commissioners are all Republican. I
mean among the delegation. We have a democratic Senator and a Republican
Senator, and two Republican House members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Thank you, very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would move that we give Senate Bill 269 a favorable
report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley of Iredell has moved that
Senate Bill 269 be given a favorable report. Is there further discussion
or debate? Seeing none, the question before the committee is the motion
by Representative Brawley of Iredell to give Senate Bill 269 a favorable
report. Those who favor the motion will signify by saying aye. Those
opposing the motion will signify by saying no. In the opinion of the
Chair, the ayes have it and the motion carries.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee.
Even you, Representative Luebke, thank you.
[laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen, the Chair thanks you for your
time today. There will be no further business before the committee. This
committee stands adjourned.
