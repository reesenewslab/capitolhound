The prayer will be offered by Rep. Dean Arp. Members and visitors in the
gallery please stand, and please remain standing for the Pledge of
Allegiance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If you would like to join me in prayer. This is a
prayer written by Pitts Baptist Sunday School Class 4A. Most gracious
and merciful God, we recognize your authority and ownership overall
creation and ask you, O Lord, to go before each one of here us today to
give us wisdom and discernment to walk blameless in your sight. For You
are El Roi, the God who sees. Thank You for bringing us blessings and
liberties in this great state and burden us to not take this great gifts
for granted. Allow us to recognize that true blessings, liberty and
personal salvation come through Jesus Christ alone, by our intimate
relationship with him. We pray for ourselves, the state policy makers in
both houses of the General Assembly of North Carolina to have courage to
stand firm in our personal faith and convictions and to not be persuaded
by those with selfish interests. To seek Your wisdom in decision making
and to remain humble with the powers entrusted to us. Help us to find
ways to come together without compromising our faith and values. We
bring each different ideas from all over the state, yet we seek to be
unified. We pray for our state judges that they seek wisdom from You for
decisions and rulings, and to exercise integrity while the laws that
they have been entrusted to protect. And we pray for Gov. McCrory and
Lt. Gov. Forest and their families. May they stay strong in their faith
and stay strong in Jesus, the author and perfector of our faith. Give
them guidance, wisdom and courage as they lead our state. May Your
Church be strong, bearing in You much fruit. We know that without You we
can do nothing. We pray for those who don't know salvation in You to
come to understand that You, Lord, are the only way to God the Father.
We thank You for the privilege to be here and for all You have given us.
Watch over us. Guide us in our decisions on all the issues that come
before us today. Make our hearts selfless, humble and open and our minds
focused. Remind us that our decisions affect many people. And how, Lord,
we stand before You humbled and seeking Your face. Please hear our
prayer, Father. Forgive us our sins and fill this land ? . In the name
of Your Son Jesus, Amen.

been much discussed and I could discuss it for a long time, but after a
lot of negotiation and consideration it received a unanimous
recommendation as far as I could hear from the banking committee, and
many of the people interested in it on both sides have either agreed to
it or are neutral on it now, including as not opposed the north Climate
Commander’s Council, the Commissioner of Banks, the Center for
Responsible Lending, and the Justice Center.  What it does is change the
regulations of consumers… under the consumer finance act… in many ways,
but primarily because it had been so long since the brackets to which
interest rates applied for so many years, for so many decades, it
changes those brackets really to allow lending up to $15,000.  Setting
the interest rates, of course higher for really small loans, moderately
higher for those a little higher, and a flat 18% for those on loans
above 10,000 up to 15,000.  So they range from 30% up to 18%.
But it does many other things, for example doubling the minimum loan
term from six months to one year making it much more likely that loans
will not go into default and extending the maximum term of loans from 7
up to 8 years. There does allow a modest late fee as is true in
practically all other lending a $15 late fee that could be applied once
to each payment that is there.  But unlike most other lending there’s no
attorney’s fees that you can get…   maybe this is a (chuckles) defect in
this bill… no attorney’s fees allowed.  Mr. Speaker, when I first got
into this a couple of years ago, I said well these rates that go from 30
to 18 are higher than I pay on my mortgage.    And with the recent
downturn in the economy 5 years ago interest rates plummeted and we have
made a lot of changes in interest rates because those rates, you know,
are there because of Federal Reserve policy and the effect is that
people... and we made a lot of changes to regulations of rates in the 8
– 20% range making it almost impossible for people to get credit.  I
could recount some of things we did.  But people can still get credit on
credit cards, they can still go out and deal with the mafia, they can
still do a lot of other things to get money…</p>

like bounced checks. This is a responsible way to do installment lending
that's been around for decades. It's safe and for the amount of loan
involved it's affordable and reasonable. I'm gonna pass around -
thorough the Sargent at Arms here - a discussion of micro lending. You
know, sometimes the problem is insufficient credit and a fella has
gotten even the Nobel prize - Muhammad Yunus - has gotten the Nobel
Prize for sending out micro lending around the world. That is getting
small loans to people who need some credit. And so, I researched that a
little bit and discovered that the rates on those loans typically range
from 30-70 percent. Now, representative Blackwell here would never dream
of paying that on his house, and boat, and car because he can get that
credit at three and four percent. but for people who cannot get credit
otherwise lawfully, sometimes that is the very best choice. I'll be glad
to answer questions after offering an amendment. I'd like to complement
representative Larry Hall and representative Jordan for bringing a small
amendment to my attention but which is important. It's not a technical
amendment. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to offer an amendment and then discuss
that.

The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment
[speaker changes]
Mr. Speaker, members of the house, if you're looking at page 6, line 11,
it deletes the words acceptance provided in subdivision 6 of such
section B of this section. So that sounds exciting but by taking it out
we think we're giving more protection to those of the military rank of
E4 and below. Now, first of all, I would like to say contrary to what I
heard in committee, that the rank of E4 is not a low ranking person. I
was an E4 and I rose to become the chairman of the head detail of a
barracks of 200 men. Higher than I have got in here. I got to do the ??.
E4 is a corporal. But anyway, there's special protections in here on
pages 5 and 6 for those E4 and below and without this amendment, it was
not clear that those members would have the broader protection that was
available to everybody including those of E5 and above but also the
general public. So, Mister Speaker, I move the adoption of the
amendment.

Further discussion, further debate on the amendment. If not, the

[speaker canges]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman, lest you be lulled into
inaction or a little bit of complacency by my colleague across the
aisle. I wanted just to remind you of a bill that we dealt with last
session and see if you think that it sounds similar at all to what we're
dealing with today. We keep playing this game, and I like to call that
game whack-a-mole, as you've heard me say before whack-a-mole with these
consumer finance loans. Consumer finance bills. Last session in
particular, we looked at a bill that, among other populations, would
prey on military families. And now, we have another bill that is dressed
differently with a little different bill number but I would submit that
it looks like and walks like the bill that we defeated earlier. It is
opposed by the Attorney General and those folks that you heard mentioned
as sort of glossed over as supporting or neutral, most of them are --</p>

<p id="040:00">
Neutral, it's not that they support it at all but they are neutral. I
can tell you that it is opposed by the Attorney General, by AARP as well
as the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys. And the
reasons for their opposition makes sense. These loans are loaded with
expensive credit insurance products, which by the way are sold to
customers with great success but turn out to be the highest percentage
of the money borrowed.
The customer is often encouraged to flip or refinance these loans, and
then lenders are trained in a advance that when the customer gets close
to paying off the loan to hurry up and push a renewal to make it harder
for the payoff of these loans to occur. These two issues alone would be
enough to discourage the financially savvy from using this kind of loan
alternative but there's more. These loans are expensive and even with
the adjustments made in the earlier amendments that we know exist in
this bill today, all that is saved by the customer in interest is a
whopping $42.00 on average.
What's more is that most people who borrow in this way borrow the
smaller amounts and thus end up paying the higher interest rate. But
wait! There's more. As the infomercial say, for example, by the time the
consumer goes in to borrow, receives their payment schedule, purchases
the insurance products being pushed by the lender, the amount that the
consumer has left over to pay off his or her debt is a whopping 27
cents.
There is so much wrong with these kinds of loan products that take
advantage of the poor, the elderly, families that are already
struggling. Not to mention that most of the profit that's realized by
these companies don't even reside in North Carolina. Out of state
companies control...

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Fisher does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] When I am done I'll be happy to yield. Out of state

you all will join with me in opposing this very troubling way to do
business in North Carolina. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Szoka.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as
amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentleman, I'm gonna start with the bottom
line upfront., I support this bill. I have five specific reasons why. As
you may or may not know I'm retired military and the first reason is
that this bill supposedly hurts our military. It does not hurt military.
it has specific protections written into the bill top protect the
military.
For example for E4 and below, the first thing that a consumer finance
company has to do is call that soldiers unit commander, their company
commander or whoever else is in authority. So they're gonna be talking
with a first Sargent or a captain who directly is concerned with that
soldiers welfare. As a former company commander among other things I
will tell you that if I got a call like that I would be grateful for
that call and I would certainly talk to that young soldiers chain of
command to make sure that he wasn't getting sucked into something that
he shouldn't be into.
I haven't seen in any other bill that we've passed here the consumer
protections for soldiers that has been written into this bill. The
second point I'd like to make is this bill is about consumer choice and
it's about the availability of capital. I've had many conversations with
you on a one to one basis about one of my pet peeves which is the
availability of capital both for corporations and for consumers.
We all have been through a great recession here, we know that. It's very
difficult to get loans whether your a business whether you're trying to
finance your house, or whether you're an individual who just rents. We
still have needs though. Cars fail, they have to be fixed, we have to
pay for our kids to go to college, there's a lot of different reasons.
This is an avenue for people generally speaking with lower credit scores
who gives them access to capital. And as long as we're talking about
credit scores for just a minute let me remind those of you who might not
know what it is, the official definition of a credit score form Equifax
is it's a numerical score that is an indication of a consumers
likelihood to repay a loan. Now this is [??] coaching to this
discussion. If you have a credit sore of 700 or...</p>

<p id="045:00">
the odds are 577 to 1 that you will make a late payment on anything in
the next 90 days, if you have a credit score of 630 the odds are 18 to
1, so the logic behind a lot of lending goes, the more likely you are to
miss a payment in the next 90 days, the higher the risk is to the
lender, therefor the higher the rate of return is to the lender because
more people fail to make payments. it just makes sense, that's why some
people with lower credit scores have higher rates on their cars, some
people who are looking to qualify for mortgages can't qualify and some
people who need access to capitol in situations like this, with lower
credit scores have to pay a little bit more. Now the good part about
this is, the consumer finance companies don't just go by credit score,
they also go by the credit, so they look at the whole person when they
are evaluating and when they're underwriting these files, in fact they
turn down more of these loans than they actually accept. There is
another option sometimes for people to get short term amounts of money
and its credit cards, if you can qualify for a credit card, you can have
whatever up to your limit is, the rates on those is significantly high,
and there's no term for when you pay it back. When you get one of these
consumer finance loans you can pay it back in 12, 24, 36 months. For
people who might have difficulty with credit cards, this is actually a
very good option because they can plan their budget knowing how much
they have to pay every month, rather than having a credit card, where
they start making minimum payments and get into all kinds of trouble.
The last 15 years in which I've been involved in the mortgage business,
I've looked at thousands of individuals credit reports. Now I'm not
going to say I've never seen a credit report where somebody had a
consumer loan and they didn't have a problem and I needed to recommend
they give it to a bankruptcy attorneu, but I tell you the answer to
people who have ran up their credit cards making minimum payments can
really get in trouble, far, far, far outweighs those people I've seen
who tend to like these consumer loans, so its a matter of consumer
choice, its a matter of the availability of capitol, and really for
these people its a choice. now its not our job to legislate the outcomes
of peoples decisions, if people want to do this than we ought to let
them do it in a way that we protect by sound laws which I think that
this law is. There are other options for folks to get money, my good
friend the representative valmor was asking me about this aggies son tv
from western travel landing, APRs of over 500%. there are literally no
consumer protections in that because some of these off shore lenders, if
you will and some of these tribal lenders, they advertise on the
internet. people go to the internet, they sign up for it and one of the
first things you do on the internet is sign away all of your consumer
protections, so there are other options, as representative Sam said the
mafia might be one, however we are not in New York so I don't know if
that's really true, in summery its consumer choice, its the good option
for people where they can plan their own payments in advance, as far as
the flipping goes, its not really flipping they may renew it. The
additional products that they might choose to have some of these
insurance products,in a lot of cases they don't have any insurance like
you and I might have, health insurance, so it affords them a low cost
option to have those things, while their being extended credit and
protecting their family in the unlikely event that they die. I think its
a good bill and I commend this bill to you

'speaker changes
thank you Mr speaker, i want to make a quick point about credit
insurance, while credit insurance is more expensive than traditional
home owners or life insurance or disability insurance, a lot of
consumers that take out these installment loans don't have this type of
insurance and they really want these products. generally if they don't
bomb and they have some sort of event, or fire, or a death, they go back
to the lender and say &quot;why didn't you sell me that product&quot;, i
would also like to point out that's its made very clear to the person
taking out the loan that they do not have to buy credit, life or
disability, or property insurance on this product, so while they are a
little more expensive than traditional insurance that people buy. a
majority of the people who take these loans don't have these products so
it does provide a benefit for them. One other quick point I want to make
is that money is a commodity, and people when you want access to money
you have to pay for it. It has been 30 years since these institutions
have been able to increase what they charge even though their costs have
gone up, none of us would ever</p>

history we have heard in here today. If this bill sounds familiar to you
it should, and in 2011 we passed, the House passed house bill 810, we
didn't defeat it. on a good bipartisan vote and I remember much
bipartisan debate support for it just like we have here today. I
remember standing up and basically saying what Representative Goodman
just said about the fact that we're just kinda making up for inflation
over last thirty years.  I remember Representative Kelly Alexander
standing up and saying much of what Representative Zoco did about the
fact that it's easy for us here in this chamber who, you know, can go
play banks off each other for a loan rate to tell other people who don't
have those alternatives they shouldn't go get money somewhere and that
this is basically their alternative other than, you know, Knuckles on
the corner, to go get some money from. But anyway I just wanted to make
sure we remembered that it was the Senate that sat on this bill, we
passed this bill on a bipartisan vote back in 2011, I would suggest we
pass it again.

[Speaker change] Representative Collins, what was the interest rate

[Speaker change]  Representative Stam, please state your purpose
[Speaker change] To speak on the bill
[Speaker change] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill
[Speaker change]  Mr. Speaker and members of the house, for many of you
this will be the fifth time that you have  debated this, not including
second and third readings as more than one time. If you've been on the
relevant committees it may have been ten or twelve times. And so I'm
tempted to say very little and just vote but I realize that a large
proportion of this house is new.  You're not new to the public debate
that has occurred in the, your communities, but you may be new to the
legal debate. So I will say something about it. It's very, very serious.
I’m passing around two pages of excerpts from debates that we've had in
the past in 2009, 2011 and 2012, and I'll come to that at the end, but
it will be coming to you. And what it addresses is a phenomena that we
had a couple years ago and even last week. And that is people who
support the so-called racial justice act, but had no idea that it could
be applied or relief could be sought by, for example a white defendant
who killed a white person, tried by a white judge and a white jury and
claim that he or she was discriminated against on the basis of race.
That's what this bill does among other, I mean that's what the
underlying bill we want to repeal does whether you believe it or not.</p>

<p id="055:00">
That's true.  I'd like to got through the bill with you, because it does
some other things other that repeal, although I expect most of the
debate to occur on that repeal.  The first section allows doctors,
nurses, pharmacist to participate in executions, in other words, do
their job without fear of professional retribution.  In 2007, the
Medical Board issued a statement prohibiting doctors from participating
in executions, even though state law required a doctor to be there.  The
North High Supreme Court later ruled that the board could not punish
doctors for doing that, and this section codifies that decision.
Section 2 directs the Attorney General to notify the Department of
Public Safety when legal appeals are exhausted for a particular case and
then directs the Department of Public Safety to ensure the protocols
provide the assembly with periodic updates with what's happening with
these 150 or so appeals that have been wandering around in the appellate
courts for 15, 20, 25 years.  Section 5A repeals the so called Racial
Justice Act, while reaffirming in Section 5, the multiple avenues of
appeal available to ensure a fair hearing in any case where there's
actual discrimination based on race.  And so I don't have to jump up and
down every time someone claims that there's no remedy if there's actual
racial discrimination, all I'll do is I'll just hold up my hand, it'll
say 5, and 5 means Section 5B, read Section 5B, you'll see it there.  No
one wants actual racial discrimination, what we don't want also, is for
race to be used as a pretext in order to stop the death penalty which
has been the public policy of this state for those who have committed
deliberate premeditated murder under aggravating circumstances.  When
the Racial Justice Act was passed in 2009, it effectively imposed a 4 to
6 year moratorium on the death penalty, I prophesied a 3 or 4 years, I
was wrong, by allowing all death row inmates at the time to claim they
were racially discriminated against.  As I said, even white criminals
claimed racial discrimination.  I think there where 156 inmates at that
time, 152 of them made these claims, and I guess the other 4 are just
volunteers who wanted to be executed.  The reason for this is it allows
murderers to seek relief by proving that someone else was discriminated
against in another time, another place, another decade, another county.
And as I say, almost all murderers sought relief.  Why does this matter?
 I've shown this book before, this is probably the 5th time I've shown
this book.  It's 28 studies furnished to me by the Attorney General's
office which demonstrates that there's statistically significant
deterrent effect of having the death penalty, on whether or not you have
additional homicides.  And a rough count, a rough count of the people
who have now died in North Carolina, innocent people who've died in
North Carolina, a majority of whom are African Americans, because of
this moratorium, would  be approximately the number of people seated
here and the number of people filling the galleries.  That's been the
human cost of this so-called Racial Justice Act.  Let me go to the paper
I passed out, the 2 page piece of paper there, I not going to read the
whole thing.  I could quote myself, but that's boring even to me.  In
the debate on the 2009 act before it when into effect, what's underlined
there, is we told them, this allows every person of the 163 murderers
currently on death row to make this claim.  Every one of them has had
the right to make the claim that racial prejudice was exhibited against
them for the last 8 to 15 years they've been on death row.  In other
words, before this act went into effect, the typical murderer had 8 to
15 years</p>

on death row if they ended up being executed. In a case reviewed by 45
judges.  What the Racial Justice Act did was add six years approximately
so that becomes then 14 to 21 years and instead of 45 judges, 53 judges.
 How many judges is enough?  It was easy to tell from the bill itself
why this would happen. They got an immediate one year stay because they
had a year to make their motion and now they've been in litigation on
those motions for I believe about three years now.  If they're African
American they claim it's disproportionality according to population. If
not, they'll claim disproportionality in other ways.  ??? Bill, the
prosecutor in Gaston County told us in Committee and in paper that one
of the ironies of the bill is that it will make seeking the death
penalty almost impossible.  Of all the defendants in Gaston County on
death row, only one is black.  All the rest are white men. I have two
pending capital cases both involving white defendants.  In order to
prosecute more white men capitally  I'm going to have to first get some
death sentences imposed on some black men. That's the way the bill will
work if we're foolish enough to pass it. Quotas on the death penalty.
And then in the debate in 2011 when we knew what had happened, we
explained  again that this was not about actual racial discrimination
but rather discrimination proved that somebody else did it in somebody
else's cases and somebody else's time. Well we weren't able to get an
override of the Governor's veto in 2011 but in 2012 we did and I have a
short excerpt from that.  Another proponent was quoted publicly, I think
that was Representative Womble, saying  he didn't understand that white
defendants could use it if they murdered white people or of the same
race or had the same race of jurors. But it has all of those effects.
It is probably one of the most foolish laws we ever passed and if you
would look at Section 5b. of the bill you will see that even after, this
is on page 4, lines beginning at 44, upon repeal, that's when we pass
this law, a capital defendant retains all of the rights which the State
and Federal Constitutions provide to ensure that the prosecutors who
selected a jury who sought a capital conviction did not do so on the
basis of race, that the jury that hears his or her case is impartial and
that the trial was free from prejudicial error of any kind. These rights
are protected through multiple avenues of appeal, habeas corpus, motions
for appropriate relief, and we don't need this extraneous act which is
unique in the nation. They'll try to tell you that Kentucky has a
similar law and I'll explain why Kentucky's is completely different if
that comes up.  But remember this.  Every time you hear that this law is
necessary to ensure that we are free from racial discrimination I'm
going to hold up my hand here, it's going to say 5b. and I'll want you
to go look at page 4, those lines, and you'll see that that is not so.

My son is much smarter than his dad, so I- and he studied the RJA as we
were going through this in college and in grad school. So I called him
and asked if he would play Devil's Advocate with me as I defended the
act while he gave the arguments against it. And the conversation went a
bit like this:
Phillip said &quot;Dad, isn't the RJA designed to answer whether anyone
on death row was sentenced to death due to a significant reason that it
was the color of their skin?&quot; And I said &quot;That's right,
son.&quot; And he said &quot;Dad, didn't the act allow overwhelming
statistics of discrimination to show patterns of discrimination just
like we do in civil cases?&quot; &quot;Yup.&quot; &quot;And Dad, didn't
the original act require an outside university, with no ties to North
Carolina to look at two decades of cases and present their findings
wherever that mass of evidence led?&quot; &quot;Absolutely.&quot;
&quot;It was Michigan State, wasn't it dad?&quot; &quot;Go
Spartans,&quot; said I. &quot;That study, dad, said Philip found in jury
selection that the prosecution struck over two times as many qualified
black jurors as white jurors in those two decades of cases. And in fact,
over 40% of those on death row had all white juries or just one minority
juror on that jury?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; said I, &quot;but son, you
have to know that wasn't a North Carolina study, and you have to
remember it was done out of state.&quot; &quot;Well dad, the study was
peer reviewed, wasn't it?&quot; &quot;Yep.&quot; &quot;And it had the
same findings as the Carolina study done by professors at the University
two years prior, with a smaller number of cases.&quot; &quot;Yep.&quot;
&quot;And its authors were nationally acclaimed?&quot; &quot;That's
true.&quot; &quot;And it was introduced into evidence at the first RJA
trial, and the judge found it valid and credible and statistically
unassailable?&quot; &quot;That's true.&quot; &quot;But you gotta
remember son,&quot; say I, &quot;as one Senator said in this debate on
this bill on the Senate floor about five weeks ago, 'The judge that
tried that RJA case was black. And probably biased.'&quot; &quot;I
see,&quot; said my son. &quot;So Judge Weeks, that same judge that's on
the Law faculty at Carolina and Central and Duke and Carolina?&quot;
&quot;Yeah, that's the one.&quot; &quot;And he's been on the bench
twenty years?&quot; &quot;Yes he has.&quot; &quot;And he has one of the
lowest reversal rates in the state over those twenty years?&quot;
&quot;Yes he does.&quot; &quot;And he was asked by the Chief Justice to
be the specific judge to try the murder of Michael Jordan's
father?&quot; &quot;He was.&quot; &quot;And he's handed down death
sentences in cases as a trial judge, including one of yours, dad, isn't
that the case?&quot; And I said, &quot;Yes he did. And we're not gonna
talk about that.&quot; &quot;But the Senator still said he was biased
because he was black? Dad, do you think if Judge Ammonds or Judge Don
Stevens out of Wake County tried the case, that that Senator would have
said they were biased because they were white?&quot; &quot;No son, that
would be discriminatory, wouldn't it?&quot; &quot;Oh, I see,&quot; said
Philip. &quot;Well dad, since the RJA passed there've been several
trials.&quot; &quot;That's true.&quot; &quot;And in the first trial,
didn't Judge Weeks find overwhelming evidence that discrimination in
Cumberland county in jury selection occurred where he said there was
very powerful evidence race was a significant factor in the exercise of
pre-emptory jury strikes in Cumberland county, and he found evidence
that North Carolina prosecutors 'systemically' quote, 'engaged in
training from 1995 til 2011, not in how to comply with the Batson
decision prohibiting race as part of jury strikes, but in how to
circumvent it. And didn't he find that race was a materially,
practically, and statistically significant factor in jury selection in
these cases for 20 years in North Carolina, in the second judicial
division, and in Cumberland county?&quot; &quot;Yes he did, son. But
some of that evidence was contradicted at trial.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot;
Philip said, &quot;by another study?&quot; &quot;Well not exactly, the
state had a partial study but they said they didn't have time to
complete the study.&quot; &quot;But Michigan State did?&quot; said my
son, and I said &quot;Yes.&quot; He said &quot;Well who then
contradicted it?&quot; I said &quot;The prosecutors who tried those
cases said that they didn't make their strikes based on their race, and
they should have been believed.&quot; And my son said, &quot;Well kind
of like when the defendant says he didn't do it, they should be
believed?&quot; And I said &quot;Well not exactly, there's a
difference.&quot; &quot;Well aren't they both self-serving?&quot;
&quot;Well maybe.</p>

are made by officer the state and the other is facing a penalty. I was
at my son well. the other thing I said is remember who has the burden of
proof. if the defendant state authority found guilty, but then has to
prove that there was racier. most of my son, so the state controls all
the records of their own jury selection, and they control those records
on trial and on appeal and they don't have to disclose their jury
records to anybody but the defendant has to prove that those dreary
records show discrimination. now you're getting it. Philip was in a
great state
didn't judge weeks in the expert statistician from Michigan State on the
probability that racial disparities like he found occurring in these
cases
that they would occur in a racially neutral process would be less than
one in ten trillion square. yes, that's on you know what Mark Twain said
about statistics, statistics and statistics, and lots and remember also
saw that the Supreme Court of McCleskey versus Glenn said
statistic should never be enough to prove race discrimination in capital
cases that set myself in Justice Powell, who wrote that opinion before
he died. states of the New York Times that he wished the one where she
had was that it loaded differently in that case an idiot come to the
conclusion it was the biggest mistake ever made on the Supreme Court of
that's true son. but you got remember judges never make mistakes,
because did that for posterity owes that fill recalling the Dred Scott
opinions Cora Moxie and Plessy versus Ferguson
and remember Philip were talking about RJ, we repealed that last year
the now statistical evidence can only be used as background evidence,
not dis positive. it has to be geographically limited and time-limited
and racial discrimination can only be proven by real anecdotal evidence
of rates. I see said Philip and judgments just told the second trial
after that.
and after a long opinion, in which both sides not to put on all their
evidence and cross examine their witnesses and make full arguments and
to define this time a few months ago, even more evidence this time in
the prosecutor 's own notes of racial bias in jury selection left with
the order said son judges make mistakes without it, you just submitted
it to the judges never make mistakes built in memory like her mother,
two points. my son first judge week 's decision was just about
Cumberland County, and that's on appeal and ask not affected by this
order will know whether Judge Weise was right or not. after that appeal
that this new act is now stop that from happening in any other camp, so
want find out what happened in Cumberland County, really. I ceased to
fill, so it's okay for Cumberland County defendants to have the
opportunity to prove that their trials were racially tainted by
race-based jury selection, but now won't be okay for anyone else in the
state to have the same opportunity. what exactly do you call that that
uniform system of justice of general corpses on and then there was the
second point
is that this representative Stan says creates a very long process. it
delays executions beside the defendant can always prove race
discrimination at trial are you on motions for appropriate relief.all
those live finger nothingness representative stands talking about that,
let me ask you that you think it's worth the time to get an answer to
the most pressing and divisive issue of race in death penalty cases. it
existed in the criminal justice system for generation and the truth of
my leases rapid North Carolina Supreme Court, and should that would
decide those cases. once they do,which should be within the next year.
all of the other cases will then fall very quickly. one way or the
other, and in the true dad don't think that the prosecutors now have the
ability and have always had the ability to move to dismiss RJ appeals
that are frivolous and isn't it possible that the other judges like
Judge Weeks and other places might find them recently. the significant
role in jury</p>

Representative: JA was designed to ferret out and stop now and forever
race discrimination in jury selection and isn’t time, if the repeal is
done, isn’t it true that we will never, ever get the final answer that
we have now spent all this time and money and emotion in trying to find.
Wouldn’t we want to remember that over the last 12 years there have been
three innocent people released from death row in NC after they were
convicted by a jury, had their appeal upheld by the courts, lost their
motions for appropriate relief, lost their federal [xx] petitions, and
all those wonderful things that Representative Dann’s figure has raised.
Well son, those are all great questions. The witness’ family needs
finality, the system needs finality. [xx] always taught me that nothing
is ever settled until it is settled right, didn’t you? Yes I did. Here
we are talking about life and death, and race and prejudice. Aren’t we
Dad? Shouldn’t we take time and money to get it right for future
generations? That maybe true son. Dad, I have just one last question for
you. If all this evidence could have been uncovered at people’s trials,
and appeals, and mar’s, habius, and we have had great lawyers trying
those cases, why did it never happen? Why did it take RJ to find out
about all that evidence? Well son, there really is a good answer to
this. The prosecutor’s notes on jury selections and trial strategy are
protected. Lawyers have to be able to write down their thoughts,
opinions, strategy and innermost thoughts free from the belief that
someone will then get to review them. So, said Phillip, the RJ is the
first time those notes were made available. Basically that is true, but
dad, if that is true, then wasn’t that the first time that these things
were uncovered? For example, he said, that Kenneth Rouse had an all
white jury because the prosecutor dismissed everyone of color who were
qualified for the jury? One of the jurors who sentenced to death
admitted that he lied to be on the jury – that juror’s mother was
sexually assaulted and murdered, and that juror deliberately concealed
that fact from the judge, the prosecutors and the defense attorneys, and
he admitted it after trial, “black men rape white women so that they can
brag to their families.” “That blacks don’t care about living as much as
whites,” and referred to African Americans routinely as “niggers.” That
bigotry influenced his decision to vote for death, isn’t that true dad?
Well it is. Isn’t it true that the courts never meaningfully considered
that claim but would have to under the justice in deliberation act. How
about Qunitel Augustine who was convicted by an all white jury and their
unsigned, hand written notes, turned over many years ago, that said,
“jury strike list,” on it. That had things on them like, “this juror is
from a respectable black family, “ “this juror is a black wino,” or “a
white juror as a trafficking marijuana potboat earlier in the 80’s, but
a fine guy.” Those notes, and many like them, were never uncovered. His
lawyers never had access to them before RJA. We look through the RJA
discovery that prosecutors were trained, in this state, how to avoid
bats and through cheat sheets, which we will talk about later. That is
true. Isn’t it true dad that we learned in 1995, in a case called State
versus Pervet, that the prosecutor struck an African American member in
the jury because he was a veteran in the U.S. Army but then kept white
[xx]? That is true. Didn’t we learn in another case called State versus
Dibidough that struck a black member because he answered questions,
“yeah,” instead of “yes,” six times? Isn’t it true that in a note from
another case that he struck an African American because he did feel like
a victim even though he had his car broken into one time? Yeah, and many
more. Well, said my son, what do you say about that? Well, I said, they
were great notes: clear and specific, good grammar and syntax on those
notes. All told that they were great notes. The jury</p>

Rep. Glazier do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman does not yield. Rep. Glazier you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much Mr. Speaker. Remember sometimes son, lawyers write
things down by mistake. So, he said, the DA’s that wrote on those notes
black wino strike’em might really have meant white and sober? Well, not
exactly son.  Or, maybe when they wrote black, bad neighborhood, they
meant white good neighborhood. No, son. So, dad let me ask you, finally.
If this RJAA is repealed, it’s going to be repealed despite a UNC study
showing racial prejudice in jury selection in North Carolina? And, a one
million dollar Michigan State study that say the odds again race
discrimination having occurred fortuitously is one to ten trillion
squared? And, two court decisions headed to the Supreme Court with
detailed findings by a respected judge holding the study to be valid and
findings give massive anecdotal evidence from pages of prosecutors notes
that race played a significant factor in those cases? And, cases pending
in courts around the state that would be stopped? And the North Carolina
Supreme Court hasn’t even had time to rule on the first two cases, but
if they did they would establish the law for the state if we let them do
it? And, all the rest of the cases would resolved and now we will never
know whether race played a part or didn’t play a part in those cases. Is
that true? And, I said yes. He said, well dad, what exactly do you call
this system? And I said equal justice under the law son. We’re very
proud of it here in North Carolina. For the reasons my son articulated
more eloquently than I, and the many inconvenient truths he’s
highlighted, this should resolve our decision today. We can no more
pretend that we have completely escaped the grip of a historical legacy
spanning centuries as a society and the prosecutor and defense lawyers
who tried these cases could rise above the legal culture of that same
society in which they operated and were trained. We remain in prison by
the past as long as we continue to deny its existence. If instead of
accepting the consequences of what we did, and hoping and ensuring it
never happens again, we simply bury the evidence. In a Hogan’s Hero
like, Sgt. Schultz “I see nothing I know nothing I hear nothing”
routine. We will never again have the confidence of our full society and
the fairness and accuracy of the criminal justice system. And more
importantly, in the truth of equal justice under the law. We will not on
this floor be remembered for most decisions we ever passed. Unemployment
changes, tax reform changes, employment security changes, but every once
in awhile in a generation when you’re a legislator, you will cast a vote
for which history will remember you. I know you came to this floor many
of you from caucuses we did. And, have a set view perhaps when coming
in. But, what we do today goes way past our caucuses and our ideology,
and our political obligations. We decide here today, a matter of life
and death. Whether we leave ragged questions unanswered about our own
history, or whether we leave together confidently to heal all those
wounds. We decide today a case, an issue, about the soul of the state.
We have an opportunity to that generations have asked for to resolve the
issue of race discrimination in the criminal justice system.
Fundamentally, that decision is up to each of you.  And for me, I will
be voting to give the courts a chance to answer. Thank you.

<p id="085:00">
Speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady has the floor. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman of The House. I too
have been involved with the racial justice act since it inception. I was
in two of the initial committees that heard the initial racial justice
bill. And as an attorney I saw it fraught with all kinds of problems and
concerns. I will tell you about the first, and it was a pre-trial
motion, the first racial justice act case motion that was heard in my
district. A man, a young man, fleeing from a murder in South Carolina
came through my county. Stopped at an over, rest, rest area. Climbed the
fence and went into a house and killed two people. Just to get their car
and a little bit of money. They didn't know him. It didn't matter. He
didn't care who his victims were. Should racial justice apply to him? Oh
yea, I forgot to tell ya, he's white. And so were the victims. But he
got to claim under the racial justice act. He got to not have it
considered on the facts of the case. And that's the biggest thing about
the racial justice act. It doesn't matter what the underlying facts are,
it doesn't matter how many offenses this person has done in their own
life. Everything we've ever learned about criminal justice is we judge
the person based upon their prior record, their prior acts in terms of
sentencing. We look at the actual crime they did. Was it heinous? Was it
in the commission of another felony? There are very specific facts to
get the death penalty. And there is not a person on death row that the
jury has not found that they had prior criminal histories, multiple
prior criminal histories, that the crime they committed was especially
heinous. To me, race doesn't and shouldn't matter. The facts of the case
should matter. Now I sat in on some interim study committees with racial
justice and, and listened to some of the facts and statistics. And what
I heard was we're looking at jury selection only from the perspective of
the prosecutor. We're not looking at final jury composition. And I've
been told that's racially consistent when you get to the end. It's
racially consistent with makeup of the general population. So we're only
looking at it from the prosecutor's perspective. Now as we talk about
the trial in Cumberland County that went on. Guess what. The trial judge
who tried him initially wanted to take the stand and testify about any
or, any type of racial prejudice he saw and he was not allowed to even
though the original bill allowed that. Now rep Glazier said he'd like to
see this go on up to the Supreme Court. But if it goes up to the Supreme
Court its going up under the old law. Which said if there were a racial,
racial justice problem, factually or statistically, 15, 20 years ago in
one area of the state, it could be used to apply to the entire state, it
could be used to apply to the entire state. I too had some discussions
with my daughter about racial justice. She was taking an
African-American studies class at University of Tennessee. She wanted to
ask me a lot more questions about racial justice. and every time I tried
to explain to her that we're gonna try a criminal case based on
statistics she kept going that doesn't make sense. Why are you using
statistics? Why don't the facts of the case matter? We, we were told
about cases in these committees where one person tied up another one,
and then taped his face completely with the thick packing tape and left
him to die. Now for us did that matter what his race was? Did it matter
what the person who committed the crime was? A cruel and heinous left to
die and suffocate for the want of a hundred dollars. Look at the facts
underlying a case. The true intent of the initial racial justice act as
was to end the death penalty. Was to end the death penalty. To put a
moratorium on it. Ladies and gentleman we don't need the racial justice
act as Representative Glazier indicated. We've had ?? challenges where
you can challenge about racial motivations in jurors. There are other
things that if you can show the kind of prejudices like he was showing,
we, we had one in our area in which the diner, in a, in a dining area,
was overheard to be using racial slurs. And that stopped the entire jury
and went for a mistrial. We have the abilities in place. If there's
specific areas of the.</p>

?? where we are having this kind of problem.  We need to focus on
tackling the problem.  Not letting murderers get off.  We either have
the actual vote and speech on doing away with the death penalty, or we
don't. But this is not the way to go about it.  I just jotted down some
notes cause I wasn't expecting to stand up, but to me, we need to look
at all death penalty cases under the specific facts.  If you really
wanted to sort of do away with any kind of prejudices at all you have a
jury picked at random.  You find the facts without them even seeing the
witnesses.  And then you put it in a computer, and let the computer
decide.  That makes more sense than what we're doing.  But, we do not
need this race on justice act.  It has created nothing but a delay in
the system.  A tremendous amount of cost that were understated grossly
by our physical research department.  It has been used and abused to
delay trials, and to try to effectively end the death penalty.  So I
would ask you to support this review.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Harrison, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The lady has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the
house.  I'm not as eloquent as my seatmate across the aisle here, but I
do want to point out the need for the racial justice act, and why this
bill is so wrong headed.  We know that our country has had a long
history of racial  discrimination in our court system, especially in
jury selection.  It dates back 2 centuries.  We've had multiple efforts
to address it, in 19th century congressional acts, and U.S. supreme
court decisions, and the 20th century, and even more recently.  The
supreme court confirmed to ?? that racism in our country is a problem,
and that states need to figure out a way to address it at the state
level.   Which is what we had done with &quot;RJA&quot;.  In the recent
rulings on &quot;RJA&quot;, judge Weeks found the intentional racial
discrimination throughout our court system.  Studies as Representative
?? has pointed out, studies have shown that in North Carolina qualified
black jurors have been struck 2 and a half to 3 times as often as
qualified white jurors.  And that 40 percent of defendants on death row
have been sentenced to death by a jury that was either all white, or had
only one person of color on the jury.  This is clearly a problem, and
this is one of the many that &quot;RJA&quot; was meant to address.  U.S.
Supreme Court ruled in Batson versus Kentucky, that qualified jurors
cannot be struck based on race alone.  And it's been stated by others,
?? Representative Stam, and Stevens, that Batson provides sufficient
protections, to ensure that race doesn't play a role in our criminal
justice system.  But all a prosecutor needs to do to comply with the
ruling, is to offer a race neutral reason for striking the juror.  And
it's because of the &quot;RJA&quot; litigation, we found out through the
discovery, that instead of complying with Batson, the conference of DA's
has provided DA's with cheat sheets on how to get around Batson.  It was
in the evidence, these cheat sheets.  They reference items such as
inappropriate dress, physical appearance, age, attitude.  These are ways
the DA's got around the Batson restriction.  The conference of DA's held
what they called top gun trainings, in which one page of cheat sheets
listing these race neutral reasons a prosecutor could use in a Batson
objection in striking a black juror.  So rather than being trained how
to comply with the law, this demonstrates a calculated, and largely
successful effort to circumvent Batson.  And the Racial Justice Act
cases heard thus far, the courts have found that DA's across the state
have relied on this training handout to avoid Batson's mandate,
resulting in racial discrimination in juror selection.  It's clearly a
problem.  Additional evidence as Representative Glazier pointed out, in
the Cumberland county cases are the notes, these prosecutors notes that
were written in the juror's strikes.  And that's very troubling, you've
got a Assistant DA whose writing comments like black wino on drugs, and
a respectful black family but when inquired by the judge the prosecutor
did not have a similar comment on a white family.  In contrast to the
black wino, you've got a white country boy that drinks, but he's okay.
We never would have known about this if it were not for the
&quot;RJA&quot; litigation.  There is no other mechanism in the law for
finding this out, because many of the defendants have exhausted their
appeals, and there is no other way to introduce this evidence.  This is
another important reason why we should not be repealing this statute.</p>

Just this week Judge Weekes/g said in his ruling, most recent ruling,
quote, I had hoped that acknowledgment of the ugly truth of racial
discrimination revealed that defendants evidence in RJA cases around the
state would be a first step in creating a system of justice that is free
from the pernicious influence of race, a system that truly lives up to
our equal I feel unequal justice under the law. This will not happen if

without parole which is what the Racial Justice Act calls for? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I, I’m not an expert in this area of criminal law. But it’s my
understanding that you want a jury that represents the diversity of the
community and also a jury of one’s peer. And when that jury does not
reflect that diversity you don’t get fair rulings from the jury. And
that’s that’s my understanding of it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker,
second question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady yield? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] She yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Here’s
my question. You have this bad jury why should the defendant who had
this bad jury and we know, we know he’s a murderer because they, none of
them have raised the claim of innocence. Why should he get life in
prison without parole if this prejudiced jury tried his case? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] If I could I, I believe that the point is is that you wanna
process that’s transparent and fair. And if you have jury that’s issuing
these decisions it’s not a fairly composed jury that there is some lack
of confidence in the system in the ruling from the jury. I guess that’s
my answer. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members at this time we have six
members of the minority party that are, are still in the queue to speak.
And there’s 36 minutes left for the minority side. So that’s six minutes
apiece. Nobody’s going to be cut off from debate. But at the six minute
mark, just if we want to split the time up among the six that are left,
I’ll hit the bell. You can continue to speak and eat up others times.
But just to make sure that every member has an opportunity to speak, we
wanna make sure that is, that they are aware as they are speaking. So at
this time, Representative Daughtry please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the
floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Hearing Representative
Glazier’s remarks is very troubling to me to hear about our court
system. And the way he described as DAs that were, I would say even
crooked, judges that were biased. I’ve been going around the courts in
this state for over 40 years. And I don’t know that I’m in the same
country that he’s in. I don’t see what he sees. I see a place where
people are doing the best they can do in an institution to provide
justice for all. I’ve also been around here a  long time. And this
debate is not about racial discrimination. It never has been. It’s about
the death penalty. That’s what we’re debating. Five or six years ago we
were here and we didn’t have lethal injection because we couldn’t get a
doctor to give the injection for fear of losing their license. So we did
not have the death penalty carried out since 2006. And this is a
continuation of us not having the death penalty. I don’t know about you
but my district, my constituents favor the death penalty. They believe
that when crimes are committed that are so egregious and so horrible
that the only appropriate punishment is the death penalty. You may think
otherwise in your district. You may think that the best approach would
life in prison. But I, I submit to you the thing for you to do is run a
bill to decide whether or not we should end the death penalty, or
whether we should continue the death penalty. Because right now we’re
doing this side attack, this end run. We haven’t had a death penalty in
2006. We’ve had people on death row since 1985. We ought to have justice
that’s swift and sure. But the way we’re trying to do this is to put
people in prison for their life as Representative Stam said and not</p>

not give them a lethal injection. I don't understand the kind of court
that I've been hearing described over here. It's not the way we hae a
court system. And we have some of the finest lawyers. We have
specialists who defend those people who have been convicted and received
the death penalty. It's a cottage where people go and they defend the
death penalty in Supreme Court. We the Commission of Actual Innocence in
our state. We have motions of appropriate relief. I think our court
system is the finest in the world, and I think the attacks on our court
system is wrong. And I don't anybody should prouder of what we've done
to protect our citizens and at the same time protect the defendants than
we've done. I hope you'll support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Michaux, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentleman of the House, you
know I don't try to get up and become an edifier of anything. I try to
be plain and true. Rep. Daughtry, it's unfortunate that you haven't
walked in my shoes or the shoes of any other black person in the state
when you were convicted because you were black. I've had to defend that.
I've walked in the courtroom, and the judge looked at me, said I had law
book in my hand, and said &quot;Boy, what'chu doing with that book? It
ain't gonna do you no good. I'm the law here.&quot; Now that's fact.
That has happened, so when you walk in my shoes, then you will
understand what's happening here. Now there other thing is that this
bill -- the Racial Justice Act is not about the death penalty. It  is
about an individual getting a trial free from any prejudice at all, and
when you knock out jurors because you think they have a prejudice in
favor of the defendant or that they would be more in favor of the
prosecution side, that discrimination in picking a jury. Judge Weeks, I
think, did a great job. He didn't use the statistics that everybody says
that this thing used from out of state. He used what he call this:
&quot;defendants presented a wealth of case, anecdotal and historical
evidence of racial bias in jury selection.&quot; And he was talking
about Cumberland county, but it affected every other county in the state
because there was other anecdotal evidence from other counties also. The
case is now before the Supreme Court. It's been appealed, and they're in
the process of making a decision on that, and we ought to let them go
ahead and make the decision on that. But, as I said before, this is not
about the death penalty. It's not about the heinous act or anything like
that. These persons have been convicted and were given the death
penalty. That's not a get-out-jail pass. It's simply stating that simply
because you have a jury that was not of your peers, that there was
racial prejudice involved in the picking of that jury, that you were
guilty of the crime, but  instead of putting you to death, you're gonna
be put in prison for the rest of your life. And to some that may be more
-- Some folks wish for death more than having to spend life in prison.
The other thing is that some folks have said that this adds time to the
people who are on death row. That does not have to be true. There are
things that a district attorney can in order to shorten that time. A
motion to dismiss, a motion for appropriate relief. I asked one district
attorney this when it was in committee, and he said, &quot;Yes, I have
filed a motion, but it's not going to be till 2015  before we hear it.
Well, there are several things there: Number One is that he can ask for
an expedited hearing, and I have not appeared in a court yet when and
expedited hearing was asked for and wasn't given. So that means you
don't have to have the extra time in there that's involved. The second
thing is that has been said is: Well, if you got a white-on-white case
that you can't show racial prejudice in the picking of a jury. Well, as
Rep. [CUTS OFF]</p>

?? is, I have a little bit of faith, fortunately, in the justice system,
and I believe that those claims that are frivolous will be thrown out in
a matter of a few days if the district attorney asks for it to be done.
There's just so many ways to do this, but the bottom line, my friends,
is there should be no prejudice of any kind in the picking of a jury
that's going to impact your life or anybody else's life. There are scare
tactics used in here. They bring in pictures of these heinous crimes and
whatnot. These people have been convicted. They've already been
convicted. They don't get out of jail because of this. But there should
have been no racial prejudice shown in the picking of that jury. And
that's what has been shown in this instance. I'm simply asking that let
the courts make the decision. Representative Daughtry, if you have that
much faith in the courts, that matter is now being decided by our
Supreme Court. So let's see what our Supreme Court has to say about this
matter before we rush into something that we're going to regret later
on. I would suggest that you vote against this bill, or, Representative
Stam, take section 5 out of the bill, and let's--you raise your hand,
you're right--5, take it out. Thank you.

To ask the gentleman if he would yield to an inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Since you've done, Representative Michaux. One of the cases that Judge
Weeks removed from the death row was a 2000 case, State vs. Walters,
Native American defendant, two white victims. It was a gang initiation.
That had a six black and six white jury. Can you explain the racism that
would be present in that kind of case?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I can't explain it because I didn't hear the case and I don't have the
facts before me at this time. If you give me a few moments--I've got
Judge Weeks's decision here, and if you give me a few minutes and ask me
later, maybe I'll have a chance to go through it and see why he did
that. If you don't mind.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's correct, sir. Representative Adams, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, there are
many things as individuals that we don't like to talk about because
those things tend to make us uncomfortable. Racism is one of those
things. Race shouldn't matter, but it does matter. And in some cases, it
matters whether you live or whether you die. Racism is everywhere. And
it's even in the justice system. And North Carolina took a big step to
eradicate racism and to ensure fairness and integrity in our justice
system when we passed the Racial Justice Act. Representative Larry
Womble did a lot of work on this bill and I'm sure he's frowning about
what we're doing right now. Integrity and fairness are not foolish
words. Fairness is a good &quot;f&quot; word. The Racial Justice Act
allows people facing the death penalty--black, white, male, or
female--to present evidence of racial bias, including statistics, in
court. And as Representative Michaux has said, it doesn't get them out
of jail, just off of death row. And none of us really should want to
execute any person whose death sentence was based on race
discrimination, whether discrimination was utilized or applied by
prosecutors or jurors. The first priority of our criminal justice
system--and I'm not a lawyer--but it should be to ensure justice and
fairness and to not uphold verdicts that have any hint of racial
discrimination. No one, supporters of capital punishment or opponents of
capital punishment, want racial discrimination to be a factor in the
courtroom. And it should not be. In this General Assembly, we talk a lot
about working across the aisle. Now the concepts embedded in the Racial
Justice Act, as it was proposed, was supported by a cross-section of
people around this state, including Democrats and Republicans, by
supporters and opponents of the death penalty. And as a matter of fact,
eight Republicans in the Senate voted for the Racial Justice Act. As an
African-American, I certainly can understand the comments that
Representative Michaux has made, because if you haven't walked in these
shoes,</p>

<p id="110:00">
You don’t know how they feel. But I can tell you that more people who
look like me fall victim to a justice system that is not always just for
us. Because of the impact of that existing racism, we need it, the
Racial Justice Act, in the first place, to ensure that fairness and
integrity in our justice system to help prevent more innocent
African-American defendants from being wrongly sentenced to death. There
are many cases to support the fact right here in North Carolina, that
race have been a factor and we heard several of those today. We’ve had
several cases that were mentioned by Representative Glazier. The point
I’m trying to make is simply this: that the justice system is comprised
of human beings and human beings are not perfect. None of us our.
Unfortunately, some people are still guided by conscious or unconscious
racial bias. We might not like to talk about it, but racism is alive,
it’s well, and it’s read. It’s real and it is a real problem. As policy
makers we have a responsibility to ensure that, as much as possible,
that fairness prevails in everything that we do. The least that we can
do is to put in place a mechanism that provides for all people,
regardless of race or religion, regardless of socioeconomic status. The
right to a system that treats them fairly and justly. The Racial Justice
Act provides that sense of assuredness and we should leave this law
intact to continue to do what it was intended to do. To ensure fairness,
equity and justice. Let’s not undo the good that we did by instituting
the Racial Justice Act that was needed than and it’s still needed now.
Vote against this bill. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, just wish to comment on a
few points that have been made in debate and add a few points that have
not yet been raised. The first is that there’s been a lot of reference
from Representative Stam about the deterrent effect of the death penalty
and I’d just like to note that as has been noted, we’ve not had any
executions since 2006 and since 2006, the murder rate in this state has
dropped. That whole linkage that some talk about is simply not there.
The murder rate has dropped since 2006 and no executions since 2006,
first point.
Second point, this is not Representative Stam, the so-called, Racial
Justice Act, it is the Racial Justice Act. I was one of the primary
sponsors of this bill and I want to thank, publicly, former
Representative Larry Womble of Forsyth County offered his great
leadership in working on this bill and ultimately having this bill come
into law. Actually what we have here today are two bills and I think
when Representative Daughtry said, you want a death penalty restoration,
or you said, Representative Daughtry, of course, abolition bill, you
said put one in. I feel the same way. You want a death penalty
restoration bill, put that in. But what we have here is two separate
bills merged into one. We have the death penalty restoration clear and
we have the repeal of the Racial Justice Act, and that’s most
unfortunate because there are some members in here who would vote to
restore the death penalty, but will not vote to eliminate to repeal the
Racial Justice Act.
People should just be very clear about that and it’s most unfortunate
that there are not separate bills. Senator Goolsby chose to put them
together and unfortunately the committee system brought it that way as
well. It’s important, again, to remember that in the Racial Justice Act,
that people are not let out. The infamous and reprehensible campaign ad
from 2010 that was used, that said that those who voted for the Racial
Justice Act had voted to let convicted murderers out of jail and back on
the street. Some of you know it was actually used against one of our
Representative not here who had voted against the bill, yet it was used
against him in his attempt to be re-elected and did lose that campaign.
The fact is is life without without parole it’s no picnic to be in jail
without parole for the rest of your life.</p>

<p id="115:00">
Mr. Speaker, I will yield at the end of my remarks.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman does not yield.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  The fascinating thing
about the bill is section 5A.  Representative Stam referenced section
5A.  5A just repeals the use of statistics.  Now, some of you know that
I teach sociology and it is just kind of amazing, if I went into class
and said, “Now class, we are not going to use any data in our class.  We
just don’t want to use data.”  But that is basically what this bill says
is let’s not use data.  Let’s not look at jury compositions.  That is
really what the Racial Justice Act is about is looking at jury
compositions and its impact on court cases.  And there has been a lot of
consternation on the part of some people that white defendants, whites
on death row, were making use of the Racial Justice Act.  But look, the
Racial Justice Act allows people to do that because it is asking about
jury composition and whether jury composition has something to do with
the conviction of someone and the giving of a capital sentence, the
death penalty.  Whether the defendant is black, white, or green, it is
looking at the fact of whether the jury having constituted relative, or
well basically, one or zero African Americans on the jury, whether that
has some impact on the death penalty.  Now, I know some of you say, “Oh
God, don’t go into sociology, Luebke.”  But the fact is that African
Americans are far more skeptical of the criminal justice system than our
white Americans.  Representative Michaux addressed that directly, with
good reason.  You don’t know what DWB is?  Ask an African American,
especially an African American male.  Driving While Black.  And that
just summarizes a lot of the problems that African Americans have with
the criminal justice system.  It is why African Americans might be more
likely not to give a white defendant the death penalty.  It is as simple
as that.  So there is nothing complex about why white defendants on
death row would have used the Racial Justice Act.  In sum, the Racial
Justice Act is a good act.  It is unfortunate it has gotten merged with
the other bill about death penalty restoration.  They should have been
split and we should sustain the Racial Justice Act.  Thank you.  I hope
and I urge you to vote no on this bill.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. Speaker.
 [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Would Representative Luebke yield for two questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Luebke, do you yield for two? [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  Of course, go ahead.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  The first one, would
you explain to the house why these 152 convicted murderers who
apparently had tainted juries, why they should spend their life in
prison without parole instead of getting a new trial?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
 Under this bill, it simply asks the question of whether there is a
problem with jury selection.  And it is saying, in order not to have, I
don’t want to be personal, but folks like you say, “Oh, these folks got
off,” it is saying you are not going to get off, you are going to have
life without parole, precisely to try to undercut the criticism that
this bill is about letting murderers back out on the street.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  Second question, Mr. Speaker.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Does the
gentleman yield?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  I yield.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  And
here I address you as a sociologist, probably the only one here.
Representative Jordan asked Representative Michaux about one of the
cases that Judge Weeks said was infected with racism, State vs Walters,
a gang initiation case.  It had six black citizens of Cumberland County
on the jury.  Do you believe that six black jurors from Cumberland
County could be so infected by racism that they would send somebody,
sentence them to death?  [SPEAKER CHANGSE]  Representative Stam, Judge
Weeks worked on that case.  I didn’t talk to him.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Pierce, please state your purpose.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I want to be able to speak.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  The
gentleman has the floor.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I
just want to add a few comments.  There is a question that is asked, and
I think many of us have talked around it today, of why does jury
diversity matter?  Beyond the constitutional issues with some type of
strike, individuals from the pool based on their race, systematically
includes inclusion of African American jury undermines the public
confidence of both individuals who are in the court systems, studies
have shown that community perception of justice is based upon its faith
in the process by which the outcome achieved by the process and make
sure that it is fair and transparent.  And lack of jury diversity</p>

His life incarcerated, convicted by two juries, here in the great state
that I love that is North Carolina. I cannot support anything that
allows to continue to happen. The whole world is watching. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Tim Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Members of the House. Number of hours growing long. I'll make this
brief. Last year speaker asked me to chair an interim committee that
looked at the issue of capital punishment and we did that, a number of
you on that committee.
Part of that even included a visit to death row. And we went over there,
saw everything from where they live to where they executions take place.
Talked with a number of folks. And we had several hearings. Had folks
come in who testified we had a those who had been wrongfully convicted.
And we had a number of of family members. Folks who came in and
testified. There were family members of all races that were death row
defendants of all races. So it's, one thing I picked up from it is, it
wasn't a racial issue. There's been much made about fact there has been
some bad convictions and that's true. I think we acknowledge that's
happened. But in those cases, those folks were vindicated through
motions for appropriate relief through DNA evidence. Through other
things.
The flaw of this bill is that it doesn't go to a problem with a
particular case. It tries to put a cartblanche solution to something
that is not there. Under this law, under this bill as it presently is,
unless we amend it, a person could walk in to a Walmart and shoot ten
people in point blank range, caught on video, and no dispute that they
did it. And still try to use the racial justice act a basis to avoid the
death penalty. Here's another irony with the racial justice act, the way
it presently is, it would allow a man who is an ?? white supremest
member of the Arian Nation, who murdered an African-American victim to
argue that he was a victim of racism. That's the flaw with the bill,
with the law, as it's presently written.
Members, this bill corrects that. This bill is to push through justice
to make sure that a person is judged for the crimes they committed not
for what somebody else did. Members I would urge the body to support
this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Farmer Butterfield, please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and and gentleman. Passages of this bill and it's goals to
restart executions do not make North Carolina a safe place to live.
The death penalty has a tremendous amounts of money. A lot of resources
and yet less then 1% of individuals tried for first degree murder
receive death sentences. What if you were not able to serve on a jury
because you went to a particular university with not a high school
graduate ?? or law enforcement connections or military connections. Or
you just liked eye contact. Instead of focusing our efforts on rushing
to restart executions we ought to be considering how we can better serve
victims and actually take steps to make communities safer.
Killing somebody by mistake once in a while is not okay. North Carolina
is better than this. I ask that you oppose Senate bill 306. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Jerry Hall, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Inquiry to chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his
inquiry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The amount of time left for. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] 13 minutes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Gentleman is recognized to speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. And I'll certainly save time for others. I wanted
to make sure we didn't get too far off the subject. And part of the
question we face now, and yes, racism is uncomfortable and all of us in
here, black, white, indian or otherwise, have experienced moments when
we caught ourselves and said, &quot;that was probably a racist thought.
That was probably a stereotypical thought that I had.&quot;</p>

And of course being a Marine I have thoughts of people being inferior to
me all the time. Maybe so. But our responsibility is probably the
greatest. We talk about passing bills that will create judgeships and
bills that eliminate judgeships and bills that increase the penalties
and bills that take away the funding necessary to pay the judges to
enforce the greater penalties. And all of that responsibility falls on
us. So we can't take part of it and walk away from the rest of it. When
we talk about these cases and the question of these constitutional
rights involved, this jury of your peers and the selection process, it's
important to note that not only are the rights of the accused at issue,
but the rights of those who are in jury service are at issue as well.
That they deserve to be treated fairly and not discriminated against.
And that is a portion of this act that we have to understand. Samuel
Poole, many of you might not know him or Christopher Spicer, maybe Tim
Ennis, some of you might know that name and Alfred Rivera, sound
familiar? Allan Gale, Jonathan Hoffman. Glenn Chapman, maybe Levon Bo
Jones. How about Ronald Cotton? You know Darryl Hunt you heard his name.
Dwyane Dail? Maybe you don't know these gentlemen. But they are North
Carolinians. Maybe you think they should have the same rights as the
rest of us. Should be treated fairly. They're death row and non death
row exonerees though. They went through the system. They were treated
unfairly and as a result we had people on death row that should not have
been there. Now what does that do to our system and the confidence of
our public in that system? That responsibility we still have. If we have
not improved that since we've been here then we failed our duty. We make
judges. We make the law. We give them the budget and we tell them to
enforce it. I love DAs. They have a role to serve. If they want to be
legislators they need to put their name on the ballot and run if they
wanna make the laws. They have a duty to enforce the law through
prosecution. And sure, they have a lot of discretion. But to have the
shameful act of consciously having training to subvert the law in order
to be able to meet out the death penalty after we know time after time
how dangerous that is thinking about the number of innocent people who
we have taken off of death row in North Carolina so every caution we can
take to ensure fairness is essential. And the names of those gentlemen I
read who lost parts of their lives that we could never repay no matter
what price I don't know what the price is to you to hold your grand baby
in your arms. I don't know what price it is to you to hold your loved
one before you get on that trip to come to Raleigh and when you get
back. I don't know what the price was to you to see your child graduate
or see your parent on their 80th birthday. I don't know what that value
is to you and I don't know what it was to those men. But everything we
can do to make this system work properly and fairly and abide by the
highest standards we have an obligation to do. Let the rest follow.
We're paid to lead. We come down here. We take that oath and this is one
of the times we should take it the most seriously. That we should hold
that standard high and say we do not want there to be any question when
the ultimate penalty is given  as to whether there was any bias, whether
it is as to race, of a juror, or race of a defendant. We don't want
there to be a question. We want to sleep at night with a clear
conscience, get up in the morning and look in the mirror and know we did
what we should do in our position with the responsibility we have as
legislators. There's no one else we can look to.</p>

no one has this ultimate power, this is the ultimate power, any power
that the judges have we give it to them. we as the representative of the
people and they entrust us to ensure those power are used not only
judiciously but fairly and there can not be room in our system fro there
be a question in the inner mine as to the whether discrimination played
a role in selection of the jury, in the selection of the punishment to
be requested, in the decision made by the jury we have been down this
road, this is the top issue, i faced discrimination and i know how
battle discrimination, every one of you in your heart and in your mind
