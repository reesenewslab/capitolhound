and we'll move on over to the budget overview.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm Evan Roadwall from the fiscal research division of the general
assembly. To set the stage for work on the budget over the coming
months, my teammate and I, Christian Walker, are providing you with a
broad overview of the budget. I'm going to be talking about the budget
in broad terms, I'm also going to talk about growth trends and budget
drivers, and I'm also going to talk about some of the factors that
affect the condition of the budget, particularly the general fund.
Kristen will then cover recent budget shortfalls and budget pressures
that'll be facing you in the current session.
This first chart shows 2 ways of looking at the budget. The first is the
general fund, general fund appropriations, the general fund budget
covers some of the most basic functions of state. Government, in general
fund appropriations or the portion of the general fund that are funded
through revenues rather than agency receipts. The general fund
appropriations generally get the most focus and the most attention, and
it will be the focus of our presentation today. This first pie chart
shows that between public schools and higher education, education is
over half of the general fund budget, about 55%. The next largest
segment is medicaid, about 15%, justice and public safety, which is what
JPS abbreviates, comprises the court system, correction, the department
of public safety. NER and general government  are lumped into one
segment for purposes of this chart. NER stands for Natural and Economic
Resources. It covers commerce, the department of environment and natural
resources, agriculture, labor, and general government agencies are those
most closely associated with the administration of state government. So
the department of administration, for example, is in general government.
As is the general assembly, the governor, the department of the
treasurer, and insurance. The pie chart labeled all sources, includes
all over governmental funds. So the highway fund, the highway trust
fund, enterprise funds like the lottery and internal service funds like
motor fleet management, and also includes federal receipts, and if you
look at medicaid, when we look at the all funds budget, medicaid is the
single largest portion. That's a result of the large amount of federal
receipts the program draws down. NER and general government are much
more significant portions of the overall budget then they are the
general fund budget, that's due in part to the Employment Security
Commission, which is part of the NER function, and in  general
government you have the ?? fund, and internal service funds like
information technology services and motor fleet management.
Transportation budget doesn't register in the general fund pie, but it
is a significant portion of the all sources funds. You've got the
highway fund, the highway trust fund, which are both state funds, and
there area also significant federal receipts that are made available for
transportation. The education portion of the all funds chart includes
institution, does not include institutional funds such as endowment
funds, and it doesn't include Federal research dollars, but it does
include tuition. The central point here is that although the general
fund gets the most attention and discussion, the state budget is larger
and more complicated than just the general fund.
I'm going to talk a little bit about budget drivers now, and this first
chart shows per cap- the general fund budget per capita. And the shaded
areas are periods of recession, and you could see from looking at the
chart that those recession periods correlate with slight downward trends
in a generally upwards sloping graph.  But when we adjust for inflation,
the</p>

<p id="05:00">
per capita is much more modest.  This next chart shows 3 snapshots of
the operating budget at different points in time.  And these are numbers
that have been adjusted for purposes of programmatic comparison.  So
fiscal year 2000/2001 was the bottom of the previous recession.
2008/2009 was the last budget that was passed before the Great
Recession, and fiscal year 2012/2013 is of course, the current budget
year.  The c hart shows how education dominates the general fund.  It's
more than half, and throughout this entire period.  If you look closely
at Medicaid, you'll notice that that represents pretty significant
increase between 2001 to 2009, it more than doubles,  But then between
2009 and the current fiscal year, it's been reduced somewhat.  And it's
important to note that Medicaid budget shortfalls over than last 3 years
suggests that the Medicaid budget has not been quite large enough to
fund actual expenditures.  This next chart, these are the numbers the
previous chart is based on.  And I just show it here because there are a
couple of details that sort of get lost in the previous graph.  I'd like
you to take a look at the NER line, at about the middle of the page, and
you'll see some pretty significant growth between 2001 - 2009, it not
quite double, but it grows significantly.  that's largely, although not
entirely the result of the establishment of and the increased funding
for the Clean Water Management trust fund.  And similarly some pretty
significant reductions in the period since then, and that is again,
partly a result of cuts to that particular program.  And before I leave
this chart, please take a look at the debt service line.  That shows the
most dramatic increase in this period of time, There were some large
bond issues at the beginning of that decade, general obligation bonds,
and also some later certificates of participation bonds that
dramatically increase debt service.. And it's increased at a much lower
rate since then, but it's interesting to note in that last column, debt
services is the only segment of the budget, over this period of
time,that's seen any increase at all.
Alright, I'm going to focus now on some of the drivers imbedded in the
budget, and behind some of the growth.  This chart represents cumulative
change in percentage terms, so as an example of what the data is, let's
direct your attention to the yellow line, which is just overall North
Carolina population. So over this period of time between 2001 - 2013,
the North Carolina population grew about 21%. And the numbers aren't
shown here, it went from 8.2 million to about 9.9 million.  And this
chart plots that percentage increase over time.  Population influences
demand for many if not most government services, DMV, highway, vehicle
miles travels, environmental permits, Secretary of State filings.  But
this chart plots the largest enrollment driven programs within the
state, with the exception of Medicaid which I'll talk about later.  So,
the lowest line there is K-12 Full Time Equivalent Enrollment, I
apologize for the abbreviation, FTE, stands for Full Time Equivalent.
And for the majority of the period we plotted here, K-12 public school
enrollment track with population.  It's since decreased some, or not
increased</p>

<p id="10:00">
As fast a rate, that's at least partly the result of recent changes in
the kindergarten age requirements which have reduced enrollment
somewhat. The dark blue line that sort of bends and goes up and then
bends downward is the North Carolina prison population. And for many
years the prison population was growing at a rate much higher than the
that of the general population. Surprisingly it's moderated a great deal
and in fact in the last year it's  decreased and this is not just a
state trend but a national trend. UNC head count has grown pretty
significantly over the period but has leveled off somewhat and then
community college enrollment is measured in full time equivalent units
really took off during this period. Community college enrollment is
counter cyclical so one of the ways that people responded to the lack of
employment opportunities was enrolling in community college. This next
chart, the enrollment trends on the previous chart basically put
pressure on the budget. In the form of new positions and increased
salaries and benefits and that's what this chart illustrates. So this
chart shows the cumulative percentage increase over this period of time,
01 to 11-12 and you can see salaries and benefit spending is growing at
a faster rate in the public schools then the state agencies. After the
public schools you've got UNC and then the community colleges so you
will remember that education makes up over half the budget and this just
shows that some of the growth and trend factors are driving those
numbers upward. This next chart shows that higher education where North
Carolina has seen so much enrollment growth is also where the state
offers fairly generous funding relative to other states. So the state
constitution says that higher education as far as practicable shall be
extended to the people of the state free of expense and that sort of
underlines the North Carolina tradition. In the area of K-12 North
Carolina ranks 22nd in spending among...in per student spending among
the rest of the states and the District of Columbia but when you add
federal and local spending to that number our rank drops to 45 of the
51. By contrast in higher education, North Carolina spends the most per
university student of the states in the southern region. It spends the
most per student in community college students in that same region. And
then per higher education student which includes both community colleges
and the universities we spend the third highest of the fifty states. And
then the tuition information is basically the inverse of that. Our
tuitions in higher education are relatively low compared to other
states. I need to mention medicaid enrollment growth and health care
spending before I move on to...before I leave the discussion of budget
drivers. So this chart is similar to an earlier chart but it compares
cumulative percent growth in medicaid enrollment as compared to the
population. You'll see that it's growing significantly higher than
population just as higher education is. The most expensive medicaid
enrollees are the disabled who account for about 15 percent of
enrollment but 44 percent of medicaid costs. We don't have quite as many
years of enrollment data for the disabled but you can see that they are
growing at a rate approaching that of overall medicaid enrollees and
well above the North Carolina population. I'm going to shift from
enrollment for a second to price inflation. The best measure of health
care inflation is from the health care cost institute. We don't have a
lot of years of data so I'm showing you one year of data between 2010
and 2011 in unit prices for in patient health care increased 5.9 percent</p>

<p id="15:00">
Outpatient visits increased 9.6%, and that's as compared to 2.1% in the
economy at large, as measured by the CPI. So there's some evidence that
health care inflation is higher than that in the economy at large. I
mentioned, in an earlier chart I showed the Medicaid budget increasing
rapidly between '01 and '09 and then decreasing. But Medicaid is not the
only way that health care impacts the state budget. You also have the
state health plan and you have inmate medical expenses, for example.
This shows, for context, annual growth for some other sources of health
care cost data. The first series of number are for the state health
plan, and the last two are national data. For the state health plan,
where contribution rates per employee have more than doubled over a 12
year period, at a time when benefits were actually being reduced. The
second series of numbers are from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on
employer health costs per employee hour worked. You can see that they
have not quite doubled over a 10 year period. And you have similar but
slightly lower numbers from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid
Services. That's national data. The key points I want to leave you with
on budget drivers are that General Fund per capita spending has been
increasing significantly over the years. But after adjusting for
inflation, that growth is much more modest. Education is about 55% of
the general fund. And the drivers of education are strong enrollment
growth and a tradition of higher education support more generous that
most other states. The Medicaid budget is being driven by strong
enrollment growth, particularly among the disabled population. and
health care inflation and increases in utilization impact the state
budget through Medicaid, the state health plan, and inmate medical. I'm
going to talk a little bit about some of the factors that influence the
overall condition, the overall health of the General Fund. The first of
these is the Savings Reserve. Think of that as the rainy-day fund. It
was established to help manage natural disasters and economic downturns.
The green blocks of the bars represent the balances in the Fund, and the
red blocks in the bars represent the gap between the statutory goals and
the balances. You can see there that it's waxed and waned, more or less
correlating with the economic cycle. I should mention the dramatic
increase in the height of these bars is because the statutory goal was
changed in 2008 - 2009, from 5% of the previous years' operating fund to
8%. So the bar is literally higher. Right now, the balance is around, I
believe, $419 million, and the target is $1 billion, 576 million.
Although the budget is always balanced at the end of the Legislative
session, typically there are not enough recurring funds to meet
recurring requirements. And so surplus nonrecurring funds are used to
temporarily plug this gap. This chart illustrates that problem. On the
bottom of the page in red, you have the recurring shortfall, and on the
top half of the page you have the use of the surplus. Where it's blue,
it's being used to meet the shortfall, and where it's green, it's
actually excess funding that goes into the credit balance. For example,
the worst year for this was 2002-2011, when $3.2 billion in</p>

<p id="20:00">
recurring needs were met with temporary tax revenue and about one point
six billion in federal american reinvestment and recovery act funds, A R
R A funds that were made available by the feds to help states manage the
fiscal crisis. The problem's much smaller now and I think that that
amount is just- is in the neighbor of four hundred million dollars for
the budget for the current fiscal year. One difficult long term issue
facing the state is retiree medical benefits and this chart compares the
condition of the retirement system which is quite healthy by the
standards of other states to retiring medical which is not so healthy.
So for the retirement system the vast majority of the liabilities, we
have assets to cover. So only- so of the liabilities, only three point
seven billion are unfunded, that gives us a ratio of ninety four percent
of our liabilities being funded and that we're second in the country in
terms of the strength of our system and the reason for that is that, I
guess the tradition of the general assembly of appropriating the
actuarily required contribution each year, the amount recommended by the
actuaries. By contrast retiring medical benefits, our liabilities are
largely- we don't have the assets in large parts to cover those
liabilities and our state ranking therefore is significantly worse.
Forty second out of the fifty states. And, again, the tradition is we
have not typically appropriated the actuarily required contribution. And
then finally and briefly there is some evidence that we may not be
meeting the repair and renovations needs of the state for our buildings.
This is a estimate by the office of state construction for six years
worth of repairs and renovations that they estimated in two thousand and
eleven and funding for repairs and renovations since fiscal year two
thosand ten, eleven has been a hundred twenty nine million. So, the key
points I want to make on budget conditions is that the savings reserve
is well below the statutory target but up significantly from two
thousand nine, two thousand ten. Non recurring funds are being used to
meet recurring requirements and the retirement system is one of the
strongest state systems in the country but North Carolina retiree
medical benefits are large relative to those of other states and there
is some evidence that maintenance of state buildings is underfunded. And
with that, I'm going to turn it over-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm going to have to interrupt you there. What we're going to do in-
since we have about ten more minutes left, we're going to take some
questions for you and then we'll let Christen finish with her part
tomorrow and some further questions there. I have several people who
have seen raise their hand. We'll start with senator Apodaca.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. Evan, can we go back to page ten please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Line one. state spending. K through twelve. And that is twenty two,
we're ranked twenty two out of fifty one? Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Why is it always here we're like at the bottom? Forty eight, forty nine,
or fifty.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll turn this over to the education folks but I suspect it has
something to do with that second number that when you- the first number
is just state spending, the second number is state, federal, and local
spending. So it probably has to do with which number-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have somebody from education to answer the question. If you can go
ahead and identify yourself please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning, Brian Madison with fiscal research. Good morning mister
chair. Answer to your question is typically comparisons are made with
special emphasis on state and local resources. Most states tend to have
a kind of a half and half system where states comprise about forty five
percent of the public school budget, locals about forty five percent</p>

<p id="25:00">
feds about ten percent. Outside of this recent fiscal situation. North
Carolina is a litte different. Our system is much more state based and
typically you'll see sixty five percent state, twenty five percent
local, ten percent feds. That's where that comparison comes from.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Additional question, of ??, not education.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
ok. alright.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Did we not take steps starting last year to put a little additional
money in the retiree health plan shortage?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd have to defer question to the salaries and benefits team on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We've got somebody step up on a mic. Identify yourself please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. Good morning, David ?? from fiscal research. I don't know if there
were particular steps taken last year but we have steadily been putting
in about fifty to a hundred million dollars more in the retiree health
benefit fund each year more than we are paying out in premiums so that's
the case.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes mister chairman. Thank you. How does that work out in getting caught
up? What is the expected time frame if we continue to put those monies
in?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That would never be sufficient to fund the full liability compared to
the thirty billion dollar liability.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, just one quick technical question on slide twelve where we're
talking about health care spending cost increases. Are those national
numbers or those specific to North Carolina?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Those are national numbers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. I'd just like you to
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For ?? sake, can you identify yourself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Horn from Union county. You talked about adjusted for
inflation . What are you considering to be the inflation rates in the
last couple of years and projection.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Simply the C P I. That's all we're using, the standard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Which is
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm sorry, the consumer price index.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand what it is. I meant to say approximately right now what is
the percentage your looking at that you're using for this inflation
adjustment these days because seems to me the inflation is very low
compared to previous years so when you're showing spending adjusted by
inflation really all that adjustment came some years ago and now we're
not faced with those issues today to that extent
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is absolutely true. Typically, in recent memory, I think of
inflation in the two to three percent range for many years now and it's
true that the inflatoin was much worse. ten, eight, thirteen percent, at
times, in the seventies and eighties. That's absolutely right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The next one I have in the queue is senator Hunt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. Evan. Regarding debt service, calculations on
page seven. Would you clarify the point that even though we have fairly
moderate debt service increase because of low interest rates, the
principal balance is substantially higher than it was back then. In
other words, our debt service is low but the interest rates are very low
so we have a very large amount of principal on debt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe that's true. I'm not exactly sure what the number is on the
principal for debt service. Mark Bondo might be able to enlighten us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, while he's coming up, there's quite a queue that's lining up so
if I don't get to you today we will pick you up first thing tomorrow. So
we'll work our way as much as we can today. Mark.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. Mark Bondo, I'm with fiscal research. I believe the question was
how much principal has been issued in terms of debt over the last, over
that time period, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, so in two thousand there was a fairly large general obligation
bond authorization. three point one billion dollars for U N C and the
community colleges and after that, beginning in two thousand and on,
where what was known as certificates of participation and or special ??
and those I believe were about two point eight billion dollars over the
course of a number of years</p>

<p id="30:00">
so those issuances combined with the general obligation that issuances
in 2000 were one of the large increases in sort of principle in that
service cost.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Rep. Michaux.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ??, I guess one of the things we've always faced here was the
factor of using nonrecurring funds to pay for continuing ??. Are we
about to reach a plateau on that right now? Do you know of, or are we
still in that bind?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My guess is we're still in that bind. The fiscal research division in
the next, in the coming weeks and months is going to be putting together
a 5 year budget  projection that we typically do around this time of the
year.  And that will shed more light on it going forward. But my
instinct is that it's not going away.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Wilkins?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair.

I'm on your right. Over to your right.

How are you doing, Mr. Wilkins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Page 8.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You look good on the far right, winky.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And we look at a drop in prison population, we'd all like to say oh
yeah, there's a decrease  in crime rates, my question would be is that
true or is this somehow also tied to the recession and lower funds
availability in state budgets?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wish I had a good answer for you. There are a lot of theories  out
there about why crime rates are coming down, and why prison population
and enrollment is down. As I said it's a national trend and there are a
lot of theories. It doesn't sound like  there's any consensus. One of
the more bizarre theories I've heard is it has to  do with lead, the
absence of lead in the environment.  That's true. I mean I'm not saying
it's true, I'm saying there is that theory.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm going to take Rep. Queen, then Representatives Iler, Blackwell, Sen.
Robinson, Rep. Faircloth, you'll be first up in the queue tomorrow. But
I apologize for that. Rep. Queen?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. My question is just trying to drill down a little deeper to
understand what the accuarily appropriate contribution would be for our
retiree medical benefit so that that would be solvent and those benefits
would be available in the future?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I understand your question, 2.5 billion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So in this budget, we would need to put in 2.5 billion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe that is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So just from what Sen. Apodaca's question referred to, we've been
putting in 50 to 100 million over what we're spending but to get so- and
that the answer to his question, was that not improving the situation
and the answer was we would never get it solved just doing that? So in
what kind trend line would a solution be ?? We can't do it all at 2.5
million at one time, what kind of trend line would be reasonable to say
take care of it in 10 years?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Evan, you want to defer to David?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. David ?? of fiscal research division. So to clarify a few points,
the amount we are currently  putting in is the 0.9 billion, that
represents about 50 to 100 million more than the amount being paid out
in premiums, that was the 50 to 100 million dollar number.  The
accuarily required contribution is 2.5 billion dollars this year, so in
other word 1.6 billion more than we are currently appropriating. That
represents a 30 year amortization of the liability itself. So that would
pay down the unfunded liability over 30 years if we gradually ramp up to
the 2.5 billion dollar  number, that would take obviously longer than 30
years to pay down the unfunded liability.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, members, what we're going to do, apologies to those who we weren't
able to get to today, Rep. Dollar will be running the meeting tomorrow
and he's got your names first up int the queue. We have about 10 minutes
of presentations tomorrow, most of the time will be dedicated to your
questions. Please remember to bring your documents back with you,
