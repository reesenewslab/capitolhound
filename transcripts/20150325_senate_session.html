  <p id="10:00">
  the opportunity to, if we approve this bill today, to give the green
light to the sale of some assets from the cities down east to Duke Power
which will serve to reduce power bills for thousands of customers in
Eastern North Carolina and ensure low-cost power for many other
thousands of customers that buy their power from Duke Progress. This has
been something that has been worked on for many years, and for those of
you briefly in the chamber who have not heard this in committee, which I
think most have, I will try to offer it in abbreviated fashion. These 32
cities in the eastern power agency took on billions of dollars of debt
in order to become partners in energy generating plants, nuclear power
plants and coal fired plants, here in North Carolina. Shearon Harris,
two nuclear plants down Southport Brunswick, and two coal fired plants.
Since that time they&#39;ve been struggling with this debt. It has been
a back breaker to so many working families. It has been the difference
in whether or not small businesses even stay in business. It has been a
huge economic burden in our part of state. Quite literally, it has been
a boot on the neck of the economy of Eastern North Carolina, and with
this bill today we have the opportunity to change that. Many of my
colleagues have heard me talk about this issue for years. Senator Bryant
I know has, who can&#39;t unfortunately be here today, has I&#39;m sure
warned other people out about it as well but I kid you not, I&#39;m
holding a power bill here that fortunately was only 650-some-odd-dollars
this last month. If anybody cares to look later on I&#39;ll be glad to
show it to you. So I&#39;m just thankful to be here today to have been a
part of moving this bill forward. What this bill does, and in short
measure, is it gives the green light to the completion of this purchase
by Duke Power, of their, buying out their partners in these plants. The
purchase price is $1.2 Billion. This bill provides for how Duke Progress
will recover its investment over the next 31 years. It also provides for
how the cities are going to deal with their remaining debt. Because even
though they&#39;re selling these assets, it&#39;s not completely erasing
their debt. So what this bill does is provide for how the cities can
re-bond, refinance, if you will, the remaining debt and provides for the
mechanism for how Duke, over the long term, will get paid back.
Colleagues, I know of no opposition to this bill. It has been vetted
thoroughly by the local government commission. In fact, recently our,
sorry my mind has just slipped, we just received a letter from the
chairman of that body who we all know is an elected official, I
apologize, the name has just gone right out of my head as I stand on my
feet, approving of this, encouraging us to pass this. Public staff at
the Utilities Commission has vetted it. It has been looked at up and
down, in and out, left and right, and sideways, and after all of that I
know of no opposition to this bill. So I commend it to you and I&#39;ll
be happy to answer any more specific questions. Thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis, you have the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks, Mr. President, and colleagues. As I stand before you today I
stand in full support of this bill and I can tell you that this is
public policy at its best. This will go so far for Eastern North
Carolina and many beyond. I&#39;m reminded that over the years there
have been so many people who&#39;ve come to me personally saying,
&quot;I need help. I need help to get through this month with my
electric bills.&quot; One thing, I remember standing the other day with
Senator Newton, and we were talking about this exact issue and we were
sharing stories and this was one I relate so well, and that is people
coming to the church trying to get help with electric bills

  <p id="15:00">
  [SPEAKER CHANGES] This is real and it has been extremely real for us in
these communities. You know one thing, residents don&#39;t hesitate to
tell us what&#39;s on their minds, especially with a couple bills
that&#39;s come through. But one thing that&#39;s generated in this bill
is some good conversations. I&#39;ll read a couple of comments
that&#39;s come in to me. One person said, &quot;I pray it passes, my
light bill is $550 and it&#39;s only my husband and me. We both work
first shift, we keep the heat at 68 degrees, we keep everything
unplugged except the refrigerator and the alarm clark-the alarm clock
when we leave. It still doesn&#39;t seem to help.&quot; Another person
said, &quot;Thank God! I can&#39;t continue to pay an electric bill as
high as my rent.&quot; For many people, they are paying electric bills
as high or higher than their rent and their mortgage. So as I stand
before you today, I&#39;m just so excited and delighted, and I want to
personally take this moment to thank everyone who signed on to this
bill. And this shows what we can do and what people send us here to do,
collectively together, and Senator Newton, when 45 members sign on to a
bill, Democrats, Republicans, and people in protected areas,
non-affected areas. And I&#39;m saying for all those who signed on,
thank you. To those that we&#39;ve knocked on your door, reached out,
Senator Robinson, thank you. We called her at a funeral and asked if she
would please consider signing on and she did. So I say thank you to my
colleagues and I want to say especially thanks to Senator Newton,
Senator Pate, and you know Senator Bryant has al-always served with so
much passion and out of all days she&#39;s not here, but we anticipate
her coming through tomorrow where she&#39;s able to cast the third vote.
And I&#39;m going to end by saying this, for all those residents in
places like La Grange and Hookerton, Adan, Fremont, Greenville, Windsor,
Rocky Mount, Tarboro, Enfield, Elizabeth City, I mean this is going to
go a long ways and we should all feel proud. So I do stand and ask for
your support and your vote today. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill. I also would like to add my
very, very much my support for this bill. As a resident in our home
county of Robeson, there are two areas that come under this, Red Springs
and Lumberton, and Robeson is a very poor county. And our residents have
a hard time paying the electric bills that have been caused by the
excess of rates that have to be done to pay this debt, so I hear a lot
from our constituents who are having a hard time paying the bill. I also
wanted to mention one more thing, that this will help all of eastern
North Carolina for, and that is not only our residents and businesses,
but it&#39;ll help in economic development. When we&#39;re recruiting
businesses to eastern North Carolina, if they&#39;re a very large power
user, we just get eliminated because they take a look at those
electrical rates. That makes a big difference and as someone that&#39;s
been involved in economic development for a number of years, that has
been a real problem. So this will not only help all of our constituents
on their own power bills, this will help us in recruiting industry to
eastern North Carolina. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Waddell, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Waddell has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. Even though I&#39;m in
Charlotte, we certainly support this bill because when one section of
the state prospers, so does other sections. So with the summer fast
approaching, we would normally be embracing higher utility costs.
However, thanks to Senate Bill 305, families in North Carolina will have
additional relief from the incoming warm weather. I support this bill
wholeheartedly because it does what I came here to do. It makes life
easier for our fellow citizens and it puts money back into the hands of
families that need it the most. So with the passage of this bill we can
rest easy knowing that we&#39;ve taken another step toward helping make
North Carolina a better place for families. Duke Energy is in the final

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 6: State Health Plan/Rehired Retiree Eligibility.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman is recognized to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President thank you and members who speak on the bill. We have had a
situation where retirees are returning to work especially in some
counties like Senator McGinnis’s County and many others around the
state, I don’t know any county that’s not asked for some help with this
and is ?? to allow retirees teachers, superintendents, principals, who
have a lot of knowledge and a lot of skills to fill these positions that
they have not been able to fail, and we got some vacant right now
waiting on this legislation and that just fixes the things where the
local school system will pick up but in some cases $400 to $500 a month
to get them the good coverage and not the ?? Plan that the Affordable
Care Act was offering them and that’s a very poor coverage so that’s all
that does it, it fixes the situation and allows them to how these people
and get them going here between now and the end of the year just to move
fast enough, thank you I appreciate your support.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I just want to remind everyone tomorrow
afternoon is bill filing deadline, I believe. Earlier I made a motion to
4:00 today, bill following every day cuts off at 3:00. They needed a
little extra time today, so that&#39;s why we went to 4:00, but
tomorrow&#39;s 3:00, bill filing deadline still stands and ask for

Announcement sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the finance committee, today&#39;s meeting

9:00 to discuss and vote on Senate Bill 372, Renewable Energy Safe
Harbor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Cook, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A moment of personal privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You
have the floor Senator. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;d like to send forth a
Senatorial Statement. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You can send forward your
statement, Senator. And you still have the floor. The floor is yours,
Senator Cook. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. The Outer Banks of North
Carolina is a place of natural beauty, and it is considered a national
treasure. It is the birthplace America, birthplace of aviation, and a
destination for millions of visitors each year. However it is also
important for us to recognize the economic contribution of the
commercial fishing industry in North Carolina. For us from the coast,
commercial fishing is our heritage. It means everything to the working
watermen. Today many of our local fishermen have fathers, grandfathers,
and great-grandfathers who earned their living from farming the ocean,
oftentimes under adverse conditions. Here in North Carolina there is a
significant amount of potential for the agriculture industry to become a
greater source of income and economic prosperity for North
Carolina&#39;s commercial fishing industry. So, except for Jerry
Tillman, I would like to invite everybody to the fish fry dinner.
[LAUGHTER] Forgive me. I enjoyed that. [LAUGHTER] Featuring harvested
seafood brought to us by North Carolina&#39;s watermen. It&#39;ll take
place at Fred Mills Construction Company, 1627 Navajo Drive, Raleigh. It
begins at 5:30, and I hope you&#39;ll all join us. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman, for what
purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] A moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor, Senator. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Cook, I understand why you don&#39;t want me to come. Number one,
although your girth is much larger than mine, I can out-eat you.
[LAUGHTER] I did not eat. This is the third day that I&#39;ve not eaten
and I&#39;m going to be there. Senator Rucho, we&#39;re going to have to
cut our meeting short. I&#39;m going to be there today. And I want to
say a word about our working watermen, our fishermen, our commercial
fishermen. A lot of this catch was done last night. You&#39;ll have the
best trout, farmed and drawn, if you get soft-shelled crab which we had
last year, it was in season. It&#39;s not in season now but they&#39;ve
got a lot of them Senator Rabin, that are frozen. It&#39;ll still be
good. And flounder and many other great fish from our waters of North
Carolina. Now folks if we don&#39;t protect this valuable resource, what
you&#39;ll have is you&#39;ll have fish uninspected from Taiwan, from
China, from Indonesian countries and many other places. I believe this
is a great resource, made for all spokesmen as well as our commercial
fishermen. The ocean is big enough and it&#39;s sustained us for a long
time and it will continue to but I hope you, if you come and I hope you
all will, you&#39;ll enjoy the best, freshest seafood that you can get.
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any other business or
announcements? Senator Blue, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER

  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Will caucus immediately after session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bingham for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you ladies and gentleman of the Senate. I have
an announcement. Some of you know or did know John Carrington. He&#39;s
a good friend of ours, those that did know him, and his wife, Ruby
Moore-Carrington, passed away Friday, March 27-or I&#39;m sorry Monday.
On Friday the 27th they&#39;re going to have a memorial service here in
Raleigh at the Mitchell Funeral Home at Raleigh Memorial Park, and
online condolences can be made, www.mitchell@rmp.com. I&#39;ve got
information here at my desk and, he was certainly a dear friend of the
Senate and, a well-loved and thought of senator. If all of you would
keep him in your prayers, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you Mr.
President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator, any further business to come before
the Senate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Sanderson, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. I&#39;m not real sure that
Senator Cook really got through his Senatorial statement. It seems like
he got kinda diverted, he and Senator Tillman. But if it&#39;s
permissible, I would like to move that the written part of his
Senatorial statement be spread upon the journal.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No objections, so ordered. Senator Brown for what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] An announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Republicans, we will caucus at 3:00, not 3:15, but
3:00 this afternoon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other announcements? Any further business to come
before the Senate? If not, the chair will recognize Senator Berger for a
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. I move that the Senate do now
adjourn, subject to the standard stipulations set forth in Senate Rule
24.1. The receipt of committee reports and messages from the House to
reconvene on Thursday, March 26, 20015 at 11 am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The motion is that the Senate do now adjourn, subject
to the stipulations stated by Senator Berger, to reconvene Thursday,
March 26 at 11 am. Seconded by Senator Meredith. All in favor say aye,
opposed no. The ayes have it. The Senate stands adjourned.
