Order throughout the room. Welcome everyone, we are glad to have you

back, we'll see what we have going. We'll do our housekeeping first and
introduce our pages, there is a Clark from Rayford, Senator Clark, any
relation? Harrison, I can't read your writing from ??. Senator Wade
welcome and Miss Lindsey from Reedsville. Senator Berger?? Senetator
Burger. Jacob Bernett from Camden, Senator Jay Davis and Grahams Clark
from ??. Welcome, hope you've had a good week, I know it's been a short
week but one that I am sure you'll all remember. Sergents and Armed
Staff, we appreciate and are glad to have with us today ?? Cheryl,
Camden Lewis, Donald Blake and Anderson Meadows, so thank you all for
your service and for all that you do for us. This morning we are going
to hear from two Bill. This morning we are going to hear about two
bills. They are both PCS's, we'll take those up. They are not for
discussion, they are just for presentation. We will not be discussing
today, we will do that at a later date, and of course we will won't be
voting on any of these, for either of these today so with that, we will
first hear from Senators Clodfelter and Hartsell. Senate Bill 394 and
this is a PCS, do we have a
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Motion of clarification sir. Did I understand that we are not going to
take any questions
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, this is just for presentation only today. We are just getting it out
in front of the whole world today, but we will have a motion to hear
this PCS or have it put out please by Senator Hise, thank you. All in
favor say Aye, thank you very much ??? Senator Hise
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr Chairman, members of the committee. First let me say that,
we appreciate the opportunity to present this to not just this committee
but to get out to the whole world as it will be including those folks in
China that are apparently listening on our system here and have been for
years. Let me simply say that this is not, the 394 that you have before
you is not a Republican plan, it is not a Democrat plan. It is not a
Senate plan, it is not a House plan. It is a what we tend to think and
we like to look at, Senator Clodfelter and I as a consensus effort to
look at tax reform. It is an attempt to fix an adequated, outdated tax
code. It does not seek to increase taxes. It does not seek to decrease
taxes. We again appreciate the opportunity to put it out. You have
before you the committee sub and you have a series of, there is also an
explanation that goes back to the last version and updates from the last
version that we've presented to this committee, I think sometime in late
March or early April. This is the third version of the bill. Let me if I
might, I think Senator Clodfelter can explain the specific items in this
separate handout that you have as to what they are.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The handout will guide through the bill. The first two pages of the
handout are the high level summary of the major provisions of the bill,
broken down by the principal types of taxes. The third page, those
haven't been distributed yet, have they been distributed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Apparently some people don't have,some people do
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Remember what I am saying cause it's going to be really simple and you
will get the copy in about 15 seconds alright, the third page that looks
like this, that's the fiscal analysis of the bill and it shows you all
the operating components of the bill and how they come to the bottom
line. The fourth, fifth and sixth pages of your handout are analysis of
the impact of the personal income tax changes on different income levels
and different filing statuses</p>

<p id="05:00">
Those would be charts will look like this in your handout.  Some people
have the hand out. Everybody will get it shortly and then the final page
you've got, on the back, will look like this and that page is a summary
of what are the main changes that were made between the second addition
of the bill, which was the addition we presented to the committee in
early April and this addition of the bill, which is the third addition
of the bill. That is the back page.  That's the summary of the principal
changes. Most of those are the result of input and reactions we've
gotten from folks. Some issues are still in progress but that's
essentially what you have with your handouts and that will help guide
through your reading of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In summary, the primary differences from the last
version are the rate, the personal and corporate rate for both carry
pass throughs and otherwise is 5.95 percent flat. The franchise rate is
$1.25 per thousand with some ? and the sales tax is 4.5. Otherwise, we
have the other changes...we do not...this bill from the last version
does not tax social security. It does not expand the base any farther
than it would be  previously on sales taxes and just as a matter of
information to you, in the first two years we looked at...we actually
came up with more money  than we needed to make it a flat situation.  We
thought about looking at some other provision. We looked at some other
provisions and one of them was in fact we have extra funds and we
applied that into a reserve to pay the UI debit, which could expedite
the payment back for business purposes. Other questions, we'd be glad to
answer at some point in time but I think that's our time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We're going to make sure everyone who does
not...anyone who does not have a copy of the explanation and etcetera,
please let me know or the Sargent at Arms know. I think they all got
swallowed up pretty quickly. We'll make sure all the members do have
copies and then we will have discussion. The Sargent at Arms pass those
out please and then we're going to have a full discussion next week or
at a later date on these bill. So next bill will be 677. It will be
presented by Senator Rucho or without Senator Rucho. It is a PCS so we
need a motion to hear the PCS, please Senator Tucker. All in favor say
aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Oppose?  The ayes have it. Senator Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister Chairman and members of the finance
committee. This has been waited...a long waited...we worked hard to get
out some information. We're not going into a lot of detail because it
was designed, basically, to allow it into the public domain so that
you'll have a chance to look at it prior to any committee meetings.
First thing I’ll ask,  though, is...members of the audience, how
many...would you just raise your hand if you're lobbyists. Okay, members
of the committee, I just want you to remember those are the folks that
are in the process of trying to be sure that this tax system stays
complicated and loopholes are maintained. And I’m not saying...and I'm
not saying...that's their job and okay but all I will tell you is the
people that they represent in many case are concerned more about the
fact that they maintain their loopholes and their special ? as is
evidence by seven other times when we tried to move a tax reform...you
ask Senator Clodfelter...tried to move tax reform and, unfortunately,
was was stymied because of the fact was that the goal of special
interests rather than the people were put forward first.  The goal of
this bill is to do a number of things. First of all, to eliminate tax ?
and loopholes that are in the biannual expenditure, which we're trying
to get rid of those so that what that means is we get rid of the
expenditures and the loopholes and the ? and that means everybody's tax
rates are less in the state of North Carolina. That means everybody's
going to be treated fairer.</p>

One special instead be given special consideration at the expense of the
people from console by the ring by limiting the Congress and the plans
we get a chance alone made without ultimate goal of Symantec's is
similar for a similar two from that agency, several personal income tax
rate the plan is designed to transition into that he has also designed
with first base on sound economic principles based on company business
policies so they can B got up and down based on the revenue stream by
the old Seattle and a novel to reduce from the professionally to taxes
and taxes across the board to make North Carolina the competitive state
we already know which makes take away and now it's going to be inmates
taking this is the fourth week and have a business he organically grown
in small business mouth or leaking the attracted just two of them, state
businesses to come here purchasing property purchased land to play north
Carolinians and blocking back to work from this case opportunity to put
the people first and not special interests sell malice talk about just a
couple about to get some clarification on a few things are out there
that belie discussion but let's talk about the TV ads that are out there
confusing the public that talking about some of the areas that are
always say some less than truthful information about some ads back talk
about the Federal Health Care by E and nonprofits are two other than
withholding taxes pay no taxes a loyal to the state of North Carolina
and their existence here F. Bentley SE and F-one NSC by the hospital
association and the sure knowledge seemed that talks about that, they
should have said that the Moscow face facts and they only seem possible
bills of 26200 thousand dollars of that nearly impossible to understand
that began a nonprofit organizations many executives and then pay
$10,000,000 for multimillion dollar salaries S at the profit at 20/4 and
so we need to be very conscious about the fact that two L. Nichols the

also talk about any damages claimed that because tension you'll be
inundated by a lobbyist friends trying to preserve their tax loopholes
well to talk about (SPEAKER CHANGES)  P. Mel Tillis for example they had
represented of adults that talks about seven are still fighting for
affordable housing and as a number of falsehoods at Manhattan a special
interest group that many say the monopoly because of the fact that they
leave or anyplace else to try to stem from a 6% and that is universal
price that they are getting more concerned about any job creation that
the tax reform package would do about maintaining their luggage and well
financially this is a contract everybody to look at what is in the best
interest of the state of North Carolina MM last month talks about to
another and that talking about to nonprofit charities anyone understands
that they are doing a lot of good work in the U.S. cable Carolina and
law will say he is that if we treat everybody the same everybody used
out that the police (SPEAKER C HANGES) , Cannell by Eric Weiner Emily
and tax policy that this does is it puts money in people's pockets so
that they'll have a chance to even two to charity, it released by the
men should not be taking winners and losers that if Mr. Chen and bodies
finished IE look from too much higher than the future will weekend talk
about this bill in the detail and that this is designed to do is give
everybody kind of opportunity to study it too are battling for
renovations and got we will find a way they are to actually make North
Carolina, competitive economy not just in the southeast but one that
will be able to challenge by the entire state to attract the chief of
the strength of the national title in the foot two, an opportunity to
present this in more detail thank you for that to hand out of five to oh

the public eye. And before we adjourn, before we adjourn, I want to
thank our staff for the hard work that they have done on this throughout
the session in both houses and in all the bills that we have brought
forward and I hope that we can come out of this with some really good
tax ?? for the taxpayers of North Carolina. Do we have a question not
germane to the presentation?
[speaker changes]
It's germane, but not - it's a technical question which is, is there a
similar document to this for the NC Fair Tax Act? It shows the changes
of what the net cost will be, who bears the cost of the changes. That
would be very helpful.
[speaker changes]
Yes, that will come out before we have discussion.
[speaker changes]
Thank you.
[speaker changes]
Thank you. With no further business, this meeting is adjourned.</p>
