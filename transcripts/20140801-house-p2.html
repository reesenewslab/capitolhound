[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To move for adoption of the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is- the motion is now properly before us, the gentleman is
recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, members of the House, the first, I think 7 sections of this
is really an agency bill that I think came out of the joint
transportation oversight committee, and if you have specific questions
on that I may refer to one of our conference committee members, Rep.
Iler or maybe Torbett.
Section 8 is new, but actually was in our ?? reform bill, was suggested
by Rep. Millis, currently where right of way is taken, the property
owner is entitled to density credits, but they're never told they are.
And they don't know about it. So this requires the local government to
tell them what they're entitled to as a result of a right of way
dedication.
Then the final I think add-on provision is section 9a, and it deals with
digital dispatching services from the revenue law study committee, and
I'd have to defer to someone else to explain that. But I think we passed
that before. So unless you have questions, I move for adoption of this
conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Torbett, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the adoption, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and Gentlemen of the House, this again is part of the effort that
we've taken with DOT/DMV, just to bring them up to a level of
modernization, dragging them kicking and screaming into the 21st
century. And the outcome is that the expedition of processing for the
citizens of North Carolina. I think there's no one in this chamber that
hasn't had issues</p>

To the president of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of
Representatives, conferees appointed to resolve the difference between

has been entitled An Act to Modernize Business Court. The conferees

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for a motion and to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I move that we concur in Senate Bill 853 as the Business Court
Modernization. As most of you know, the Business Court in North Carolina
is very successful. It has been well received by the business community
as a place they can go with certainty and have their disputes taken care
of and they can understand those very complex cases, and many times are
involving a lot of money. This court is a place they can go and be
confident that they’ll get a fair hearing. Claims like security law,
antitrust laws, state trademark law, intellectual property law, internet
and tax law disputes are just some of what the Business Court takes up.
This sets out what cases are eligible to be tried in the Business Court
and it also, this conference report also has a way for a corporation to
create a holding company and this is a new thing for us. It’s already
been done in Delaware and this is what the business community wants and
I don’t know of anybody who is opposed to either the Business Court part
of the bill or the holding company  part of the bill so I recommend that
we concur in the conference report.

Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, having voted on the prevailing side, I move that House bill
1133, that the motion not concur to House bill 1133, which was adopted
previously in this House, previously i believe a couple days ago, which
is the technical corrections bill, be reconsidered, and that I would be
recognized to debate the motion once.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The motion is properly before us, the gentleman is recognized to debate
the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, and members. The reason for this motion, as you
recall, the technical corrections bill that we did, we passed a bill, we
sent it over to the Senate, the Senate took what as a good bill and made
it a less good bill and sent it back, we voted not to concur with that
because they took out several provisions that were in the House bill
that we wanted to keep. The things they added really weren't a big deal,
that no one really seemed to have any heartburn with what was added. But
the issue where there were several things that we wanted, that the House
wanted that were taken out. So the dilemma is that the House is left
with is, given the current state of affairs, is do we adopt the
technical corrections bill if this motion passes. Do we bring the
technical corrections bill before us, simply adopt the Senate's version
of the technical corrections bill which fixes a lot of the technical
problems that are out there. You know, the downside in doing that of
course is you los your leverage to ask for the additional things that we
wanted in the bill. We've reviewed it, there are probably about three
other matters or so that we wanted in that bill, that we can- that 2 of
those have been addressed in other matters. Matter of fact, some of the
provisions we wanted were either in the budget or when the couple other
bills that we've already dealt with, so the list got narrowed down. And
the concensus was at this point, that-
Anyway, the concensus very simply was that we could probably get
something done, and this would be better to adopt this than nothing at
all. So I would ask the body, body support I believe Mr. Speaker wanted
to debate the motion also.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the motion Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I would recommend actually the reconsideration be
adopted, I think that a number of the provisions that some people had
concerns about on the House technical corrections are out, I think most
of it truly is agreed upon in technical corrections, it doesn't mean
somebody might not have an issue with one provision, but it looks pretty
clean, and I would recommend because it fixes a lot of things that
really should be fixed that we adopt the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the motion.
If not, the question before the House is the motion by Rep. Moore to
reconsider the vote on Senate committee substitute to House bill 1133.

Representative Howard, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The...we had a good vote on this yesterday and
there were several additions that were made from the original version, I
just hope that we could support it again today. Most of these changes
are critical, they came from the Department of Revenue so it’s things
that we really need to have in place immediately so I’m hoping we can
pass this. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate? Representative Hager, please state
your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is there any way we could have this bill
displaced just for a few minutes? I’m preparing an amendment for it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We will. There are no other items on the calendar, so that will have the
effect of putting us at ease. If there are any members intending to have
an amendment on this bill, the chair will limit any submission
amendments to the next ten minutes. 3:45.
Ladies and gentlemen, the chair may, before everybody steps away from
their seats, a couple of things. One, the calendar tomorrow, we were
thinking 9 AM. The chair understands that there is a ceremony down the
street with the Governor, I think, at 9:30 related to our World War II
veterans and commemorating the war. That’s at 9:30. The chair is
inclined to move the calendar up so that members who choose to
participate in that will be able to do that. The only other alternative
would be to move it back to 10 AM so the chair, given the choices, we
have 10 AM or 8:30 AM. The chair would ask you to turn your light on if
you prefer 8:30.
If you will turn off all your lights so we will not lock up the machine.
Apparently we’ve got a little glitch here. The clerk would say it would
be better just to record the vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Bill Brawley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There’s a point of parliamentary inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would an amendment to 8 AM be in order?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you’re on the Rules Committee, probably not because there will be a
Rules meeting before the 8:30 AM. Ladies and gentlemen, just in full
disclosure, it’s the intent of the chair to take a vote. I think the
chair stands corrected, it appears as though Representative Boles
originally had 9:30 as the time, so we will back to 9 AM.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The chair was informed that it was at 9:30, we were trying to
accommodate that. Representative Jeter, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d like to change my vote on 1133 from no to aye.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and Gentlemen of the House-
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and Gentlemen of the House, more than 2 decades have passed since
I have began my service as a member of this body and my tenure is about
to end. I want to first of all thank the citizens of Guilford county for
allowing me to represent them here in the General Assembly and in the
elected positions that I've held. I've appreciated their support and I
have enjoyed being their representative, and I look forward to
continuing my service with the citizens of North Carolina away from
Raleigh. My thanks to my family, my children and grandchildren, my mom,
who's 89, for their sacrifices and allowing me to share my time with
North Carolina's people. I also thank my last workplace of Bennett
College. I leave here as the longest serving Democratic woman in the
House and in the benefit, and the tutelage from the longest serving
member in the General Assembly, my seatmate, Rep. Michaux. I thank him
for his mentorship and his friendship as well. And my current leader as
well, and Mr. Speaker, I thank you. I also want to thank the many I have
served with, some who are still here, and some who are no longer here
for various reasons, including the wonderful staff and the L.A.s who
serve my office. The many lobbyists who I've had the privilege of
learning from and working with. My time here has taught me to value and
appreciate hard work. It's reinforced my belief that service is indeed
the rent that we pay for living on this earth. And I've tried to keep my
rent paid up, and I've worked to be the voice of citizens throughout my
district and state who often are not heard. Serving here has taught me
the value of friendships and partnerships, and I've made many, and I've
lost many close friends too over these decades as well. This can be a
very averse, sometimes complex environment. I remember long hours, Rep.
Michaux and the appropriations room upstairs and LOB, trying to get back
to Greensboro to teach my classes at Bennett College, which is a
college. I remember bright moments too as we celebrate new babies, and
grandchildren, and members' birthdays and holidays, and historic events
as well like hat day, and ??, and I thank you all for participating in
that. But serving in this House has taught me to value the lives of all
of North Carolina's people, especially the least of these. It's a
wonderful institution, and as an elected person charged to do the
people's work, I hope that you will always remember that doing the right
thing is always right. It's not easy all the time, It's not popular all
the time, but I've learned a lot from many of you. Some times what to
do, and other times I've learned what not to do. So I'd like to think
that as an educator of more than 4 decades, I'd like to think that you
learned a little bit from me as well. I've had the pleasure of
sponsoring and working on many legislative initiatives that I hope have
improved the quality</p>

this work, that you will remember that it matters not only how we treat
each other, but how we treat our citizens who need and depend on us. We
can’t solve all of the problems for all of the people all of the time,
but we must always try to extend our reach beyond our grasp. The late
Maya Angelou reminds us how delicate those we serve are. She said that
people will forget what you did. People will forget what you said. But
they will never forget how you made them feel. It’s been an honor and
it’s been and it’s been my pleasure to serve with each of you. I thank
God for this unique opportunity and I wish for each of you, Godspeed.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Mr. Speaker, to Representative Pierce, an inquiry of the
chair. Just want to know about the schedule for tomorrow. What I need to
come prepared to still at least leave Sunday for church.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The session will start at 9 AM. The only matter that may be on the
calendar tomorrow, or maybe two, would be the third reading of the
Senate Bill 744, the Appropriations Act of 2014. It’s the intent of the
chair to limit debate on that bill. I would prefer we allocate time and
we will go two thirds of the time, or some reasonable proportion to the
minority caucus, but it’s the intent of the chair to take that vote
before 10 AM. That’s at least the plan now based on the items that we
have on the calendar. It is the intent of the chair to adjourn by 10:20
AM so that those members wishing to participate in the World War I
wreath laying down the street will be able to get there on time.
Representative Blackwell, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I’d like to request permission to change my vote on House
Bill 366 from yes to no.

Brandon, please state your purpose.

Moment of personal privilege, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for a point of personal privilege. The House

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don’t write speeches. Everybody knows that I just get up and talk, and
I didn’t write one for this moment here. As a lot of emotions come down
on me because I’ve been thinking about what I was going to say to you
guys and I could never really figure out what I wanted to say because
it’s like, you never know when it’s going to end because it keeps going.
You have to think about different things. I will say this, that when I
first got here I didn’t know what to expect. I was looking at an article
that was written about the new cream of the crop and I remember that the
biggest thing that I wanted to work on, and I remember I was...I told
them is they were wanting to know about a bunch of issues and how I felt
about issues, but the biggest issue for me was stability and that’s what
they wrote. And I thought that...and this paper, it said that I didn’t
think that the biggest threat to our country wasn’t a nuclear Iran or
Korea or any of the things that we talk about, but I thought the biggest
threat to our country was the fact that we have parties that can’t get
along and people that can’t work together. I am proud of the fact that
when we got together that at least for the experiences that I have, that
we were able to live up to that. We have disagreement and we’re going to
have disagreement because come from different reference points and we
have different constituencies. I understand that. But I do want people
to understand that my whole goal  was not necessarily to...and people
are still on this day as I leave, still confused about why I’m here.
Why, Speaker Tillis, who’s one of the most wonderful people I’ve ever
met, would make such a comment…</p>

convolute that voice with political rhetoric, or else the same thing
that had been happening to them for 50, 60 years would continue to
happen to them as long as I can convolute the conversation with
political rhetoric. I still don’t engage in it. I’m not going to engage
in it today and I will not engage in it tomorrow because it is political
rhetoric that can have you have 50 straight years or more of people
still living in poverty with no change whatsoever. You cannot, folks,
concentrate on problems for that long and they don’t get fix. You can
fix problems if you come together and be able to work through it, but
take the political rhetoric out of it. There are things that we witness
every single day – we watch it, we see it go down, and we still will
vote for policies or vote for systems that really, really doesn’t work
for people that we are here to work the most. This budget that we’re
talking about every single year, it usually deals with people that are
the least of these. We have to take care of them, and I tell people we
already spend the money. We spend the money. You have to spend it
anyway, so why don’t we spend it in an efficient manner that will make
sure that we can ?? the biggest capacity to make sure that we move
people from one place to the next? That would be the goal if you’re
going to spend the money, and so for you in this body to continue to do
the incredible work that we do, and it’s hard, I want you to look at the
fact that if you want to change it, it can be changed. People do it
every day. People have moved every single day, and one of the things
that I talk about on my campaign and that I would love for you guys to
remember this by, is that your reality is not your destiny, and we all
have our different realities, and in my community there are different
realities that I have to face. I have people who are going to wonder
where their next five dollars is going to come from, and I have people
that suffer from drug addiction, and I have people that suffer from
obesity, and I let them all know, that’s your reality; it doesn’t have
to be your destiny. And folks, the same, same, same principle applies to
this body. The reality is is that we have a Senate that might not
cooperate. The reality is is that we have ideological differences that
might tear us apart. The reality is is that we continue to have
conversations that are outside of systems and not necessarily in
systems, but that’s our reality; it never has to be our destiny. God has
given us great things and given us the ability to be destined to be
great people, but as we sit here in this leadership position, and it is
an honor, I tell people it’s the biggest honor I’ve ever had in my life.
It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done, it’s the greatest thing I’ve ever
done, but as we look at that from the position of 120 lawmakers for all
of the rest of these people, understand the power that you have to
create change. Understand the power that you have to create change
within your constituency, to motivate them to be better than they were
yesterday because you were. I love the fact that the Speaker talks about
my independence, and I would like for all of us to be able to have the
same independence. I understand that no one in this body – this is the
policy I always took – no one in this body has to represent my
constituency but me. Anybody gets mad at me, come to my district and
tell them your name. They won’t know who you are, so it doesn’t really
matter if you’re yelling at me about that. So and the same goes for your
district. Represent your district. It doesn’t matter who’s yelling at
you. It doesn’t matter if someone disagrees with you. You represent your
district, your people. They will be better because of it and you will be
better because of it. I am proud of the fact that no one can yell at me
from the back and tell me how to vote. Everybody knows that’s the truth,
and it will always be the truth no matter what position I serve in.
there’s only one people I look at, and that’s my constituency, and that
might make some people mad, but that’s just the way it is because none
of these people have to vote for me except my constituency, and that’s
it, and that’s the only people I answer to, but for your guys, I want
you guys to remember this from me, not only that your reality isn’t your
destiny, but I also want you to understand that don’t look at me as the
guy that only supported education reform or the guy that was the LGBT
guy or the guy that was the Democrat that crossed lines, but for the
sake of this, I want you all to remember me as your friend because you
will all be, always be remembered</p>

For me, and for my friends. I have enjoyed each and every one of you. I
have a story probably from each and every one of you that I can laugh
about and that we've had fun with. And the biggest thing that I've
enjoyed in this body is the camaraderie and the friendships that we've
all been able to develop. I think we have the best clerk in the history
of the United States of America, and I'm so proud of having been able to
serve under her leadership also. And I think that our staff is
incredible. When I first got here, I was looking at bills and said I
can't write like that. And I don't understand what's on these bills. And
it was very, very comforting for me to understand that staff did it.
They're incredible staff. They will stay up all night long. They will
take the most ridiculous bill and make it a bill, even though it's
ridiculous. And so they do all of that work and I love the staff for
what they do. Down to my janitors who make sure that they open up my
office because I lost my key the first day and have not seen it since.
[LAUGHTER] And they open my doors every morning, so this has been an
incredible, incredible experience. I love each and every one of you. You
guys have made this the best experience of my life. I have nothing but
good things to say about all of you. Anybody asks me about the North
Carolina General Assembly, I tell them it's the best place I've ever had
the opportunity to be, and I wish all of you the best. The best, best.
And all of you, God bless you. Godspeed. And thank you so much for being
everything to me. [APPLAUSE] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brandon, I
think your time was just about to expire when you made the comment about
a clerk, and somehow the clock got reset. [LAUGHTER] You got a little
extra time. Representative Wilkins, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, to I think, attempt to follow that with a point of
personal privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for a
point of personal privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker.
I'm one of those who will not be back. In the last, Representative
Brandon's right. The last couple weeks have been some really goofy
emotions racing through me from time to time. Let me tell you something
about this body. I've been here ten years. I looked at my 05 composite
picture the other day. I had hair then. [LAUGHTER] 88 of the people in
that photo are not here now. 88 of the 120. Several of those seats have
switched out more than once. I know one seat in particular I can
remember has switched out 4 different times so what I'm telling you is
I've seen a lot of folks come and go. And they've come and they've gone
for various reasons. And quite sadly, we've experienced a couple of
those reasons during this session because 11 people that I've served
with are dead. But why'd I tell you all this? I tell you because I have
memories of each and after I'm gone, maybe you'll remember me. Thank
you. [APPLAUSE]</p>

Mister Speaker, just thinking about Marcus Brandon and the fact that
he's leaving, I was wondering if we had any extra clocks around the
general assembly that we could give him on his way out because he's
never been able to be on time to anything and maybe that might help him
going forward.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I am new to this chamber, somewhat new, but I remember, I,
I'm gonna speak about my friend, Representative Brandon. When I first
came here for a meeting with miss Adams for the legislative black
caucus, I was coming from Charlotte on the train. So this young man got
on at Greensboro to back, I was up at the front. And so some way we
started talking when we kinda met each other in the middle. I said, well
yeah, he said, I said where you going man. Well, I'm going to, I'm going
to Raleigh. I said, what me too! I said, he said, well what do you do?
He said well I'm in the general assembly, this is my first term. I said
this is my first term too, sir. So he said well, my name is Marcus
Brandon. I beat an incumbent. I said well, my name is Rodney Moore. I
beat an incumbent! And so we'd been friends ever since. And so Marcus, I
just want to say congratulations to you, I know that you have an
election coming up to be Mayor of High Point and I'm proud of you for
that. But also, we're gonna have to go to Joseph A. Banks and get you,
get you geared up to be a successful candidate for the mayor of High
Point. But let me just say, I mess, I pick with Marcus all the time.
Marcus is my friend. We don't agree on everything, but one thing that we
agree on is that we have mutual love and respect for one another as
human beings and as God's children and so, godspeed my friend, and we'll
see each other soon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentleman the ice cream was provided by our dairy farmer and
colleague Nathan Ramsey, and he's also worried about it becoming milk,
and so if any of the rest of you would like some ice cream before it's

thank you for your generosity. Representative Michaux, please state your

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Throughout the mundane, mister Speaker, but based on us coming back
tomorrow morning, can you give us some idea as to what we do in terms of
adjournment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The, the chair and various members including Representative Moore are
working on an adjournment resolution. The chair does not anticipate
receiving the adjournment resolution that was sent forth by the Senate.
So, we will most likely have an adjournment resolution tomorrow to send
to the Senate. What the, tomorrow effectively represents the end of
session. The, the chair will be directing legislative services and all
staff to move to part time status, more or less adjourned status on
Monday with respect to staff policies, et cetera. There is a possibility
if the Senate does not take up the resolution either out of the skeleton
session that they will have tomorrow or in a session that they will have
by constitution next week then we could have skeleton sessions up at
least until the point of the veto window for the Governor which is ten
days, about ten days out from the bill that will pass tomorrow. But the
chair is hopeful that we will have an adjournment resolution to a date
certain that would minimally take up the Medicaid reform bill in
November.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a follow up. Based on what I've heard today, we don't have to worry
about a veto situation from what I understand. And that's why I was
reading the question because I knew that folks were looking at, you were
looking at the ten days out and whether or not we were gonna adjourn, we
were gonna adjourn to a date certain or sign and die. That, that was
what a lot of folks were wondering about.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct, Representative Michaux. There are a couple of other
bills that are pending that are in possession of the Governor, and</p>

with respect to the Senate and the House working out an adjournment

potentially be vetoed and that we would simply adjourn to the November
Medicaid Reform session. But the chair would encourage those of you, for
the purposes of next week, to consider it acquiesced session, we've
directed all the members of the caucus to no longer take their per diem

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. speaker, and members of the House. It is August 1st, 2014
and as Representative Boles has indicated there is some sort of ceremony
tomorrow but this day marks, this day 100 years ago the world was
plunging headlong into the maelstrom of World War. By now, I think, all
the various countries had mobilized and I think August 2nd is the day
some of them started declaring war on one another and in the last year,
leading up to this centennial, I've read two books on the beginning and
I still, to this day, cannot tell you what the fight was about. There
were blunders by the political leaders of the day, there was just pride
and boasting by some of the political leaders of the day and there's
still lessons there for us. And really, we're still in the post World
War I era in the world, some of the problem areas of the world today,
the problem started in the aftermath of that world war and, really,
World War II was just a continuation of World War I and the carnage was
on a scale, at this point people were celebrating and cheering the
beginning of a war and within, by the end of the month of August tens of
thousands already laid dead because the tactics of the last war were
used in the beginning of World War I and the technology of killing had
advanced greatly and men were just mowed down. Open charging, cavalry
charges became a thing of the past because you can't charge cavalry
through machine guns and massed artillery. Just tens, hundreds of
thousands lay dead. World War II, just hundreds of million, probably 100
million, at least, died as a result of the beginning of that war.
Diseases spread, the great flu pandemic of 1918 and it's just sobering
to think of people in high political office having tremendous
responsibility for the direction of their nations and we just need to
reflect on this as the centennial goes on and try to learn lessons where
we can and it's just an important milestone in history. Thank you.

Representative Torbett, please state your purpose.

Point of personal privilege, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Following my good friend, John Blust, I'd just like to add something
that did come out as a result of the war to end all wars. Of course that
didn't work out that great, did it? But something we did learn, and
we'll take it to November, 1963, World War I, the basic thought process
is that it began with the assassination of Franz Ferdinand. We had an
assassination November '63 that had not been from lessons learned from
the beginning of World War I we could have very well have entered into
another world war because of the leadership of a country that was, at
that time, was just torn as to what to do. But because we followed our
history, because we've learned from our history and we study our
history, that did not occur. And thank you for bringing that up,
Representative Blust.

read. Representative Floyd just to anticipate an inquiry we have 4
amendments. Representative Hager is recognized to send forth an
amendment the clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hager
moves to amend the bill page 17 lines 4 and 5 by inserting between the
lines the following language to read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Speaker. This is an amendment that we put in twice before now and we
only ran one bill, it was a [??] of the House Bill 1224 for
Representative Presnell J MAC for the western part of the state for
Evergreen and if Representative Presnell wants to add Mr. Speaker, I’d
be happy to have her tag along. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative
Presnell please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The is lady is recognized debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is the Dream Act Provision that we really need

on board with this and so is Senator Davis, so I would appreciate your
vote. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Queen please state your purpose.

is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Again, we have
passed through this body a couple of times, this provision. It’s very
helpful expand to the natural gas to the number one employer west of
Ashe [??] outside of Harris Casino, I guess, the number one industrial
employer, a 100 year old industry, Evergreen Paper. So, I please ask for
your support once again. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further
debate on the amendment. If not, the question before the House is to
passage of the amendment sent forth by Representative Hager to the House
Committee Substitute number 2 of Senate Bill 763. All in favor vote Aye,
all opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will allow
the machine to record the vote, 98 having voting in affirmative, 11 in
the negative, the amendment passes. Representative Iler is recognized to
send forth an amendment, the clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Iler moves to amend the bill on page 17, lines 4 and 5 by
inserting between the lines, language to read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
Chair apologizes. The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I have about 10 minutes to read
my own amendment. I understand that the just of the amendment is like
Representative Presnell was saying J [??] funds that were in 1224 and
the [??] fund which was actually asked for by the Governor and the
Secretary would be included in this. I ask for your support, glad to
answer any questions and again, my 10 minute reading of this. This is an
industry of 500 million investment and over a thousand jobs is waiting
word on what’s going to happen to these funds before they make a
decision. In our county, I share with Representative Hamilton and with
Senator Raven and she may or may not want to speak on it. I see some
other lights on, Representative Hamilton might have something to say
about this also. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier please state

Mr. Speaker. I’m trying to read fast too and I know the job catalyst
money as I recall was in the Conference Report. Can you just explain
what this does to that provision? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Could you repeat the
last part of the question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The job catalyst money as I
recall was in the Conference Report of the budget we just passed and
part of this is labeled job catalyst. Could you just explain what this
provision does to the Conference Report provision we just passed on job
catalyst? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, I may be able to

without this the money that has been allocated would be appropriated for
other purposes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the House, let's see. August the 1st, and we want to spend
another $36 million here, I'm having passed out to you a article from
the Southern Economic Journal of 2004, which empirically analyzes this
question. And all I'm gonna do is just read the abstract, it's like 3
sentences so if you'll bear with me. The entire premise of this type of
project is that it produces increased net income to that region. Now, it
doesn't. This has been examined many times by economists, and this
particular one comes out of the University of Tennessee. The sighting of
a large, new firm is often presumed to give rise to significant and
economic tax benefits to the community of location. This presumption
serves as the basis for the granting of lucrative economic development
incentives to footloose business. This article examines whether large
global firms generate significant net benefits for the region of
location. And here's the conclusion: The results show that large firms
fail to produce significant net benefits for their host communities,
calling into question the high stakes bidding war over jobs and
investment. Now many of you all just won't believe that, some of you
will think if you can appear at a ribbon cutting that you actually
helped produce the jobs that will be there. But I'm almost glad that
Rep. Iler presented this, because many of you were led to believe in
1244, 1224, that that job catalyst fund will somehow for people all over
the state, tier 1, tier 2, whatever, but no we find out of course it's
for particular projects in a particular place and like all other
incentives, almost none of it's going to tier 1 or tier 2 counties or
locations for other reasons. So in a sense of course this doesn't matter
at all because this bill is going nowhere, there's no Senate to receive
it, there's things in this bill that they hate, so that's why my speech
is going to be very short today. But I just think that you can show your
common sense by voting no on this amendment, just to get used to doing
it. Rejecting the siren calls of the people who are just bad at
economics.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Millis, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wanted to see if Rep. Stam would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Stam, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On page 1 of this bill, lines 27 through 31, it says that if the total
cost of the project to the state outweighs the benefits as a result of
an award from the Job Catalyst fund under sub part D, the committee may
disregard the Job Catalyst Fund award in determining whether the grant
is appropriate for the project. My question to you is that does this
mean that if the cost to the state are more than the benefits to the
state, they can back out all of the actual incentive which could go to
capital improvements, just not public infrastructure, in order to
determine whether the award is suitable?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Millis, that's one of the most hilarious parts of the amendment and
also the previous bill. They have these models by Professor Walden, cost
benefit analysis, but then they say &quot;We're going to disregard this
money as part of the cost.&quot; It would be sort of like an equation,
e=MC squared, but for the purpose of our trying to figure out the speed
of light we're going to disregard the e. It's crazy.

votes regarding incentives in this state, so I’m really grappling with
what it is I’m going to do. Haven’t really made a decision, it’ll be a
split-second decision, but I’d like to remind everybody in this body
that this particular amendment creates a new economic development fund
in the state of North Carolina. I offer that for your consideration.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Catlin, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Speaker. As I read this, I see that we’re looking at 36 million
dollars, and earlier this session, I filed with some other primary
sponsors a bill to try to restore some of the medical tax credits for
senior citizens, which we have not been able to find the money for. The
fiscal note for that was 30 million dollars to be able to restore those
tax credits to those senior citizens. To take this money and give it to
companies that are bribing us away from our senior citizens in my
judgment is morally wrong. I cannot support this amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Tim Moore, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker,
members, we’ve been debating the notion of incentives for years. We’ve
been debating them both when I’ve been in the minority and when I’ve
been in the majority, and when I first came and when you talk about
incentives just in an abstract world, they seem unfair in a lot of ways.
Why would you give a tax break to a company to locate to an area that
you aren’t giving to everyone? The reality is until the federal
government does something, until the federal government says State A
can’t do that with State B on that, that’s going to happen. There may be
challenges in the federal courts on it, but the problem is, and we’ve
seen this, North Carolina lost… My area of the state lost 17 hundred
jobs for a project that they were working on for a wheel-manufacturing
company just across the line in South Carolina because South Carolina
offered better tax incentives. Now the thing to understand in that is in
what this is, it’s only less tax paid. If they don’t… if the company
doesn’t pay any tax, they don’t get money. It’s not a perfect thing, but
if we’re going to be competitive, if we’re going to actually show that
we’re serious about trying to lure the jobs, what else are we going to
do? Those of you who represent tier 1 counties, tier 2 counties
particularly where the unemployment has spiked up very high, have seen
the textural mills leave, people getting laid off of their jobs, and one
of the bright spots in my area has been having some incentives to keep
those companies from going across the state line. Now what I hope – what
I hope is that eventually as we continue through tax reform that we
won’t need it, that the broad overall tax policy of this state will be
competitive enough so those states can locate here, but right now if
we’re going to compete with South Carolina, we’re going to compete with
other states in the region, some of whom are red states, conservative
states, we’ve got to be ready to compete, otherwise we’re going to see
jobs go to Tennessee, we’re going to see jobs go to South Carolina, and
I would just… When I’ve been there feet on the ground, seeing what’s
happening, meeting with these companies, actually talking with these
folks, it’s not theory, and I want to see us continue to work forward to
actually try to lower the overall tax burdens, try to pull all the tax
relief we’ve done, but I do think we need to give the Department of
Commerce and the governor the tools they need to be able to recruit
industry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Torbett, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I was torn on the original
bill, 1224. I pretty much said no, I can’t support all the stuff that
was in it, but there’s three things that came out in the way of
amendments on this bill that are positive, and let me give you just a
little bit of what little I know. JDIG, for example, goes predominantly
to larger jobs, larger account jobs, like maybe 500, 800 thousand, that
kind of thing. I received a text; it said this JDIG and JMAC could
possibly account for four thousand jobs. Four thousand jobs. None of
them are coming to my area, but there is one thing I’ve known and always
known, is that if Rocky Mount or if Blowing Rock is negatively impacted
economically, it’s going to negatively</p>

Impact Gaston County. I know that as a fact there’s one state working
cohesively to try to attract jobs. Here, let me tell you a little
horizon. I, I try to think over the hill. Let me tell you what I know. I
know down where George Cleveland lives and Phil Shepard lives, I know
they had the thing called United States Military. By all accounts their
downsizing to pre-nineteen forty levels. By all accounts on top of that,
there’s gonna be a brack/g. Will we win? Will we lose with a brack/g?
Ladies and gentlemen we are body movers, we’re people movers. We’re not
the industrial military complex that Eisenhower spoke about. We’re body
movers. When you downsize to pre-nineteen forty levels, you, you, you
reduce troop strength. You reduce the personnel inside the military. Now
George and the good Army guy back there might be able to tell you for
each soldier on the field, how many additional troops are required as
support? Four? Five? Six, somewhere in the military? It’s estimated that
if we go through all the downsizing that’s been talked about. I can’t
say it’s gonna happen. I can’t say it’s not gonna happen. But I’ve seen
it based on historical past numbers. There’s a possibility down where
George is and where Phil lives, out on the coast, you might lose up to
16,000 jobs in North Carolina. 16,000 personnel gone. Gone. Poof. Now as
we near net new job growth which we haven’t been there in years, we’re
nearing net new job growth. Net new. Haven’t heard that term in probably
six years. As we near it, it is my humble opinion that we need to raise
the cap on JDIG to give commerce the opportunity to bring in as much as
she possibly can. As much as she possibly can for North Carolina,
knowing that there very possibly could be that huge loss somewhere down
the road. And with that also being said everyone in here should be
fighting and talking to our members in D. C. and our future members in
D.C. to not let that happen. This is a catalyst for job growth. Is it
cash money? Is it money? Is it coming from the taxpayers? Absolutely.
And when we our complete tax reform package down to the point it is
replaced with an adequate, that it replaces adequately the incentive
packages, then we can get rid of the incentive package. It doesn’t
today. Just bear in mind what’s, what’s coming. Just, just think what’s
coming. I trust, I hope that you would give Department of Commerce a
non-appropriated amount simply letting her raise on JDIG so she can run
like the wind and bring everything she can possibly in the way of job
creation to the State of North Carolina. Thank you very much Mr.
Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Holley, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I have a question of the bill’s
sponsor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The amendment’s sponsor is Representative
Iler. Representative Iler, does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Now I’ve
not made a decision on this bill whatsoever but I did have a question
because the numbers seem to don’t add up. I’m looking in the budget. And
the budget has allotted $20 million. With this amendment will make it
36. Where’s the other 16 coming from? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s a good
question. I don’t know if we staff in the room that can help. But this
is part of the JDIG funds I believe. JDIG section. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’ll come from JDIG? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes ‘Mam. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
‘Kay. Thank you. [CROSSTALK] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Larry Hall
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask a question of the
motion’s sponsor and to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Iler does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Speaker, thank you Representative Iler. I was struck by your comments
that this would produce 1,000 jobs and that the commerce secretary would
be essential to that. If we pass this that would happen. Is there any
requirement? It. Is there any requirement that if we pass and fund this
$20 million that the commerce secretary is required to spend it on that
particular project you referenced to create those jobs you referenced?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don’t think we can require an executive branch
official to do that. But I believe that is the intent that I have heard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. To speak on the motion</p>

The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Speaker and, economic development is a tough thing and
people talk about picking winners or losers and that's always a tough
debate. This is a situation that appears to me that we're saying, we're
gonna take hands off, but fund an effort and, and I just asked
Representative Iler the question because it's been advertised to us that
it would be used to create these jobs. But I think it exemplifies what
the problem is. We're in effect just putting this money out there to be
used by whoever the commerce secretary may be. Now, secretary Decker is
great, fine person. And I have no doubt she would use her best efforts
to do something she thought was the best interest of someone in North
Carolina, whether it would be the project Representative Iler talked
about, or some totally new project, some other project, maybe one I
agreed with, maybe one I didn't agree with, but this does not seem to
have the requisite vetting process to go with this amount of money for
the sacrifice that would be made to guarantee the return on investment.
I really reluctant to just put twenty million dollars in someone's
pocket book or purse to walk around and look for someone to give it to.
And so, although I'm really a supporter of economic development, I think
it does have to go through the safeguards and the checks since it is the
peoples' money, and we do need to have some vetting process to ensure it
is spent in a manner that will give us the return on the investment that
is discussed. Not something that can't be enforced, can't be identified,
and therefore can't be measured. So right now I would have to vote
against.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Millis, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Speaker, members of the House. I'll speak briefly on
this as if I assume you all have made up your mind on how you will vote
whether for or against this amendment, but I think it's healthy for the
body to make a few remarks about what we're doing here today. And I'll
have to begin by saying that one of the most important powers that we
have as legislators is the power to tax and the power to spend. It is a
tremendous authority. And I also have to say that while I'm here, I'm
most certainly trying to fight as hard as possible to create an
environment where jobs can grow in the district I have the privilege to
represent and all across the state. But there's a difference between
creating an environment for jobs can grow within the role of government
that we all have by way of our oath of office and directly creating jobs
by taking taxpayer dollars by force and giving it out directly to a
special interest. Let me say, I would be voting for this amendment if
this amendment was talking about public infrastructure. Public monies
for public infrastructure. But this amendment is not speaking about
public infrastructure solely, but also by way of capital improvements
and capital assets. I just want to make sure we have that understanding
here. And also too, in regards to the shenanigans about appropriations
and about spending and things of that nature, I want to bring your
attention to the way that JDIG, JMAC and the ONE fund actually work, and
this job catalyst program that we're actually adding to. While we may
appropriate certain funds, we actually give the authorities of the
Department of Commerce to go and enter into certain contracts and these
contracts are actually signed not only by the director of commerce, but
also by the attorney general. And as of November of last year, let me
read to you, as a new member last year, our liability to the year of
2028 is eight hundred and forty million dollars. Now, for the other
expansion that we have done, I'm not sure what that current number is.
But just to let you understand is that this is not just thirty six
million dollars here ad ten million dollars there, but again that these
companies actually fulfill their obligation. The taxpayer's on the hook
for at least 2028 to the tune of almost one billion dollars. Again, I
would be supporting this amendment if this was solely for public
infrastructure. Water, sewer, roadways, if the business goes belly up
the taxpayers get the benefit of less congestion on the roadway. They
get the benefit of the proper infrastructure so another business can
come in. But for us to basically put the taxpayer on the hook and also
leverage local governments to actually establish capital assets by way
of shell buildings or by way of the actual equipment. If you read this
provision or not but it also allows aspects of equipment purchases. So
again, I find this very problematic and I would actually urge you to
support, excuse me, I would urge you</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Dollar, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wasn't going to speak on this one, but the debate became pretty
interesting. One thing to note, I think Rep. Hall may have asked the
question, or I thought  he asked the question about where the money is
coming from. The money for this actually has been appropriated, we just
did that a couple hours ago. So the money is in the budget. I do think
that the points that the points Rep. Millis have made, Rep. Stam have
made, Rep. Catlin has made, which is probably one that pulls it with me
as much as anything, are all very true. I suppose I'm going to vote for
this amendment, even though I have some inclinations on both sides of
it, if for no other reason than it gives this bill, which frankly
everybody in here understands has become, what do you say, a Christmas
tree? It's got a lot of pieces in it, so it will go over there with a
piece that not only is of interest to Rep. Iler, and some others in the
southeast, but is also of interest to the Senate, so maybe if the bill
ever comes back, maybe it'll have a provision or two in there that is
supported by a wide measure of individuals here in the House.  So that's
maybe just a practical thing, but the other piece of it is, is this
debate over in the Senate, I imagine it's just gonna come back to us and
back to us and back to us, and over the years, I don't know what the
resolution is, I'm not sure what the right answer is, but we're
certainly going to be back here many years to come trying to figure out
what is that appropriate role, and as Rep. Millis said, what is the
appropriate role for government in this area? Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would Rep. Dollar yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Dollar, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Dollar, I thought it was 20 million that was in the budget if 1224
passed. And is this 36 million?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's- I believe the amendment says 36, there's 20 in the budget, as far
as where they would- those additional dollars would come from, I would
leave that for the amendment sponsor to reconcile.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But as the budget senior chairman, where is the other 16 million being
appropriated from?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well the bill...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Incidentally, staff is available to the members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The funds would be sufficient, it's paid out over a period of time, and
staff can explain the details of that.

Rep. Iler, does the gentleman yield.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Iler, I understand this is your amendment, and we have 6 lights,
and ?? discusses about 45 minutes, could you take the appropriate step
please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm not sure which appropriate step ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That would be what I believe in the 2015 rules will be the Floyd rule,
and I believe that is calling the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I be recognized for a few words of debate before-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman wasn't actually in line to be recognized, the gentleman is
recognized to debate the amendment a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, we've heard a couple of comments about 2 or 3, 1
and 2, I can tell you that within a few hundred feet, a few hundred
yards of the site that is in this tier 3 county, only because those of
us who live on the coastal part of that county are supposed to be filthy
rich millionaires, it's a tier 3 county. You close highway 17, it's not
a rich county. It's a poor county, needs the jobs, but within a few
hundred feet is Columbus county, and not too far away is</p>

<p id="080:00">
I believe both of those are tier one counties. So our tier system has
got some problematic areas where problematic seems to come up. There is
some problematic things about it and every county is not uniform
throughout. The other thing is this catalyst part was a closing fund for
the secretary and the last two years we've lost a ?? project in that
same area. We've lost a caterpillar project and we've find out that
South Carolina who won those projects has a panel of about 13 of their
cabinet officers who could make a decision and put money on the table
today. A company doesn't want to hear we've got the votes for X, Y and Z
like North Carolina is so  well we've got the votes to do this, that and
the other and then we go through the ?? wars all over again. They want
to hear what's on the table today which gives a little bit of freedom to
the secretary and the governor. I understand the ?? the way that works,
that is paid somewhat down the road after they've proved they've
qualified and have got the jobs in place. Qualified so that maybe a year
or two down the road that's why the funding is sufficient. So that's two
of the points I've heard. I've also heard something about winners and
losers and I'm not trying to really be funny here but I guess it's going
to sound that way but I'm just as happy to let Washington pick the
losers and us pick the winners. But I guess it wasn't funny so Thank
you. Point being board, ladies and gentleman that until other states get
out of the rebate game or whatever you want to call it. When I was a
Hardee's years ago we said how soon do we get rid of buy one get one
free coupons and the answer always came back as soon as McDonald's and
Burger King get rid of them buy one get one free coupons. So until the
other states get out of this business doing business this way then we
are going to be in that business or we are going to lose projects to
South Carolina every year or to other states. I've got also a few
concerns about the ?? industry that this may hurt them because we are
giving a lot of money in one area and kind of being a little cheaper in
other areas so I hope that doesn't play into anybody's thinking but
again that's just some of the comments that have flown around and I want
to answer a few of those. Recognized for a motion Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER

Mr. Speaker, Members, this is the amendment I'm sending forth is
language that was in the Technical Corrections Bill. I know of no

you to go to the hardware store and get a copy made of a key. So, I
would ask the body's support.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Question of the amendment sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, how long has it been illegal to go to the hardware
store to get a key made?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think about a year. There was some provision, Representative Lucas,
that was in some obscure bill that has now been interpreted by the
Locksmithing Board as to mean that if you were to go to like your Ace
Hardware Store or go to Lowe's and get them to make a key for you that
that is now somehow engaging in the profession of being a locksmith. So,
we really need to fix this. Folks, I think Representative Moffitt was
talking to me. It was in the Rag Reform Bill, it was in the Technical
Corrections Bill that we passed. Um, you know, I know we can a lot of
times argue about whether things are good or bad, but this one's gonna
probably be pretty hard to argue with.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Remember last year, I got up and I talked about.. I told everybody that
I am a certified locksmith, and i thought to get something out of one of
the bills that we had.. try to make it illegal to even possess
locksmithing tools unless you are an actual practicing locksmith, and
you all had mercy on me and you went ahead and took it out. Well this is
something else that should have been taken out. What they were trying to
do.. because I know which locksmith is pushing this bill. I know who
sponsors on the other side, and the problem here is the particular
locksmith and I understand his situation, but they were getting tired
here. They were losing money for a lot of different reasons because a
lot of the big box stores are making keys now, because cops are
unlocking doors in the middle of the night when they are on their way to
help somebody. They get a midnight call “i'm locked out my car,” by the
time they get there, a police officer has come by, they stopped him and
opened it, and now the car is gone. So they were trying to prohibit
anybody that was not a locksmith from making keys, from having the
equipment or anything else. I've got all the equipment, and I certainly
didn't want it to be illegal. I went to school on it, I got trained on
it, and I know how to use it. I bet this is just another part of that
bill that should never have gotten past us, and it probably wouldn't
have, but there didn't seem to be a whole lot of interest in fixing it,
but I do appreciate you fixing the part is asked you to fix.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just briefly, it sounds like a lot of support for the amendment, but I
did want to let folks know that it is more than theory, because a lot
of.. what happened was after we finished last year, and as we were all
moving on doing other things, at the beginning of this calendar year a
lot of stores around the state got a letter.. cease and desist letters
from this licensing board threatening prosecution for folks making keys,
and I would venture to say if anyone here had the intention of that
happening, please .. I don't think I can ask you to raise your hands
because that violates the rules. But I will dare say very few would
raise their hands to say yeah, that's what we wanted to have happen with
that bill, and so this is an example of certainly rolling back some
regulation, and something that we ought to do to pass, so I would ask
the board to support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for a point of personal privilege. The House

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, one of my
good friends is departing us. He didn’t run this last time. He’s a true
gentleman. He didn’t want to get up, he wanted to ease out, but my
friend Joe Tolson, I met Joe about 16 years ago, maybe 17 years ago on a
state Economic Development Board. I tell you, you couldn’t ask for a
finer gentleman that took me under his wing, he’s been nothing but a
friend. He’s been a seatmate at one time. Used to buy candy and he used
to get on me because he said you’re putting weight on, man, and I got
sugar and I don’t need all that. I just want you to know, a lot of
people have come by this desk and Joe has passed this on to me, and this
is a peanut container. Joe, you are truly a gentleman, you have truly
been a good legislator. You’ve been here nine terms. We’ve been through
a lot. We talked a lot about our families. I tell you one good thing
about it. He truly loves his family, but he’s been a good legislator. We
were working on the budget one year, I tell you, if you don’t have the
good Lord, you don’t have your family, you don’t have anything. I
watched Joe Tolson sit here one day and he was torn a little bit, but I
think his grandson was graduating from High School, was that right Joe?
Junior High, which was really important to him and a time that he really
wanted to go, but Joe stayed here to vote because he was here to
represent the people of North Carolina, people of his district. Joe,
from me to you and from the colleagues, I know you didn’t want to get up
and say nothing, but from the bottom of my heart, you’ve been a friend
to me, you’ve been a good seatmate, and you have been a good legislator.
I wish you many, many more years with your family and I’m going to miss
you, buddy.
