Was a very much moving target and an additional 1.2 billion dollars or
more will need to go into medicade over the next ??. Of the total
spending, again 20.58 billion this year, 20.95 billion in 14/15, we have
an unappropriated fund ?? of 106 million that will carry over, if you
recall the april surprise was made up of 104 million dollars, but much
of that we believe is one time collections as people accelerated the
dividends and things of that nature at the end of 2012. The savings
reserve will be 165 million in 2013/14 and the allocation 74 million in
14/15. There is 100 million dollars of R&amp;R in 13 and 14 , 26 million
on 14/15 and the budget authorises 100 million dollars of 2/3rds bonds
for R&amp;R. We fully fund the teachers and state employees and ??
retirement system , it establishes a policy of increasing contributions
to the state health plan at the same rate as the CPI, so you see it at
1.8% in 13/14 and 2.2% in 14/15. There is a salary freeze that continues
for all state university, community college and public school employees,
and it also freezes statutory automatic increases in compensation
bonuses for certain employees. There is a methodology in here where we
go ahead and use the SG fund and basically take the 27 million dollars
and take the global trans?? off of the books. In terms of capital,
provides a state match for water resources, development projects as a
department of environmental and natural resources - 6.9 million in
13/14, 5 million in 14/15, and provides funds to renovate a number of
national guard armouries and facilities that are grossly in need of
repair, with that Mr Chair, would Mr President like to go and yield to a
sub committee chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman's recognised.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. I will speak briefly on the
budget to the education portion. Senator ??, Senator Apodaca, staff,
thank you all for a good team effort on this - we're spending, lets say
investing 11.1 billion dollars out of the 25 and a half billion dollar
budget, so we are putting a lot of resources there, the cuts were
miniscule if you will, when you see your money reports etc you will see
that the smallest cuts went again to the public schools and the largest
cuts, which were small, went to the universities, and they range from 1
to 3, 3 and a half, 4% in each year of the ??. The community colleges,
the universities, the public schools I have worked with, and Dan and I
and Tom since January, they have all sent me, well, 2 out of 3, notes of
congratulations and thanks for this budget . We worked out to give them
flexibility, fully fund the enrollment for all 3 and to ?? to reform
money and to continue the excellent public schools act money, and to put
additional flexibility into the budget for the public schools,
universities and community colleges, and they will be able to do things
with the limited amount of dollars that we still have for the budget but
I believe you will see in the details that the reform, things that are
in there, there are things that have been requested, have been asked for
and to give them more flexibility then ever before, thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Hose of Health and Human Services is recognised.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr President, members of the senate. Let me
begin by thanking Co-Chairman Senator Pate and the incredible staff that
we have had working on this HHS budget, this was not the easy task as
one might imagine, this is ?? we have gone, and additional increases
this year required, in our payment portion this federal entitlement
program, including the rebase, the affordable care act woodwork, the
program integrity and contract cost for the increase enrollments,
contracts and other ACA impacts. We are looking at an additional 1.33
billion dollars in required spending in medicade, a program who's
current certified budget is 3.1 billion dollars. This has taken a lot of
changes within the program and actually across state government and
state budgets.</p>

<p id="015:00">
We've had to go through the departments budget for areas that they have
had to make cuts. Particularly in areas where they've historically
transferred money to fill the medicaid gap. We've had to close four of
the sixteen child development service centers. Service centers that are
already riddled with vacancies in operation. We've closed  the three
drug treatment centers in the state. ?? centers which operated at
158,000 dollars a bed. We closed the Wright School which operated at
112,000 dollars a bed for part time services. We've had to change the
way drug payments are made - put pre authorizations on mental health
drugs. We've changed provider assessments to a percentage rate. We've
raised co-payments. We've also had other things to do. We had a
department of justice settlement we needed to continue funding, which we
did. We've moved funds and childcare subsidies from the pre-k program to
the subsidy program to provide services for more children in the program
and protected those funds through the block grant program as well. With
block grants to non profits across the state, we've moved the
politicization out of the process, taken those funds whole and moved
them to the secretaries office where oversight of those nonprofits can
be what it has not been historically. We've also expanded the care
program with block grant funds provided for people who are caring for
Dementia and Alzheimers patients and we've expanded the personal care
service hours up to the limit of 130 for individuals with those same
conditions so that we can address what occurred last year when those
were cut back to 80 hours. We can address some of the issues that
special care units are experiencing in the state. As we move, I'll be
glad to continue any other questions but I think that's a good summary
of where we stood in the HHS budget and I thank you all for your time.

Senator Jackson of Natural Economic Resources is recognized.
[speaker changes]
?? Mr President, I believe Senator Brock is going to do the presentation
today.
[speaker changes]
Senator Brock is recognized.
[speaker changes]
Thank you Mr. President. In N.E.R, we had a lot of moving parts and I
want to thank our staff first of all for putting up with Senator Jackson
and myself. They deserve an award for that but we had a lot of moving
parts. And how to modernize, how to make government in North Carolina
more efficient, more effective, our budget moved 7 million dollars into
JMAC annually to make sure that we live up to the promises we do. We
continue to put money into BRAC or our Base Realignment and Closing to
show that North Carolina is still the most military friendly state in
the nation. To protect that important investment, not only do we have in
our economy but in the security of our nation. We created an economic
development program so that the state can act in a quicker response to
existing industries and industries that want to move here. So we can
make it for more infrastructure so that when the companies want to move
here and the companies that are here, they can expand more quickly
putting more North Carolinians back to work. And because our rural
communities are so important in North Carolina, its more than a piedmont
crescent but more of North Carolina so that we launched a new rural
economic development division when the state commerce led by the new
assistant secretary that will focus on approving rural services and
addressing the rural needs to make sure that all North Carolina moves
forward and we invest in this. We also invest 55 million dollars over 2
years in our new rural infrastructure authority to be a streamline and
efficient program that will offer one-stop shopping where our
communities can get support and the resources they need. When we're
looking at our competition in all of the other states, and also other
countries, we've got to make sure that North Carolina is faster and
efficient and effective. And that's one thing we do in North Carolina
well here in some sectors and it's something that we are going to do in
our state government as well. Our budget continues to make sure that we
have the strong investment into agricultural water efficiency and
domestic energy production to make sure that the shell gas expiration in
North Carolina. We're going to put 1.5 million dollars over two years
into agriculture. We're looking at putting money. We have 5 million
dollars going into our research stations so that North Carolina and our
77 billion dollar industry in agriculture can continue to grow, and
thrive and let North Carolina continue to be the leader in agriculture
to make sure that we're using modern farming</p>

My Co-Chair, Senator Rabin, and our wonderful staff for continuing on
the philosophy that we've worked so hard to continue with our philosophy
of taking care of our current infrastructure and completing unfinished
projects.  The total transportation budget is 7.92 billion including
3.16 in revenues and 4.76 billion in federal aid and other receipts.
The Senate budget continues efforts from 2011-2013 biennium to reduce
administration, increase privatization, advance information technology
projects, enhance DMV customer service, and target identified savings,
and other available funds to maintain the highway system.  The Senate
budget also restructures prioritization and funding processes for key
transportation infrastructure by collapsing various funding streams
within the highway trust fund and distributing funds based on state
wide, regional and divisional funding tiers.  We also encourage local
government, financial participation and totaling by awarding bonus
allocations to participants.  We expand the allowable uses of aid to
municipalities.  Allocations include bicycle and pedestrian projects and
prohibit the use of State highway fund or highway trust fund revenues or
bicycle and pedestrian projects.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Senator Brock is recognized for information
technology.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you Mr. President.  If you look at the IT
section of our budget and just the ITS section of the budget but if you
add all the agencies together you are looking at 1.3 billion dollars in
spending on IT in North Carolina and the focus this year and with the
team of Karlynn O'Shaughnessy on staff and the rest of the team, which
was Senator Hise and Senator Tarte, I appreciate working late into the
night with these senators that pulled double duty and especially
Karlynn, and it was a tough task but North Carolina we have to fix what
is broken and with that our IT reserve is 67 million dollars over two
years to improve security areas so we don't have the same issues as
other states where security is breached and improve planning to develop
a strategic plan for statewide architecture but also direct a CIO to
develop an inventory of our server and server locations in the State.
And as we started out this session we saw the problems we have in this
area where a server caught on fire at the Department of Administration
and it was located in a closet.  We cannot operate as a State or a
business when you don't have your IT secured and running as efficient as
possible.  We are working with the new CIO who is doing an outstanding
job and make sure we avoid duplication in our agencies to make sure
we're trying to save as much money as possible.  This effort on IT is to
make sure that we are spending the taxpayers monies wisely to make sure
that we are not duplicating our monies.  A new initiative we have is
GDAC, which is Government Data Analytic Center, which will provide
capability  to analyze data from different sources to support decisions.
 This is what we're doing in business now.  To make sure that when we
put this together we're making the best decisions possible and this will
actually help us in all of our agencies of all the data we are working
to fuse it together.  Also, something new is from the Governors that we
are supporting is the Innovation Center.  It's to work with vendors to
make sure that the new products, new things that we have that are being
developed that we can test them out, try them and how that can help our
agencies and help us deliver services to the people of North Carolina.
We have a lot of projects we've got to work on.  We are way behind the
curve.  Years and years behind the curve of where we need to be on IT,
and again, if we're going to be efficient and effective, we've got to
work on these issues with all our agencies.  Make sure that these new
systems will deliver efficient and effective services to the people of
North Carolina.  Thank you Mr. President.

SPEAKER CHANGES:  Thank you Mr. President, members of the Senate.  This
amendment presents a real clear and stark choice for us.  It's how are
we going to spend more than three-quarters-of-a-billion dollars, 770
million dollars?  Are we going to spend it on tax breaks for the
wealthiest among us that would be paid for by increasing the tax burden
on middle class and working families?</p>

and by cutting critical public services like education and economic
development. The budget that is before us today, proposes to cut pay for
that three quarters of a billion dollar tax break for the wealthy, by
doing the following things. Firing 4800 teacher assistants in grades 2,
3, 3 - nearly 5000 TA's. Senator Berger has money in here to try to
increase the reading performance of our young children by the end of
third grade. I'd like to understand how firing 5000 TA's is going to get
us toward that goal. At the same time it raises class size, but
permanently eliminates approximately 4500 teacher positions. It
eliminates the North Carolina Center on the Advancement on Teaching,
which provides professional development for teachers. It permanently
eliminates 275 student counselors, school counselors, media specialists
and other instructional support. That's what it does at K-12. It also
pays for this tax break for the wealthy by raising tuition on every
community college student, by a total of 20 million dollars over the
biennium. It fails to restore $63 million in cuts that we imposed on the
community college system at the height of the recession. It imposes in
additional $123 million in unspecified cuts to the university system, on
the back of $414 million in unspecified cuts that were in last sessions
budget that you all pushed. Senator told me to say that it fully funds
enrollment growth at our universities, when we're taking $123 million on
top of $414 million out of the universities, I think is a hollow claim.
This budget cuts financial aid for 8400 students, who get it today,
making access to higher education that much more difficult at precisely
the time we need to be having more educated work force, not less. This
budget cuts thousands of pre-K slots and jeopardizes the future of Smart
Start, which is an award winning nationally acclaimed program that not
only educates young children, but establishes the infrastructure for
high quality pre-kindergarten education all across the state. It
eliminates fundings for proven non-profit economic development
organizations, it leverages public money with private resources to
create jobs and economic activity in low-income communities all across
the state, particularly focused in the rural parts of our state. 100% of
the Rural Center budget gone. 50% of the Biotech Center budget gone.
100% of the Community Development Initiative gone. 100% of the Institute
for Minority Economic Development budget gone. There are many others as
well. This amendment that's before you addresses this fundamental error
in judgement. As you can see it does the following things. It restores
funding for all 4800 teacher assistants. It adds back 1100 teachers in
the first year and 4500 teachers in the second year. It adds back 160
educational support personnel in our public schools. It continues
funding of the North Carolina Center for the Advancement of teaching,
which was completely eliminated, and serves to offer professional
development for our educators. During the recession our LEAs had to make
a lot of tough choices with the budget. We know that there are 11,000
fewer positions in our K-12 schools today than there were at the
beginning of the recession. At the same time the number of students that
are in our K-12 schools have exploded. We can't fix all that and
probably shouldn't fix all of it, but the standard shouldn't be 'when I
drive by a school I see kids walking in and out of that school every
day.' The standard should be, 'what are we doing to improve the quality
of our education for our children by having the right number of
teachers, support personnel, and teacher assistants so that our kids are
actually learning in school.' This amendment eliminates entirely the
tuition increase on community college students so that education remains
as affordable as possible. It restores $20 million in unspecified cuts
to the community colleges. It restores need-based financial aid for</p>

Students at our University system.  It also restores
thirty-six-and-a-half million of the unspecified cuts that you all are
imposing on our University system, which, by the way are among the best
economic drivers we have for creating jobs in economic stimulus in North
Carolina.  It increases funding for Smart Start by 15 million dollars,
which would increase by 1,000 the number of slots of high quality,
pre-kindergarten opportunities for young people across the State.  It
restores cuts to the economic developments groups in the second year
fully funding the Biotech Center.  Bring the recession two sectors
encounter job growth in North Carolina, Biotech and Cleantech.  Why you
all would cut in half the support for an organization that is helping to
create North Carolina to be about the third best node of Biotech in the
entire country behind San Francisco and Boston is beyond me.  It
restores funding for the rural centers and the other rural economic
groups that I mentioned earlier.  Budgets are about priorities and this
budget shines a bright spotlight on your misguided priorities because
your proposal to cut three-quarters-of-a-billion dollars in tax breaks
of the wealthiest among us at the expense of educating our children and
growing our economy it makes no sense at all.  You do not have to fire
thousands of teacher assistants.  You do not have to raise class size.
You do not have to eliminate 5,000 teacher positions.  You do not have
to eliminate education support personnel.  You do not have to raise
tuition on community college students.  You do not have to cut need
based financial aide.  You do not have to eliminate proven economic
development organizations in this State.  This opportunity allows you to
correct that mistake.  I encourage you to support this amendment.  Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Senator Rucho what's the purpose of your rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Senator Rucho has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  It's always great to hear Senator Stein stand up and
make one of these impassioned speech and it reminds me of Disneyland
where none of it's true and none of it's real.  He talks about the fact
that the enrollment is leaping up and up and all the things that ever go
up insofar as education enrollment is what's guesstimated.  The results
for the past five years have all been flat.  But lets talk about things
Senator Stein and his friends seem to be touting all the time.  You look
at it and he says how wonderful things were.  We've got this brand new
car that thanks to Senator Stein and his friends they were able to give
us over the last number of years and yet he says well, lets have this
brand new car.  We're going to fill up this car with high test gasoline
and what he forgets to do is put four tires on it because it basically
does nothing.  You sit her and listen to what he's talking about and how
he's going to save the world, let's talk about some of his successes.
Oh, gracious, let's talk about income.  Since 1997, North Carolina,
under his tax and spend policies, which I have to tell you are
considerably failed.  Talk about the fact that income is declining since
1997 in whether you talk about per capita income or you talk about net
household income, and you know what that means ladies and gentleman,
that means thanks to Senator Stein and his friends everybody's paychecks
have gotten less.  Not only because of the environment of work but more
importantly because of their tax and spend policy because they take the
money from the people, hard working people, so they can use it on some
of Senator Stein's projects.  Let's also talk about the fact that his
policy, something that he professes in all of these great programs and
government assistance where he wants to make everybody dependent upon
government.  He wants to have a system where everybody is going to be
taken care of by government.  Don't worry you don't have to do anything
and evidence is clear folks will get government assistance.  They're
eligible for government assistance.  There is no incentive to be out
there working.  What Senator Stein forgets to understand very clearly is
the fact that the best way out of poverty is a job.  His system has
delivered no jobs.  Our system has provided jobs, at least 179,000 since
July of 2011 and he keeps complaining about what we're doing.  Let's
really take a look at that.  Another factor that Senator Stein has he
talks about all the great things, all the jobs that he's going to create
with an education.  Well it's great to have an education.  Most of us
here are educated.  Most of us are trying to - you look at the education
system</p>

rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak to the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Parmon has the floor to speak to the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. What I would say to my colleagues is that I am a
member of the Education Appropriation Committee and if I had had an
opportunity to participate in the budget process, I would have fought
for those things that’s in Senator Stein’s budget – I mean amendment –
and I want to thank him for bringing those before. I did not have the
opportunity on behalf of my constituents to fight for these, and I would
ask you to support the amendment on that basis. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the
question before the Senate is the passage of Amendment 1. All in favor
vote aye. Opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the
voting. Clerk will record the vote. 18 having voted in the affirmative
and 32 in the negative, Amendment 1 fails. The bill, un-amended, is back
before the body. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Send
forth an amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick, you can send
forward your amendment. Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
McKissick moves to amend the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick
is recognized to explain the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This amendment
is pretty straight forward. First what is recognizes is the fact that
what’s embedded in this budget is simply an opportunity to provide tax
base to the wealthiest of our citizens here in North Carolina, and it’s
been contemplated we’re going to be increasing sales taxes, and it’s
doing it at the price of sacrificing economic development that’s
absolutely crucial to job creation, particularly in our rural areas, and
if you’ll look at our rural areas, they are suffering today. They have
higher than average unemployment rates, the opportunities for them to
expand their tax bases is very challenging for them in these difficult
economic times, coming out of a recession, and those factors very, very
deeply concern me. What this amendment does is several things. First it
looks at the funds that will be coming into Golden Leaf. Of course, we
all know that when golden Leaf was established, it was to assist those
economies, particularly in our rural areas, that were dependent on
tobacco as their economic mainstream. Those that were employed in the
fields, those that were growers, those that were being displaced tobacco
workers. So in many respects that was what the master settlement was all
about, and what we’re doing today and what’s proposed in this budget is
to take the funds that’s not coming from government money – it’s coming
from the cigarette manufacturers, and rather than dedicating it as it
was always intended, to go to those tobacco-dependent economies in those
rural areas of our state, it’s absolutely establishing a permanent
roadblock – a roadblock that will be a part of our law, that diverts the
purpose of the very funds that the tobacco settlement was all about.
What this amendment does, it takes those funds that are coming in, and
what we’re looking at in terms of their totality, it’s roughly about 137
and a half million dollars, and it basically takes 68 million 750
thousand, and it goes back to Golden Leaf. It also takes the remainder
of it and goes into that special trust fund that was originally
established. And what do we do with those funds? Once they are
reapportioned in a way that’s fair, that’s reasonable, that’s equable,
that’s consistent with the original master settlement, we put it where
it deserves to be to assist those rural areas in our state, those
tobacco-dependent economies, in helping them to rebuild the
opportunities which they have lost. How does it do so? It goes back and
it helps the Rural Economic Development Center, an institution which has
impeccable integrity in terms of assisting our state, and particularly
in the rural areas. If we go back to what they have done in recent
years, just between 2007 and 2012 they created over 19,911 jobs. They’ve
assisted communities with water and sewer projects, done over 518
grants, 149 million awarded, 557 million leveraged, 504,101 customers
served. In terms of job-creating infrastructure, they’ve gone in and
done 110 grants, 38 million awarded, 122 million leveraged, 134 new and
expanded businesses, 6,361 jobs.</p>

<p id="060:00">
I could go on and on in terms of what they’ve done in terms of housing.
279 grants, $41 million awarded, $544 million leveraged. They are doing
enormous work to help those tobacco dependent economies, to help rural
portions of our state that need a helping hand to provide the water and
sewer infrastructure, to provide the opportunities for job creation, to
help those individuals that are suffering today in a very profound and
significant way. It also looks at other opportunities for Golden Leaf.
What is Golden Leaf? What have they done? Well, in 2010, there 20
economic development grants which generated 4709 jobs, grand total of
about $16.4 million. Golden Leaf is doing a remarkable job. Golden Leaf
has an established track record. Golden Leaf is making a difference in
the lives of many in our state. That is the sort of thing that we should
be doing. Of course, all of this is being paid for. How? On the backs of
the hard working people of this state who are now...what are they going
to be doing? They’re going to be paying more taxes in sales tax dollars.
The wealthiest of this state are the  only ones who are going to be
getting the tax breaks. The wealthiest. Golden Leaf is the type of
institution that’s out there that’s create 48,000 jobs. $2.9 million
private investment. We also restore funding to a number of non-profits
that are out there. There’s a group of entities known as...or what we
affectionately refer to as the minority economic development package.
Why are they important? For one reason, and one very significant reason.
Many of them are helping minorities throughout this state who are
disproportionately impacted by this recession, who in every set of
statistics that you read and that you observe are showing higher than
average unemployment rates. Those funds going into the Community
Development Initiative, the Institute for Minority Economic Development,
Land Lost Prevention, North Carolina Associated Community of Developers,
as well as those that are not just looking at minority types issues,
such as the North Carolina Farm Bureau and their Ag in the classroom.
The North Carolina Indian Economic Development Initiative. The Regional
Economic Development Commissions. The Support Center. It restores their
funding. It restores funding for the biotechnology center.
One thing we know is that we’ve invested wisely in biotechnology in this
state and it’s producing substantial benefits in terms of job creation
in additional investments by the private sector. We fully fund the
cancer research center, because it deserves to be funded. Most of the
lives of you in this room will be touched by somebody who has cancer.
There’s no reason we should be backing away from that commitment that we
have made as a state. That’s a mistake. That’s not the direction that we
should be moving. We should not retreat.
For all these initiatives that I’ve spoken of, all those about job
creation, all those that are incentivizing private investment, all those
that are creating economic benefits for many, jobs. We need to be doing
it. Not providing benefits for the wealthiest in this state. That’s not
what it’s about. So with that, I offer you this amendment, because it’s
the amendment that will establish that moral compass. It’s the amendment
that will help us recommit our resources as a state, recommit our
efforts to restart this economy, recommit our efforts to help those that
are least of us that are having the most difficult and challenging
times, overcoming the impact of this long-term recession that we’ve all
experienced. It will help us to renew our commitment to helping those
that need a hand. We took the oath of office, that’s one of the
obligations that we took. When we came here as legislators to debate and
to look at our budget and to help establish priorities, we should be
committed to making certain that our solutions, our budgets are fair.
That they’re equitable, and that they do, in fact, help this economy to
restore the types of jobs that we need when so many people are
suffering.

<p id="065:00">
The economic development non-profits that are a part of this amendment.
For 26 years, the rule center [?] has provided a phenomenal service
throughout this state, and are the gold standard for water and sewer
development-- not only in North Carolina, but nationally. The minority
economic development non-profits have developed over 20 years of
expertise in delivering our phenomenal economic development services to
the most distressed areas where private developers and local governments
dare not trod. This public/private partnership of the minority economic
development groups, have provided over 11,000 jobs and generated $600
million to aid community development and housing development and help
over 50,000 North Carolinians become more financially secure. And what
are we doing? We're replacing this public/private partnership with two
or three more government agencies that will be stretching across this
state, at a time when, I thought, limited government was in, and
public/private partnerships were also an important part of that
strategy.
To fund your tax cut, you have eliminated almost 10 million dollars a
year in the CDBG grant for scattered-site housing, and small business,
entrepreneur development. These funds are specifically targeted for
working families in the 97 counties of this state that do not receive
federal funds directly in CDBG grants. They now will no longer have this
source for scattered-site housing for their most blighted areas and
where they have the most urgent emergency needs for community
development. In addition to that, you've cut $800,000 per year in the
[??] and I'm rounding; it's probably closer to nine, to the housing
trust fund. Some say, &quot;Well, the rule center will have 100 million
dollars left,&quot; but you know when you say that, that this $100
million is already committed in grants and loans that have been
obligated, and it will only be available as those loans are repaid.
So, by putting our regional staff in the rural areas is admirable, and I
understand that strategy, and can support that strategy-- what it
doesn't do is help build the capacity of these rural areas and small
towns to develop the economic development projects that you are able to
fund with the remaining monies that are left. The local boards in these
small towns that turn over quite frequently, with the fast aging of the
communities in our small towns and rural areas, and the emerging young
leaders that need to be developed. We need the mediating support--
institutions that these private/public partnerships provide to help
prepare these very communities that need the most help to participate in
the economic development activities. To fund your tax cuts, and because
you won't listen to us, and you won't hear us, and you won't open your
eyes to see what we need in these rural areas, you are emasculating
rural North Carolina and cutting us off from government by imposing what
you think we need, rather than what we are telling you we need and
opening your eyes to see what has worked and to open your eyes to see
what the real needs are. You cannot help people by imposing on them help
that doesn't help. This is offering them the help that will work. For
that reason I ask you to support this amendment. Thank you.

Well, my understanding of reviewing the proposals..we don't know the
details, would love to know the details, but for what I have been, have
seen in the proposals that have been put out in the press and what's
been available from staff and from staff have put out from other
sources, most of the benefit would be to those who are wealthy including
estate tax cuts, elimination, etc. So that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And where is the follow up, where's that in here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant do you yield for a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's not in this book. That is where, we are happen to make-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would like to finish my response Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator finish your response.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We're, without any information on what your tax proposal exactly is.
We're having to make the best sense out of it we can based on the
information available. Everything that is available from the Senate and
the House or what and what you're saying, your speeches and press
releases.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, follow up, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, follow up question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm confused Senator, where is the House budget in here. Where are we
talking about the House tax cut.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was just speaking  in general, assuming that you are aware, assuming
you all confer and collaborate on some level on these finance package
tax proposals. I was just splitting the odds between the varying
proposals, that's all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President speak on the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca ?? to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I feel like Alice in Wonderland. I mean we have all these accusations
coming down about tax cuts for the rich, this does this, we got the
House budget built in here. We heard the talking points of the Middle
Class and the rich, ba ba ba ba, you know, let's stick to the facts we
have in front of us. Let's vote against this amendment, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown for what purpose do you rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown has the floor to speak of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
First of all, Senator McKissick on your amendment you talked about
Golden Leaf, and you talked about the rural center and I think Senator
Bryant talked about the economic development partnerships. And what they
mean to rural North Carolina, and what will be lost with some of these
?? First of all we captured the Golden Leaf's money for this particular
year, but what you didn't say is Golden Leaf has 700 million dollar fund
balance at this point. So they have 700 millio9n dollars, it's in their
fund balance, that they could have out in the community, but they've
decided to hold on to those dollars. So I guess one question I'd have to
ask is what do you think they should have, a billion dollars, 2 billion
dollars? What kind of fund balance do you think maybe they should have?
Then we talk about the rural center. The rural centers got 100 million
dollars, or over 100 million dollar fund balance, so again, is it 200
million, 300 million? What kind of fund balance should we let them have
instead of getting those dollars out into rural North Carolina? In our
budget plan we try to streamline the process to get dollars out to rural
North Carolina. We actually spend more money for rural North Carolina in
our budget. And you try to defend the status quo about rural North
Carolina so I thought I would give Senator Bryant in particular, I
thought I would look at some numbers and Nash County's got 11.8%
unemployment. Wilson County is 12.2% unemployment. Let's just touch a
couple other rural counties. Mitchell County, 13.7%, Avery County is
12.3%, Cherokee County is 12.2
&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

<p id="075:00">
Grand County 17.8, Swayne is 16.7, Rutherford 12.6, Robson Country 12.3,
Scotland 16.1, so I guess our process is that we are doing now is that
we are doing a great job for rural North Carolina. We have really
affected unemployment in those counties, haven't we, with what we are
doing today. I think it's time we look at some new ideas on how we
attack these figures in rural North Carolina and come up with a new
process, that streamlines that process and gets those dollars to rural
North Carolina, to benefit those counties. And that's exactly what this
budget does. It creates a new rural economic development division within
commerce that focuses some dollars on rural North Carolina, and it also
creates a new rural infrastructure authority which streamlines what
dollars can be used for. Right now the rural center has expander what
their dollars can be used for just like ?? leaf has. I don't think
anybody can tell me anymore exactly what those dollars can be used for,
because they continue to expand them, and expand them, and expand them,
and I don't think they are helping rural North Carolina any more in a
lot of ways. So we have tried to streamline a process, make it better,
to get those dollars to those rural counties that truly do need help.
I've got one, Jones County, I've got a rural county, I'll understand
this issue as well as anybody. And I think that when I talk about these
unemployment numbers, it's pretty obvious to me that that what we're
doing today surely is working. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr President [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Cook, for what purpose do you rise [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
correct an error. I voted the wrong way in the last Amendment, I didn't
mean to encourage the class warfare propaganda, I should have voted no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Change Senator Cook's vote to 'No' on last. 1733 is
the final number. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
speak on the Amendment [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt has the floor
to speak on the Amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President,
and members of the Senate. I'm pleased to hear that the tax plan that
was rolled out by Senator Rucho and Senator Berger at a press conference
is not the tax plan and that you have all abandoned that, that's the one
we are talking about, it was analysed by people all over the state of
North Carolina and I think editorialised by every paper in the state
that is was a - I called it the largest tax increase on the working
people and the middle class in the history of the state and I think
people pretty well agree with that. It took about six billion dollars of
the high earners and it put about five billion - [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President [People talking over each other][SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, if
you agree [SPEAKER CHANGES] Are we talking about the appropriations act
or are we talking about the phantom tax package that's not contained in
here? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sorry, Mr.
President, I'm talking about that phantom tax package that shows up on
line 26 of the budget document as a reserve of 770 million dollars over
two years - [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President [SPEAKER CHANGES] And its
phantom because nobody's ever produced a bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Bryant, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? of order
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Byrant. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Are we not on
Amendment number two? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We are, Senator. Senator Nesbitt
if you will just keep your comments for Amendment two please. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Amendment number two takes this money to fund these programs,
and senator Senator Apodaca spoke to it also, Mr. President. That's the
Disneyland, that's the Alice in Wonderland, we've gotten into a
situation down here where people hold a press conference, say what they
want to say and don't produce a bill. The governor had a transportation
plan he, he made a speech that send somebody to get the detail - there
was none. There was no handout. ?? seen anything. We had a press
conference about a tax shift in this state that was six billion or five
billion on with no bill, so we got to assume that's the only thing we've
seen, now if you've got a new tax package that takes care of the middle
class and working people, tell us about it. But your reserving the money
to do, I would assume, what you've said your gonna do, and you want to
keep blaming everything in this budget on medi??, the problem with this
budget is you start out and and take 770 million dollars in tax break -</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I've lived that the last eleven years.  It's line 26
called finance package minus 217 million the first year minus 553

cutting.  Thank you Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Senator Bryant what is the purpose for your rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I just want to speak a second time on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Senator Bryant has the floor to speak a second time
to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  And I want to say in all due respects to Senator
Brown, who has been very nice, and I agree with a lot of what he is
proposing to do, but in this rural economic development piece he knows
we disagree on the approach and that is that we are putting some money
in this rural new economic development authority again creating a new
government agency.  It's got to start from scratch.  No relationships,
no track record, no nothing to serve the most needed areas of our State
at the most critical time in our economic recovery.  I would also add
that those numbers you read in the areas of my State would have been
worse had it not been for the organizations that we are talking about
today, and I was not talking about the partnerships as much as I was
talking about the minority economic development organizations and I
wanted to make that point and back to the hundred million dollars for
the rural center you know and they have provided documentation and those
funds are already obligated in existing grants and loans.  Thank you
very much Mr. President and members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Senator Stein for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Point of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Senator Stein you have the floor for a Point of

[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I use this as a point to Senator Apodaca.  I used my
computer, I went to NCtaxcut.com and there's a great video of the
President of ?? Burger.  That's the tax cut that we've been referring
to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Senator Apodaca.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Inquiry of the Chair.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Are we talking about videos on the computer or are
we talking about the State budget.  I can go on the Internet and find
videos about a lot of things.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Senators we're getting a little out of hand here.
Lets keep our comments to the budget.  Lets keep our comments to the
amendment at hand please.  Senator McKissick what is the purpose for
your rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Senator McKissick has the floor to speak on the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  One thing I can say, and I think it is very
transparent, we can all agree upon some of this data and information, is
that the rural center has done an amazing and effective job.  You cannot
do what they have done, and I spoke earlier in specifics about water and
sewer projects since 2007 518 grants, 145 million awarded, 557 million
leverage, 504 thousand people served.  You cannot do that the way it's
proposed in this budget all for 4 million dollars.  The numbers just
don't work, but yet that's what is being put in as a substitute of the
rural center to provide some rural infrastructure grants.  You can't
serve 504 thousand people, you can't make 145 million in grants on 4
million.  It's a pitiful substitute.  Talk about Golden Leaf, well, they
set up something called Little Tobacco Trust Fund Entity and it's 2
million.  Well, Golden Leaf should have had 68 million.  What happened
to the other million?  If you subtract that 2 million from the 68
million it leaves you with 66 million dollars.  It would certainly
appear that if that's going to the general fund, if that indeed is
embedded in these lines which I see in the budget in page 5 where you
talk about the finance package hoping  217 million 100 thousand dollars
in year 1 of the biennium and 553 million in year two of the biennium.
If you look at those numbers and you take that 66 million and it's going</p>

[Speaker Changes] You know guys and ladies, we've had a lot of
discussion here this afternoon. And I come from Robeson County,
Fairmont. A town of 1900 folks with thirteen [??Debauket] warehouses.
And there were a lot of rich people in that town, Senator Goolsby. And
we're proud of our heritage and we worked hard for what we had. And our
Master Settlement Agreement is not taxpayer money. That belongs to
[??Debauket] dependent counties and the communities of North Carolina.
It does not belong in the general fund. And we were getting off
messages, Senator Rucho you turn around, I've been glad that you're for
question. But this belongs to [??Debauket] dependent counties and the
citizens of North Carolina that were affected, and not the general fund
of North Carolina.
[Speaker Changes] Mister President.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Brunstetter, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes] To speak to the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Brunstetter has the floor to speak to the
amendment.
[Speaker Changes] I think it's time this bill's sponsored a way in.
Mister President, I told you when you got here there'd be days like
this, didn't I.
[Speaker Changes] [laughs] You did.
[Speaker Changes] Members, I appreciate Senator McKissick bringing the
amendment, but I would ask you to oppose the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the
question before the Senate is the passage of Amendment 2. All in favor
vote I, opposed vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for voting. The
Clerk will record the vote. Seventeen having voted in the affirmative
and thirty three in the negative, Amendment 2 fails. The Bill, unamended
is back before the body.
[Speaker Changes] Mister President.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Nesbitt, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes] Send forth an amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Senator, you can send forth your amendment. The Clerk
will read.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Nesbitt moves to amend the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Nesbitt's recognized to explain the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you, Mister President. And members of the
Senate, I bring you an amendment to actually create money and do a lot
of good things for people while you do it. In essence, the amendment
would go ahead and pick up the expansion of Medicaid. And interestingly
enough, when I started looking at this, there's a net gain to the
general fund of about 72 million dollars - it generates 93 million,
costs 25. The rest of that money's available to the general fund and
y'all can spend it or give tax cuts with it or whatever else you want
to. In essence, this would actually generate 250 million over the next
ten years, it would insure 563,000 people, create 23,000 jobs, Senator
Rucho, sales taxes, income taxes, and the list goes on. And I bring this
to you because it's 100 percent federally funded for the first three
years, it generates income to the state, it helps these rural counties
where they have an abnormally high percentage of people that are
uninsured - you've gotten letters from the Hospital Association telling
you that - and it will help bring our economy back. We need jobs
desperately in this state and we're sitting here ignoring 23,000 good
paying jobs in the healthcare field large and with a disproportionate
share to the rural areas.
I pitch that out there to you because I think it's the right time and
the right place to do that. I would say to you, I know there will be
some question about the management of Medicaid. And nobody's mentioned
this, but I can remember two years ago, when Sector [??] wrote a letter,
it was read on the floor during the budget, that you would have a
shortfall in Medicaid if you passed the budget that you were fixing to
pass. That there was no way DHHS could make that budget. And they
didn't. And the problem with Medicaid is not Medicaid. The problem is
your ability to properly budget. And to listen to the input you get from
the people that are having to manage the [??].</p>

<p id="095:00">
So I urge you to do this. I think it is a, it’s, it’s good. Straight to
the point. It generates an exter $68,000,000 for your budget or once
again tax cuts. Whatever you’d want to do. And it helps a whole lot of
people in the state of North Carolina. And it helps those rural counties
that are getting killed in the rest of this budget. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak to
the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise has the floor to speak to
the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President, members of the
Senate. We service over 1.2 million people on our Medicaid program in
the state of North Carolina right now. We can’t begin to keep up with
cost overruns, the inability to forecast. And I am beyond confused that
someone can stand up and say the solution to that is to expand it by
50%. Because the Federal Government is so great they always keep their
promises moving forward. This is a shiny object. Look here. Catch it.
For two years we’re funded at 100%. Some of those other cost savings
that are listed/g things we provide for individuals outside the Medicaid
program such as AIDS drug treatment and others that say they can be
picked up under Medicaid if we just expand it. That misses the point you
can pick them up under the exchange as well. So I would adjust some of
those numbers accordingly. But I think we’ve just made a huge mistake
moving forward because it doesn’t end. The Federal Government starts
stepping out of the way. They start stepping out of the way into 95%.
And then 90%. And by 2020, you know that’s not in the law anywhere. And
when they step back to 65%, we have another entitlement program that
just exploded. There is no decision that I think we can make that would
be more detrimental to this future of this state’s budget than to jump
off this cliff for the rest of the country and to dive in. Our job and
our responsibility is to control costs in this program. To speak to
every Congressional member we speak and let them know that the only
solution to this is to get it out of the Federal hands and block grant
it to the state moving forward. But there is no solution here with the
expansion. There’s a sol, there’s an option here that will destroy rural
healthcare and will destroy North Carolina’s budget taking with it our
education and judicial systems and asking the question why haven’t we
spent more? Thank you members. I do ask you to defeat this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? Ask a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise do
you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise,
in number 59G12 I believe in HHS budget the exchange premiums, is it
correct? Am I correct that you are proposing to transfer the coverage of
pregnant women to the health exchange from Medicaid? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The health exchange is not under Medicaid. They are leaving the Medicaid
program. We are reducing from 185 to 133 of the percentages in which
individuals are eligible for pregnant women. And we are exchange moving
them to private insurance. That is correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. And
my, follow up Mr. Chair? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise do you yield?
Yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And with that
transfer of those women to health exchange is there a guarantee while
the state pays their premium, is there a guarantee on the limit of the
out of pocket expenses those women may have to pay? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
There is. [SPEAKER CHANGES] There is? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is a guarantee?
Can you tell me what that is? [SPEAKER CHANGES] If you’ll give just a
minute to look [CROSSTALK] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca for purpose
do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Inquire</p>

Senator, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are we on the amendment, or back to the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is on the amendment, Medicaid, Senator. Go ahead, let him answer
the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Give me a chance to look it up. Under the requirements for the exchange
now set by the federal government by the Affordable Care Act, the
federal government has determined that the out of pocket maximum for an
individual on the exchange from 100% to 200% of the federal poverty
level, which would cover this group, would be $1983 a year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you Senator Hines. And my final question chair, and I'll get
to my point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For Senator Hise? Senator Hise yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can a woman be denied coverage by private insurance if they are referred
to the health exchange?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is my understanding that under the, as the Affordable Care Act was
originally rolled out and promoted to the American people, is that they
could not be denied coverage on that system. Now if that's changed, that
would be congress' choice and the President's, not ours.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson has the floor, speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of this August body, while we all are, or you're looking at
Medicaid, and who you aught to transfer out, I realize that low income
people and pregnant women are not a priority to this body. However they
are citizens of this state, and as we talk about who aught to be
transferred off if it saves you four million dollars according to this
budget, out of that large amount, of whatever you want to call the Santa
Claus amount, then should women be denied access to coverage knowing
that a private insurer may not cover the other kinds of conditions. We
know for a fact that women who have smoking problems can be denied some
types of services. And so what we do with this kind of amendment, I mean
this kind of bill, and what the amendment would protect, is that these
women, who don't have money to pay out of pocket, who can not afford
even a thousand dollars, will not have health coverage, so when the
babies are born, they will go without coverage, their children may add
to the infant mortality rate that you have seen drop in this state. And
so what we do, is we penalize the poor. We penalize the poor, regardless
of what you say, to support people that are at the higher income levels
of this state. I support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise, repurpose your aye's.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson, question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No I won't.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Miss present.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, for purpose your aye's
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I ask Senator Robinson a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Out of respect I will Senator Apodaca, but if you tell me to get up in a
hurry like you told Senator Brown, I'll sit down.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, let's keep it going please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This serious question just dawned on me. Now you're talking about women,
who we all love. My mother's a woman, we all love women. We don't
necessarily fight women here. But you mention that someone might be
turned down for smoking. And it just dawned on me, that your seat mate
was saying, golden leaf should go only to tobacco farmers. Well wouldn't
this be a good medical purpose for golden leaf to participate in?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, are you asking me about the amendment, are you asking
me about golden leaf? I'm not the expert on golden leaf.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well you were talking about, follow up Mr. President? I was just going
with your discussion about how someone could be turned down for smoking,
for medical benefits, and I thought this might be a good tie in for a
program to help those folks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well one good tie in Senator, Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One good tie in would be that the funding that was previously available
from those funds to support health issues would continue, and that would
address smoking cessation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rogers, repurpose your aye's.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rogers has the floor, speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I recall correctly, I said the money should go to tobacco dependent
counties, not to tobacco farmers. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion today?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brunstetter, repurpose your aye's.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brunstetter has the floor, speak to the amendment.

Thank you Mr. President.</p>

I thought Senator Nesbitt's comment about appropriately budgeting for
Medicaid was well taken; it's lessons we all need to learn. I remember
that the two years prior to the last biennium, two of the largest
bailouts in Medicaid history were in this state, and Senator Nesbitt and
I, one of the things that we have done, in trying to tackle this
Medicaid problem, is to take partisan politics out of it and just deal
with the mechanics of it.
To that end, you remember that last year, when we did the budget, we
actually allocated in this body $170 million more than requested by the
previous administration to cover Medicaid. So I don't think that anybody
here is trying to minimize the impact of Medicaid. What we're trying to
do is figure out to manage it. You couldn't manage it; we're having a
heck of a time managing it too.
The test way we're going to try to get that solved is to not play
politics with it. With all that being said, I would ask Members to
oppose this amendment.
The President Pro Tempore: Is there any further discussion or debate?
Hearing none, the question before the Senate is the question on the
amendment number 3. All in favor vote aye; opposed vote no. Five seconds
will be allowed for the voting. The Clerk will record the vote. 17
having voted in the affirmative and 33 in the negative, the amendment 3
fails, the bill is back before the body.
Mr. President.
Senator Woodard, for what purpose do you rise?
Sen. Woodard: To send forward an amendment.
The President Pro Tempore: Senator, you can send forward your amendment.
The Clerk will read.
Clerk: Senator Woodard moves to amend the bill.
The President Pro Tempore: Senator Woodard is recognized.
Sen. Woodard: Thank you, Mr. President.
Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, this is a straightforward amendment
that places a strong and firm action of limited government into this
bill. It takes three specific action. First, it prohibits people from
registering as lobbyists if they are spouse of one of the state's
elected or appointed public servants as outlined in GS-138a.
Second, it prohibits the senior public servants in GS-138a from having
their names placed in the title of any business. And third, it prohibits
secondary employment by members of the council of state, members of the
principal state departments, and deputy secretaries.
This is a good-government amendment. The intent and the outcome of this
amendment is to assure the voters and taxpayers of North Carolina that
their public servants will not be unduly influenced by professional
associations and personal access. I commend it to you and respectfully
ask for your support.
Mr. President.
The President Pro Tempore: Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you
rise?
Sen. Apodaca: To speak on the amendment.
The President Pro Tempore: The senator has the floor.
Sen. Apodaca: My, my, my, we can pick up the newspaper and make things
personal. This is just pretty low. I don't know much more to say about
it. With that being said, I move that the amendment be laid upon the
table.
Mr. President.
The President Pro Tempore: For what purpose do you rise?
To second the motion.
The President Pro Tempore: The second is to lay on the table. We have
one electronic vote, to lay upon the table. All in favor will vote aye;
opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. The
Clerk will record the vote. 31 having voted in the affirmative and 17 in
the negative, the motion passes; amendment 4 lays upon the table.
Mr. President, Mr. President.
The President Pro Tempore: Senator Nesbitt, for what purpose do you
rise?
Sen. Nesbitt: For a point of order.
The President Pro Tempore: Senator Nesbitt has the floor for a point of
order.
Sen. Nesbitt: Thank you, Mr. President, and I know the tabling motion's
non-debatable, so I didn't want to get up in the middle of that, but
once again I would ask the President to observe the decorum. I don't
think it's appropriate to start slurring other Member's rights to get up
in this body and argue points and offer amendments, and calling them low
is as if, I don't know, there are words words than that, I guess.
The President Pro Tempore: Thank you senator, I'll take that into
consideration.
Mr. President.
The President Pro Tempore: Senator Warren, for what purpose do you rise?
Sen. Warren: To offer an amendment.
The President Pro Tempore: Senator, you may put forward your amendment.
Sen. Warren: Thank you.
The President Pro Tempore: The Clerk will read.
Clerk: Senator Warren moves to amend the bill.
The President Pro Tempore: Senator Warren is recognized to explain the
amendment.
Sen. Warren: Thank you, Mr. President.
Members of the Senate, Senator Apodaca, and Senator Nesbitt. I think I'm
going to be able to get through this amendment without mentioning a
specific amount of money or where it came from, but it does follow along
the lines that Senator Woodard brought forward about good government.
We've heard a lot about government efficiency, we've heard a lot about
government reform. I want to follow that up with what I think we all
could agree, that our citizens deserve a state government that is a...</p>

accountable. A state government they can have confidence in and one that
focuses on accountability of taxpayer dollars with proper oversight. My
amendment speaks to the proposed transfer of the state bureau of
investigation to the governor's department of public safety. There's no
justification nor cost saving that would result from this transfer.
Earlier this week, the North Carolina sheriff's association as well as
the North Carolina Police Chief's association spoke out against this
transfer. I've heard from district attorney's in the state who oppose
this transfer. There is a significant government accountability issue
here. Having the Attorney General over the SBI creates a check and
balance system with other law enforcement agencies as they investigate
corruption, murder, robberies, and many other heinous crimes in our
state. The SBI has a track record of helping District Attorneys
prosecute and convict violent criminals and even prosecute elected
officials and other public officials who have betrayed public trust.
While serving as mayor for 15 years in my hometown, I've seen first
hand, the professionalism and independence of the SBI. The key here is
this: The public needs to have confidence that there is an independent
agency not state police that's under the political control of the
executive branch to investigate these criminal cases. For over 75 years,
the governors of both parties SBI investigations have been independent
of the executive branch. This transfer is not good for NC, it's not good
for law enforcement, especially in our rural communities and it's not a
good message for us to send folks at home. Even Governor McCoy yesterday
said that he does not want the SBI under his supervision saying, and I
quote, &quot;I never asked for it and I've got enough on my plate.&quot;
He also quoted as saying &quot; I haven't seen the argument yet
presented to me why that needs to be done.&quot; I agree with the
governor. This ?? Bill, if it has merit, needs to be studied and
reviewed. I urge you to support the amendment which simply says no
transfer of the SBI to a department of public safety. Thank you, I urge
your support.
[speaker changes]
Sen Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[speaker changes]
Mr. President, I want to be careful here and not try to offend anybody.
I was reviewing the Bill and I had found a grammatical error. I'd like
to send forth a substitute amendment.
[speaker changes]
Sen Apodaca can send forward your substitute amendment. Clerk will read.
[speaker changes]
Sen Apodaca moves to amend the bill.
[speaker changes]
Sen Apodaca is recognized.
[speaker changes]
You got it up? This amendment merely makes a technical correction to the
effective date and the quote marks were left out when it was printed. We
need to put those in so it will be grammatically correct. I ask for your
support. Mr. President.
[speaker changes]
Senator Nesbitt, for what purpose do you rise?
[speaker changes]
To speak on the amendment and to make a motion.
[speaker changes]
Senator Nesbitt has the floor to speak on the substitute amendment.
[speaker changes]
Thank you Mr. President. This amendment, as you all know, has the effect
of killing the underlying amendment. An amendment which gives you that
want to vote for this budget, an opportunity to get this out of it. This
is bad government, and you're going against your own governor and
everybody that's looked at this, for what reason, I can't understand.
Nobody wants you to do this. So, I would suggest that you--we'll give
you a chance to vote on it, but you will have had a chance to get this
SBI transferred out of this budget, and that will not be excused when
you go home. And with that Mr. President, I'd like to move that the
amendment do life on the table.

Mr. President reminded the story as in different forms but one when I
hear some of the justification for this current budget that reminds me
of a fellow who burn down his house and then complaint that he was
homeless. The justification for getting so much of that of what the
state has done about and what is made attractive it holds on water it’s
an empty reason by blaming the expenditure of the additional funds
available in this cycle, the budget on medicate expenses, creating
expenses in our rural hospitals basically assuring the ___[02:50] feel
or be observed by bigger hospital networks over the next several years
by not participating in meaningful way and medicate expansion but then
cleaning that the current medicating is what creates the problem is what
I call and I think that in some of the debates that we had earlier and
debate is sort of point in pivot that is acknowledge that somebody made
a point but then pivot to talk about what you wanna talk about. In this
case we are not talking about the real reason for not doing for the
people of the state what all be done is exactly that. I have looked and
I have found it strange that we create the availability in the budget,
we have 750 million dollars, 770 million dollars that’s not appropriated
using standard terms of appropriations because it’s not designated
anywhere, probably ___[03:54] of the Executive Budget Act and then say
that you can’t reallocate that 770 million spend on a meaningful way is
pivoting away from the real issue for the educators and there is a
choice, there is ___[04:14] whether we like to have those roughly 10,000
teaching assistance and teachers, whether we have to give teaching
assistance and teachers and people in education and highway patrol or
hardworking state employees paying raises. Now, whether we allowed to
enlarge class sizes, whether we allowed to do what more responsible
business would do and that is eliminate the program that recharges

mturk july 19 NC Senate-1
Is getting greater. The rural center money, the Golden Leaf money, and
nobody mentioned I don't think the Clean Water Management trust money,
which is another fund I think is extremely important to the rural areas
of the smaller counties. Healthcare in smaller counties is getting
pushed tighter. Education cuts for smaller counties. Redirecting, for
instance, the lottery money, where for 10 years the lottery money that
counties have depended on for construction is no longer there. They are
having trouble. I had two counties today that I represent come by and
speak about this specific issue and the fact that they can't raise taxes
in their counties to take care of the school construction that they
need. Education cuts, as I said, and thenwithin transportation, we have
taken a lot of funds that small counties have relied on in areas for
economic development, such as the small ?? fund, access funds, spot
safety money, and put it all in a big pool.
There was one item in the budget that I saw that had to do with the
maintenance report, which has been an annual or biannual report that has
gone out for many years, where the different divisions talk about what
their needs are. In this one now they have got to add a piece that talks
about congestion and traffic counts. This is obviously going to help the
larger counties, the urban counties, more so than it will the smaller
counties. I think it is shortsighted. Industries that would like to come
here are going to have a harder time getting in the larger counties
where land is hard to get. The larger counties have already got good
jobs. The smaller counties are the ones that need it. And I think it's
just another example where this budget does extend and widen the divide
between the haves and have-nots. And I join my friend Sen. Blue in
asking you to vote against the budget. Thank you.
Speaker: Senator Hise, for what purpose do you rise?
Hise: To send forward the amendment.
Speaker: Senator, you can send forward your amendment. The clerk will
read.
Clerk: Senator Hise moves to amend the bill.
Speaker: Senator Hise is recognized to explain the amendment.
Hise: Thank you, Mr. President and members of the Senate. The amendments
that you have in front of you are a two-part amendment. I'll explain the
first two parts. The first one, as the last two members have addressed
some of the issues of rural health care, I think this is another step
forward and is something you will appreciate.
We have variances in our base rates all across the state, based on the
size of the hospital. Our budget currently moves those into four
regional rates. This amendment takes that a step further and will set
one base rate for all hospitals in the state. Our base rates do not
consider that there is an adjustment to that per-patient mix. And then
there is the assessments that come on top of that. But this will be a
significant shift in making sure that more funds are available in rural
areas across the state.
The second part of this plan is something where we are dealing with a
state plan amendment that was submitted without the consultation or
approval of the general assembly nearly 2 years ago. We had sought in
the budget to repeal that amendment. We have since heard from UNC
hospital about some concerns that they have had with doing that. And
this will amend that to allow that state plan amendment to be amended,
but it will now only apply to faculty on their main campus, and not
allow them to expand additional rates out all over the state in coming
forward. So I ask for your support on this amendment.
Speaker: Sen. Nesbitt, for what purpose do you rise?
Nesbitt: Will the gentleman yield to a question?
Speaker: Senator Hise, do you yield?
Hise: I will yield.
Nesbitt: Thank you, Senator Hise. I think all of the members on the
floor have hospitals in their districts. Do you have anything that you
can pass out for us or put on the dashboard or whatever to show us the
impact that it has on our hospitals?
Hise: Mr. President, it can be ?? on the dashboard.
Speaker: Senator, we have that information on the dash. It's coming up
on your dashboard, Senator. Give it one second to refresh. It should be
up now. Senator, does everybody have that information in front of them?
Senator Hise, you are recognized.
Hise: Thank you, Mr. President. As you explained and I know some,
depending on the size of your device, pulling this up, this will show
for every hospital. I believe it's coming up that way right now. I'm
pulling Region 4 only. For other pages, I don't know if it is reading
page by page. I'll have to check.
Speaker: One second, Senator.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson you’re recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. As keepers of the trust of this state, and
responsible for delivering a budget to operate the services for the
state, I think it’s imperative, and I know you agree, that we operate
with transparency and we remain ethical.
Years ago, prior to my coming and many of you, the State Ethics
Commission was established. And in that Establishment, there is required
a statement of economic interest that all of us, including appointees,
have to sign. And in light of recent incidents, issues, whatever the
public can assume, we have to remain above the foray. And so I commend
this amendment to you which would require that failure, and willful
failure to follow, that within 30 days after the due date, and some of
this is already in the statute, a person currently serving as a covet
person who has not completed a statement of economic interest within
that 30 days, shall be subject to a fine as provided in this section.
And in B that fine is $250. And C, failure by any filing person to file
or complete a statement of economic interest within 60 days of the
receipt of the notice, required in subsection A of this section, shall
be deemed a willful failure to file. And not withstanding GS138A-45, the
filing person, 45, the filing person must vacate the person’s office or
position immediately. And that is something that all of you put in
place, and I commend this to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any discussion or debate? Senator Apodaca, for what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, I move that we move Amendment 9 to the
end of the calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection, so ordered. Senator Sanderson, for
what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, to send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Sanderson you can send forth…</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is ALB-69 version 2. Senator Sanderson moves to amend the bill.
Senator Sanderson's recognized to explain his amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. This amendment simply corrects a date that was
on the last amendment. It changes it from June 30, 2013 to August 1st,
2013-- the purpose of this date change is because the discussion that we
had about economic development is very very time sensitive and we need
to see if we can move on this and I ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there discussion and debate. Mr. President. [The purpose of the
&quot;aye&quot;]?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To support the amendment.

Any further discussion or debate? [?] The question for the senate is the
passage of amendment 10: All in favor vote &quot;Aye,&quot; all opposed
vote &quot;No.&quot; Five seconds will be allowed for the voting; the
clerk will record the vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Blue: Aye
Clark [?]: Aye
49 having voted in the affirmative, and 0 in the negative, Amendment 10
is adopted; the bill as amended is back before the body. Senator
Sanderson, for what purpose do you rise?

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Sanderson, you can send forward your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Amendment ALB--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, hold on one seconds, we're-- the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Sanderson moves to amend the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Sanderson is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members: This amendment is an attempt to
correct something that we have in our budget that concerns me deeply.
This is-- and first of all, let me say that I appreciate the work that
Senator Brown and others have done on this bill, this deals with
increasing our boat registration fees to pay for dredging our inlets
down on the coast; I will be the first to admit that our inlets, in
North Carolina, are tremendously important to our economy; they bring in
millions and millions of dollars every year in revenue for the state and
for our local businesses. I also realize that for many many years, the
federal government has helped us with these funds to dredge these
inlets-- that money has ended and the state of North Carolina has to
take up the-- to do those inlets. This amendment-- Senator Brown, in his
budget, has put forth an increase in our boat registration fees to help
cover the cost of this dredging, along with some money from other
sources-- this is currently in the budget as a two-tiered level for
boats under 26 ft; the increase is 10 dollars; and fifteen to
twenty-five dollars for boats over 26 feet-- for boats 26 feet and
over-- this is an increase from fifteen to fifty dollars. This amendment
would [simply?] across the board raise the rates on boats-- or
registration of boats-- from, everything would be 10 dollars instead of
the fifty dollars. I would just ask for your support. This is-- at this
point in time, it's something that I really don't think we need to put
this much of a burden on our boat owners, and I would ask for your
support in this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown has the floor to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As a bill sponsor on this, I appreciate Senator Sanderson talking about
this issue, but I just have to disagree in this case. One of the
concerns I think most of you had was that our larger boats, particularly
commercial vessels on the coast, needed to pay a little bit more. And,
in the bill, a 26-foot boat or more would go from fifteen to fifty
dollars on the registration fee. And what this amendment basically does
is take that provision out. And I think it's important that we have
those dollars to take care of the dredging issues, and I ask you to vote
against the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question for the
senate is the passage of amendment 11. All in favor vote
&quot;Aye,&quot; opposed will vote &quot;No,&quot; five seconds will be
allowed for the voting, clerk will record the vote.
Six, having voted in affirmative, and 44, having voted negative,
Amendment 11 fails, and the bill, as amended, is back before the body.
Senators, at this point in time, we're gonna move back to Amendment
number 7, Senator Hise, would you like to be recognized again?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. Members, I do believe that [??]</p>

Senator Sanderson, for what purpose do you arise?

To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Sanderson has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen of the senate, I want to add my support to my
neighbor and friend, Senator Cook, about our coastal ferries.  I have
ridden the ferries in Eastern North Carolina for over 40 years.  One of
the reasons I moved from Craven county back to ?? county was because
there was a ferry in place to do that.  My business is still in Craven
county.  For me to drive other than taking the ferry it's about an hour
and fifteen minutes each way.  That means I have to leave home very,
very early in the morning to be there by 6:00.  These ferries are vital
to our constituents in Eastern North Carolina.  They serve a great
purpose, and no matter what we call these added fees, they are taxes on
our people, and this is a time in Eastern North Carolina when we do not
need any more taxes.  And I, like Senator Cook will continue to work.  I
will support this budget, but I will continue to work to the end for
these tolls, so that our folks can enjoy the same benefits with their
highways that every other citizen in the state of North Carolina enjoy.
Thank you, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate?  Senator Ford, for what
purpose do you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, see if senator Cook will yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Cook, do you yield?  Senator Cook.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Cook, can you share with us how much the state subsidizes
ferries?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe about 46, 47 million dollars a year.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  The budget before you contains the removal of
a statutory exception in the turnpike authority, which protects the town
of Garner and the residents of southern Wake county from having a
proposed route of the 540 extension from being built through their
community.  As many of you know, the orange route is the preferred route
and has been for 20 years in southern Wake county, but the Feds are
requiring us to study the red route, which will greatly impact the town
of Garner, approximately 13 neighborhoods, a church and other community
fixtures if it is built.  The senate voted in 2011 to adopt the
provision that I'm asking you to keep in there, and I was opposed to
removing a provision when it came before the senate early this session,
and ask that you support the amendment.

Discussed thoroughly and looked at. I think it’s a major policy change
that is probably needed, but with that being said, I do move that it lay

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brunstetter, for what purpose do you rise?

like more time to explain the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think I’m okay with explaining it at this point. I
think everyone has the information they need so I’m willing to answer
any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. To ask if Senator Hise would
yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And Senator Hise, these are honest questions. I got
members back here trying to figure out what we’re doing. Did your
amendment, which column on here represents where we are without your
amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Where we are without my amendment would be the first
column that is highlighted, and the title of that column, and I’m on
page 1, is Regional Net Impact.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And that’s based on what? What would you call?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Based on the current bill moving from the individual
hospital rates to regional rates.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And that’s part of this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s part of the bill as it currently exists. This
amendment would move to a state-wide rate that comes forward so we the
take disparity out. There’s some disparity that came up in between the
regions in doing that, and instead now we wipe it out across the state
and put one based rate in for all hospitals across the state instead of
4 base rates based on their regions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would he yield to another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And that new rate would be the state wide net impact?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, that’s correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One further question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And then the last column would be the net change,
between those two?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Between those two. That’s correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And that, would he yield to another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I still yield, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It was my understanding that the hospitals had worked
something out about rates. Can you share that with us as to where they
are in terms of what they wanted, or have they participated in your
knowledge? That may have just been bad information.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would suggest that the change in the base rate,
probably as members would look across the board, would depend on the
hospitals. As they move forward, there are movements across, but I think
if you will look at this as a whole for that second column: State-Wide
Net Impact. I believe that there are four hospitals in the state that
are negatively impacted. All other hospitals in the state are positively
impacted by a state-wide rate in moving forward. Also, remind members
that on top of this for what a hospital is actually paid, every hospital
can pay into the assessment, get the federal match on those funds, and
get paid up to the Medicare rate for individual services. This is the
amount coming out to the hospital when the individual is discharged.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would he yield to one other question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I will yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] When I look at Region 1 Rate Model, I’m looking at the
back of the second sheet, all the numbers are positive.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct. Currently under the base rate, the
regional rates, there were four regional rates, it was 2,887 dollars and
40 cent for Region 1, 3,356 dollars and 4 cent for Region 2. These are
their ?? summaries. 3,324 dollars and 76 cent for Region 3, and 3,195
dollars 31 cent for Region 4.</p>

Four at the top of the page. You with me?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What will be the net effect to Blayton County hospital if we adopt this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Blayton Hospital will receive estimated next year $194,877 more dollars.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Correct. I think where everyone is confused Senator Hise is the net
impact last column is the difference between. One way of figuring it is
the region vs. the state the actual net dollars to the hospital is under
the net impact column, the next to the last one. Correct, $194, 877.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's correct. That's what they'll receive this year vs. what they
would have received with the same...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And that would be for every column going down. Right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant, for purpose your aye's.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Senator Hise a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise, this is still confusing to me. In the budget bill you
have, as it currently exists, we would be using the regional base rates.
Would that be correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And that would be what would be in the column called regional net
impact.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So if we pass this budget, that we currently have, Blayton County
Hospital will be receiving $255,000 more than they were receiving from
their individual DRG rate. Is that correct? Or am I lost?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Now you want to shift from regional to state. So Blayton Hospital is
going to get $194,000, now $60,000 less or close to $61,000 less than
they would have gotten under the regional rate, which is in the current
budget. So it's no way we can say that we're helping Blayton Hospital
because they're going to lose $61,000, if they want money, now I don't
know what else they might want. But they will get $61,000 less under
this amendment. Correct? Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, as I have answered the question before, we are changing the
system as we are currently going. Compared to what the currently have
under the system, they would receive $194,000 more. Compared to what
they have under an interim stop in the system which created inequitable
rates across the region, across regions, there's a $60,000 a year change
for the entire hospital.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ok, so it is the case that this shift from regional to state for most of
the hospitals on this page will be a loss in money to them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have, We have never been on a regional rate, that is a new concept
that we have established in this budget, moving forward. But the state
of North Carolina had each hospital on their own base rate prior to us
developing this process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca for purpose your aye's.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise, Yield to another question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise, with the Blayton example, say we don't vote this in, say
the budget fails and we keep it exactly as it is when we walked in here
today, what would Blayton Hospital get?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They would receive $194,000 less than they currently receive. They would
receive $1,192,317.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up? So in reality, if we don't vote this into the budget and pass
this, Blayton Hospital is going to lose $194,000.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's correct. if we don't get the changes to the base rate...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, so there's more money to them because of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, for purpose your aye's.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. What you all put in the bill, this regional
rate. This was, I assume this was somebody's idea, or else it wouldn't
be in the bill. But what you are asking us to do right now is to vote on
an amendment that is going to cost our hospitals money. I mean look at
Wakemed, they are losing 1.2 million dollars. Wakemed Carry is losing
$240,000. I'm voting against this amendment, and I encourage you to do
the same.

Mr. President.

The Federal Association has finally written a letter saying all of that.
They cannot take care of this half million people that will not have
insurance and  will not be able to pay. And the safety nets are going
away. I know Senator Apodaca spoke about a program he has in Henderson
County. It’s one of the federally approved centers. I got one. A lot of
us have them around.  That money’s going way. They aren’t going to be
there. The dish money that rural hospitals get now to help offset this,
it’s going away, all under the Affordable Care Act. And we’re going to
be left here with all of these uninsured people with no place to get any
money to take care of them. And what we were trying to present to you,
was the ease with which we could take care of these things that we
consider necessities. I don’t consider over 4,000 teachers in the school
fluff and fancy stuff. It’s teachers and that’s what gets our kids
educated. Healthcare for people is not fluff and fancy stuff. It is an
absolute necessity. And it’s something that this country is moving on in
a direction to try to make sure that everyone has access to healthcare.
And it’s not the time for North Carolina to throw an anchor out and say,
except us. It won’t work. We can’t sit here in a vacuum and all the
programs go away that are taking care of people now and survive. So it
is about choices. You all have made the choice to take that 770 million
dollars to do something else with and leave what we consider the needs
of this state pushed to the side and I guess abandoned. I guess we’re
not going to do any of those things in the future. Because we have a
chance and we aren’t doing it. So we will, I will be voting against the
budget and I urge you too, also.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Berger, for purpose what do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Berger will speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr President, and members of the Senate. I want to start out
with just expressing my appreciation. And I think everyone in the
Chambers will acknowledge that the members of the Budget Committee,
particularly the Chairs of the Appropriations Committee, have spent a
lot time and put in a great deal of work on what you have before you.
And I appreciate what they’ve done and what the staff have done to get
us to this point. As we all know, this is step two of what is in essence
is a four step process. The governor makes his proposal, one house
adopts a budget and the other house adopts a budget and then we get
together and adopt a Conference Report. And so what we see in this
budget, we hope will be much of what we'll see in that final product.
Because it does a lot of good things. And it does many things that we
need to do. And it does it in a way that we can say that we’re living
within our means. That we are funding those priorities of state
government that we have. That we are trying to take care of those people
in our society that the state government has an obligation to help take
care of.  Now does it do it in a way that every member in this body
agrees is at the appropriate level? Well, obviously not. We’ll see that
reflected in the vote in just a few minutes. But I would say that
predictions of dire consequences are not actually something that we
should be all that concerned about in terms of their accuracy. I
remember two years ago when we were faced with an even worst situation
than we have now. That we were being told that we were engaged in an
assault on public schools. That what we were doing by adopting a budget
was going to decimate state government. That what we were doing was
going to create all kinds of chaos and terrible situations around the
state. Well, the last I looked, the schools were still open, we were
still educating children</p>

I was him with fraud number finds that that we need to do with you in a
way that stacks the taxpayers of the state and makes it clear to
MacCallum that we're not going to spend money that we don't have that we
are not going to further Burton VL are because we think we like to spend
the money of particular way are we going to stand prudently those
dollars that they send us now we have a choice. are we can go back to
where we were befuddled about it a few years ago, we can go back to the
site. if we got it working the standard even if we haven't got it were
to understand because quite frankly, that's what we were doing before
the two thousand eleven budget and the interesting thing is that God
will receive a number of amendments offered to die and a couple of those
amendments have spent the money that was set aside to get back to the
people the money to set aside for the finance package notes an
interesting concept that really what we do not link back to them. it's
its values to begin with all which is saying that when you take so much
of buttons are low, but some folks have amendments to spend that money,
as opposed to letting people keep it. and if you look at the Minnesota
and often infectious if it has not spent that money twice, so, so that I
will looking at is going back on this would be if she suggested that we
go back the way we do things before limited things before I gave us
budgets that really will boom or bust budgets of we would go over a few
years, we have surpasses those successes with its data. we didn't have
an economic man him reason. so now all then we would not really curtail
spending. when we do is we see taxes rise emphasizes the raise even a
form of permanent tax increases. interesting concept of temporary tax
increases that have no options on and so well when we made a commitment
to the voters that we were to get out of that cycle. in this budget gets
us out of that cycle is on the path of adopting budgets that are
predictable adopting budgets that showed equipment to live within our
means and adopting budgets that for the first time in a long time. it
was the prospect of giving the people of this state some relief from
that as well as accounts, the highest taxes in the south east, and
