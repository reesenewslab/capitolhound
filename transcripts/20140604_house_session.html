every time I hear it. Please give your reverence and attention to the
winner of the state wide FFA creed Ms. Nicky Lacklier from Robson
County. Nicky, please approach the podium, and present the creed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The FFA creed by Ian Tiffany. I believe in the future
of Agriculture with a faith born not of words, bit of deeds.
Achievements won by the present and past generations of agriculturalists
in the promise of better days through better ways. Even as the better
things we now enjoy have to come to us through the struggles of former
years. I believe to live and work on a good farm, or to be engaged in</p>

<p id="005:00">
Other agricultural pursuits is pleasant as well as challenging. For I
know the joys and discomforts of agricultural life and hold an inborn
fondness for those associations which even in hours of discouragement, I
cannot deny. I believe in leadership from ourselves and respect from
others. I believe in my own ability to work efficiently and think
clearly with such knowledge and skill as I can secure. And in the
ability of progressive agriculturalists to serve our own and the public
interest in producing and marketing the product of our toil. I believe
in less dependence on begging and more power in bargaining. In the life
abundant and enough honest wealth to help make it so for others as well
as myself. In less need for charity and more of it when needed. In being
happy myself, and playing square with those whose happiness depends upon
me. I believe that American agriculture can and will hold true to the
best traditions of our national life. And that I can exert and influence
in my home and community which will stand solid for my part in that
inspiring task. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen, I
think you can see that Nicky is a good example of what agricultural
education and the Future Farmers of America can do for our young people.
Those accompanying her in the gallery today include her mother, Ms.
Bridget Massaid, her step-father, Kalee Massaid, Josh Starling and
Horace Johnson who both work with young people like Nicky all over the
state, and the state FFA officer team Carmen Honeycutt, great-niece of
JH Langdon a former education teacher and FFA advisor, Miranda Bergland,
Hailey Lore, Danielle Blake, Bradley Glover, ??. Nicky is from
Representative Ken Waddell's district. Interestingly, Mr. Waddell was an
agricultural education teacher at East Columbus High School before
coming to the General Assembly. I heard this created a meeting over the
course of the, or heard a young lady deliver it and I said I think
that's something we should probably bring to the house and remind
everybody about the good work and the future of agriculture in North
Carolina. I think in my opinion and I hope in yours is in great hands.
But before we go further, we may have the guests I just listed please
stand and let us welcome you. Representative Waddell, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For a point of personal privilege. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
house, I think you've seen today exactly what is good about public
education in North Carolina. It does my heart good, I taught these
students and listed many creeds and many speeches in my career as a
school teacher. What other example of leadership skills could you
imagine being better than being able to stand in front of 120 members of
the house and give this rendition of the FFA creed? Outstanding work,
and outstanding commend the young lady that said this creed. She said it
last year in the agriculture committee. And she really didn't know
whether she was going to win the state contest or not but did, and I
think went off to national convention and finished sixth. Once again,
this is one good example of many in our public schools of how well they
are providing these opportunities for those folks to get out and be all
we want them to be sooner or later which is be responsible citizens of
North Carolina. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen, I'd
like to extend the courtesies of the gallery to a number of municipal
officials</p>

Would move for passage of the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further
discussion, further debate. If not, the question before the house is
Amendment One to House Bill 1025 House Committee Substitute. So many as
favor the adoption of the amendment, please vote aye. Those opposed vote
no. The clerk will open the vote. We’ll give members time to get to
their seats. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The clerk
will let the machine record the vote. 413 having voted in the
affirmative and none in the negative. The amendment is agreed to. For
what purpose does the lady from Wake, Representative Gill rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I never saw the amendment on our screen. Was there a problem?
And I didn’t vote because I didn’t know what I was voting on. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Gill, the lady is correct. There was apparently
an error on the dashboard, and so the amendment was not before, we would
be glad to take a motion from the Representative, if the lady would like
a revote, we can take a motion to reconsider, if the House would like. I
think it was a technical amendment, however. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, may
I have permission to vote yes on that amendment? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
lady will be recorded as having voted aye. For what purposes does the
lady from Franklin, Representative Richardson rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker I rise also to be recorded as being yes on that amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady will be recorded as having voted aye. For
what purposes does the gentleman from Gaston, Representative Torbett
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To inevitably speak on the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you ladies and gentlemen of the House. We’re
going to get through this as fast as humanly possible. I’ll give you a
brief description of one bill that is a compilation of a myriad of bills
that passed through the joint legislative transportation oversight
committee. Section one, which was original House Bill 1025. This section
amends the safety and emissions inspection laws provided that DMV may
grant a continuance for an inspection station, related license violation
hearing. Under current law, if a violation hearing is requested, DMV
must hold the hearing within 30 days. Again, it provides a continuance.
Section two, which is also House Bill 1071. The section amends current
law governing agri-tourism signs to require the Department of
Agriculture to work with DOT on placement of agri-tourism signs. Removes
one-mile limit on placement and it still requires agri-tourism sign
placement to follow DOT tourist and local sign rules which allows
placement up to five miles from agri-tourism sites. Section three,
otherwise known as House Bill 1072. This section changes the due date
for the North Carolina turnpike authority annual audit report. Current
law requires the report to be submitted promptly following the close of
the fiscal year. This bill changes the due date, an actual due date to
October. Section four, previously House Bill 1073. This section repeals
the requirement in current law that DOT annual report to the joint
legislative transportation oversight committee on right turn on red
light crashes including crashes involving pedestrians and persons with
disabilities. Once again it repeals that study. Section five, formerly
known as House Bill 1122, this section changes the material technical
standards for state driver license to eliminate a requirement for use of
polycarbonate material. Instead requiring use of materials that is
measured by energy standards of security and durability and is resistant
to both tampering and reproduction. Section six, previously known as
House Bill 1125. This section amends the strategic transportation
investment act of 2013, House Bill 817, Session Law 2013-183 to provide
that two types of funds obligated to support of emergency repair work
will be subject to alternative prioritization criteria under the act.
One, federal or state funds obligated for repairs for which federal
emergency relief funds are available. Two, state funds obligated for
repair to damage</p>

<p id="025:00">
As a result of an event that is lawfully declared to be a federal or
state emergency.
Section 7, which incorporates part of the amendment we just passed, was
formerly House Bill 1126. This section reenacts a 2009 law that
authorized DOT to participate in limited circumstances in private
developer contracts for state highway system engineering design or
construction of improvements. The department’s participation under this
act is limited to the lesser of 10% of the contract or $250,000. DOT is
required to annually report, no later than March 1, to the Joint
Legislature Commission on Governmental Operations and the Joint
Legislature Transportation Oversight Committee on all agreements entered
into between the department and a private developer for participation in
private engineering and construction contracts under this bill draft.
The authorization provided by this bill draft would expire December 31,
2016.
Section 8. Effective date accepted otherwise.  Noted provided the bill
becomes effective when it becomes law. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I support
the bill and hope everyone will, as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask a question of the bill sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative Torbett, when we went to the
introduction of ramp meters, it’ll be in our traffic patterns now, was
there any study that was done on getting people used to them, or any
problems that we may incur with that kind of a change and people knowing
how to use it. We had recent issues with roundabouts. I’m just
concerned.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. As you know, or may not know, that they are used in other states.
As far as actual training for drivers, I don’t know that there will be
any. But the application of them will be self-explained because they are
just, they’re like red lights, but they are not red lights. They are
more of a gauging system to make your entrance ramps safer as you merge
into your most busiest times of the days on some interstates.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess my question is not so much when the light’s red or when it’s
dark. It’s when it’s green and they just scoot out. They still have to
understand that they’re under the driving etiquette of looking to see
before you just realize the green lights let you go without following
the look over your shoulder rule.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’re absolutely correct. And my hope is that, if I understand, the
light is more to the entrance as opposed to where you actually access
your highway. So it is, you still have merging time, if that makes
sense. It’s not a stop here, go here, stop here, go here. It’s a stop
from that, but then you still have ample area to merge after that. So,
you would have to look and see for oncoming cars.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Last follow-up, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is there a consideration for the length of the
merge lanes? Because some in the area, I know here in Raleigh, are short
compared to others. Is there any kind of a requirement that it has to be
a certain length to be safe?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wish I had an answer. I don’t know specific like foot or dimension
requirement for that application.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Iler, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To assist with the last answer, if I may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The ramp meter section was added by amendment in committee. And what
this does is actually just make the ramp meter violation of the red
light an infraction instead of a the same as a intersection red light.
And roughly, to answer the question about how far, I saw a video about
this and it appears at about half way up the ramp, or maybe two thirds,
in that area. And they still have plenty of car lengths to merge once
they’re given permission to move on down the ramp.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Bumgardner, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that this bill be displaced for a short period
while I have an amendment made.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Torbett, is the gentleman willing to temporarily displace
the bill while the amendment’s being prepared?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I’ll await to see what language of the amendment is, yes
sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The bill will be temporarily displaced. House Bill 1026, the clerk</p>

Will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Committee substitute for House Bill 1026 ??
entitled an act to update state law governing department of
transportation oversight of safety and rail fixed guide way public
transportation systems. General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Torbett please your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate
the bill, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to
debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of
the house. House Bill 1026 is a MAP21 update, rail safety type of bill
that has also come out of the joint legislative ?? oversight committee.
[COUGH] Excuse me. And what this bill does, it complies with the new
requirements of the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act,
or otherwise known as MAP21. It also gives NCDOT the enforcement
authority required to implement the requirements of MAP21. Let me also
address your attention to penalties for non-compliance if we do not act
on this. If NCDOT does not take specific action to comply with the
requirements of MAP21 as determined on the FDA, the USDOT secretary may
withhold not more than 5% of the amount required to be appropriated for
use in a state or urbanized area in the state under section 5307 until
the SSO program has been certified as compliant with MAP21.
Alternatively the secretary may require the fix gap ?? rail transit
systems under the state's SSO program provide up to 100% of federal
assistance made available under MAP21. Only for safety related
improvements on such systems until the SSO program has been certified as
compliant. I recommend this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion,
further debate. If not, the question before the house is the passage of
the house committee substitute to House Bill 1026 on its second reading.
All in favor vote aye. All opposed no. The clerk will open the vote. The
clerk will let the machine record the vote. 117 having voted in the
affirmative, none in the negative. The house committee substitute to
House Bill 1026 has passed its second reading without objection. Will
read a third time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] General Assembly of North Carolina
enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. If not,
the question before the house is the passage of House Bill 1026 on its
third reading. All in favor say aye. All opposed no. The ayes have it.
The house committee substitute to House Bill 1026 has passed its third
reading and will be sent to the Senate. House Bill 1028. The clerk will
read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] House Bill 1028 ?? directed addition of motor
vehicles to issue a single annual registration renewal sticker for each
vehicle registration plate, as recommended by the joint legislative
transportation oversight committee. General Assembly of North Carolina
enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Torbett, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, members of the house. House
Bill 1028 single license plate renewal sticker. As you are aware now
when you purchase a license plate you have a sticker on the top left and
you purchase annually a sticker for the top right. Guess what. This is
going to be more efficient. Improves efficiency in sales and saves the
DMV roughly $75,025. The statute allows for only one sticker but the
administrative code calls for two registration stickers. Thus, we need
to mandate one sticker in order to remove the authority from the
administrative code provision and allow it to be repealed. And I commend
this to you and hope you will support it. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. If not, the
question before the house is the passage of House Bill 1028 on its

For North Carolina public education. General Assembly of North Carolina
enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen, before I allow debate on
this bill, assuming there will be some debate, the Chair would like to
extend two final courtesies. The Chair upon motion of Representative
Catlin, the Chair is happy to extend the courtesies of the gallery to
New Hanover County commissioner Beth Dawson and her husband EMC member
Dan Dawson. Beth and Dan, please stand and let us welcome you. Also upon
motion of the gentleman from Onslo, Representative Shepherd, the Chair
is happy to extend courtesies of the gallery to a friend and
constituents from Richland, Ward Sylvester, and his son John. Please
stand and let us welcome you. Representative Holloway please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To explain the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mr. Speaker, members of the body. We’re here to talk about an issue that
I’m sure we’ve heard about from our constituents and that issue is
Common Core. The bill before you today was in the house education
committee yesterday. We had a very vigorous debate. I believe a very
thorough debate, and even though maybe concerns were not met, I do
believe that they were addressed. What does the bill do? It seeks out to
replace Common Core which are standards for our schools and it seeks out
to replace them in a very responsible way. The state board of education
next year will do a five-year review of standards. They do this every
year. They do it on their own accord. And what we as the legislature are
saying is we would like for you to look at replacing Common Core and
considering higher standards. Are we taking any authority away from the
state board? The answer is no. The state board picks curriculums, or
they help write curriculums, and they pick the standards for which those
curriculums are choreographed or designed. This bill does not in any way
leave us without standards. There was some concern yesterday that we
would be left without standards in our school system. In no way does it
do that, because it allows us to continue operating under the standards
we have now. The state board will do a five year review even if we did
nothing. They will make changes and we again are encouraging them to
look at other standards other than Common Core and we hope they will
pick the highest possible standards that they can select. Can they keep
parts of Common Core that they think are appropriate for our schools?
Yes, they can. But, we want them to replace Common Core and we want to
see a new face in standards and we want to see again higher standards
than what we have today and standards that are more appropriate for our
students. Mr. Speaker, that’s pretty much what the bill does. The only
other thing that I can say is that it does create an advisory commission
and the advisory commission has no rule-making authority. Again, we are
not trumping the state board. They will be given advice to the state
board as to how the standards should look, and that helps keep us as a
legislature in the loop. Because we sometimes get the blame for things
that we do or didn’t do, and it just helps us to stay a part of our
standards and our school system and stay in touch with that. Mr.
Speaker, I’ll be happy to take any questions. I think Representative
Horne would like to speak and I do have an amendment that maybe after we
recognize Representative Horne that I’d like to run before we get into
the debate. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Horne is recognized to
debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to
take just a minute to point out some fundamental things about this bill.
As you know, this came out as a PCS from the study committee on Common
Core. Some of us felt that that report out of the Common Core committee
left some uncertainty, some question, what’s going on.</p>

<p id="040:00">
are we going to have standards are we going backwards, sideways? What
are we doing? This PCS, which was written in cooperation with a great
number of folks we talked to, the business community, the education
community, parents, teachers, principals, got to the point where, I know
it's hard to believe, but I talked myself. The purpose of this, the
purpose behind here, the fundamental purpose here is to add stability to
how we're going forward, to how standards are implemented in this state.
To add certainty so that the teachers, the parents, and the kids know
what to expect next week and next year and to emphasize that it is the
responsibility of the state of North Carolina to create, establish,
promote, promulgate standards in this state. As you all know the
Constitution of the United States is silent on the issue of education
but our Constitution is not. As you all know, the Federal Constitution,
in Amendment 10, clearly states that anything that's not, any power
that's not given to the Federal Government is reserved for the states
and, therefore, to the people. Our Constitution is clear that education
is our responsibility, period. Not sorta, kinda, period. So, just a
couple of things to address. The fundamental, the biggest concern I hear
as I talk to folks on both sides of this issue and whether they're
educators or parents is are we going backwards? Is this an attempt to
throw out our standards and go backwards to standards that, pretty much
everyone agrees, were not so good? I heard that time and again, that our
North Carolina standards in public education need to be raised. Well, it
says in the &quot;whereas's&quot; that it is the desire of this state to
have academic standards among the highest in the nation. It says on page
2, line 15, that we are to ensure these standards are among the highest
in the nation. And it says on page 6, the last page, that the standard
course of study that we have today, the standard course of study that
our teachers, to which our teachers are teaching, the standard course of
study the kids are learning, the standard course of study that people
agree, &quot;these are pretty good so far,&quot; they stay in place. But
this says we can do better and we can do it better on our own than have
someone else thrust those standards upon us. Now I, I don't know if you
all got this from the NCAE and I think that they make some very good
points in their key findings. They tell you that teachers want to be
consulted and involved in the implementation and this bill insists that
teachers are consulted and involved in the implementation. This says
teachers in North Carolina are concerned that Common Core state
standards that we currently have will put increased emphasis on
standardized tests. We want to emphasize the fact that teachers need to
be allowed to teach. It points out that the members, teaching members of
NCAE want more rigorous standards because they believe the standards
will help students develop better critical thinking and problem solving.
We agree. We want better standards. We want our standards. We are
telling this commission to be established, we're telling the state board
we want our standards among the highest in the United States. We must
compete. We must compete with each other right here. We must compete
with the other states. We must compete with other nations. Everyone
business in this state, pretty much, ??? go anywhere and get their
students, they'll get their new hires. We want our students, we know
that our students are the best there are to have and that's why I urge
you to support this bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Representative Holloway moves to amend the bill on page 5, line 4 by
rewriting the line to read:
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the body, this is a technical
amendment recommended to us by staff. It just simply takes the
appropriation out of the bill. Those funds will be reflected in the
budget and so we do not need that in the bill and so this is just simply
a technical amendment that removes those funds. But again, those</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

I do not actually have a copy of the bill in front of me, Representative

Representative Holloway, it is not a new word and it is a typo that can

Representative Holloway, does the gentleman yield?

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Holloway, on line 8 you say the commission's budget to
the extent that funds are available. As I understand it, where are the
funds and what are the funds that are going to be used to do this? What
funds, to what extent are funds available and where are they coming
from?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, the funds, they will be made available in the
budget and I know you know from your time as being a full appropriations
chair or senior appropriations chair, we've got the money and we will
put it in there and the funds that are reflected in the bill, I think it
was $75,000, we certainly have the funds to do that. I believe our
friends across in the Senate, I think they're asking for a little bit
more and all that can be worked out but we certainly, we do have the
funds and again, this came as a recommendation by staff and we were just
taking their recommendation and said that we needed to pull this money
out of it and word it this way. So this isn't necessarily my doing. I'm
just taking the folks who are really smart in this place and taking
their suggestion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a follow-up. It may not be much money involved but it still
reflects the budget and I'm just, I know that there are ways that you
can find things but what concerns me is the fact that this is a major
program, a major commission that you're setting up and there outta be
some dedicated funds in there rather than trying to fish around for
them. I would hope that you would go back to what you already had in
there originally.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Pittman, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask the amendment sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Holloway, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just need a little clarification. It seems to me the way this is
worded, it's a little confusing 'cause it looks like to me it's saying
we're not going to appropriate funds for it because affected only funds
are appropriated so, I don't know. I'm a little uncomfortable with the
wording not with what I think you are trying to accomplish, so I'm just
trying to figure it out, how we're gonna appropriate something if we're
not gonna appropriate it, that's all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Pittman, again, this is nothing clever, this is nothing
tricky, this is just coming from staff. I've seen this done before in
the years that I've been here. Again, if the bill, if something were to
happen and the bill didn't pass obviously we wouldn't need it but I'm
confident that things will work out and it will pass and the money will
be in the budget, I can assure you that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further debate on the amendment. If not, the question before the House
is the passage of the amendment sent forth by Representative Holloway to
the House Committee Substitute to House Bill 1061. All in favor vote
aye, all opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will
let the machine record the vote, 116 having voted in the affirmative, 2

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members. It's hard to get up and oppose my
good friend and fellow educator Representative Holloway on this bill but
there are some things that I would like to point out and some things
that I hope that we can reflect upon. I have been involved in the Common
Core issue for over four years as a legislator and have really looked at
this issue from all different angles and I know that some of you have
heard a lot about it from constituents, some things that are accurate,
some not so much. I've had the privilege, thanks to oiur Speaker, of</p>

... serving on the interim committee. We’ve had really good discussions,
we’ve had experts come in. We solved some problems and some areas of
concern, and things that I had hoped as a committee we would adjust and
modify, and I think some of that is going to happen. I do think that. I
think the goal that we all have and I think the business community has,
as you can see based on what’s on your desk, is we all want very
rigorous standards for our students, and that that is important, and we
know the correlation between education and the economic engine that
drives our state. But there are some issues that I think still hang out
there that I hope will be solved in the next few weeks. 45 states have
signed on to common core. I think that sends a signal that maybe things
aren’t as terrible, but maybe not. Guess it depends on your perspective.
There have certainly been problems with implementation, from North
Carolina to around the country. I think that would be remiss to say it’s
been perfect. I think the direction where we’re trying to go now is
going to make us relive out that concern with implementation, because we
don’t seem to know exactly where we’re going, and so my concern from an
educator’s perspective and parents and thinking about children, because
they’re our ultimate customer here: Are we leaving them in a state of
flux? Do we really know what is going to happen, and what message will
this send to our teachers? I’m thinking about our school systems because
if they don’t know the exact curriculum that may be developed or may
not, that puts a halt on passage of their budget, of textbooks they may
purchase, professional development they may need. So those are just some
of the big issues that do concern me. I’m also worried about an end date
with this commission that’s created, and so I hope that those of you who
are going to be on the conference committee with the Senate will think
about some of these issues and see if we can make some adjustments,
because I know none of us want to put forward policy that’s going to
make our teachers more anxious or make us get thousands of nasty emails
holding all of us responsible for legislation, because I do worry that
some of the language in here is problematic, although some of the
intentions may be good. Do I do ask you to consider that, but for those
reasons, I cannot support this bill today. I will have to oppose it, and
I do hope some adjustments can be made in the Senate and that we can all
agree for rigorous standards for our students and a plan for everyone.
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brandon, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as amended. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I appreciate the comments of my colleague Representative Cotham. We both
served on the common core committee and we both were excited about
serving on it because we too have received lots of emails and lots of
letters from our constituents like you have. My disappointment in the
committee when I was in the committee was that we were tackling an issue
that does not have anything to do with common core, and we’re still here
today having a conversation that has absolutely nothing to do with the
issues of common core. We have professional development implementation
that we’re still going to have to deal with no matter what kind of
standards that you’re dealing with. We have children with special needs
that need to be protected in these things that we still deal with and
still would have to be dealt with no matter what we do today. The
problem… what I want people to understand is that at some point in this
body, we have to understand that education cannot be political rhetoric
all the time because the only thing that happens is our kids that end up
suffering the most. We are using this bill – and we’re going to call it
what it is. We are using this bill to appease about 20 percent of the
population that’s very upset about something that’s just misconstrued.
This bill was about indoctrination, Obama, we want to do a repeal and
replace, and we have to be very careful because we tried to do that with
Obamacare – we were going to do repeal and replace…</p>

<p id="055:00">
and we still have a fiasco in this state of how we're dealing with that
'cause we never did replace. And I'm very nervous of, I'm very, very
nervous about how we're going to be able to deal with this because of
the example I had before and now we are setting another tone where we're
going to replace a policy, or we're gonna get rid of a policy and we
don't have another policy. And anybody can get up and tell you that
we're not lowering standards but that's simply not the case. You will
lower standards if you don't have any other standards. It's just the way
it is. And we can get out there and talk about the talking points all we
want to but the fact remains and the fact is if you don't have standards
you are lowering them, fact. So, now we have to go to our constituents
and to our teachers and to our parents and let them know we don't know
when we're gonna have new standards. We might have them next year, we
might have them two years from now, we might have them three years from
now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Holloway, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would the gentleman yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brandon, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brandon, I certainly do respect your opinion and forgive
me, I do hate to stand up and interrupt someone while they're speaking.
I think it's the first time I've done this in ten years. But you said we
will not have standards. What in the bill makes you think that there
will be a void where there will be no standards as this process moves
forward?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The portion in the bill where you say that we're not spending any more
money on it and that we are directing our commission to say we're not
gon-, what teacher, I will redirect the question back to you, what
teacher that you know, in their right mind, will continue to use the
standards of Common Core when they get the memo saying we're not using
the Common Core?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One follow-up, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield? The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I understand you say that we're not spending money but do you
understand that that means that we do not want the school board to be
purchasing tests and things like that that go along with Common Core?
That most of what we need for Common Core is in place and just because
you're not spending money on something doesn't mean that the standards
are eliminated. The standards are there, they're in place. The
curriculum has already been written to go along with those standards and
to say that we will be operating with no standards is a little bit of an
exaggeration. I understand we're not going to be spending money but I
just want to make sure you understand that does not mean that we have a
moratorium on standards and we're operating with no standards at all. I
just want to make sure you understand that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I totally understand that but I also understand what happens when you
tell someone that you're not going to do something anymore. So if I'm a
teacher I'm gonna take all the Common Core standards that I have and I'm
going to put them with all the other initiatives that this body has
brought before us over the 20-30 years and is just another one. We're
gonna have another one. And that's another part of this. They just
started this and we're gonna come and get it, &quot;oh, those of us know
better than you and so we're gonna do this again and we're gonna bring
you new standards.&quot; And the bigger problem that I have is what
Representative Horn talked about. We are walking around like we're big,
bad North Carolina that has done this better than anybody else when, in
quire the contrary, we have no statistical evidence or base or anything
that says that we should be arrogant enough to say that standards are
not good enough and we're gonna do it ourselves. For all the existence
of this country, every single test score, everything that we measure
upon, we cannot say that. Maybe Connecticut or Massachusetts might be
able to say that, who continues to rank high, but North Carolina to say,
&quot;oh, we're gonna do this.&quot; I think that's a little stretch to
believe that we have the credibility to say that we are gonna have
higher standards. We still don't know what the standards are going to
look like. Other states have tried to do this. And one of the things I
don't like about this is that and then we come today and say we're not
gonna have, we don't know the appropriations now. We don't know. Folks,
this is a very expensive operation. I think, look at how much Indiana
spent on this. Somebody's gonna elude to this later but this is an
expensive operation. We're going to do things that the federal
government tries to give us money for, tries to deal with professional
development, tries to deal with things that deal with common core but
we're gonna say we're gonna do it on our own, where it releases us from
federal funds that we'd be able to get that. We don't, we're barely
paying teachers now. We're robbing people to pay Pa[?] just so we can
keep teachers from going across the state so we can pay them. Now we're
gonna say we're going to provide all the professional development, we're
going to provide all the curriculum, we're gonna provide all of these
things that, we can't afford to do that. You guys know we can't afford
to do it. We can barely keep it up with what we got now.</p>

Thank you mister speaker. ?? see if the bill ??

Representative Holloway this is Gentlemen ?? the Gentlemen yields.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Representative Holloway the question is somewhat ?? because I have
something I would like to see if you would be willing to accept on page
two, line thirty four you have the board of govenors and page three you
have the commission. The setup of the commission and on page four you
have the experts my question of it is you have the University of North
Carolina Board of Govenors, will you be willing to accept the amendment
on line thirty four and the North Carolina community college board of
trustees?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Representative Floyd I would say that I am more than willing to talk
with you again this bill will go to conference, the Senate has got a
slightly different version but just to make a decision today off the
cuff without having time to consult with my primary sponsors and go
through an examination of exactly what you want me to do. I would just
ask that we hold off on that today I'm more than willing to talk with
you and see what it is your suggesting and we could certainly consider
that moving forward. But for today my ?? said a lot of work and time has
been put into this and I don't know if I want to start changing and
moving the makeup of the board around on the floor of the house today.
SPEAKER CHANGES
'bout speaker.
SPEAKER CHANGES
The gentlemen yields.
SPEAKER CHANGES
I yield.
SPEAKER CHANGES
But I simply see that in the text of the bill the ?? board of trustees,
the board of governors is already in the bill, I'm just simply saying
expanding line and include the board of trustees of our community
college because at some point in time those students may arrive there.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Again and I...Just a kneejerk, I'm fine with that but again I just need
to take time to speak with my primary sponsors make sure that there are
no unintended consequences from doing that and I assure you that if you
will get with me we will certainly get that. This bill will go to
conference, I feel very very confident our friends in the Senate, I
don't think will sign off on what we've done and we can, we can
certainly work work on this and more than happy to work with you.
SPEAKER CHANGES
'bout speaker.
SPEAKER CHANGES
The gentlemen yields.
SPEAKER CHANGES
I yield all questions mister speaker.
SPEAKER CHANGES
My other is the setup of the board that on page three if you can't do
that could you talk to the speaker 'cause he has three appointees?
SPEAKER CHANGES
I'd like to thank you Representative Floyd.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Representative Davis please state your purpose.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you mister speaker to ask the bill's sponsored question.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Representative Holloway ?? this gentlemen yield?
SPEAKER CHANGES
I yield all questions. The gentlemen yields.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Representative Holloway would you please explain what the consequences
would be as to the money that's been paid to North Carolina by the
federal government if the legislation were to abolish Common core?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Yes absolutely, Representative Davis the state applied for race to the
top grant a few years back and race to the top does not require a common
core. However it does have a bar that is set of standards that we have
to meet and when we were going through this community in the LRC we had
to make a decision as to how we were going to replace this thing called
common core. If we ripped the rug, called common core out from
underneath our school system today which would leave us with no
standards then we would be in jeopardy of having to send four hundred
million dollars roughly back to the federal government but we are not
doing that and we are taking the state board which is going to do a five
year review next year as they always do. This is not the first time
standards have ever been amended. This will not be the last time that

They’re going to make changes. We’re simply in this bill saying that
when you do your review next year, we want you to move away from common
core. We want high standards. If there are pieces or components of
common core that you think are age appropriate, they can take those
individual pieces, but as a whole they need to move towards something
new and we want more vigorous standards. North Carolina does not have
the higher standards of all the states in the nation. Massachusetts has
higher standards, there's other states that are out there that have
higher standards and we can move in that direction. Again, the state
board is gonna do this next year anyway. So, they're gonna make changes,
we're gonna go about it the responsible way. We're not pulling the rug
out today. We're simply going about it, Representative Davis, the way it
should be and when they do their review, we're asking them to look at
other standards and let’s move up and get better and higher standards.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for that explanation. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Speciale, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as
amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This really is a simple bill. It's gonna get rid of a
program we never should have accepted in the first place. If anyone of
you feel you’ve done the study that we've done, have a look at the
programs that we've done. Have a look at all other things that are
involved in this ??. You'd be embarrassed. Representative Cotham said
that 45 states signed on the ??. You bet they did. And for the same
reason North Carolina did for a big cheque. We sold our kids' education,
we sold their futures for 400 million dollars under the previous
administration. Now what's the price we're paying for selling our souls?
Our children, we’ve got the 3rd graders that go to school crying. They
don't want to go to school, why? Because the pressure on them is
immense. Between all the testing and all the requirements are some of
the added things that North Carolina has. They can't take it. A lot of
the stuff has sexual innuendos, sexual stories for 3rd graders, 4th
graders, 5th graders. You look in the appendix B, you look in what is
recommended by the common core for reading materials, it's disgusting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brandon, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask representative ?? for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Speciale, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] As soon as I'm finished speaking.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman does not yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brandon said that education cannot be
about politics. That's what it has been about for the last few years and
that's what we're trying to get rid of. The focus here needs to be on
the education of our children. Period. I challenge you to go home and
pull up common core or pull it up on your computer and look at some of
the stuff in the common core program. It is not very appropriate.
Everybody knows that. PPI knows that. There's a lot of problems with
this thing. But this program was accepted for the money before the state
ever knew what was in the program because the program was not fully
developed and released until 2 days after it was accepted.
Representative [SPEAKER CHANGES] Brandon also said that no statistical
evidence to say that we should do this based on common core results. By
the rules of ?? we may not know for 10 years if common core is working.
I'm sorry, but 10 years work of students is not worth the risk of this
program. We're gonna cross our fingers and hope that they're gonna be
able to read and write, be able to do a coherent, get out there in the
work force because they've learned in the education system here in North
Carolina the things that they need to know. We can't afford to wait.
This program was sold to North Carolina and 45 other states on the fact
that it had been tested in benchmarked worldwide when it had not. Little
pieces that were pulled and put into this program were obtained from
other programs overseas. And those programs were</p>

I'm sorry.  You pull the program, you benchmark it, you test it before
you lay it upon the children. This was not done, this program.  We have
no idea. Nobody has any idea what the end result is going to be on this.
 I know what the end result's gonna be because I've looked at some the
stuff that these kids are learning. I stood in a fifth grade classroom
all morning, one morning. They were doing math. I had no idea what they
were doing and I will guarantee you the kids had no idea what they doing
because they were all looking at the guy that pushed his paper next to
them to try and figure it out. I'm convinced, as hard as they try, I'm
convinced even the teacher didn't know what she was doing. And I've
talked to teachers who don't know what they're doing, yet they're
teaching our children Common Core.  They don't fully understand the
program.  Our children are not an experiment, Ladies and Gentlemen.
They are the future of North Carolina.  They are the future of America.
We are not in a position to be experimenting with their future. We sold
their futures out in 2010. I'd like to see this Legislature stand up and
regain what was given away. I ask you to vote for this bill.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman recognized to debate the bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My very good friends Representative Holloway and
Representative Horn have talked a great deal about creating higher
standards. I fear, at least in a temporary time period, and I'll explain
that, I fear a different outcome. I fear the possibility that we will
have lower standards. And this comes at a time when we really do need
those higher standards to which you spoke. We especially need those
higher standards in the rural areas. We need folks who are more highly
schooled and more highly skilled. If you've looked at recent
unemployment statistics, I'm sure you saw the trend, but many of the
counties in North Carolina, similar to my home county, are still in
recession. And that's how simple it is. And now this bill comes along at
a time when we really, really need stability within our educational
system and that's my greatest fear is that we are gonna have that as
Representative Cotham said, &quot;that time of flux&quot; and we are
gonna have that time of instability. And quite frankly folks, I'm not
sure how long your rural areas can continue to survive these periods of
instability.

Representative Stone, please state your purpose.

The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as ammended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Ladies and gentlemen, this issue came up back
in the last two years of '11 and '12.  And it was somewhat significant.
We talked, back home, to different parents and teachers. But in the last
six months, we've had the most conversation about Common Core. Not only
with the parents, but with the teachers of our private school and our
public school. It's gotten to the point when the bill got put into
Legistation here, I had people chasing me down, begging me to sponsor
it. So, I started readin' the bill, sort of going through it. I had
public school teachers, with 15 and 20 years of experience, beggin' to
meet me at my office in Sanford, so they could go through what they
don't like about Common Core. Now I know my wife is a stay-at-home mom
and she teaches part-time in the school system. So I hear what goes on
at school system every day, the good, the bad, and sometimes she blames
me. But, I have never found one issue that so many people have come
together and said that they do not like, Republicans and Democrats. And
some of those teachers are 20 years, 20 year veterans and are Democrats
and they wanna come with me with at packet of what they don't like and
what's wrong with it. So, I'll say that for an issue that Lee County,
we've dealt with a lot of controversial issues. Just last week, we
signed one today. But this issue's got to be a statewide problem for our
parents and our teachers. And I think when you listen to 'em this is an
issue we can put forth and make the right changes. And we need

SPEAKER CHANGES
To debate the bill as amended.
SPEAKER CHANGES
The gentlemen is recognized to debate the bill as amended.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you mister speaker. It sure has been a lot of frustration
Representative ?? I've had it personally. I have a sixth grader and a
first grader and we have had a terrible time because of some of the
implementation issues with this of getting them on the right path and
it's taking a struggle for both my kids mother and myself and their
teachers and the community at large. And we've had implementation
problems with our parents not being communicated with properly with the
expectations being set for us to understand how to help our kids we have
the right resources for our students to be able to refer back to. We've
also not had the right training for our educators so that they knew what
to do. We sort of got the cart ahead of the horse. But we still have the
problems here right now today and on the one hand we're being told that
we're gonna continue on common core until we get to something better.
Quite frankly if you bring something better, I don't think there's
anybody in this room that's gonna disagree with it. When you lay the two
out next to each other and say, &quot;This is a better standard, our
businesses are going to understand.&quot; what type of employee that
they're gonna get in the future, I don't think that you're gonna have
anybody that's gonna disagree but on the way there on the one hand we're
saying we're gonna continue on common core but on the other hand we're
saying we're not spending any more money on it, when we know today we
need some resources. We need some additional training. We need some
additional online resources or books in some of the areas that don't
have the availability to get online. So to me it's more about process.
We need to have a two track system here one track that looks at how we
make things better and have higher standards if it's possible to create
that ourselves, while in the short term, we actually make it better
today for the kids that are in school today and over the next three
years have the right resources and training. For that reason, I'm
opposed to the bill as it's written right now. Thank you.

Representative Malone please state your purpose.

SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you. Good afternoon everybody. I'm something of a convert, against
common core because when I was on a schoolboard I actually voted for
bringing it to Weigh county and I've come to rule the day from personal
experience as a father and I hope you all remember at least when I first
got here, room six forty three. We had the superintendent schools come
for one of our very first presentations that I ever saw. And I asked her
a couple of questions she gave a very good presentation, I don't know if
you remember this but page nine suggested that we run a second year or
three year ramp up, including training. And that there is four hundred
million dollars that came from reached to the top, two hundred million
dollars went to dpi and the other two hundred million got put between a
hundred plus LAA's that are out there. So I thought that the resources
were mixed and I had a bit of a problem. Second of all comes down to the
issue with some of the...we didn't have books, we didn't have resources
my...one of my children comes home to do their homework and I've always
helped with the homework in the past. I worked on this and I didn't
understand what I was working on. I understood was the English language
was unintelligible to me. Kind of a linguist malpractice forced upon our
children. Didn't understand a word, couldn't help many more. Very very
fustrated. Now and then the books, I asked where the books are where the
reference material is and there's there's no book. There's further
reference material and the teacher that she had in the very first class
didn't know common core and we had to move around. I figured she was one
of those people that didn't get tested yet or ?? didn't get trained yet.
Now I had many town halls in the next couple of years and I tell you the
biggest one I had was on common core. Kids crying, parents not knowing
what to do. We even had a personal run in against the speaker...the
primary in the Senate who mentioned that she could no longer help her
common core math. I don't see the purpose in this. I think that this has
become a failure of process as been rolled out all wrong, is a disaster,
is harming children, and their futures, think about a the fact that
you're in high school and you need a good GPA and all of a sudden you're
working in things you don't even understand. Personally the sooner this
goes the better. Thank you.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Hopefully this one will go a little quicker.
This bill deals with schematics, which was part of the school safety
bill that passed last year on the House. It was a bipartisan bill that I
worked with folks across the aisle. And the bill did pass the House, if
I’m not mistaken, unanimously. But when we got to the Senate, and we
started doing some work with them, they did have some concerns about it.
And I think that we did some urging language as opposed to requiring it.
This language does put in place a requirement to have access for law
enforcement to have the schematics for all the buildings. That way, if
there is an emergency, they will have the ability to set up perimeters,
and they will know what they’re walking into before they get there.
There was an issue between law enforcement and our firemen, but
Representative Torbett cleaned that up and fixed that in education
committee. And again, this is something that the body voted for last
session, and we’re just bringing this piece back to you again this year
and ask for your support.

don’t think we need to go there. I know these things are expensive.
We’re going to end up with them all over the state. We’d be better off
spending that money constructively on some infrastructure problems. I

how vitally important they are, and frankly I was unimpressed.</p>

They must like it. And I recently been in Florida and these things are
all over Florida. They're eat up with them and everybody hates them.
They cause more congestion in most people's opinion than they solve, and
I don't think we need to start putting red lights on the entrance ramps
of the interstates all over North Carolina. I appreciate how hot and
hard the DOT works, how hot it is out there. I've been in the highway
construction business and I think this is a bad idea and I don't want to

gentlemen, Representative Bumgardner brings up a great point about
everyone in Florida not liking it. I don't know if that's actually
factual or not. But I will tell you DOT has gone through a good degree
of due diligence and they are looking at this as a safety improvement.
It has been proven to save lives. A lot of the accidents involving
interstates is at the merging of the two and during certain hours. And
when it's not used during the day it will simply go dark so it will not
be a constant item. It is put out there for safety and vote your
conscience. I do not support the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jeter, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to
debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I actually oppose the amendment,
with all due respect to my colleague from Gaston County. The concern for
me is this guides traffic, predominantly commercial vehicles onto the
interstate system. From a trucking perspective, this is significant.
Because when you have trucks that are predominantly stuck in the right
lane in these highly congested areas which is where we're putting these
ramp meters, it makes a significant difference by the volume of cars
trying to get onto the interstate at one time. It is the number one
traffic incident involving tractors, at exit and on ramps when cars try
to force their ways into holes that don't exist. And of course they
erroneously get out and blame the truck. But I will tell you that to me,
I understand his concerns but this is something that I think is very
valuable to our state, particularly in our more urban areas as we get
more congested, not less congested. And I ask you to vote against the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The pilot for this is going to be here in Wake County, so we're willing
to take the inconvenience of testing this out and seeing what the actual
results are going to be. What this provision actually is, has nothing to
do with, it's probably mislabeled. This has nothing to do with
authorizing the ramp meters. The Department of Transportation currently
has all the authority it needs to put these meters in. All this
provision actually does is to take it from an otherwise if somebody goes
ahead and runs past this red light, they would not be charged as you
would normally be charged with a more serious violation of the laws of
running a red light. This would make it an infraction, no drivers
license points or insurance points would be assessed for violation of
running past one of these red meters. So this will actually just make it
easier on the drivers as they get accustomed to seeing if this pilot is
actually going to work. But it's designed, the underlined premise is
designed when you have all that heavy traffic coming in on these ramps
and you've got people trying to merge, to try and pace folks out a
little bit so they're not right on top of each other, running into each
other. And we have that problem, I can tell you from personal experience
we have that problem in a number of congested areas during rush hour.
And we'd like to pilot it here in Wake County and see how it works. And
we don't want to charge people with a heavy violation in the process of
that pilot. Would appreciate you voting no on the amendment. [SPEAKER

Jeter said and I appreciate that and I also have safety concern. But let
me give you a scenario, when traffic is backed up on the interstate, and
you have a truck sitting there waiting to get on and he’s sitting still
and traffic's backed up all the way, you know how does that hear because
I go home on 40 and 85 and when trucks are sitting there and waiting,
how are they gonna get out? There’s no red light. You’re gonna have to
put a red light up on the interstate and stop then so that the trucks
can get out. We’re just going down the path that just I think we don’t
need to go down here. When something like this starts, where does it
stop? Pretty soon you’re gonna have them all over the state. I know
we’re doing a pilot, that’s how most things start is with a pilot. Then
you get a pilot, then you get a passenger and then you get a bus full.
I’m sure the highway patrol will appreciate ?? watch out for.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 370, a bill

religious activity in school, to create an administrative process for
remedying complaints regarding exercise of those student rights and to
clarify religious activity for school personnel.
General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dobson, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, this
bill originated from the event that happened in my county. A first grade
little girl wrote a poem for her school's Veterans Day program about her
grandfather's service in Vietnam. Because of her poem's reference to
God, she was told that she could not read it in the Veterans Day
ceremony. There were some other reasons for the legislation but that's
really what initiated this.
Let me say first, this legislation is not a fringe or a radical
religious bill. This bill received a 48 to 0 vote in the North Carolina
State Senate. Let me say that again, this bill received a 48 to 0 vote
in the State Senate. And for that reason alone, this is a common sense
bill that achieves three very simple things.
First, this bill clarifies what rights students have with regard to
prayer and religious activity. We believe that a student should not have
to leave their constitutional right to freedom of speech or expression
at the schoolhouse gate just because a speech happens to be of a
religious nature.
So the first part of the bill simply states that a student should be
allowed to pray, express and share viewpoints, possess or distribute
literature, express religious views in homework, and organize religious
clubs to the same extent that a student would be allowed to do these
things for non-religious activities.
Second, this bill provides for a grievance procedure for parents to
follow if they feel that their child's rights have been violated under
this bill. I won't take the time to go into the details of this
particular provision. I'll just say it's straight forward and I know of
no opposition to the grievance procedure part of the bill.
The final piece of this bill addresses what is acceptable religious
activity for school personnel. The first part of this final section
states that local boards of education would not be allowed to prohibit
school personnel from participating in religious activities on school
grounds that are initiated by students at reasonable times before or
after the instructional day, as long as the activities are voluntary for
all parties and do not conflict with the responsibilities or work
assignments of the staff member.
The second part states that school employees supervising
extra-curricular activities, including coaches, would be allowed to be
present while a student or group of students are voluntarily praying.
And if they are, presents they must not be disrespectful and may adopt a
respectful posture. Nothing unreasonable.
I want to say again, this bill did pass the Senate 48 to 0. This
legislation is not a fringe or a radical bill. Those of you who know me
know that if I thought it was, I would be the first to oppose it. Some
may argue that legislation like this is not needed, and in many
instances, I would agree.</p>

<p id="100:00">
I would just say in this instance the event that prompted this
legislation did not happen in some distant stay more liberal than our
own. This event where a little girl was told she could not read her poem
because of it's reference to God happened in the mountains of western
North Carolina. So I would argue that this legislation is needed and for
these reasons mister speaker there was somebody to support him thank
you.

SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you very much mister speaker. And members I hope you will indulge
me this evening with several comments but I want to start first by
thanking very profusely actually representative Dobson and also Senator
Daniel. Representative Dawson worked with me on several aspects of this
over the last week. I am rising for me at least after much thought to
support this bill with three caveats and I do that number one out of
great respect for the process that representative Dobson did. That has
to have meaning on the floor and it ought to be a model, and that is to
come to each other to try to work through problems to try to seek
solutions. I also will end up voting for it, because ninety nine percent
of this bill is faithful to the constitution. Faithful to the federal
law and while it may or may not be needed. Some view it as necessary and
to that I see their view. I find only one provision in the bill that I
believe to be unconstitutional. But because of representative Stanzamin
the other day which creates a very clear severbility clause. That
provision will in the end be decided by the court. I fear probably
sooner rather than later. And I will speak to that in a minute. But I'm
not going to vote against a bill where the rest of the bill is something
that I think is faithful to the constitution and because the people
involved worked very hard to try to find some middle ground. Something
we don't do enough and it ought to be commended. To my three problems
however so that it's clear on the record. I brought up an amendment
which I'm not seeking to have a vote on today and the education
committee. About the last page and section C of one fifteen C four O
seven thirty two. That is the section that says local boards of
education shall...I'm sorry the school employees supervising
extracurricular activities including coaches maybe present. While a
student or a group of student exercises their voluntary right to pray is
set out in North Carolina statue and at present should not be
disrespective of the student exercise of those rights and may they adopt
a respectful posture. And except for the last five words of that
sentence I believe it too. It's faithful to the Constitution and the
cases that interpret it and the law. But I cited to my collegues
yesterday the two circuit cases and their are other district court cases
that agree that that provision that clause is not faithful to the
Constitution. We had a good debate. And I appreciate Chairman Johnson,
Chairman Langman who will allow that debate to happen and that amendment
was voted down. I am sad that that amendment was voted down for three
reasons and while I'm going to vote for the bill I have to stress these
reasons are disappointing. For people in this body that are much older
than I am and there aren't many of those anymore and much wiser and for
collegues who taught me long ago. We really ought to be in a position
where often we accept ninety five percent or in this case ninety nine
percent of the bill we want even if it means giving up a clause. So that
a hundred percent of the people can feel their comfort level and so we
assure that there is a vesting by the public in the bill and we don't
create litigation opportunities to destroy portions of the bill. The
other options of course is to have the vote seek a hundred percent of
the bill but to leave a bitter taste for the rest who are seeking just
small compromise, particularly when it's based on...</p>

<p id="105:00">
Case law from other jurisdictions. That didn't happen yesterday and that
is disappointing. Second, there were arguments made in the committee
about the Constitution and many tremendous lawyers and non-lawyers in
here who have studied the Constitution and I teach as well. And what we
all know is that the structure of the Constitution of the United States
created a majority rule in the executive branch and the legislative
branch. That the only reason we have a United States and a Constitution
of the United States is because there was an agreement that if that
Constitution was to be ratified, a Bill of Rights would pass. Barely, in
many of the states and colonies that passed it. Whose sole purpose was
to be anti-majoritarian. Whose purpose exists to protect the rights of
the minority against often the zealousness sometimes and the inherent
human nature that the majority always controls and the majority wins.
The Bill of Rights, that first amendment, whether it is free speech or
free exercise or establishment clause, is meant to protect the minority,
not the majority. Because the majority will always have the ballot box.
And so when we talk about the prayer around the flag pole, it is meant
to assure that those children who want to pray will always have the
ability to do that, to their God and their spiritual person. But it's
also meant to protect the person who stands outside the circle, to not
be ostracized by their state, to not have a view that they are a less
equal person than the ones who are inside the circle. And so it is often
tough to balance free speech and free exercise and establishment clause,
and there is no easy answer to the problem. But on this clause, the
courts have had an answer. I read from Lee vs. Wiseman from the United
States Supreme Court. The principal that the government may accommodate
the free exercise of religion does not supercede the fundamental
limitations imposed by the establishment clause. The First Amendment
religion clauses, meaning that religious beliefs and religious
expression are too precious to be perscribed or prescribed by the state.
Third, for me, I am reminded often, maybe because of my religion, that
all the men in this room ought to take more heed when the women speak.
Because we as men can only know what we know, but we're never going to
walk in the shoes of a woman whose rights in this country were until 20
years ago, secondary. Because it was only 20 years ago that the court
held rights for our equal daughters as well as our sons. And second I am
reminded that those of us who are white in this chamber ought to listen
when African-Americans speak of their experience and what it means to be
a minority for them. Because none of us can fully appreciate that,
unless we walk in their shoes. And yesterday I asked my colleagues to
appreciate what it's like to be a member of a minority religion. To be
that kid outside the circle. Because the Constitution Bill of Rights
were there to protect that child looking in, not all the children in the
circle looking out. We didn't do that yesterday. And for that I am
deeply sorry. But because I believe fully in the whole Constitution and
I believe in the honor of this institution and I believe in the
fundamental rights expressed in the rest of this bill, and I believe
that clause will be litigated one day and resolved, against the bill but
leaving the rest of it intact, I am going to vote for this bill. I
appreciate you listening to my comments. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brandon, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
speak briefly on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized

Representative Glazier. I agree with most of them. I do rise in support
of the bill and I'm going to speak from a personal spin that says a
person that was president of his fellowship of Christian athletes and
continues to work with FCA today. This is something that we constantly,
constantly, constantly have to fight in terms of what you're allowed to
do as a student-led organization. And there are a lot of myths out there
and I appreciate the bill's</p>

<p id="110:00">
For coming up with this bill because it is clarifying language. It’s not
necessarily something new. It’s not something that’s not already
happening. We have lawyers with FCA. We’re constantly having to go and
reinforce to school administrators and others what actually is the law
and what actually does the Constitution allow students to do and I want
to speak to even the clause that Representative Glazier talks about. One
of those things I agree to a degree but what happens is that if you do
not give clear specific direction of what an administrator or teacher is
allowed to do, what you do is create an ambiguity. So I have other folks
who also start an FCA chapter or another chapter that deals with
religion and because the ambiguity you have some schools that do not
want to have someone sponsor that extra-curricular activity and
therefore you run into the problem of you cannot have this chapter they
can have that chapter because it’s noncontroversial. It’s not religious
based and this student group can form but we’re going to wait and figure
out and see because no administrator or no teacher would really like to
get into the ambiguity of should they be able to join or be a sponsor of
something religious. I think that this bill clarifies that yes you can
and you can do it in a reasonable way. You can do it in a way that’s not
disrespectful and I think that’s good for the state of North Carolina. I
think it does fall in line with the United States Constitution of what
you can do as a professional. I really appreciate the bill. This is
something that I feel like the people don’t realize the problems that
goes on within school. I’m a double minority in this General Assembly. I
totally understand what it is like to be a minority in several different
cases but I also understand what it’s like to feel something and you
don’t have the right to do something simply because you’re in the
majority. When I was in FCA, there were a lot of things that we were
prevented to do that I thought was against that and it’s been one of my
fights ever since I left there to make sure students have the ability
regardless of whether they’re Muslim, Christian, or Jew to be able to
express your beliefs. That’s what the Constitution provides for. I
appreciate the bill sponsors for clarifying it. I urge you to support
the bill.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady’s right is to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, with all due
respect to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I find myself in
really sort of an in between place. It really has to do with the example
that was used in yesterday’s debate and committee about the coach who
might pray with the team before the ball game or as they’re coaching the
team on the field before they go onto the field have some sort of word
of prayer with them. Whatever the example might be. I think we really
tread a fine line when we look at what we encourage role models for our
students to do. I remember high school myself when there was the
announcement on the loud speaker about gathering around the flag pole.
I’m Episcopalian. I have a devout feeling about my religion. I have a
very privately held faith and it just seems a little misleading to
invite teachers to set an example about religion in the schools. I think
that you all recall the bullying legislation we had not too long ago and
I think what this bill could do is set up a situation where it makes it
okay for the people who are maybe in the majority around the flagpole to
ostracize those children who are not around the flagpole or not in
whatever group it happens to be. I guess I just ask the body to question
that for a second. Are we setting up a way for teachers to set an
example for kids that this is ok to</p>

think it gives me pause and enough so that I'm going to have to vote no
on this bill. But I certainly respect my colleague, Representative
Dobson, and Representative Glazier for expressing themselves on both
sides of this issue. I will have to vote no. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jones, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be brief. We debated this in Education
yesterday, as was referenced, and I appreciate, particularly,
Representative Glazier's remarks and his decision to vote on the bill, I
do. But I think that those that are listening to this debate today need
to hear a little bit of the other side of the debate. In particular
regarding to the phrase in question, that he wanted to eliminate and now
says that he agrees with 99% but not that part, and that has to do with
adopting the respective posture. And I will just point out to my
colleagues it has been reported, it has been reminded to me many times
since I've been in the General Assembly that there is a difference
between the words may and shall. It does not say here that he shall do
so, it says that he may. We're not ostracizing anyone. We're protecting
the constitutional right. The right of people to be able to simply join
in if they want to be able to bow their head or to take a knee. And, as
was said many times in Education yesterday, frankly it's a crying shame
that we are at a point in our nation today where we even have to pass
these kind of laws or have these kind of debates, but we do. And
something has been said about, well, a judge might strike it down. Well
so be it, folks. We are, as far as I know, we're still a Constitutional
Republic. I know that many times it seems that we function more, these
days, as under judicial fiat where the citizens of the state can come
together and vote on something or their elected representatives can say
something and it only takes one judge to go out there and overturn it.
Yeah, somebody will file a lawsuit, regardless what we do, that has
anything to do with prayer or religion or anything like that. Somebody
will be upset and somebody will file a lawsuit but I stand before you
today and say that we need to do the right thing. We're not ostracizing
anyone. And I would just remind you, too, that prayer is a private
thing. It is a private communication between one's self and God. We
stand here in this chamber and we open every meeting, just as Congress
does, with prayer. And I understand that somebody is standing up front,
it's been me, it's been most of the people in this room and they offer
prayer and you can say that they're leading in prayer but every one of
us if we are bowing our heads or we are praying, we are saying that
prayer ourselves. We're praying to God ourselves. I've been in meetings
before, and even here, where I've heard things said, prayers if you
will, that were not Christian prayers necessarily and actually I'm a
Christian, and when I bow my head I'm praying as a Christian and I'm
praying in Christ's name. Around me, they might be praying to whatever
God they choose in whomever's name and that's the same thing here. We
are not ostracizing anyone because we are saying that a faculty member
has a right to adopt a respectful posture when they are in the company
of other people that are praying. We are simply recognizing that
somewhere out there there will probably be a judge if we don't have that
clarifying clause, and I would say when we pass laws here I think we
should be as clear as we possibly can. If we take that clause out there
is going to be somebody out there that says, &quot;yes, it's okay for
you to be present but if you adopt that respectful posture, if you bow
your head, if you take a knee or whatever, then you're breaking the
law.&quot; And so it is important that phrase is in there and I think it
helps to clarify the law in such a way that doesn't bring on those
lawsuits because, at least, our intent is clarified. And I think any
time we pass laws we should clarify our intent to the best way possible,
recognizing that yes, somebody will probably file a lawsuit and yes,
they will probably find a judge somewhere that will say okay. So I would
just, in the interest of time, I will stop but I think that people need
to hear this side of the debate as well and I would commend the bill to
you.

Representative Dobson, under the bill would, for example, fourth graders
be handed the leaflets that were on the topic of, say, God's view of gay
rights or secondly God's view of war or thirdly God's view on abstinence
before marriage? Would that be, is that included in the bill, to hand
out those kinds of leaflets?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As long as those rights are accepted to the same extent that
non-religious activities are accepted. It doesn't matter, you referenced
three specific things but it doesn't really matter what it may be. You
have a constitutional right to possess or distribute whatever it may be
as long as it's to the same extent as non-religious activities.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

violate constitutional rights of fourth graders, eighth graders, or
twelfth graders.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I understand the bill is,
as Representative Dobson said, about establishing the constitutionality
of religious expression in the public schools. But what is legal is not
necessarily good policy and I would submit to you that in the bill as
written, K-12, we are making it possible for fourth graders to receive
leaflets that they can't possibly understand. That they can't possibly
sort out, just taking the three examples that I used.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman does not yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To get back to what I was saying, it seems to me that fourth graders
can't really handle literature that, for example, speaks about God's
view on, as I said, gay rights, war, or abstinence before marriage. It's
really beyond fourth graders to handle that. So, to me it's not good
policy to have literature distribution in the bill, even though I see
that it is legal to do so. I think it's bad policy and it just bothers
me very much that we have included distribution of literature,
remembering that this is K-12 that we have included distribution of
literature as policy. And, I too, will not be supporting the bill.

Representative Luebke, do you understand that it's the schools' choice

Do you disagree with the Supreme Court's decision of, that there should
not be a viewpoint in discrimination?

As I said, Representative Arp, I recognize that it is legal to have all
these points of view and there should not be discrimination. Not against
Christians, any denomination among Christians, among Jews, among
Muslims. There should not be discrimination. I accept that premise of
the bill. What I'm objecting to is the distribution of literature to
children who can't possibly understand what it is and that's what I'm

true?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is, that's correct. I would also add to that, if I may, 14-20,
lines 14-20, it says, &quot;a student may be prohibited from engaging in
the actions provided in this subsection of this section if action of the
students would do any of the following: infringe on the rights of the

the rights of other persons.&quot; So I'd like to add that as well, so

Representative Pittman, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
First of all, I know it's kind of unusual for you to hear me thank
Representative Glazier but I do want to thank him for speaking in favor
of the bill even though he has some reservations. And I want to try to
offer him, and may-, I hope he will take it in the spirit it's intended,
I want to offer him some comfort about that because I know he has a
little bit of problems with the bill. As a Christian, I understand that
whether to receive Christ, or not, or worship somebody else, or worship
nobody, is a freedom that everybody has to have. Nobody can be or should
be forced to receive Christ or be a Christian. I have a son who has
rejected Christian faith and he frequently goes on Facebook and
ridicules the faith and in so doing pretty much calls me a fool and an
idiot, even if he doesn't quite say it that way. While I'm not happy
about that and it breaks my heart, if affects me about the way it
probably would affect you if your son beat you up with a baseball bat,
that's about how I feel, I defend his right to express what he believes
or doesn't believe. And I believe, as a Christian, because it is a free
choice and should be a free choice that, we as Christians, need to
defend the right of everyone to believe as they believe and to express
what they believe. And I will fight for your right to express your faith
any time, and to me that's what this bill is really about. It doesn't
say Christian, Christian prayer. It could be a Buddhist, it could be an
Islamist, it could be Hindu, it could be anybody. And to me, this bill
is about defending everybody's freedom and so, to me, that's why it's an
important bill. And as for your concern, and I understand your concern
about those words you'd like to remove from the bill, my belief on that
is if we remove those words , inevitably there would be a student-led
prayer, a coach would bow his head or kneel and there'd be a lawsuit
anyway. So I think it could happen either way and I just really,
sincerely, want you and others like you who feel the way you do about
that to understand that I'm not just fighting. You know, it seems to me
these days that Christians are the only ones who religious freedom can
be attacked politic-, you know, that's politically correct. But I
believe that nobody's rights should be attacked or taken away.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dixon, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I'm having enormous difficulty and I do not like to
interrupt but is the current tone of the debate relevant to the issue
that we're talking about?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Chair will take the gentleman's point. The Chair would ask
Representative Pittman to make sure he's staying focused on the
substance of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I believe I was because the point I'm trying to
make is that this is defend everyone's faith or right to express their
faith. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Schaffer, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Floyd, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, my seatmate to my left and to speak on the rules person up
front. I just want to know if one of those will yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Floyd, the Chair does recognize that either the Bill
Sponsor or the Rules Chair is in a position to state that point. We have
two other lights on and the Chair would like to try and provide those
members the opportunity to make their statements before we move to the
vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Schaffer, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To briefly debate the bill.

The lady is recognized to briefly debate the bill.

<p id="130:00">
I wanted to clarify a few things that have been said, bring a little bit
of constitutional clarity to some statements that have been made. As
we’re getting ready to vote that you would have all of the
constitutional facts in front of you. As many of you know, my background
is in practicing first amendment law so I know a little bit about this
and I just wanted to give you a little bit of information. Specifically
speaking to Representative Luebke’s issue concerning distribution of
literature. This is not really a question of policy or political
preference, it really is a question of constitutional law and well
settled Supreme Court case law. As we’ve heard Representative Dobson say
students and teachers do not shed their constitutional rights, their
first amendment rights, at the schoolhouse gate. There are some
reasonable restrictions on that which are included in this bill but as
it goes to religious literature distribution the free distribution of
literature has been upheld by the court as a form of expression
protected by the first amendment, in particular religious literature
falls under that category. Again, there may be reasonable time, place,
and manner restrictions on that. Distribution of this literature may not
conflict with school discipline if there’s substantial or material harm
that is caused, problems with the school discipline, then that may be
prohibited but if that’s not what’s happening then students are allowed
to do this and we’re not in a situation of opening up religious
literature, that’s already allowed under the constitution and under
Supreme Court case law. What this bill does is it clarifies it, makes it
very certain that this is what students are allowed to in school and
also set sup this formal grievance process. So it’s not putting
something up that is already permitted and required, the freedom to do
so is required under Supreme Court case law with this bill. The second
point that I want to make has to do with Representative Fisher’s
concerns about teachers and what they are and aren’t allowed to do and
putting them in a position of perhaps making a student feel ostracized.
We also have an issue of what teachers are allowed to do in the same
court case that students did not shed their constitutional rights at the
schoolhouse gate. The court said that teachers do not shed their first
amendment rights at the schoolhouse gate so there’s a very tricky
balancing act that has to be achieved. At the end of the day, teachers
when they are in their official capacity they may not engage in that
type of religious activity. They can teach for educational purposes but
they may not engage in that sort of a thing when they are in their
official capacities. I want to read a court from federal regulations
from the US Department of Education it says that teachers may take part
in religious activities where the overall context makes clear that they
are not participating in their official capacities. One example is that
they may discuss religious matters with students on an individual basis
if the student initiates etc. things of that nature. We’re talking about
non-school activities, when it’s not during the instructional day and
when it’s made clear that the teachers are not engaging in their
official capacity so as we ponder this legislation we have to consider
there are rights that teachers have when they are on that school campus
and there is a balancing act that has to be achieved between their first
amendment rights to free exercise as well as the issues with the
establishment clause where they are in their official capacities. So
ponder those things as you get ready to vote but I do urge your support
of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Adams please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you I’d like to ask the lady a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Schaffer does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Representative Schaffer I was actually going
to ask this to the bill sponsor but since you started talking about
extracurricular, outside of the school day. On page two of the bill line
seven from seven to about thirteen it talks about homework and artwork
and other written or oral assignments that would be graded by the
teacher so isn’t this a part of the academic program?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] When I was referring to extracurricular activities that
is what teachers are permitted to engage in in their own free religious
exercise. What this is referring to, the section that you’re talking
about has to do with the students’ exercise which that is no question
permitted to do, they are allowed to do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you. May I ask a question of the sponsor then?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Dobson does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Dobson can you speak to that area then,
how would for example it says a student shall not be penalized or
rewarded based on the religious content of the work and of course if a
teacher has a different religious, I’m a Christian, if the teacher has a
different religion or point of view how would we know..</p>

<p id="135:00">
... that the student would not be penalized, or rewarded for that
matter. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker? I think that if we have
confidence in the teachers to be objective graders or evaluators of the
material, I think that that’s what it’s referring to. They’re not saying
that they should be biased for religion or against religion; that’s not
the intent of that bill or that provision. It’s just to say that a
teacher should be objective and not evaluate the work based on religion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ll yield. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well just being a
little more knowledgeable about the arts, and you mentioned here it
talks about visual presentation. A lot of that is subjective, so how do
you…? I mean what would the penalty be for the teacher, and how would…?
I’m not sure I understand how we would know that. How would the board…?
It mentions here, that the Board of Education, that there’s a cause for
complaint regarding this, and I’m not sure I understand how they could
really determine that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would just say that if a
student – I’ll take my daughter for instance, nine-year-old girl – was
writing a paper in school and she chose to write it about her church,
she should not be graded on the fact that it was on her church; she
should be graded on the content, her grammar, the language, things of
that nature, and just be objective and not decide one way or another
based on the fact that it’s on religion or not on religion, and that’s
really all I can add to it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Avila, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady’s recognized to
debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It constantly amazes me down here how
we can read the same language and have different feelings and
interpretations on what we read, and I listened to Representative Fisher
earlier talk about the teacher serving as a role model, and I couldn’t
think of a better role model than a teacher who stands there and shows
respect for someone’s difference of opinion. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The question before the House is the passage of the House
Committee Substitute to Senate Bill 370 on its second reading. All in
favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The Clerk will open the vote. All
members wishing to record, please do so at this time. The Clerk will let
