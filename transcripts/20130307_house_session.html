<p id="10:00">
… discipline, applied to a specific set of statutes. This is not a
simple bill, as it can be technical and complicated, representing many
improvements and efficiencies in primarily Chapter 48 of the General
Statutes, the laws regarding adoptions. But as technical and complicated
as it may appear, there is little we deal with more important than the
best interests of a child and providing him a safe and permanent home,
in this case, through adoption. However, even though I will not tell you
that it’s a simple bill, it is one that should be devoid of controversy
in any measurable manner.
I appreciate the assistance of my colleagues, Representative Stevens and
Representative Glazier. As a bipartisan group of primary sponsors, we
bring you this proposed legislation. Let me briefly give you an overview
of the parts of this bill.
Section One. This change would clarify that in cases where a parent has
relinquished a child for adoption, the case is scheduled for hearing on
the plan proposed by the Department of Social Services or the adoption
agency, unless number one, the juvenile is the subject of an adoption
decree, or two, if only one parent has relinquished for adoption, the
other parent’s rights are not being terminated, and their consent cannot
be obtained. It also clarifies that the procedure for court review is by
petition if the juvenile court is not exercising jurisdiction or by
motion for review if the juvenile court already has jurisdiction.
Finally, the change simply clarifies that if a parent relinquishes a
child for adoption, then they’re no longer an official party in the
actions by giving up those parental rights.
Section Two. This change would allow a stepparent adoption to be
completed after the death of a stepparent, after giving notice to
parties who have consented to the adoption. Allowing a stepparent
adoption to be completed after the death of the stepparent would allow
the intended adoptee to receive any inheritance or other benefits that
the adopting stepparent intended. Requiring notice to the parties who
consented to the adoption before the stepparent’s death would give them
the opportunity to tell the court if they believe that the adoption
should not be completed now that the stepparent has died.
Section Three. This change would amend the statute to clarify the
procedure for obtaining an order that no consent to adoption is required
from a person who is served with notice and does not respond. Current
law states that no consent to an adoption is required from an individual
who does not respond within 30 days after having been given notice of an
adoption. Without changing any substantive law, this amendment specifies
a procedure for establishing that such individual’s consent is not
required.
Section Four is a conforming change to existing law. If you’re following
along in the bill, you’ll notice that in the current statutes,
Subsection A has been repealed. Subsection B refers to filing being in
accordance to Subsection A, which, again, has been repealed. Subsection
C is therefore the entire section, so we’ve changed the title of that
section.
Section Five. This change would amend current law to do three things.
First, clarify when adoptive parents must file a certificate that their
home study has been delivered to the consenting parent. Number two,
require filing any judgement of conviction of a crime that establishes
that an individual’s consent to adoption is not required, and number
three, clarify that required documents may be filed without the
necessity of a motion and order when they become available. These
procedural changes make the statutes in Chapter 48 more internally
consistent, give guidance on documents that should be filed with the
court, and provide needed flexibility on when documents can be filed.
Section Six. This change would eliminate the requirement of giving
notice of an adoption proceeding to a man whose consent to the adoption
is not required due to his conviction of a specified crime that resulted
in the conception of the adoptee. This change would deny a man whose
consent to adoption is clearly not required due to his conviction of a
crimes that resulted in the conception of the adoptee, such as first
degree rape, or rape of a child (adult offender), having a right to
receive notice of the adoption and the opportunity to force a hearing on
the question of whether his consent should be required. It’s been the
experience of some adoption attorneys that a man in prison for rape may
be tempted to force a hearing in the adoption of that child just for the
purpose of being taken out of prison for a day in court.
Section Seven. This change would add a reference to conviction under
rape of a child (adult offender), to the list of crimes specified.
Current law states that upon conviction, a person convicted under this
section has no rights to custody of or rights of inheritance from any
child born as a result of the commission of the rape, nor shall the
person have any rights related to the child under Chapter 48. So, this
change would supply a missing statute reference without changing
substantive law.
Sections Eight and Nine. These changes amend the statutory sections
regarding consents to adoption and relinquishments for adoption so that
a birth parent must be given a signed copy of the …</p>

<p id="15:00">
Sent or relinquishment but not also an unsigned copy. This change would
simplify signing consents and relinquishments for adoption by
eliminating a redundant requirement that the parent or guardian be given
both a signed and an unsigned copy of his or her consent or
relinquishment. For the protection of those parties giving a child up
for adoption the amendment retains existing requirements that the party
read the document and receive a signed copy of it. Sections 10 and 11
for clarity certain requirements for signing or relinquishment for
adoption that are currently incorporated by only statuary reference in
the statutes amended by this bill in sections eight and nine would
instead be fully set out in both sections. Section 12. This change would
permit the court to void a birth mother’s relinquishment at the agency’s
request if the court finds an adoption will not take place. Sometimes a
birth mother signs a relinquishment to an adoption agency or a county
department of social services for the adoption of her child but it later
appears there’s a birth father who refuses to consent or relinquish and
whose parental rights cannot be terminated. That means there will not be
an adoption. But the agency or DSS still has responsibility for the
child. This proposal would provide a procedure for asking the juvenile
court to undo the mother’s relinquishment and return the legal situation
to where it was before the mother gave the child to the agency. If the
child needs protective services at that point they can be supplied in
the normal way. Section 13. Like section seven this change would add a
reference to a conviction of rape of a child adult offender to the list
of crimes specified conviction of which results in no visitation. This
change would supply missing statute reference without changing
substantive law. Mr. Speaker and colleagues I appreciate your attention.
And again I appreciate the assistance of my colleagues Representative
Stevens and Representative Glazier. I commend the bill to you for a
green vote. And I stand ready to answer any questions you may have.
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, or debate.
Representative Pittman is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Speaker. I would like to ask Representative Jordan a question if I
might. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does Representative Jordan yield? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This is not a hostile question so don’t
think it. [COUGH] The reason I’m asking this is because a particular
situation I’m inv, I know about. If on the birth certificate it was put
father unknown and the father is known is there any way that that father
later could have any claims that this, and how would this affect his
effort if he tried make a claim later on. [SPEAKER CHANGES] But he’s not
on the birth certificate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Not on birth certificate but
he is known and he is in involved. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, if he is known
and, and involved then he his consent would be required to do an
adoption. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Other
further discussion or debate? If not the question before the House is
the passage of House bill 120 on its second reading. All those who favor
vote aye. If not vote no. The clerk will open the vote. [BLANK_AUDIO]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This has been a long bill in the works, over a
year and a half. We’ve concentrated on the statutory interpretations,
definitions, trying to get the language right and also I wanted to thank
Representative Stam, Faircloth and Glazier for helping us refine the
language in committee. If it’s in order, Mr. Speaker, I would like to
defer to my honorable, Representative Schaffer to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Schaffer of Mecklenburg is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And thank you Representative Hastings. Ladies
and gentlemen, House Bill 149, is, as you all know, inspired by the
tragic case involving a little two year old, Caylee Anthony down in
Florida back in 2008 and the subsequent murder trial in 2011 for her
mother, Casey Anthony. We all watched and waited eagerly on that day
when the verdict was announced. I believe that most of us were
absolutely outraged that there was not enough evidence to prove murder
in that case. But there was another problem. There was plenty of
evidence to prove other instance of reprehensible conduct by Casey
Anthony, but there was no chargeable offense for those things. What has
happened as a result of that case, about a dozen states now have passed
legislation to handle this very issue. Unfortunately, North Carolina is
not one of them, yet. But what we have here in House Bill 149 would
solve that problem. It fills in the legal framework and would allow
prosecutors to be able to prosecute these kinds of crimes. In short, let
me go through the bill with you very briefly. It creates two new
criminal offenses and they all hinge on the duty to report a missing
child. The one duty falls on parents or an individual in a care giving
role. That duty is triggered when the parent or caregiver has not heard
from the child or does not know where the child is for 24 hours. The
second duty falls on a third party. What will happen is that if a third
party has a reasonable suspicion that the child is missing, that third
party would be required to report that child is missing within a
reasonable period of time. There are a few safeguards that are written
into this bill. We want to encourage people to report, but there’s the
question of when do we report it, how do we know if something is really
going on here. We have a section there on immunity for good faith
reports, so if the...</p>

<p id="25:00">
individual reports. In good faith, they would be immune from liability-
civil liability as well as criminal penalties for that.  Also, we have
intent is written throughout this bill for the parent or caregiver. They
would be required to make this report and their failure, their knowing
or wanted failure to make the report is what would trigger the following
federal penalty there. For the third party, I already mentioned is that
reasonableness standard. There are a few other provisions in there to
increase the penalties for concealing the death of a child, for giving
false reports to law enforcement officers, and outright creating a
penalty for failure to report child abuse.  We have the requirement to
report child abuse but there is no attached penalty for failing to do
that.  At the end of the day, what we're trying to do here is save the
life of a child. Unfortunately, if the unthinkable happens, what we want
to do is provide prosecutors with tools they would need to prosecute
these kinds of cases and to achieve justice on behalf of those victims.
Thank you for the opportunity to explain the bill and I commend your
support for it.
[speaker changes]
Representative Glazier is recognized t speak on the bill.
[speaker changes]
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker and very briefly, I'd like to follow
with praise for Representative Schaffer who did a excellent job in
committee as she did on the floor explaining the bill and to
Representatives Hastings, Bell and Jordan for allowing full committee
participation and hopefully improving the bill and for my perspective, I
do think that hopefully this situation won't come up often but it is
going to come up and it is a bill that I think will help save a child or
two children's lives and that makes it all very much worth it.  And it's
really aimed at the person, not at the general public, but it is aimed
at people who know what is happening in a house and fail to do
something. Know what's happening in a family and sit by and watch abuse
and potentially the death of a child when they could have intervened,
should have intervened, and didn't intervene. And I will tell you the
changes that were made in the committee put in some ?? requirements  in
a couple of the paragraphs that make it clear we're not after someone
who just didn't know what to do or had some minor amount of information
or was scared to act. This is about people who should know, who
deliberately made a decision not to get involved because they - not to
try to protect the child who are in a position to do that and ten either
deliberately lied or deliberately misled or deliberately failed to
notify authorities and the child was hurt as a result. I think for all
those reasons, the changes in the bill really tie it narrowly to who
Representative Hastings, and Bell, and Jordan and Schaffer were trying
to get at and I commend the bill to you.

Bill 72 a bill to be entitled an act to amend uniform commercial code,

to remittance transfers that are not electronic fund transfers is
recommended by the General Statutes Commission. General Assembly of
North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blust is
recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, Members of The
House, this bill comes from the General Statutes Commission. It's been
thoroughly vetted, it's somewhat technical in nature and is necessitated
because the Dodd-Frank act that passed Congress in 2010 changed, and
made some amendments to the elec-, The Federal Electronic Fund Transfer
Act, which created some tension between our 24, 25A-4A-108. So this is
just clearing, clearing up that, that inconsistency and it provides that
article 4A applies to remittance transfers that are not electronic fund
transfers as an exception to the general rule exempting from article 4A
funds transfers that are governed by the electronic fund transfers act.
In addition the bill provides that if a funds transfer is subject to
both article 4A and the electronic fund transfer act. The applicable
electronics fund transfer act provisions will govern to the extent that
any inconsistent between, inconsistency between it and the applicable 4A
provisions. I recommend the bill for approval and hope you'll vote
green. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion or debate?
