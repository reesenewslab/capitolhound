<p id="00:00">
Ladies and gentlemen, we call the meeting to order. I gave up drinking a
few years ago. I've seriously considered going back. If we've got
Members around let's get them in their seats. Pages today, Caitlin
Devine, [??] Senator Tucker, Bradley Anderson, Lake Forest, Senator
Sanderson, Caitlin Hanson, Youngsville, Senator Barefoot, Alison Berger,
Raleigh, Senator Stein, Kelly Long, Elizabeth City, Senator Cook,
Caroline Peebles, Raleigh, Senator Hunt. Now, I was told how to
pronounce this name and have already forgotten. Somebody help me with
this name. Davilla Genaya [??] from Cary, Senator Clodfelter, Carlton
Rouse from Gastonia, Senator Harrington. We've got a lot good pages
today. We thank you for that, and our Sergeant-at-Arms, who always do a
great job and help us to keep things moving, Billy Fritscher, Steve
Wilson, Ashley Meakins, Ed Kesler. Today we've got three Bills on the
docket. One of them, the first one, we're going to have discussion on
the Bill, and we're not going to vote the Bill today. If Senator
Meredith would come up briefly and explain the Bill and then we'll take
some comments and questions from the Members, and then we have some
visitors to speak. Visitors you'll be allowed to speak for two minutes
and we'll go ahead with Senator Meredith. Senator Meredith on his Bill,
and we do have a joint resolution that we want to do before this to
honour Jean Preston and Senator Apodaca was going to be here to do that,
Senator Brown or Senator Davis. Do we have that resolution? Could you
pass it out? Do you have a copy? There is a PCS to the resolution. Do I
have a motion to adopt the PCS? Senator Davis, the PCS is adopted and I
will call on Senators that are not here yet. We'll wait just a minute. I
will take the privilege of the Chair to say that I am very honoured to
be able to speak on Senator Preston's behalf. She was a great Member, a
lifetime educator, I think she was even a cheerleader in High School was
she not? I'm also very, very honoured to have her daughter Suzanne as my
legislative assistant. She is quiet and professional, just like her
mother. But Jean served the State in a wonderful way in the field of
education and was such a valued Member here in the legislature, in the
House and in the Senate for a number of years, and we're just so
thankful for her service and I miss her greatly and I know that you all
who knew her certainly miss her who had a chance to work with her.
Senator Pate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr Chairman, at the appropriate time I'd like to move for adoption of
the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I've got a motion for adoption. But before that, thank you Senator Pate,
Senator Parmon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr Chairman. I will never forget my first year here as a
Member of the House, and very much interested in education, and doing
things I shouldn't have been doing. Senator Preston came up to me. She
said &quot;young lady, I appreciate you being so interested in education
but I'm going to show you how to get done what you need to get
done&quot;, and she proceeded to help me. In that first year we were
able to get scholarships for African American males to go into teaching
and she took me under her wings and worked with me the whole time as we
worked together on education and I will always...</p>

<p id="05:00">
Appreciate her for that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I, too, have deep appreciation for Jean Preston.
Of course, this is just my second term, but my very first term, one of
the first friends I made was Jean Preston, and it didn't matter what
parties we were from, we had similar concerns about education and about
the welfare of people, and often times, as we discussed bills going in,
she and I would sit back and we would chat about what it ought to be,
and what ought to happen, and the good of the kids and our education
system, so I have very fond memories of Jean Preston, and certainly, I'm
very supportive of the resolution, and so glad it was brought forth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My mike was not on. Thank you. Senator Davis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and to the members, I can say that I really got to
know Jean very well. Senator Preston was truly first class in all that
she did, and I can tell you in coming to the Senate the first time, and
you remember, Mr. Chair, sir, when the education -- but I must admit to
you, as much as we exchanged thoughts and ideas about education, and you
know, I thought a lot about those dialogues, I think the greatest came
from the conversations with Senator Preston. And one thing that we had
in common was definitely a love for education, but, beyond that, was her
Graham County roots. She was from Graham County, and when I came, we
faithfully spoke every day, it seemed, that we were here in session, and
she would always reach out to me and see how things were coming, how
things were coming along and I would say what a remarkable person,
Suzanne, not just a person I knew as Senator Preston, but infamously
known in Graham County as Pookie.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[laughter] That's right. Even that got out of Greene County, 'cause I
heard that. If you knew her, you liked her, I don't think she had an
enemy anywhere that I knew of, never heard anybody speaking ill of
Senator Preston. A great lady, and got a great daughter here today with
us, and we just say Amen to everything that's been said, and I see no
other hands, I have a motion for adoption of the resolution... and we
adopted the PCS earlier. We did have a motion earlier -- before adoption
-- let's go back, make sure, all in favor of the adoption of the PCS,
aye, any opposed, no. And we've got a motion for adoption of the PCS,
and all in favor, aye, any opposed, it's adopted. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I wanted to make sure we give honor to Jean, but
the family has experienced many, at least a couple, of losses, and I
just want to convey my deepest sympathy in regards to the entire family.
They're highly regarded, well respected, and greatly appreciated in
Graham County.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, well spoken, Senator Davis, thank you. At this time, we're
gonna move quickly through the agenda, and the first bill is Senator
Meredith's bill for discussion only, it's the Senate bill 474, the
Net-Zero Energy Schools. Senator Meredith. We do have a PCS, do I have a
motion for adoption? I do, Senator Parmon. Any discussion? All in favor,
aye, any opposed, all right, PCS is before us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think, Mr. Chairman, members of the board, I'll be very brief, 'cause
there's some people that would like to speak to this subject matter.
Senate bill 474 is an innovative way to build public schools. I'd given
you a chart that speaks to the Sandy Grove Middle School, it's a pie
chart on your desk, it will show this school was actually been built in
Hope County, it will show you what the traditional delivery would have
cost the school in Hope County, and it also shows you what the current,
based on Senate bill seven-forty-</p>

<p id="10:00">
474 bid to lower the costs of building this school.  I think this pie
chart speaks very strongly to what this Bill would do to help innovate
schools throughout the State of North Carolina, but to be specific about
it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Yes, ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Mr. Chairman, may I ask a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Senator Pate, those of us on this side of the room
did not receive any of the Pie.  Could we have it distributed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  We're supposed to get all the pie this week.  I hope
you get some pie over there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Someone in the front row was hanging onto the pie.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you sir.  I'll continue.  That kind of speaks
to what the cost would have been traditionally and what the costs were
based on the formula that's covered in Senate Bill 474.  I'd like to
refer to staff, if I may, to kind of go over the Bill.  Do you mind?
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Section 1 of the Bill on Page 2 of the Bill
specifically provides that local boards may enter into operating leases
for design and construction of net-zero energy schools.  Local boards
can already do operating leases for school buildings and school
facilities under current statutes.  B2 would provide a new section,
subsection, in that statute that before entering into any operating
leases local boards would have to go through a resolution process as
provided in the new language publishing notice of the intent to enter
into an operating lease and the resolution would have to provide
specific information that it is in the LEA's best interest with all the
circumstances and the process the School Board went through to arrive at
that conclusion to enter into the lease, and some information regarding
the private developer that they would contract with for the operating
lease.  Section 2 of the Bill would make some changes in the utilities
statutes that the net-zero energy school would produce trade-able
instruments in the forms of renewable energy certificates, REC's, and
there would be different credits that the Utilities Commission would
assign depending on the county in which the school is located, the Tier
1, Tier 2, Tier 3, which I believe deals with the economic development
of the counties, and the REC's that are generated by net-zero energy
schools could be used to comply with requirements for utility providers
depending on the underlying energy resource.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  You're up.  Go ahead Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you Mr. Chairman.  I think we have some
speakers that would like to speak, if they may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Very well, we do, and we will thank you Senator ??.
We will call them in this order and you have two minutes and Sargent
Long will let you know when time is almost up and then he'll let you
know when time is up and first off is Robbie Ferris. Robbie, if you will
give us your full name and who you are representing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  My name is Robert Ward Ferris.  I represent SFLA
Architects.  My company designs and develops school buildings and we, in
fact, did the Sandy ?? School that Senator Meredith passed out the
information on.  Senate Bill 474 is all about improving the existing
leasing statute.  It will save the taxpayers money in two ways.  Number
One, it encourages the development of schools that generate more
electricity than they consume.  That is schools that actually have net
production back to the grid and it supports the privatization of leasing
of schools and we'll go over in a minute how that saves money.  The Bill
is by no means perfect but it does get a lot of projects moving in this
State.  Currently, my firm alone, has about a billion dollars worth of
work in our marketing pipeline.  To put it in perspective there was only
a few hundred million dollars worth of new schools constructed in North
Carolina or put under contract in 2012.  So this could have an enormous
economic impact generating roughly 4,000 construction jobs by the end of
this year.  The Bill does include the assignment of SREC'S, Solar REC's
as either swine or poultry or other REC's.  We know that Senate Bill 3
is being revisited.  We understand that but Senate Bill 3 does exist
currently and</p>

<p id="15:00">
and there are not projects for the utilities to currently comply with
the requirements of Senate Bill 3 so this does, there are some projects
I think in the works but this does give a method for compliance and it
would be great for school development.  It will produce great learning
environments, far superior to what you can normally do, it will create
thousands of jobs almost immediately and ultimately it would save the
taxpayers billions of dollars and I would call your attention to this
pie chart.  Senator Meredith said this school in Hope County would have
traditionally cost about $53,500,000 to construct.  Hope County Schools
will spend a total of $16.3 million, that's a total of all these
payments, including utilities. That's accomplished in a number of ways,
number one, by eliminating utility costs, we've got about 4.2 million in
federal tax credits that went into the project.  We were able to
completely eliminate the interest costs, in fact, earn money on
interest, so again,  the total of all costs is $16.3 million dollars.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Robbie.  The next speaker is Patrick Ballentine.  If you will
give us your name and who you are representing.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Members of the committee if I may, Mr.
Chairman, if I may, make a  point of personal privilege, going back to
the prior resolution.  I served with Jean Preston and I can't think of
anybody sweeter and kinder and she was an excellent public servant and a
wonderful advocate for public education. I actually was her senator, she
said she voted for me, I'm not sure about that but she was a great lady
and I appreciate your time. Mr. Chairman, I represent, my name is
Patrick Ballentine and I represent a group called Robison for
Advancement.  The builder of this school the architect just spoke
about,is my client and it is Alumbe Construction Company that is looking
to be part of the bidding process on other schools.  This bill was
introduced actually before I came on board but they showed it to me and
I was very intrigued with the innovative approach to this.  Hope County
would not have built this school, but for this concept.  They just
couldn't afford a new school.  They needed a new school, school was
bursting at the seems but they couldn't afford one for $53 million.
This actually saves them about $35 million.  So I was intrigued because
yes, this is green, it is clean but as you know from a conservative, pro
business standpoint I wanted to see the numbers and I was just amazed.
It is going to help the taxpayers, it is going to help the children, it
is going to help the school boards, its going to help the county
commission.  We have letters from the North Carolina Association of
School Administrators, Hope County Board of Education, county
commissioners.  It is just a really good idea.
There were a lot of issues with the bills.  Duke Energy, the electric
membership coops, the treasurer's office, all had some concerns.  We
have worked diligently over the last few months to try  and alleviate
some of those concerns and we want to work with all parties to make sure
that this works for everybody but I just wanted to speak in favor of it.
 I think it is just an incrediably innovative idea and it is thinking
out side of the box but it helps so many people in North Carolina not to
mention the construction industry, so thank you so much, senators.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Senator Ballentine.  We have one other speaker who has signed
up and that is Lee Ann Winter.  Lee Ann.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Good morning, I am Lee Ann Winter.  I'm with the North Carolina School
Boards Association and I have also been asked to speak on behalf of
North Carolina Association of School Administrators this morning. Both
organizations do support this bill.  We believe it gives us another tool
in the toolbox for us to have more choices as we are looking at school
construction.  This method has also been tried successfully also in
Texas, Nebraska, Colorado and Kentucky, just to name a few other states.
 As you know, North Carolina for many, many years has had a backlog in
school construction and we believe anything that can save taxpayer
dollars, spread those dollars further so that we can get classrooms on
the ground faster is beneficial to the state of North</p>

<p id="20:00">
[Speaker changes.]...Carolina to school districts to taxpayers and to
children. Thank you very much.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Leann???????  At this time, we will go to
the members to see if we have questions about the bill. Let me make one
note for you. I believe the PCS means it is a crossover bill and, as you
know, crossover has passed so this bill...that's why it's discussion
only and I don't believe it will be eligible to be voted on but I do
wanna hear your comments because there's a lot of new ideas and
innovative ideas in here. I saw Senator Bryant stand first.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chairman.  I just wanted somebody
to explain the finances to me. I don't really...I'm just new to this and
I don't understand exactly how it works.  How can you go from 53 million
to 16 million and I really don't under...I'd like to...the pie chart is
pretty but I don't understand it.
[Speaker changes.] I (inaudible) ...exact figures so let's ask Mister
Ferris????? to come back and see if he can answer that one.
[Speaker changes.] Ok, to go over the pie chart in a little bit more
detail...of course, this is the traditional delivery project on the
left... the construction cost is about 21.5 million dollars for a
traditional project.  Utilities over 40 years would be about 16 million
and interest on a project like this would roughly be 16 million dollars
so it's three pieces of pie that are pretty close to equal. The building
will generate 30% more electricity than it consumes. Ok so that
will..obviously we're generating more than we consume so we've
eliminated the electrical bill. It's an all electric school, ok...so
we'll be selling some power back to the utility company.  We were able
to obtain about 4.2 million dollars in tax credits, mostly federal tax
credits...some because this was a low-wealth district and some because
of the solar panels and the geothermal system on the roof so that's cash
into the transaction at closing. And that money's already been received.
In this case, we were actually able to use some of the county's
?????????? allocation to eliminate the interest cost and, because of the
way we structured that debt, we are earning a million dollars on that
borrowing so there's no interest cost and there's actually a million
dollars in earnings. So all of the pieces of the pie that are shaded out
on the right under the lease delivery...those are costs that we've
eliminated that normally would've existed in a school. So the cost goes
from what would've been 53.5 million down to 16 million. And, to put it
into perspective, the county...HOPE????? County has a school that we did
for them about seven years ago. Their payment on that, including
utilities, is about 1.5 million a year. The payment on this...the first
year is $400,000.
[Speaker changes.] Follow up, Mister Chair?
[Speaker changes.] Follow up.
[Speaker changes.] Who owns the school and what are the arrangements in
that respect? Who owns it and who do they pay and what happens over
forty years? How do they keep possession of it...or use of it over the
forty years in this arrangement?  I just don't understand it.
[Speaker changes.] Okay, there's a long term lease so I own the
building, my company owns the building and we lease it to the school
system over...28 years, I believe is the term...and they have an option
to purchase the building and it's expected that they probably will
purchase the building. And we have...the way we're structuring these,
moving forward, is they'll all have assumable notes so the school system
would be able to purchase the building and assume the mortgage that
exists because interest rates are very, very low right now so it's
good...it's very good for them to be able to construct now versus having
to wait.  Construction costs have gone up a little but they're still
relatively low. Interest rates are very low, so that's another part of
the value proposition. And then, we haven't even talked about here..if
they waited two years to build this building, they'd probably pay couple
percent higher interest rates and construction costs would be higher.
[Speaker changes.] One more follow up, Mister Chairman?
[Speaker changes.] One more is it.
[Speaker changes.] Is there...the amount at which they can buy it? Is
that governed in the lease or is that managed by statute or is that
market driven...how is that determined?
[Speaker changes.] It's managed by...there's a series of accounting
guidelines that govern that.  There will be some small exchange of money
but we have to follow what's called FAZBY???????? which is a set of
accounting guidelines that governmental entities have to follow.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you. One comment I'd make here...not showing in
here, the cost of purchasing that building in the end...and you've got a
relatively new, as far as school buildings go, at 28 years
old...buildings of the last 50 or 60 years, and so you're gonna hafta
purchase that...that doesn't show in these fig....</p>

<p id="25:00">
...easier so that when you're looking at the whole ball of wax, we've
got to consider what that cost is going to be and you said you didn't
know, it would be some figure worked out or something. I think we would
need to know that before we fully look at what it's going to really
cost.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The county actually owns the land, so we lease the
land from the county. We lease the school building to the school. So at
the end of the lease, since the county owns the land, they could
technically take ownership of the building at no cost.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That building is what you said and I think that's
something we want to explore here, but I know some other members have
got questions. Senator Curtis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is the $16.3 million, is that the lease payments?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's the total of all lease payments, including
utilities and there's some maintenance items in there also.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right. Senator Cook?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't understand how, you said something about we
would earn interest on this. Can you explain that a little bit more,
please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. As the lease payments get made from the school
system, that money gets deposited into what's called an account, a
guaranteed investment contract, so that money earns about two and half
percent, which is a very low amount, but over time that adds up to about
$1 million. This is a bullet maturity so the bondholders get paid off at
the end of the financing which is a 20-year financing. So again, the
county makes lease payments, that money gets deposited into a guaranteed
investment contract and it earns interest. This is a very unique
financing. This would not happen on every project, but this is what we
did there and that's one of the advantages of the private sector doing
it is we find ways to put things together that aren't normally though of
being put together.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's definitely an interesting concept. Follow up,
Senator Cook?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I've always heard that if it sounds too good to
believe it probably is not believable. So I'm a little worried about
this. It sounds great, but I just find it difficult to believe that we
can save this much money. I think your point about how the cost of the
building should be reflected in this and I wonder about some of these
tax credits. If in the long run will they be still available.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One other comment. I have a question for you. Who
purchased the land to begin with since it's owned by the county?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The school system purchased the land to build two
schools on maybe 10 or 12 years ago and they deeded the land for this
project over to the county so then the county could then lease it to us
and that's what gives them the guarantee that they will not have some
ridiculous purchase price at the end. They own the land, the building is
on the land. When the land lease expires they get the building.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yep, but you didn't tell us what the land cost the
school system or the county. That's not factored in here and when you
build a building, you've got to buy a piece of land somewhere. I don't
see the cost of the land in the figures.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The cost of the land...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The cost of the land.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The cost of the land was $300,000.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right, well, that's a factor. And one other
question. This was federal tax credits because of a low income district,
I believe that would apply some places, but not too many places. But I
do think this bill's got a lot of interest out there. Senator Robinson?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Just one other question for the presenter, Mr.
Chair and thank you. I think it does have some possible potential with a
lot of questions to be answered in terms of how we construct schools in
the future. Since a lot of counties can't afford it. But to the
gentleman there, how does your company then, of course for business it's
about the profit at the end, so how does your company make some money
off of this arrangement? Where do you get the final profits from? How
does it benefit your company?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We make a fee on the front end to develop the project.
We don't make an ongoing profit from the project. So that the money that
comes in for the lease payments goes into a trust account to be held to
pay the debt. So our profits are made on fees up front.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And do you take care of the architect fees?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We do. We do everything from designing the building,
we develop it, construct it, we put furniture in it, technology,
everything.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right. Sounds good. Senator Pate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Who sells the excess renewable energy to the utility
and who gets that money?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We do, while we own the building and then once the
school...</p>

Senate Edu: 619:
Speaker 1: xx they will purchase the building between five and seven
years, they will get their access money then I would caution you
thinking there’s a lot of excess money    better charged by the utility
company and so there is not a lot of excess money and it pretty much
breaks even. It’s the goal. And  thereby utility, but there is not a
whole  lot of excess money because of  the demand  charges and fees.

seen Miss Hawkins here I believe that the utilities I have to purchase
something like 12 % of renewable energies are 12 ½ percent okay, Thank
you.

I guess that question I will leave for Miss Hawkins  if she might
answer, Mr. Chair.

by 2021, and it comes in phases and how utility is meeting the
compliance of everything but this one in poultry xx requirement at this
time. And earlier there was a comment that there aren’t a lot of
projects for us to meet that compliance and I would like to state that
is incorrect. We have a vast majority of solar projects coming up in our
new system. Thank you.
Speaker changes: Thank you, Kathy. I don’t see any other….thought/
Speaker changes: Thank you Mr. Chair, a quick question is this, as I
understand   the standard for renewal credit  is 1  or if you want if we
had multipliers may be as much as 300% will get xx
Speaker changes: What’s the rational thought behind giving a 3000%
multiplier since   or does that impact things like what Duke’s working
on? Are we going to lose interest or not??
Speaker changes: Who you asking that to? Senator Apadoca can answer
anything; he may not be right[  laughter]Let’s see if Robbie or xx any
of the experts can answer that.
Speaker Changes: The logic behind the multiplier is that these xx have a
very short life, about five years, in fact that’s been written into the
substitute I think that you will see it today, so while  a normal
project would have a lot of life of may be forty or fifty years, this
project , the racks?? At least in this project    may have a life of
only five years. So  it’s a way to recoup some of those expenses within
that life, short life.
Speaker changes: Senator Apadoca this is a final question from the man
from the mountain.
Speaker Changes : Thank you Mr. Chairman. It’s a two part question if I
may ask.
Speaker changes: Yes sir.
Speaker changes: Thank you Mr. Chairman. The  first question, who is
responsible for maintenance on the  school facility?
Speaker changes: I think I know but I would ask Robin.
Speaker changes: Okay we give the  school system the option to fully
maintain it or they can maintain it with their workforces, in the case
of Sandy  Governor of a school her county has decided they want us to
maintain the mechanical system, solar panels and the generator. We have
a very very large generator at this school. So we are maintaining those
things and they chose to maintain everything  else,
Speaker changes: Second question, What happens if the lease holder   I
guess in this case it is your company  were to go under   same
circumstances. What would be the responsibility of the school at that
point?
Speaker changes: The owner of the building is actually a single purpose
entity so this building is the only   asset that entity has and so if
something were to happen to that entity the school system could take
that into the xx over or if something happened to our company the school
system would take that into the , would purchase that entity they have
the rights to purchase the building and to purchase that single purpose
entity. So this entity is not entangled, doesn’t have any interest in
any of our other business.
Speaker changes: And that’s a really good question but I could show you
Speaker changes: Well okay to follow up on my question, if the entity
only has this one asset then the school system is just left holding the
whole bag, is that not correct?
Speaker changes: This is a bag that they would love to have if something
happened. This is , there was a team of  probably 20 lawyers that worked
on  that question for a very long time and [ laughter]
Speaker changes: That. .. that’s the problem, that’s why I say see where
you are going. xx thank you.[laughs] That really end the discussion. ..</p>

<p id="35:00">
...did today, but we have had some good discussion on a very innovative
idea that we'll continue to give some thought to. We have one other bill
for discussion on it, but I'm going to take House Bill 249 next. This is
one we can dispose of quickly. If bill sponsor, Holloway, I see him over
there and various others he's brought with him for armaments if he needs
them. Representative Holloway?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair and members of the committee. I
brought my whole clan with me this morning, Mr. Chair. But the bill does
simply what the title says. Substitute, or teachers when they require a
sub and use a personal day, have to pay, I think it's $50. A lot of
times in the school system they...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. Are you ready to vote?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're ahead right now. You've got a motion from
Senator Cook for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll hush. I'll hush.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right. Got a motion for favorable report. Any
discussion? All in favor say aye, any opposed? Passed. Who do you want
to handle that on floor?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You can handle it for me, if you'd like.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You want to pass? Give it here.
[laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I got one more bill for discussion only and this is
House Bill 269, children with disabilities scholarship grants. And I
believe we have Jordan, Brandon, Jones, Stam, who have we got here? We
got Burt Jones here? Marcus Brandon? All right. OK. Representative
Jones, I think you and Representative Brown have it. Go to it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair and members of the committee. The
two attorneys that are sponsors on this bill are not here today, so and
I understand it's for only discussion only. We can pretty much give you
the short version or the long version. I'm going to start with the short
version and we'll go as you see fit. Children with disabilities
scholarships is already the law. If you look at the bill summary, it's
already the law that they're entitled to education tax credits up to
$3,000 per semester for tuition and special education. And of course,
we're talking about families with children with disabilities. That's
already the law. The change that House Bill 269 would make would be to
extend this and make it basically a refundable tax credit. So what we're
saying is that it extends this opportunity to those that really need it
the most. Those that may not necessarily be having enough income, if
they're paying taxes or enough taxes to qualify for this full grant, but
it just extends the opportunity. Some of the questions that we addressed
in the House Committee when we discussed this really had more to do with
the current law that was already passed then what this bill does. And I
don't really want to delve into that unless that's what you want to do.
I would just say that the program as it is, it does help taxpayers
because it saves the State money. It does help schools, because in a
sense with the money following the child, if you will, the cost of
educating these particular children and their needs in the public school
system is higher than what the average cost would be. But most
importantly, it helps the children and it helps the parents because it
gives them the opportunity to make the choices that are best for their
children. If they have children with special needs with disabilities to
be able to put them in the place where they're going to get the best
services for their needs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones, let's pause for a moment. I
think Senator Parmon's got a question that can't wait.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I can wait if he wasn't what...but my question is I
know its current law but under this bill, how many families or students
would actually benefit from these scholarships or the tax credits?
Possibly?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Brandon?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Senator Parmon, it's a little
unclear of how many because the bill still currently allows for those
who are currently on the program to also be grandfathered into this
program, and so the number of children that it's going to be effected
will depend on really and how much we continue to allocate, and the
extra people that come on after the point of the people who are
grandfathered in. But this does extend it out to those families that
would, because of the way we passed a bill last year, which I'll let
folks know that the Senate passed it unanimously. The way we do it now
is that those who didn't...</p>

<p id="40:00">
If they have to pay income taxes, they are now eligible. That just gives
a lot more far reach, especially to those poor and minority families who
were not able to take advantage of this now. I mean, its the first year,
don't ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Now, before we go on, if Chris Nordstrom, I would like for a . . . To
tell us, we're actually doubling from the federal 3,000, we're putting
an additional 3,000 I believe in this bill. What's the price tag on
that?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Sir, the fiscal implications on this bill . . . Sorry, let me pull up
the note here. In 13'-14', its more the result of a timing issue. The
appropriation has to be made in 13'-14' in order for the money to
available to be distributed for scholarships. The tax credit is then
repealed for 14'-15', so there's a $3.7 Million cost in the first year,
$2.8 Million in the second year. The ramps down a little bit throughout
the five year time frame of the estimate. It's down to $2.1 Million, by
2017-18'.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I was told at one point there would be a net savings, since we were
putting a little less money there than the state is spending on those
children. I guess I was wrong about that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Sir, the original program of House Bill 344 that was passed in 2011, I
believe there were savings associated with that  bill. There is a cost,
mostly due to this timing issue of replacing the tax credit with a
scholarship program.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Okay. Very well. Lets see if we have some questions, folks. I think the
idea is one that is certainly worth discussing. Senator Bryant.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I was just wanting an update on how many people are currently using the
tax credit and the cost is of that, if we know. How many years has it
been going on, is it one year or two year?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Chairman can get staff over, we have Julia here who might know . . .
You don't know that information. Lets just get staff to answer that for
me.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Anybody have . . . Chris, I believe may have . . .
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Chris Archer, from fiscal again. In the 2011 taxable year, we have 619
returns that claimed the tax credit. Preliminary data through March 12,
2013 indicated that 485 returns reported an associated tax credit value
of $1.2 Million for the 2012 taxable year. Of course, 2012 taxable year
they're still getting returns, so there's not final number there for the
2012 taxable year.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
One more question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
One follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
One of the things I do hear from my community, and I'm not sure its
addressing the summary and I get some of these different bills confused.
Is there any accountability requirements, in terms of what is provided
to these children with special needs, by wherever the person goes? Since
the credit goes to the family, I mean, is there any criteria in terms of
how its used and what has to be provided, or is it solely driven by the
choice of the family?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Bryant, I understand that, you know, the public school system is
the one that issues the IEP, I think thats what it's called. The answer
is, yes. They do have to actually obtain the services. They can't just
say, I'm going to pull my child out of the public schools and I'm going
to get this scholarship. They actually have to show that they are
obtaining the services that they need.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
A follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Last follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Who monitors whether or not, when we pay whatever we pay, either the
child has IEP, we pay whatever we pay at the state supposedly for this
child to get services elsewhere. Who monitors whether or not that ever
happens or not. Is there anyone?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Bryant, I appreciate your question. From what I remember and
this is the PPI is in charge of making sure that happens. If you look at
the bill summary, in the section of the reporting it talks about PPi and
the requirements they need to do to make sure they accommodate the
program. But, I'll be glad if staff wants to clarify that further.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Last question from Senator Robinson. Then we'll have to clear the room.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I think I have two questions, several concerns,
one is a credit to the parent is one thing, but the assurances of the
service to the child with the developmental disability is at issue. If
the IEP is issued by the</p>

<p id="45:00">
The school system, Ben how does the school system make sure some other
school that they have no authority over and hears to the requirements of
the IEP and that gets back to the accountability issue. Is there
anything in this bill that says wherever the child goes they are
responsible to make sure that those criteria being made for the child's
need.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Those questions all revolve around who is here ?? of
the private schools that are going to be doing the program, and we have
got representative Stam here who is ??. May be he can answer that one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: The parents of the ?? of that, and they have also
suggested in the house that was defeated that public schools should keep
the hands on that, but the problem is this, this is like specially ??
what the kid needs to do for a physical disability is swim everyday. So,
they find a private school that's perfect, that doesn't have a swimming
pool. So, they use their money, under this bill, to go swim everyday.
That doesn't have to be done at the school. Same thing a speech
pathologist ?? the school doesn't have to provide the daily services,
but for the reimbursement to happen the parents have to prove to the
SEAA to get reimbursement that they received daily services.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Yes I follow this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: ?? follow-up center.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: When follow-up based on the answer I just got is
there any liability then to the school system if the child actually did
not since the parents determine what the child needs, and the Federal
Law has some determination in terms of what those services for their
child since the parents determines. Is there any liability issues for
the school system then.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: ?? the representative Stam for that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES}: I was advised by a staff previous thing, the answer
for that is no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Final question, we have got ?? for another committee
??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: I am not clear, ?? could help me better understand
how it is that this program appears to cost us ?? when we are saving
money in the schools by, we are spending more on the child in the public
school then this credit is worth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: ?? time ?? I don't think that this school not shows
the savings to the counties. Is that correct Mr.??. So the tax payers
are also county tax payers as well by ?? before Mr. ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: The bill that's currently being discussed is
replacing an existing program. There is a cast related to replacing that
existing program that has representative ?? mostly due to timing issue.
From the county's perspective the expectation is there would be no
change in the number of students coming or going, so this bill that is
currently being discussed doesn't impact the county's role which is why
there is no look at the county impact. The impact of the original bill,
there would be some savings there involved but the current bill, there
are no savings.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: We will take up a couple of those other financial
questions that I have sent to Cook when do we have to get a ?? since we
are putting in less. The public ?? don't want to paying less for these
kids than the cost. So, I think, somehow we have got to find out where
that trigger is. I know the start up and the transition is going to cost
that we develop those later, we have got to in the meeting ?? set up for
another committee. But very good discussion, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you.</p>
