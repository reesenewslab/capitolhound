<p id="00:00">
Good afternoon. Welcome to environment. I happen to be on my tippy toes.
I'd like to introduce our pages today. And if you'll just stand up and
wave at us when I call your name. We have Connor Christian from Pitt
County representative Brian Brown. And Ryan Dawe from Guilford,
representing Representative Pricey Harrison. And Tristan Best, did I say
that right, or Trystan? Tristan Best from Wayne, and he's here
representing Jimmy Dixon. Representative Jimmy Dixon, pardon me. Sabrina
Colias, all right. Well listen, everybody misprounces my name all the
time, for eight years now, so I'm glad I got it right. From Mecklenburg
and of course Speaker Tillis, thank you. And then Steven Dupre from
Duplin County, and also representing Representative Jimmy Dixon, and
hopefully Representative Dixon will be here soon. And then today we are
honored to have sergeants at arm Bill Bass, Joe Crook, Bill Morris and
Martha Parrish. Thank you all for your service. And we've got a long
agenda. ?? We have a long agenda today. We're going to start with Senate
Bill 38 because it needs to be reported out quickly. And so first of
all, we'll have Representative Samuelson explain the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Madame Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Madame Chair.
Madame Chair, I believe, shouldn't we put a PCS before it? I move the
PCS. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You're exactly right. I haven't chaired in a very
long time. Go ahead. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I move that we put the PCS before
us, on Senate Bill 38. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The PCS is before us. Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madame Chair, members of the committee,
this is a long bill with a number of parts. To summarize I will tell you
that 2 of them are studies. 4 of them are ERC proposals or are bills
that have already passed the committee. The only sort of tweak to that
is 1 of the bills that came out of the ERC, the Isolated Wetlands
portion, we added a study for Deaner to study a definition of wetlands.
Other than that it's exactly as it passed out of ERC. 4 of them are what
I would call permissive or allowable. For example, number 15, leases for
renewable energy, simply takes what is currently, wow, local bills where
all of these local communities have come and asked for leases on the
rooftops of their buildings to be extended from 10 years to 20 or 25.
And so we finally said there's so many of them, we're just going to go
ahead and extend it to all of them. So 4 of them are sort of permissive
allow. There are 13 that I would call adjustments or cleanups. For
example, number 2, the CND financial requirements for landfills right
now. All landfills are treated the same for financial requirements and
yet most people understand that a construction and demolition landfill
doesn't take the same types of materials and therefore this simply
lowers the minimum requirements for those landfills only. And then
another example of that would be number 23, to repeal of the waste
management board rules. This is one of those, it's a committee, a board
that was abolished years and years ago but the rules have still been
sitting there and nobody does anything with them so it's just cleaning
up those rules. So I called 13 of the items things like that. And there
are another 7 that I just said are other. For example number 27 is the
Senator Jean Preston shellfish reserve and that's simply setting aside
some property and directing Deaner to set aside some property to create
a shellfish reserve in the name of Senator Jean Preston. I would be very
happy to go through every provision in here if you would like but I also
understand that there are other amendments and there are other bills
that we would like to cover, so Madame Chair if the committee prefers, I
will let people just ask questions about the ones they have questions
on, or I can quickly go through all the provisions. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair? Over here. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
wondered if staff could just go through them very quickly for us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff can or I can if you would like, I'll go through
them and staff can correct me if I'm wrong, or you can have staff read
them to you. Whichever you prefer, Representative Leubke. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I'd prefer that staff do it, and you can correct staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We'll go with staff then, at your request. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sorry, Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I understand.</p>

And but I had all the hand motions and everything but that’s fine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. ??, would you go ahead, quickly go through to these areas for us?
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure Madam Chairman and I’ll just try to stipulate as much as I can on
your behalf. I’ll try to walk through these as quickly as possible.
Section 1 of your PCS would authorize the transplanting of seed clams
and seed oysters of a certain size from permitted aqua culture
operations and certain included shellfish waters to private beds if it’s
done so in accordance with aqua culture sea-transplant permit that’s
issued by the sector of Environment and Natural Resources. Section 2 of
the PCS would reduce the amount of financial insurance that owners and
operators of construction and demolition to breed landfills are required
to establish from a minimum of two million to a minimum of one million
dollars for potential assessment and corrective action at that facility.
Section 3 of the PCS would amend the statute that governs the approval
of onsite sub-surface waste water systems. Section 4 of the PCS would
amend a provision enacted in 2013 to provide for reduced flow
alternatives to the daily flow rate for design for waste water systems
such that in addition to exempting establishments, private dwellings
would now be exempt from the daily flow rate for design and any design
flow standard under certain conditions. Section 5 of the PCS would amend
the requirements from membership on the Marine Fisheries Commission,
amend the ethical standards that apply to those members and would
specify the circumstances under which the Governor could remove members
of the commission. These sections would also ?? the terms of the
currently serving members of the Marine Fisheries Commission effective
when the legislation becomes law. Section 6 of the PCS would do the
following with regards to rules forming agency review of engineering
work, require regulatory agents, authorities to standardize certain
regulatory review procedures, direct the creation of an informal review
process, create a pilot study of two ?? permitting programs to inventory
the work activities associated with those programs and identify those
activities that constitute the practice of engineering. And lastly,
review the working job titles of employees with job duties that include
review of regulatory submittals. Section 7 of your PCS would direct the
department to study ground water withdrawal permitting in the central
coastal plain capacity used area and report to the 2015 General Assembly
when it convenes in 2016. Section 8 of the PCS would make the following
changes to the regulation of activities that impact isolated wetlands.
It would increase the amount of isolated wetlands that could be impacted
without requiring a permit from one-third of an acre to one acre East of
Interstate 95 and one-tenth of an acre to one-third of an acre West of
Interstate 95. This section would aim, would decrease the amount of
mitigation that would be required for it impacts the isolated wetlands.
And this section would also direct the Energy Study one, how the term
‘isolated wetlands’ is defined in State Law and two, the surface area
thresholds for regulation of mountain bog isolated wetlands. And the
department would be required to report its findings and recommendations
on those studies to the Environmental Review Commission on or before
November 1st of this year. Section 9 of the PCS would authorize ?? and
the department of Aquaculture and Consumer Services to issue a waiver
authorizing a person to operate a vehicle and access a twenty-five miles
per hour at the State Parks Road Systems or the State Forest System
respectively. The Secretary of the commission may impose additional
conditions on any, on the waiver to protect public health and the safety
and the natural resources of the State Park or the State Forest in
question. Section 10 of the PCS would increase certain penalties for the
taking of protective plants. This section would increase from a minimum
of ten dollars to seventy-five dollars and to a maximum from fifty
dollars to a hundred and seventy-five dollars per offense. This section
would also require the clerk of court for the jurisdiction to report the
conviction to the Plant Conservation Board, provided that the plant is,
the plant taken is also listed under the protected plant-lists pursuant
to the Plant Protection and Conservation Act. Section 11 of the PCS
would direct the ?? to study ways to improve the timeliness of actions
necessary to address contaminated properties such that the property is
safe for productive use, threats to the environment, public health are
minimized and the risk of tax payer funded mediation is reduced. The
department would be required to report the results of the study to the
Environment Review Commission no later than November 1st 2014. Section
12 of the PCS would repeal.</p>

<p id="10:00">
A temporary limitation on enactment of environmental ordinances by
cities and counties. I would point out that this is a provision that was
adopted by the Environmental Review Commission in the course of it's
study this past interim. Going back to the sections, sections 12B and C
would require the Departments of Agriculture and Consumer Services and
Environment and Natural Resources to report to the ERC on any local
government ordinances that impinge on or interfere with any area subject
to regulation by those agencies no later than November 1st 2014 and
November 1st 2015. Another portion of that section would prohibit cities
and counties from regulating the use, sale, distribution, storage,
transportation, disposal, formulation, labeling, registration,
manufacture, or application of fertilizer. It wouldn't limit Deener or
the Environmental Management Commissions authority to enforce water
quality standards or a local governments authority to adopt ordinances
regulating fertilizers to protect water quality. Section 13 of the PCS
would direct Deener to treat a waste containment basin as closed an no
longer part of the Animal Waste Management Waste System if certain
conditions are met. Section 14 of the PCS would repeal the fee for an
undock oyster culture permit. Section 15 of the PCS would amend the
statue to increase a lease term of up to 25 years for renewable energy
facilities for local governments and remove the language that restricts
that provision to certain cities making a state-wide provision. Section
16 of the PCS would direct the Environmental Management Commission to
amend it's rules and the administrative code that pertains to open
burning without an air quality permit. To provide that in addition to
the open burning of leaves, tree branches, and yard trimmings. A permit
is not required for the burning of logs and stumps when certain
conditions are met. Section 17 of the PCS would direct the Coastal
Resources Commission to adopt rules disallowing the establishment of any
new and to repeal any existing inlet hazard area in any location that
are specifically identified in the PCS. This section would not prevent
the commission from studying current or potential inlet hazard areas,
designating new inlet hazard areas, or modifying existing inlet hazard
areas consistent with this section. Section 18 of the PCS would direct
the Wildlife Resources Commission to adopt rules to clarify the hunting
license requirements for participants  in the retrieve or field trials
including, out-of-state participants, judges and spectators. And in
developing these rules the commission must hold public hearings and
consult with field trial groups active in this state. Section 19 of the
PCS would amend the statues regarding the procedure for the EMC's
consideration of a determination of an application for surface water
transfers for coastal counties. And would apply that expedited procedure
to the withdrawal or transfer of water sort in any multi-purpose
reservoir constructed by the US Army Core of Engineers that is partially
located in the state adjacent to North Carolina. Provided that the Army
Core prove the withdrawal or transfer on or before January 1, 2014.
Section 20 would repeal various air quality reporting requirements for
the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the
Environmental Management Commission. Section 21 of the PCS would clarify
that when a venomous reptile is seized and anti-venom approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration is not readily available, the Museum of
Natural Sciences and the Zoological Park or their designated
representatives must euthanize the reptile unless the species is
protected under the Federal Endangered Species Act. Section 22 of the
PCS would define a ground water absorption system for waste water
collection purposes. It would direct the local health departments to
advise the owner or developer of any rule changes for waste water system
construction and would remove the five year limit on improvement
permits. Section 23 of the PCS would provide that the general assembly
finds that the Governor's Waste Board was repealed in 1993 and that the
Board's rules are no longer enforceable or necessary. The section would
also direct the Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources to repeal
the Board's rules on or before December 1, 2014. And prohibit any
political subdivision in the state from implementing or enforcing those
rules. Section 24 of the PCS would repeal the requirement for the state
energy office to conduct energy audits of each state agency and
institution of higher learning as a part of the Department of
Administrations Facilities Condition and Assessment Program. The section
would also change from annual to bi-annual. The required updates to the
management plans developed by state agencies and institutions of higher
learning to manage energy, water, and utility use. Section 25 of the
PCS...</p>

Would exempt from the requirements of the electrical contractor statutes
including licensure requirements, the installation, construction,
maintenance or repair of electrical wiring devices, wiring or equipment
by a person certified as a well contractor when running electrical wires
from a well pump to the pressure switch. This section also directs the
Well Contractor's Certification Commission to establish minimum
education, experience and knowledge requirements for each type of
certification for well contractors for the installation, construction,
maintenance and repair of wiring devices, appliances and equipment
related to the  construction, operation and repair of wells. Section 26
would provide that drinking water well permitting, inspection and
testing programs administered by county health departments must use
standard forms created by the department unless the local program
submits a petition to the EMC and the EMC finds that the area has unique
conditions that constitute a threat to public health that would be
mitigated by the use of a different form. This section also provides
that local health department registries of private drinking water wells
must be searchable by the address or addresses served by the well. This
section also provides that neither the department nor any local program
may require that well contractor identification plates include well
construction permit numbers, and directs the environmental management
commission to adopt conforming rules. And lastly this section would
provide that if the well location marked on the map submitted with an
application to a local well program has also been marked with a stake or
similar marker on the property that the program may not require the
contractor to be on site during predrill inspection. Section 27 of the
PCS would direct the Division of Marine Fisheries to designate a
contiguous area of appropriate acreage within the Pimlico Sound as a
recommendation to the ERC for the establishment of the Senator Jean
Preston Marine Shellfish Sanctuary and create a plan for managing the
sanctuary and on or before December 1, 2014, DNR would report to the ERC
on implementation of that plan. Section 28 of the PCS would provide that
gravel would be considered a part of a built upon area to the extent
that the gravel does not allow water to infiltrate through the surface
to the subsoil. This section would also direct DNR to use funds to
contract with the Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering
at NC State to study the extent to which different aggregate or gravel
surfaces are pervious or partially pervious. Section 29 of the PCS would
provide that when cluster mailboxes are added to single family or duplex
developments permitting by, developments permitting by local government
to replace individual curbside mailboxes, that the addition of that
mailbox must be considered incidental and not subject to stormwater
permit modification or required to be included in the calculation of
built upon area for stormwater permitting purposes. Section 30 of the
PCS would direct the Commission for Public Health to amend its rules
pertaining to the modification of accepted waste water systems to
provide that a survey or audit not be required for the installed,
modified and accepted systems in order to confirm the satisfactory
performance of such systems. Section 31 is a separability clause and the
act will become effective when it becomes law unless otherwise provided.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, thank you very much Miss ?? Madam Chair,
thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK, thank you very much. We appreciate
that. Representative Iler, I believe, did you have a question? We have
14 amendments, so let's keep these quick questions and then we will get
into the amendments. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK, I think one question has been
answered. Representative Miller says a amendment of that effect's going
to come forward. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK, I think some of the amendments
will take care of some of the questions, so let's go ahead and start the
amendments since we have 14 of them. [SPEAKER CHANGES] May I ask one
quick question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] And if they don't. Uh-huh, sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK, on the inlet, I don't have it in front of me, the
inlet, CRC to indicate the inlet hazard areas you picked 15 years. Was
there a particular reason for 15 years? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It's a good
question. It came to us with that language. My understanding is that
that was sort of a predetermined reasonable amount of time to determine
if something was going to change in the hydrology of the area and that
the intent was simply to take the areas that used to be hazard inlet
areas that really don't conform to that statute anymore and remove that
designation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK, I
believe Representative Starnes was next. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To offer an
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We had asked
if amendments to Senate 38 would be presented ahead, if you'll start
working on your amendment with staff. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, they've
got it. It's been passed out. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You've already got it?</p>

<p id="20:00">
We've already got it. Never mind. We're gonna wait and we've got them in
order as we're gonna have them. Representative Luebke. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Ma'am, thank you. I had a question about section 24. I'm just not
understanding why would we want to repeal the energy audit requirements
that the state energy office is doing and also why are we moving from
one year to two years the need to update energy conservation plans. It
just doesn't seem to me to be necessary to make this change and I'm
wondering why it's in the bill why we couldn't just take it out?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Anybody could, I think somebody might be amending it
to take it out. But the reason it was put in there was the understanding
that as this technology has continued to progress they've gotten so they
can sort of anticipate what the results are being and that the audits
weren't showing a lot of change from year to year and that's why they
were taking them out. I would agree though that if you were going to
change your plan every two years, it would make sense to look at every
two years that you might want an audit of something but at least it
removes the requirement. Therefore, if they feel like it as they're
modifying their plan that they need an audit, they can go ahead and do
one. It doesn't say they can't do one it just no longer requires one.
And changes the plan to every other year as things begin to stabilize
and the facilities people who are administering these understand the
system they didn't feel like it was needed for every year. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] ??? chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Harrison. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I just wanted to follow up on Representative ????? and another
one we have another section to understand the rationale for it.  On the
inlet hazard area I know that this something the  CRC has been working
on and is this something that came from them because it's so cumbersome
for them to adopt regulations or did this come from somebody else?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It came over in a Senate Bill, I will tell you that as
we tried to find out where it came from and what the motivation was we
were kind of getting mixed things. But all of them sounded consistent in
the sense of, they're no longer hazard areas let's change the definition
of hazard area. But it was in the senate bill and that was really all
the feedback we've gotten on it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Another quick
follow-up. On the marine fishery commission changes. We went through a
lot of work with the Marine Fisheries Reform back in 1997 to establish
what we thought would be a fair commission and I'm just wondering, where
this language came from for all the new seats or amended seat
requirements on the Marine Fisheries commission. That was a pretty
thoughtful stake holder driven process. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You are right,
that this can also be a contentious issue. My understanding is that
Marine Fisheries supports these changes. They were brought to me already
made, so I don't really know who made them. But, I understand that they
do support them and I think somebody might be here to speak to that if
we need them to. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually, we have an amendment on
that so there will be some discussion on that. Ok, the first amendment
will be Representative Samuelson. ATQ55 Version 1. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, this is an item that we thought was in the bill that was in
finance this morning and they thought was in ours and nobody seemed to
object to it. We just lost track of who had it. What this basically
says, and if somebody else, if staff needs to clarify for me if they
can. The gist of the issue is that sometimes you have a single project
that requires multiple licenses and in the process of going through the
multiple licenses before the secretary or Chief Administrative Office
makes their final decision, you may get some complaints or questions or
concerns about objections to what's happening. Whereas, if you waited
until you got to the end, at the end of it the decision might actually
have resolved the case is only licenses beforehand. So all this is
saying is if you've got multiple licenses for the same project, that
those objections will be filed at the end once the decision is made
rather than all along the way which sometimes hinders the ability to
even get to a final decision when the final decision may have been what
you wanted anyway. And so they're simply asking to remove that so that
you still have the right to object to it but the objection is at the
time the decision is made rather than along the way. And I urge your
acceptance and support both. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You've heard the
amendment, all in favor say aye. All against? The amendment has passed.
The Second amendment now is Representative Starnes, would you like to
explain your amendment 'cause I can't read all your writing but it ends
in TA39. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam, Madam Chair, and this
amendment applies to page 13 in the bill. What it is it deals with the
section where you're taking a protected plant and moving it from...when
the board reviews these things as percival penalties it goes from a
&quot;may&quot; to a &quot;shall&quot; and the Department of Agriculture
felt like that was a little bit severe that you....</p>

...?? of $2,000 penalties, so they just wanted to go back to the
language of May and that's taking out a lot of the lines but that what
the effect is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chair, this is not an issue about which I have
any strong feelings. I wanted to ask staff a question. If we make this
change is there any need to have the whole division or is this the only
change in this section, and that's why that whole piece is in there?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This provision, there are two substantive pieces to it
and then the effective date. Representative Starnes is taking out
Section 10.b which as he said has changes made to shale. Section 10.a
however, increases the fines for the taking of protective plants and
right now that statute only applies to certain counties. Section 10.a
makes it state-wide, so the Section 10.a is still a very substantive
section.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for reminding me that it was that other part
was in there, too.
Members, I don't have feelings one way or the other on this. I do
believe there are some members who do have strong feelings about that so
you may hear about it on the floor, but vote your conscience on it.
I will probably vote against just because of the way it came but not
because I have strong feelings.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion? You've heard the amendment and
those for say aye. Against? The ayes have it. The amendment passes.
Next we have several amendments, four, I believe, from Representative
Millis and we will take them. The first is ASB 109, version 1.
Representative Millis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. Let me get my papers sorted
here. This has to do with Section 12 of the bill and all they're doing
is it's a friendly amendment to actually require that in the actual
stakeholder input of local government ordinances that the study is
actually dealing with. It just DNR, as well as Department of Ag will
actually solicit and receive input from the public at large.
That way that as they're doing the study that the stakeholders could
have a voice and that we can make sure that we actually get to the
overall intent on the backside of the study. I would ask for your
support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't have any objections.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion? All those in favor, aye.
Opposed? The ayes have it. The amendment passes.
The next for Representative Millis is ASB 108, version 1. Representative
Millis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] With ASB 108, what this looks to do is within the bill
there is current language dealing with the Marine Fisheries Commission.
And last night at 7 o'clock was the first time that I've actually seen
this language and why I may belief in the intent of trying to take out a
little vinegar that's going on on the Marine Fisheries Commission, the
actual process of rewriting all the positions without some thorough
vetting is concerning to me.
I'm with the intent, but this needs some major thorough vetting, not
only from the rewrite of the actual member positions. For example, it
takes out expertise and just gives individuals who own land in the
Northeast, the Central East or the Southeast and it's my opinion just
because I own a piece of property in Hampstead that I might not
necessarily have a knowledge and an expertise to know about how to
manage a fishery.
And it's my heart to manage a fishery that is healthy and productive,
whether you access that resource by way of a cane and a pole, by charter
boat or even by a net. To me, this undermines what we currently have. I
know that there is some contention with it and that's the very reason
why that I'm actually pulling all of this language out from the bill, is
so we can actually have some further debate, some further vetting and
actually do this in a right way.
In addition, while it seems good, what it does is it strike some ethics
requirements that were a part of the '97 Fisheries Reform Act and then
flips it to some standard ethics requirements here. That's problematic
because you have individuals who are appointed to be a part of this
fisheries commission and then just because by way of their expertise
that they actually sell a shrimp or sell a fish or run a charter boat,
you're taking away their vote on the issues that may actually have to do
with them having an expertise in the charter boat.</p>

recreational aspect or actually they sell other commercial fish so again
this needs further vetting I think it is just wise for us to pull all
this out take a prudent look at it and I  strongly ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand your concern with it I'm gonna disagree with this amendment
Deener helped put this language together the marine fishery supports it,
we do have in there one person who is required to have experience in
recreational fisherman and one person who is required to have experience
in commercial fisherman to try to balance it out, I know that members of
the house and the senate have looked at this and agree with it it is
often a contentious issue but they're ready to move forward and the fact
that we've got both Deener and marine fishery's support for it I would
urge your support as well not for the amendment to defeat the amendment
but keep the existing language.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Iler.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chair I would agree with my colleague representative
Millis on this and this study this long session issue it's not something
that I saw it the last 24 hours myself and I am from the coast I know
there's opposition at least from the North Carolina officials
association from the actual industry and we need to pull this out study
it and come back a long session and try to make improvements after [??].
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chairman you know I'm from the mountains I can't see
coast from where I am and I've got to support my coastal representative
so I would urge the passage of this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will make one correction let me add one thing the bit about the ethics
I forgot to mention this on the ethics piece that's actually in the
budget so the ethics piece was moved into the budget I'm not sure why
they got separated but I want you to know that's where that went.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Millis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mrs chair of course the budget is in conference so therefore
everything is at play also I wanna mention by the aspects is I
definitely support our administration and I think it's very important
that we definitely have their input but the issue is that the
administration has put this in without any deliberation by the
legislative body and this is our authority to deliberate this and to
actually decide what's good on behalf of the citizen so I definitely
believe in the process and the process is that administration can make
proposals but it's supposed to be actually deliberated by the body here
and I say that we just definitely stand for the citizen no matter how
they access the resource again by way of aligning a pole by way of a
charter boat by way of the net we should be here trying to make
decisions for a healthy fishery a healthy fish stock so anybody and
everybody can access it to the benefit of their own personal pursuit and
I definitely ask for the urge of your support to this amendment and us
to move on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Harrison.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chair and I just got [??] the arguments [??] made in
favor of this but I agree having worked on the marine fishery's reform
back when it was enacted in 1997 we spent years pulling together what we
thought was the appropriate stake holders to have them put on who should
be sitting in the marine fishery's commission so I agree this is an
issue that should not be addressed in a multiple [??] laws it's just
something that needs separate attention and separate discussion so I
hardly endorse representative Millis's amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion here seeing none we are gonna vote on
representative Millis's amendment all in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
all opposed no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
the ayes have it the amendment passes I have a statement from staff on
these amendments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chair just wanted to point out some of you may have
noticed a couple of the amendments are off by a line or two so we just
[??] your indulgence that make that technical correction when we engross
all the adopted amendments into the PCS at the end of the committee
meeting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Don't hold that against us, okay next another Millis amendment my you
were busy in between your last committee and this one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mrs chair and I apologize to the members I don't wanna take a
lot of committee time but again I've only had a few hours here to kinda
right some wrongs so again if can bear with me as we go through this
vetting process and the amendment before you right now is ASB107 and
this has to do with the isolated wetlands regulation and just to back up
a little bit I'll actually give you all the short story the short story
is as a member of ERC as this [??] this issue was rolling out language
and [??] that language was presented to the ERC committee I contacted
the chairs and I asked if they would be supportive of me actually
clarifying their intent but having some more specificity of what needed
to be regulated my heart is that we most certainly need to protect our
environment.

...that may not fall under federal jurisdiction. And this proposed
amendment does not erode any environmental protections but what it does
is it put further clarification around what it is that we need to
protect. We want to make sure that our agencies have the proper
perspective of what needs to be preserved and this amendment does that.
I've tied some language, I don't know if ya'll saw this as a separate
hand-out, in the prose-prose amendment on lines 21-36 you see that we
tie isolated wetlands to a north climate wetland assessment manual. And
I gave you the two definitions in that manual. And the manual is very
specific that it actually addresses what should should be deemed as
isolated wetlands.It covers vernal pools, it covers I(??)depressions, it
covers mountain bogs. This is a good guide to put a further fence around
this. I'll end with this, on this first initial comment. Is that what we
want to do is we want to have certainty for your constituents that a
cloud is not looming over them at all times. Where the department can
show up on their property and take a cattle pond who has dirt sitting
along the edges and claim that as isolated wetlands. Or, to actually
take a tire tracker depression and claim that as isolated wetlands. We
want to make sure that we protect what needs to be protected from an
environmental standpoint and those things that are significant that we
give the actual private property rights due to our citizens. So, on
behalf of the certainty and the protection of our environment I ask for
your support of this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative (??)
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madame Chair. On this particular amendment while I agree with
the passion and the desire to protect our environment as well as to
protect our property owners from unfair declaration of their property as
an isolated wetland, this bill goes way beyond that. I will say
Representative's background, ERC. This was a real contentious issue last
session. ERC put together a task force. The language that is in your
bill is what came out of the that task force out of two days of meeting
where we had a public hearing and invited all groups to come up and tell
us what they liked or didn't like about the existing rule that Dener(?)
has on isolated wetlands. Representative Millis was not on that task
force, he did come to me right as we were presenting the bill to ERC, or
during the times we were presenting the bill to ERC. But, unfortunately
there was not time to amend what was then already the task force
recommendation. I told him he would have a chance to share it in
committee so this is his chance to share it in committee. I have
problems with it on a variety of fronts. The bill that is in front of
you came from the ERC. It takes, right now there's a rule in Deener that
says, if it's a third of an acre east of I-95 and a tenth of an acre
west of I-95 then it has to mitigated and I believe it's two-to-one.
What we came up with was we said, &quot;OK, let's make it an acre east
of I-95 and a third of an acre west of I-95 and it's a one-to-one
mitigation. The reason for doing that wast to get rid of the kinds of
things that he legitimately brought up. Which is where you have a truck
that get's stuck in a ditch and creates a ditch and some grass grows
around it and somebody calls it an isolated wetland. None of us want
that to happen but I don't know the last time I saw a ditch that covered
a full acre east of 95 or a full third of an acre west of 95. With clay
soil you just don't get that big a ditch. So, the goal of having those
increased limits was to avoid what were considered some of the arbitrary
issues with wetlands. The other thing that we looked at when we were
with Deener was how to do you define a wetland. And they went through
with us,it has to do with the type of soil,and the depth of the soil,
and the type of plant, and all the kinds of things Representative
Millis' has laid out. But they said they already had that defined. They
already have within their rule structure a definition for it. So, we
didn't feel at that point we needed a different definition. The
definition that Representative Millis has brought forth may come from a
viable source but it's not the source that Deener's using right now. And
so, what we did add in difference to his and there was one or two other
people who had a completely different definition of a wetland. And we
understand there is an issue about what constitutes an isolated wetland.
So, what we did put in there is we required Deener to come back to us by
November and let us know how they're defining isolated wetland so that
if there's some problem after that. You've increased the size, you've
decreased the mitigation rate, if you don't like the definition that
they've come up with then let's go and change it. But I had concerns
that taking a definition that has not been thoroughly vetted, we have
not heard everybody's opinion on it. There seems to be some disagreement
as to whether this goes to far, whether it basically says no isolated
wetland in the state would qualify for this. I just feel like this is
something that needs way more discussion and that...</p>

for right now to take it up into the long session this will protect
property owners while at the same time allowing Deener[?] to do what
they need to do without going overboard. So I urge your defeat of the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair. May I ask Representative Millis a question,
amendment sponsor?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Representative Millis, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Millis, I know us in the west, or west of 95 were a
little concerned with a third acre and east of 95 being an acre. Can you
explain to me what difference your amendment does in that area on the
thresholds?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager, on line 12 the actual language is consistent with
actually providing uniform protection of our environment regardless if
it's east or west. Therefore we want to treat all of our property owners
and all of our citizens and all of the aspects of our ecosystem the same
regardless if you're east or west. If these aspects are important to
protect by way of a threshold then so be it. But in regard to this
moving forward, thresholds aren't necessarily that important to me as
much as it is to be very defined about what we're going to protect
versus what we're not. But my understanding was that no one had any
issue about the thresholds including because it basically came from the
Senate and, of course, this is going to be a part of conference so if
people don't like the thresholds, understood. But, of course, my focus
is on the overall definition. And I will say this, members need to
understand this, is that since the federal ruling of ?? which deals with
federal regulated wetlands is that the way that the current EMC rules
stand is that there not authority to regulate isolated wetlands. When we
put something in the statute we are codifying in law the ability for our
agencies to now regulate isolated wetlands. So I say, if we are going to
do such, that we do so that provides certainty and is very, very defined
and I just think that this is an important process to move through.
While I understand that the task force met for two days, I've been
working for two months with stakeholders on this issue, for members of
EMC, all the way around. So I, this is something that's very thorough
and thoughtful. I'm more than happy for any type of alterations that
need to be made but if you're going to give statute authority to an
agency that does not have the authority to do it now then let's make
sure we put a fence around it so that your constituents aren't calling
you up and lighting you up for rogue agencies. I've been on the field
personally where I've seen a cattle pond with dirt next to it being
flagged by Deener[?] and, again, the dirt's right next to it just as if
the farmer's just dug it. This amendment here is, from my understanding,
supported by the Farm Bureau and other stakeholders and I ask for you're
support as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair, can I follow-up that long answer?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Millis, what does it set the threshold to? I
know Representative West and Representative Dobson and I are interested
in what that threshold is for the west, for west of 95, what is the new
threshold under your amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager, under my amendment it uniformly treats all aspects
of the state under one acre. So if you have a isolated wetland by this
definition, that it is above an acre, then all of it has to be mitigated
from a one-to-one standpoint but if it's below that threshold, whether
your east or the west, it's all treated the same. And I would say that
mitigation ratio of one-to-one is very important because what was
actually happened is that your constituents may have a low quality
wetland and their actually having to mitigate at a high quality and also
having it mitigated at two-to-one of what they're actually compounding.
So talking about making it triple or quadruple cost. This is a very
important measure to actually protect our environment but also to
protect private property rights and also their wallets.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chairman, I don't think we have time for me to ask another
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Quickly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh. Representative McGrady.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, I oppose the Millis amendment. I think what is in the bill
reflects a compromise that occurred. I wasn't real excited about the
compromise but I got there. Representative Millis talks in terms of
wanting uniformity here but our state isn't uniformed. The mountains and
it's mountain bogs are different than other wetland areas across the
state and that was reflected in the original rule that we're now trying
to address. We've rolled that back in this bill but to roll it back as
Representative Millis is suggesting, basically there will be no
protection for mountain bogs and similar sorts of things in the
mountains. That's why this rule is there. So I particularly find that
objectionable. This, in my opinion, doesn't protect what needs to be
protected. Now, with respect tot he definition of wetlands,
Representative Samuelson's got it right. We've suddenly got some
language and it's very, very long and widely technical. The better way
to handle that issue is the study that was added. This was not part of
the original ERC recommendation but recognizing that there is this</p>

<p id="45:00">
Back and forth as to what these wetlands are. Representative Mill's
suggestion here is probably a good one and would be incorporated. But
it's a broader issue, shouldn't be addressed here. So i'd asked our
coastal folks who made a plea for, ya know let us handle these marine
fisheries thing. To, with respect to this, don't eviscerate the
protection for wetlands in another part of the state. We don't need to
go there. This is a compromise. Vote down this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Nellis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chair. Just to add a few more
comments. In regard to uniformity, is that the definition that's
presented for you today, actually protects wetlands based on the
differing aspects of the coast, to the Piedmont, to the mountains.
What's uniform is the fact that we're stating is that, if we have an
amount of these wetlands that are diverse across our state, once it
becomes across a thresh-hold, then we're treating all the citizens the
same way. So, understand that the thresh-hold is uniform, but the aspect
of the species and the ecosystem, it's allowed to vary by way of this
definition. Also understand this too, is that immediately whenever I saw
the language come out of the ERC, or actually be presented the ERC. I
approached the members about actually providing some further
clarification, to not undermine the proposal, but, if we're gonna give
statute authority ??, to be able to regulate isolated wetlands. I think
you owe it to your constituents to do it in deliberative process. While
this may be the first time you'd seen this, I've emailed it to you as
soon as I could, as soon as I realized this was gonna be dropped in the
bill. I've also been working on this for the last two months by way of
regular reform. It's just as surprising to me as it is surprising to
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Representative Hager, and then Representative
Samuelson, and then we're gonna vote on this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chair, and real quick, us being from
the west I had to look up where I-95 was. Couldn't remember where it
was, well that's pretty far across the state guys, so a third of the
acre applies to the Piedmont, as well as the mountains, if you look at
the map there. I just think we need to all be treated, and I think
Representative West agrees with me, and I've talked to this, we think we
just need to be treated equitably in, in all this. So our developers
have the same opportunity as a developer, you know in the east, whether
your in the Piedmont, or whether your in the west. Understand there are
some issues of geography, but your taking out the whole Piedmont, a lot
of the southern mountains that I live in, and all the mountains, and
saying it's a third of an acre, it's just not equitable I don't believe.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ya know it's funny how equitable is applied one way
with coastal issues, and another way with these other issues. The dirt
east of 95 is different than the dirt west of 95. So, the nature of a
wetland east of 95 is different than the nature of a wetland west of 95.
And while Representative Nellis is correct, that he's providing
uniformity in terms of the acreage size. Once you apply the criteria
that he has on there, you wouldn't find an isolated wetland west of 95,
that's that big. In de facto, it's basically saying no isolated
wetlands. Because the one acre east of 95 already rules out 90 something
percent of the ones that were permitted last time. If you go above, the
third of an acre already rules out most of the ones that were west of
95. It's just leaving a few in there where they genuinely have, some
concerns, and some value to the community. The home builders, and some
of the other developers have asked for, the removal of the uncertainty
of ditches, and things like that, that happen, that come in here. By
raising it to the one acre, and the third of an acre, you are removing
that uncertainty. But by taking it to an acre all the way across, what
you are actually doing is saying, that, western North Carolina and
particularly, up in the mountains, where you have these mountain bogs
that can be very sensitive. You are removing the ability to even
consider, whether or not they have an ecological value. I agree that not
every isolated wetland is worth protecting. But, let's not throw the
baby out with the bath water, and say that all of them aren't. And to
say that it's not, already something that's allowed in North Carolina,
it is a rule. The feds changed their ruling, and I think that's
something that we can look at. But right now there is a rule in North
Carolina, and right now the rule is, one third of an acre east of 95,
and one tenth of an acre, west of 95. We're taking that one tenth up to
a third, that's a big difference. So, I just think we need to look at,
and recognize, that there's more to this than just an acre and an acre.
Just like fish hunt, ya know these whole rules on marine fisheries, and
the difference between recreational fisherman, which frankly are mostly
in the western part of the state, versus the commercial fisherman that
are in the eastern part of the state. And yet, we use the argument on.</p>

Representative Harrison, I can’t read hers either. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m
not going to take the blame for the handwriting. It’s not mine, although
mine is illegible. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry. This is staff. I just
can’t read that. We usually have a V, whatever. It’s yours? [SPEAKER

couldn’t read all that PCS stuff. Representative Harrison, please
explain your amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair, and in
staff’s defense, their handwriting is much better than mine. So anyway,
I am proposing to delete two of the reporting requirement repeals. Said
that backwards. On page 18, it says part of the air quality reporting
requirements, the bill proposes to delete two of the reporting
requirements. I’m proposing to reinstate those reporting requirements.
These are vestiges of the Clean Smoke Stack Act, which has done so much
to clean up the air in our state since it was enacted a decade ago. I
think it’s been very important for the… this would reinstate section 11,
which has been really important for the reporting of knocks and socks
emissions, and these are reports that have been going to the General
Assembly and the Environmental Review Commission, and  reflects some EPA
involvement to continue to make changes in air quality rules, and then
it would also maintain section 20, which is the requirement that
permit-holders annually describe how they are reducing air pollution
through source reductions and recycling. I think there are folks out
there who feel like both of these reporting requirements have some
value, so I’d like for us to retain those two pieces, and I’d like to
move for adoption of the amendment. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I don’t have strong feelings
about these reports. I will ask staff if they would like to comment. My
understanding is no one ever asks to read these, and we get them given
out, and nobody’s using them anymore; they were important at a time, and
that this was just to clear up and decrease the amount of work and
reporting work that they need to do if to our knowledge, there have been
no requests for these reports. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Samuelson, Madam Chairman, the reports which Representative Samuelson is
referring to, you can follow me in your summary on page 5. There’s a
paragraph in the middle of section 20. One of them would be a
requirement for the EMC to report on the desirability of requiring and
the feasibility of obtaining reductions in knocks and socks beyond those
required by Clean Smoke Stacks, and the… let’s see. And then the other
report would be a repeal for permit-holders to submit to DENR a written
description of their current and projected plans to reduce the emission
of air contaminants under their permits by source reduction or
recycling. This position of these reports is similar… our understanding
of that is similar to what Representative Samuelson had earlier
indicated. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All in favor of that amendment, signify by
saying aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed, no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think the no’s have it, so
that amendment goes down. I think that’s it. We’re going to vote on the
bill now. Does anyone have comments on the bill? [SPEAKER CHANGES] So
you mind? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Harrison. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair. I just… well I really appreciate the efforts of
Representative Samuelson and McGrady to help rid this bill of some of
the most offensive provisions that came over to us from the Senate,
including the air quality monitoring piece. I think there are lots of
problems still with this bill. I’m troubled by the landfill requirement
for the C&amp;D landfills. I’m very troubled by the isolated wetlands.
I’m glad that Representative Millis’ amendment was defeated, but I think
that the fact that we are removing protection from isolated wetlands to
the extent we are is problematic for water storage and water quality and
water supply and all those reasons that wetlands are important. I’m very
troubled by the local authority. I’m glad it’s a scaled-down version of
the constraints on local authority, but I think that we should not be
going there. I’m also concerned about the inland hazard language. Having
been on the CRC and worked on these issues, it’s very controversial and
I don’t know that this is the vehicle where we should be doing this. I’m
concerned about the air quality reporting requirements. So while I
appreciate ya’ll’s efforts to make this a better bill, I’m still
concerned about it and I will be voting no.</p>

representative Mcgrady.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I appreciate representative Harrison's acknowledgment that the bill that
we've got here is better than one if we just took all the environmental
provisions that were in the senates' bill and roll them into this I do
think that this is a compromise I can't say every provision here I'm
widely excited about but on the whole I think we've done a good job and
again like many bills large portions of this bill are totally non
controversial so I support the bill and madam chair at the appropriate
time I'd like to make a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you at the appropriate time representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chair I heard a lot from my constituents about the air
quality monitoring closure of some of those sights so I know it's gone
and I appreciate that I get very bothered whenever you have like in
section 3 of the bill telling the commission and the department that
they may not delay or deny approval it just seems to me that we ought
not be going I just give that as an example in section 3 we got places
where we're telling the agencies that are working on these issues at the
commit the department [??] that they may not do something it just seems
to me to be too strong and the kind of thing that we ought to stay away
from because we do have technical expertise in these divisions so it's
bothersome to me and join representative Harrison in opposing the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any more comments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just wanted to madam chair if representative Samuelson would tell us
why we need these strict prohibitions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chair I was going to address yours on that particular
issue it says they may not refuse to do it on the basis of density this
bolt density apparently we're one of the only states in the country that
has this density requirement and the way it usually works now is because
of the density requirement the only thing that they can use is gravel
and so this is an alternative way to meet the same concerns but they're
getting pushed back on this one density requirement so the department
can refuse it on other basis they just can't refuse it just on the
density basis so we figured if we were the only one in the state plus
the people who manufacture this product are here in North Carolina and
this is the only state they can sell it in so that was what was behind
that one but on the other things I appreciate your support particularly
on the isolated wetlands.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson I'm sorry there was one more comment from
representative Insko.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chairman I have a problem with the concern about the
section 13 the closure of certain animal waste contamination basis
specifically I would like well probably try to work to get an amendment
to exempt public supply water sheds we have an issue on king creek that
is an old lagoon but it has a beef kettle [??] directly above it and
that is within a thousand feet of our water intake for our water supply
so I would like to discuss this with some other people about exempting
public sector of supply water sheds.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
and we would be okay with that I don't think the narrowness of this
would affect that but if it does I don't have a problem with limiting it
in that way.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further comments representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
okay as I was saying thank you all for this [??] we really have tried to
do this in a way that respects the wishes and concerns of as many people
as possible I appreciate your support on the isolated wetlands this has
been a contentious issue for years and I do hope we'll keep in mind that
as we did with gravel dirt is different in different places so we do
have to treat it differently and you can't assume that what works on the
coast is actually gonna work in the mountains or in the [??] where we
have a whole lot of clay so I know that it will probably come back up on
the floor I would request your support of that but also to support the
bill and we're open for more questions if anybody has it [??] your
support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
okay we're ready to vote then all in favor of oh what representative yes
you do I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm gonna make a motion my motion would be to give a favorable [??] of
the bill as amended rolled into a new committee PCS unfavorable as to
the original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam chair just a point of clarification.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
yes.

Bill comes out of this committee presently it has a serial referral to
transportation. That will be stricken when we go back into session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK, good, so we won't have to mention that referral at
all. OK. You heard the motion from Representative Grady. Thank him so
much for reminding me twice today to make motions. Anyway, you heard the
motion, all in favor please respond by saying aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed, no. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The ayes have it. The Senate Bill 38 heads to the floor. Thank
you very much. OK, no, we're not through, sit back down. We've got
several more bills to go through quickly here. Representative Hager,
House Bill 1057. OK. It's a PCS and Representative Catlin makes the
motion to have that PCS before us. How bout that Representative McGrady?
Will you explain your. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chairwoman.
It's a study bill and basically the title tells you everything as I
direct it. Department DNR to study the strategies, to talk about
interbasin transfers. We want to re look at that. We had a review
commission to try to look at what water supplies would look like within
the subbasins themselves. We want DNR to kind of look at those subbasins
to determine if there's new rules needed to assure water and water
quality in the individual subbasins themselves. Madam Chairwoman, I move
for its adoption. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Iler. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I'm for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion?
Representative Iler, I think we're ready for your motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] This is not a PCS. This is approval of House Bill 1057.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It is a PCS. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Approve the PCS to
House Bill 1057, unfavorable to the original. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam
Chair. Madam Chair I just want to note that we literally got the copy of
the bill and the bill summary as Representative Iler was making his
motion. Can we not slow things up enough, please, so that we can at
least have it in front of us. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely. Would you
like to have time to read that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] If I may just ask
Representative Hager a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Of course, Representative. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Are you, I think
I'm seeing here that this is a study only bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke it is a study only bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you. And Ma'am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Any further questions?
Representative Iler for your motion again. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Move for
favorable report for PCS for House Bill 1057, unfavorable to the
original. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All in favor of that motion say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, no. OK, House bill
1057, PCS for House Bill 1057 has passed. Next we have Representative
Torbett and Brody for House Bill 1105. This is not a PCS. Would you
explain your House Bill? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. These
next two bills come from the Interim Committee on Land Development and
they're going to be pretty short and I'll get right to the point. This
particular one requires that if a colony is going to take over the
erosion and sedimentary control program over from DNR that they take
over all the properties in that program and not be selective on which
ones they want. That's basically it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And that's House
Bill 1107. Representative McGrady. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd recommend the
bill to you. Henderson County went through such a transition in the past
and got sort of caught in the middle and this it would have if it had
been in effect would have been a positive thing. I think Representative
Hager and I both served also on this committee and I believe it's a good
bill and I'm willing to make a motion at the appropriate time. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] OK, we do have a technical amendment that's being passed out
right now, ATA 61 version 1. Who's going to explain that? OK. Staff will
explain</p>

<p id="70:00">
A technical amendment. Has everyone gotten that? Technical amendment.
They're passing it out right now. The technical amendment. Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chairwoman. The technical amendment
just simply removes the word soil because that's kind of old school
language and modern language is just erosion control, not soil erosion
control, so we just removed the world soil. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Move for
the adoption of the amendment if that's in order. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK,
you've heard the, OK. Anyone have a question about the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Is this mountain soil or coastal soil or peat moss soil, what
kind of soil is it? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It's ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Bill had
the same question too. You know, barbecue is different east to west,
maybe soil is too. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm from Cleveland County. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] How many ways to say soil out there? It's &quot;sawl,&quot;
it's called &quot;sawl&quot; out in the west. It's &quot;sawl.&quot; OK,
you heard the motion, all in favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, no. The technical amendment passes, we're
back on the bill. OK, 1105. Please explain your bill Representative
Brody. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He's already done that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chairman for a motion. Motion at the proper
time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] What did we do? We voted on the amendment,
right? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just the amendment, not the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Right. So we're back on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He's
already explained it, though. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh. OK. Any questions on
1105? We have a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] My motion would be favorable
as to the bill as amended rolled into a committee PCS, unfavorable as to
the original. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You guys are too fast for me. OK, you've
heard the motion. All in favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  All opposed, no. OK, the bill passes. Now, House Bill 1106,
Representative Brody, you're up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam
Chair. This also comes from the same. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh, wait it's a
PCS. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It's a PCS, yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I move the PCS
be before us. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Wait until we get the PCS passed out.
You're too fast. Get it to Representative Luebke, real fast there. OK,
staff while that's being passed out will you explain the PCS? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chairwoman, Representative Brody and
Representative Torbitt. This PCS is truly just clarifying language to
the first edition of the bill as it was introduced. What this bill would
do generally is amend the statutes that govern the approval of erosion
and sedimentation control plans such that in order to obtain approval
for a plan that includes a retaining wall or other similar structural
device such as a structural foundation, the applicant for the plan would
be required to provide a written certification from the designer of that
devices that assures that the device has been designed in accordance
with applicable codes and specifications that would be enforced by the
local government and installed with the proposed sedimentation control
plan. The commission must provide a copy of the plan approval that
includes the written certification to the chief building code
enforcement officer of the local government responsible for inspection
and approval of that device, and the provisions of this PCS would only
apply to applicants for plan approvals for land disturbing activity that
takes place in jurisdictions that do not administer or enforce local
erosion and sedimentation control programs. I'd be happy to answer any
questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK, we have a motion before us. Are there
any questions for the bill sponsor or for staff. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam
Chair, over here, to your right. Moore. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Moore. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No question, I just wanted to briefly speak to
the bill. Because I know these bills are getting pushed through pretty
quickly, but I think the committee and the folks here ought to know that
Representative Brody and Representative Torbitt took a lot of time
dealing with some pretty serious situations and actually went over to
Gaston County and saw firsthand some problems that happened with some
construction and some problems that were affecting folks. So I know
we're giving quick approval to these and I expect they'll get quick
approval, but I just thought that the two of you ought to get accolades
for the work that you and your committee did really spending a lot of
time and going to other parts of the state and seeing what's the
problem. I just thought you ought to get recognition for that. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Absolutely. I was on that committee but I only went to one of
the meetings I think, but they actually took the trip across the state
and it was greatly appreciated.</p>

Hager for your motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chairwoman, I
move for a favorable to the PCS for House Bill 1139, unfavorable to the
original. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You've heard the motion, all in favor say
aye. All opposed no. And the PCS passes, thank you. And our last bill.
Do we see any of the Senators here? Oh, you're going to handle it?
That's right. Senator, Representative Wells is going to handle Senate
Bill 163. It's a PCS. And Representative McGrady, this is a PCS, he's
making a motion. Similar motion he's made, he's our PCS guy. And do you
want staff, do you want to explain it or do you want staff to? The PCS
is already before us. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll start. The PCS is before
us. This involves Senate Bill 163, which has had a few adjustments. This
is an attempt to get regulation in line with a fast changing technology
world. What we would like to do here is give some options to our
municipalities to use up to 20% reclaimed water in their water
facilities and their water plants. This is not a requirement that they
do anything, it does not force them, it is not a mandate, this is an
option, an extra tool in their toolbox. It's designed to up to at least
the 20% level minimize water drawn from a river, thereby benefitting the
municipalities downstream of that as well as the agricultural uses
downstream. There is a section 3 that beyond that, the section 3 gets
into asking the Environmental Management Commission to study effects of
chemicals of emerging concern. I could, I think staff could address that
if anybody has any questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK, any questions.
Representative Harrison. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Not a question, an approval,
I mean a motion. For a motion. Perfect time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further
questions? OK, I think that time is now Representative Harrison.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Been a while. Motion for a favorable report for the
PCS, unfavorable to the original. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK, you've heard the
motion. All in favor, signify by saying aye. Opposed, no. OK, the bill
passes and we are done. Sorry I was rusty at this position today.</p>
