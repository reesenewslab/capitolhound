Thank you mister speaker, members of the house. This is a technical
amendment to make it clear. I been working with the town and the county,
transitioning their ETJ zoning from the county, towns jurisdiction to
the county jurisdiction. When its in the county's jurisdiction that the
county will no longer have aportments?? to the weaver ville town planing
and zoning commission. That is the purpose of this amendment. I ask for
your support.

[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Mister speaker, members of the house this bill allows for the county to
transition, and take over the ETJ zoning district for the town of weaver
ville. The county and the town have been meeting over the the last month
or so to work on this transition. As for your suport the town would have
been greatly opposed to the county still having aporments?? to their
town, planing and zoning. But with out that being in the bill, and that
was my fault, for that technical error there. The town is working
constructively and does not express opposition. Based on my conversation
with the mayor of weaver ville. I ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Setzer please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
To ask the bill sponsor a question, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Ramsey, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I yield.

[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you mister speaker. Representative Ramsey did the town of weaver
ville come to you and request this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
As we spoke earlier, representative Fisher, and as I told you earlier.
Had conversation with the town of weaver ville. The town of weaver ville
was not opposed to the county ever taking the ETJ zoning area because in
that case, the county zoning restriction are very similar to  the town
zoning restriction. Also the folks that live in that area, do vote for
their county commissioner. They do not vote for the people serving on
the weaver ville town counsel. That is the purpose of this bill. The
town of weaver ville is very aware of this bill. I don't think any one's
been contacted</p>

the corporate body.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen, I know that you're getting
really tired of a bill a week either about County of Buncombe or City of
Asheville, and now we're on the town of Weaverville. I would remind you
all that my colleague represents not only the County of Buncombe but the
town of Weaverville. And in fact, the town of Weaverville did not
request this bill, and it is, again, a sort of a kicking off of the
townspeople in terms of decisions regarding the zonings around the areas
closest to the town of Weaverville. I would just urge the body to  think
in those terms and to please oppose this bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] To inquire [??] present issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Fisher, does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Fisher, do the citizens who live in the

[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, they don't, but . . .
[SPEAKER CHANGES] How about . . .
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady yield for a followup?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do the citizens in the E T J area currently vote for
the county commissioners?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Ramsey, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill one more time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as it's
minuted a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, members of the House, I would submit in
this case . . . I know there's been some other bills in Buncombe County
that have received some attention. In this case, it's really a win for
Weaverville and a win for the county. Not only in this bill is the
county overtaking the E T J zoning district for Weaverville, there are
donut holes all throughout the county where over the years between
municipalities, zoning regulations and other factors, State law only
allows the county to zone one square mile or greater. The bill also
allows the county to bring in conformity. Many areas of the county that
are under State law, they cannot bring in conformity with their other
land use regulations. The county has spent hundreds of thousands of
dollars with professional land planners. The county rules are very
similar to Weaverville, and I would submit it's good for the town of
Weaverville; it's good for Buncombe County, and I commend the bill to
this body.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not, the
question before the house is the passage to the House Committee
Substitute to House bill five-thirty-one. It's amended on its second
reading. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The Clerk will open
the vote.
All members wishing to record, please do so at this time. The clerk will

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen, we
had an excellent discussion and a vote on this bill on Thursday of last
week. This is an extremely important bill that has to do with
prescription drug abuse and our attempts to thwart the ever-growing
threat of prescription drug abuse. In light of the discussion of Friday
and in discussion with members that commented, we concluded that the
bill is best served if we have one more amendment, and I'd like to send
that amendment forth, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is the gentleman sending forth the amendment, or is
Representative Faircloth? The gentleman is recognized to send forth an
amendment. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Horn moves to amend the bill on page 4,
line 44 through page 5, line 5 by deleting section 6 of the bill and by
re-numbering the remaining sections accordingly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The effect of this amendment is to put that portion of
the law right back where it is today, so that the bill focuses on the
controlled substance reporting system itself. And I appreciate your
support for the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on the amendment.
Representative Faircloth, please state your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to send forth an
amendment. The clerk will read. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry.
Representative Faircloth, does the gentleman wish to debate this
amendment or does he wish to be recognized in turn for another
amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry, another amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on the amendment?
If not, the question before the House is the passage of the amendment
sent forth by Representative Horn for the House committee substitute of
House Bill 173. All in favor vote aye, all opposed vote no. The clerk
will open the vote. All members wishing to record please do so at this
time. The clerk will let the machine record the vote. 117 having voted

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to send forth an

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Faircloth moves to amend the bill on
page 3, line 32 by adding between the words &quot;sheriff&quot; and
&quot;who&quot; the following phrase &quot;or a police chief or a
designated police investigator.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House. The
registry that we have talked about in this particular bill is very
valuable for the investigation of the wrong use of prescription drugs.
It's really a problem, as you've heard from Representative Horn. The
registry is available, the information there is available when applied
for in the proper way to pharmacists, to people who are in the registry,
to the state bureau of investigation when conducting an investigation,
to other states' investigators, and two or three other groups. The
sheriffs have asked, and it's included in the bill as you presently have
it, that the sheriff or a designated deputy sheriff who's assigned to
investigate this problem, be allowed access to the registry with a
lawful court order specifically issued for that purpose. The North
Carolina Chief's Association, who also oversee units who investigate
prescription drugs, have asked that they be included as well--it is a
very valuable asset to them. They can only apply for information with a
lawful court...</p>

pests, seeds and food products made from plants. Under this authority
the department can prevent the sale of seed, or the cultivation of
plants that are harmful to agriculture or could create plant pest
problems for the general public. In North Carolina local governments
have not attempted to exercise this authority but in some states they
have as I mentioned earlier. So North Carolina has made a huge
investment in biotechnology through our university system and The
Biotechnology Center. In addition to investments made by private
companies and individual farmers. It is estimated that %95 of the corn,
cotton and soy bean varieties grown by North Carolina farmers have been
developed through biotechnology or genetic modification. The local level
decided they wanted to prevent that genetic ?? plants from actually
growing, or being grown, we would actually harm agriculture to a real
big level. So I hope that you will support this. This is not trying to
take over anything. It basically puts into law what The Department of Ag
is already doing. And we needed to make sure we did that. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Harrison please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Harrison you're recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen of The House I'm gonna rise in opposition to this
bill. This is a repeat of legislation we saw back in 2005 that has been
pushed by the country's largest ag and biotech company and what it does,
it prevents local governments from taking steps to restrict the sale or
cultivation of certain plants and seeds in North Carolina and it arose
out of efforts by heavily organic farming counties around the country
where they've enacted local ordinances to prevent genetically modified
foods. And the reason that's a problem is because this stuff cross
contaminates, you can't control the air, it drifts and contaminates your
product. And as a result these counties have enacted ordinances that
have prevented GMO foods in their counties. And I, I like many of you,
have heard from organic farmers in my district who are very concerned
about this legislation. And I think it's a big concern for the organic
farming community. I think it also-. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Ramsey, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ask the Representative a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] She yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

beli-, I believe it's the Department of Agriculture. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Har-. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I yield. I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] She yields. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Do we trust the Department the Agriculture to make the best
decisions for the people of North Carolina, to balance the needs of our
small farmers and organic producers with our commercial farmers?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I assume that's a rhetorical question, I'll continue
my debate. I think is a important issue for many who are worried about
the contamination of their crops. And it does appear that it may an
impact on local control of invasive species so for those reasons I will
be voting no and I encourage you to vote no on this bill. Thank you.

Committee substitute for house bill 635.  A bill to entitle an act to
allow a clerk or assistant or deputy clerk of superior court or
magistrate to issue by facsimile or electronic mail transmission and
involuntary inpatient commitment custody order to a petitioning
physician, eligible psychologist or designee at a 24 hour facility when
they respondent is already physically present at the 24 hour facility,
and to establish protocols for the training of physicians, eligible
psychologist or designee, and to direct the secretary of the department
of health and human services to review and revise the rules designating
facilities for the custody and treatment of involuntary clients.
General assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Forsythe county, Representative Lambert is recognized
to debate house bill 635.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker and house members.  Let me first describe the current
statute that sets forth the processes for involuntary mental commitments
in North Carolina.  One of these processes allows for commitment of an
individual already present in a medical facility when a physician of the
medical facility believes that commitment is necessary because the
individual is mentally ill, and a danger to themselves or others.  Under
the current law the hospital or facility physician completes a
certification and related paperwork, which is then presented to a
magistrate for review and either approved or denied.  At that point, if
a magistrate issues a commitment order based on the physician's
certification, the commitment order must be served on the patient.
Under the current law, the commitment order for this type of onsite
commitment must be made by a sworn law enforcement officer.  The purpose
of this bill is to provide another option.  The bill would add a new
subsection to provide that if a person or patient is physically present
at a 24 hour facility, and a physician or psychologist at the facility
recommends that the person be involuntary commitment, then a clerk
finding probable cause to believe the person meets the commitment
criteria may transmit the custody order from the physician or the
psychologist, or a designee by fax or electronic e-mail transmission,
rather than requiring a sworn law enforcement officer to be required to
handle the paperwork and onsite delivery.  The new process will save law
enforcement many thousand hours, rather than taking those officers off
the streets to handle the paperwork in that 24 hour facility.  This
change has the support of the hospital association, a variety of mental
health organizations, and I'm not aware of any opposition, and I
encourage your support for this bill as well.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Speaker, thank you so much.  Representatives of the
House, this is a very narrow, restrictive bill.  If you live in a city
inside the corporate limits, nothing in this bill will impact you.  If
you live in a community where you have deed restrictions that prohibit
manufactured housing, this bill does not impact you.  If you live in a
county that does not currently restrict manufactured house, this bill
does not impact you.  But for those particular instances where you do
live outside the corporate limits of a city, what is says is the county
may not restrict manufactured housing, no more than they can single
family homes.  This applies to owner occupied single family homes and it
does allow the counties to impose reasonable aesthetic design
requirements to make sure they're within conformity of the community.
So I'd be happy to answer any questions members may have, and I ask you
to support this bill.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman from New Hanover, Representative Catlin, is recognized to
debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This bill applies to public utility authorities
and allows rate flexibility for water resource preservation and
mitigation. For instance, during the low flow season, extra water
capacity could be used and it could benefit ?? for storage and in
official recharge. Presently the utility authorities don't have the rate
flexibility to make that affordable. ?? storage could help prevent salt
water intrusion, and the surficial recharge could restore dewatered
ponds and wetlands. Long term as river allocations are decreasing, we
need to be flexible to protect our water resources and store in
&lt;h3&gt;excess seasonal capacity. Water's going to be new gold, and
this would provide us the flexibility to be able to take care of it. I
urge your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

House Bill 789.  A bill has been filed an act to clarify that the
presence of a substance released from an underground storage tank does
not disqualify property from participation in the North Carolina ground
fields program. General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from New Hanover County, Representative Catlan is
recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. North Carolina has a really good ground field
agreement program that allows for the reuse of vacant or dormant or
derelict property that has remnant contamination. Basically allows
prospective developer to redevelop the property. It takes the liability
away from them or their lenders. The responsibility party still has
whatever liability there is. It's a very intense process to ensure that
there is public health and safety. It allows the utilization of existing
infrastructure which is very good, roads, water and sawyer, power lines,
schools, fire protection, police. It presently includes petroleum
contamination but it eliminates contamination that came from underground
storage tanks. I met with Deaner and Ms. Gillespie who runs this
program, they're very supportive of this. The responsible party would
still be liable. The prospective developer would be subject to land use
restrictions and whatever qualification or restrictions that are in the
agreement. It's very good for economic growth because again it uses
existing infrastructure. So I urge your support of this.

?? for Senate Bill is to encourage volunteer care in free clinics and
that’s exactly what it does. I want to take just a moment, if I may,
just to take this opportunity to recognize what free clinics mean to the
citizens of North Carolina. No doubt, most all of you probably have a
free clinic that operates somewhere in or near your community. But free
clinics provide and help address health care needs for approximately 1.5
million people in this state. Health care providers provide somewhere up
toward $200 million a year worth of health care benefits through free
clinics. Needless to say that we appreciate the work that is done in
free clinics. I know in my own community, and I represent a rural,
rather poor tier one county. We got a free clinic that started about 15
years ago and it has met many needs. I would just for me, personally, as
a health care provider, I think we say sometimes we get more out of it
going and helping and providing the care than those that receive it. I
will say that they’re extremely appreciative, and I think you ought to
know that. If you haven’t had the opportunity to visit a free clinic, I
would offer you to do that.
What Senate Bill 83 actually does is to address the fact that free
clinics provide primary and preventative health care which is not very
high risk care. In fact, no lawsuit has been filed against a free clinic
in this state in more than ten years. Senate Bill 83 encourages more
volunteer care by modifying the current qualified immunity statute that
encourages the provision of free health care services. It replaces
insurance requirements that are rather ambiguous with a notice to the
patient about the immunity of the provider similar to the notice that
was passed by this body in the volunteer health services act last year.
This is just a continuation of our state saying that we appreciate free
clinics and we want to encourage volunteers to participate. Ladies and
gentlemen, I would encourage your passage of this good bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I just want you to know, I
think Representative Jones is being very modest here because one of the
greatest providers of volunteer care and volunteer services  has been
the North Carolina Dental Society. They have a program called MoMs,
Missions of Mercy. If none of you’ve ever seen that program, it was
absolutely amazing what they did and saw over three weekends. I mean,
over three days of a long weekend in Alleghany County and the number of
patients they saw, everything from routine cleanings to root canals.
They were amazing, they did it all for free, and all this volunteer
labor and I think even the pharmacist from here in Wake County was
there. It was just an amazing thing, I ask you to support the bill.
