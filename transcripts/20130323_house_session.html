The conceal carry folks to protect their privacy,to protect folks who
have, go and apply for permits to make sure their information is not
able to be scattered  across the web and out there for public
consumption. What it will allow is for law enforcement to continue to
receive this, these documents. And to obviously, you use them as
necessary. And basically this just prevents any potential exposure of
law abiding who want to have a conceal carry permit. It allows them to
be protected and for them to have privacy. So there’s no potential for
their information to be spread across the web where potential criminals
can use that to either target those individuals or those who may not
have a permit. So this is simply an effort to protect their privacy. But
also take a potential tool away from any criminal who may choose to
target these individuals. And I would ask for your support. I do believe
there will be one technical amendment offered by Representative Jackson
which I support. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Representative Jackson, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is a technical amendment, ladies and
gentlemen. The Clerks of Court currently have access to this
information. It was I believe an oversight that they were deleted.
Clerks of Court hear incompetencies proceedings, judges at the Clerks
Office through the Clerks Office they hear domestic violence case,
protective orders, and voluntary commitments. This will just allow them
to still have access to this statewide information. I ask for your
support.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen of the House, this may sound a
little out of line. But let me just pose a question to you. I’m gonna
vote against the bill for other reasons. But they tell me that the right
to bear arms and ownership is a constitutional amendment. But you want
to keep the names of  those people off the rolls. I would submit to you
that the right to vote is a constitutional right. But those voter rolls
are open. So you can see anybody who voted or how they voted, if you
want to take restitution or if you want to take retribution against
those folks who voted. You can go through the rolls and find out and do
all sorts of crazy things there too. I just thought I’d put that little
bit of information in your mind.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Pittman, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Everybody knows that I was going to offer an
amendment to this bill. I believe that’s going to be my concern and
that’s going to be handled elsewhere. And so that’s why we’re not
running it today. But I just want to say that I am in favor of this
bill. But believe or not, I really consider this a bit of a compromise.
Because as I’ve repeatedly said elsewhere far as I’m concerned as long
as you have no intention of harming an innocent person, it’s nobody’s
business especially the government, what guns you have and how many. And
I just don’t see any point of anybody having this information. But at
the very least the privacy of gun ownership be protected. So I’m in
favor of this bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Shepard, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, Mr. Speaker, I have a question for Representative Michaux and
if this is out of order, you tell me. I was just curious about the
statement.

Representative Dollar, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I will try to cover this
and not take too much time. What does House Bill 181 do? House Bill 181
does one thing and that is that is codifies current state law, with
regard to physician supervision of certified registered nurse ?? and the
procedures that they undertake in their practice. If you want to ask
why, why would we need to codify what is currently case law and that is
because for the last 20 years this matter has unfortunately been very
unsettled. I will go through that in just a few moments. But, be not
mistaken in the state of North Carolina today, physician supervision of
medical procedures by CRNA's is the law and is the practice in North
Carolina. I want to make sure that I add, right up front, that certified
registered nurse and ?? or CRNAs are advanced  practice nurses who do
work in collaboration with other healthcare providers pursuant to the
nurse practice act and they do an outstanding job. They are a critical
component of the care team in our operating rooms. I also think that one
of the most important things that you need to know about this
legislation is that this bill will change absolutely nothing in our
operating rooms with its passage. Nothing will change in terms of the
operations being done in hospitals, clinics, or dentist office. Just a
very brief history, back in 1993, 1994 there was a consent order entered
into by the Board of Nursing and the Board of Medicine, that resulted in
a change to the law and to the administrative code. I'll just read the
relevant portion of the law regarding CRNA practice, it says
collaborating with other healthcare providers in determining the
appropriate healthcare for a patient, but subject to the provisions of
90-18.2, not prescribing a medical treatment regimen or making a medical
diagnosis, except under supervision of a licensed physician. The
corresponding administrative code.</p>

<p id="25:00">
Says likewise. Pursuant to a request by Senator James Forrester, I think
many of you knew him. The Attorney General issued an opinion in December
31st of 1998, that opinion reads in part while the list of permitted
activities is broad, this is relating to CRNAs. Those activities are
limited by a requirement that a CRNA “may not prescribe a medical
treatment regimens or make a medical diagnosis accept under supervision
of a licensed physician.” With the appropriate citation.
Management of a patients anesthesia requires the prescription of medical
treatment regiments and the making of a medical diagnosis. The CRNA
rules therefore do not eliminate the requirement that anesthesia care
patient be under the supervision of a physician. Moving down the road in
2005, the North Carolina Court of Appeals issued a unanimous decision.
It was authored by Justice Wanda Bryant and concurred by Judge Hunter
and by Judge Barbara Jackson.
Affirming a lower court ruling that physician supervision is the law of
North Carolina. I’ll read just one paragraph from the decision at this
time. Physician supervision of nurse anesthetist, providing anesthesia
care, when that care includes prescribing medical treatment regimens and
making medical diagnosis, is a fundamental patient safety standard
required by North Carolina law.
At your desk you will find a letter outlining some of this that is given
to you by the attorney on behalf of the North Carolina Board of
Medicine. I would just like the read the first two sentences. Pursuant
to your request, this was a response to request that I gave the Medical
Board. Pursuant to your request, the legal staff of the North Carolina
Medical Board reviewed the proposed statutory changes contained in House
Bill 181.
The legislation merely codifies and clarifies existing North Carolina
law requiring physician supervision of nurse anesthetist providing
anesthesia services. I would also like to note for you that if you look
at the federal regulations for Medicare and Medicaid, these regulations
require all hospitals to provide physician supervision for nurse
anesthetist providing anesthesia services.
That is Federal requirement that all hospitals have and has been
confirmed by the Hospital Association. All hospitals in North Carolina
obviously follow that requirement. This Bill is a bi-partisan Bill. It
has passed with strong support in both the Health Committee and the
Regulatory Reform Committee.
Just to conclude, it does not change any practice in the operating room.
Physician supervision is the law in practice in our state and the
advantage of passing this legislation is this Bill will settle. Will
take out of court jeopardy and out of the administrative wrangling that
we’ve seen for 20 years and codify what is the current case law and
current practice. Mr. Speaker and Members I’ll be happy to answer any
questions that you would have and I would appreciate your support for
the Bill.
[Speaker]: Representative Cunningham, please state your purpose.
[Representative Cunningham]: Mr. Speaker, couple of question for
Representative Dollar.
[Speaker]: Representative Dollar. Does the gentleman yield?
[Representative Dollar]: I yield.
[Speaker]: The gentleman yields.
[Representative Cunningham]: Representative Dollar, are you aware that
any type of practice in a nursing profession requires supervision of a
medical doctor or some type of physician that has been required of every
profession in the State of North Carolina?
[Representative Dollar]: I am aware that if you look under the Medical
Practice Act, you will see 20 specific exceptions to the provision of
medical services. In the nursing provision, nursed can conduct medical
procedures pursuant to the Subcommittee of The Board of Medicine and the
Board of Nursing being in agreement. Specific to CRNAs, there is a
requirement for physician supervision both in the nursing</p>

to practice act as well as in the administrative code.
follow up Mr speaker.
does the gentleman yield.
I yield.
the gentleman yields.
according to the North Carolina hospital association letter that we put
on our desk the fourth paragraph states by the senior vice president in
the case that there's no practical change that will result from HP181
but you're just saying that it would [??] are we thinking possibly that
if the physician has to be on the site even though the CRNA is providing
the service that we'll be an additional building for the physician's
charge for being on site or are we looking at just the physician being
able to be reachable by telephone but not physically being there but
still able to collect some billing fees.
okay I understand your question I think what's not being understood here
and I apologize the physician is going to be there no one goes under
anesthesia just for the sake of going under anesthesia you go under
anesthesia for the purposes of a procedure whether that's an operational
hospital whether it's out patient procedure so the physician is there
the physician is on site this is immediately prior to during and post
stop of an actual procedure so the physician could not be somewhere else
because then there would not be a procedure being done and no need for
anesthesia.
follow up Mr speaker.
does the gentleman yield.
I yield.
the gentleman yields.
representative Dollar in the real world of practical medicine when an
anesthesiologist puts you to sleep he does not remain in the room with
you the CRNA most likely remains in the room with you the physician that
performs the surgery leaves to surgery room and leaves you in the care
of the recovery where the CRNA is available.
representative [??] if the lady will yield this if the lady wished to
direct a question or debate the bill.
I'm fixed to asking my question Mr speaker so are you aware that the
doctor is not always at the bed side when the surgery is done and may
only return if he is called.
well I think that's a bit of a misunderstanding of what the procedure is
if you happen to be for example in a hospital where you have an
anesthesiologist a physician is an anesthesiologist that
anesthesiologist is going to be working somewhere between one and four
operating rooms in a major hospital the CRNA is critical to the process
because they do carry forward all of the procedures that are lifted for
them to carry out in the administrative code again this doesn't change
however in the case of the prescription of the exact anesthesia to be
given that's a schedule to medication and that can only be done by
either an anesthesiologist or by a physician or in certain cases by a
dentist in certain scenarios so the and if something happens with that
patient which thankfully is rare but when those occurrences happen
whether it's the anesthesiologist or the physician or if it's just the
physician if you're an out patient in a clinic somewhere they are in
charge of that patient and the care of their patient.
Mr speaker I'd like to debate the bill.
the lady's recognized to debate the bill.
thank you there are three counties in the state of North Carolina that
do not have hospitals [??] hospitals are absent in those counties in
most of these cases CRNA go in and provide services for pregnant women
[??] anesthesiologist there's not an anesthesiologist that's present in
that county because there's not a hospital in that count but they still
need the services because they're birthing babies and sometimes even at
home they're birthing babies with mid wives so therefore if there's not
a supervisor of the CRNA's in these particular counties what are their
possibilities for getting the service in those three counties well an
anesthesiologist or a medical professional or someone would have to
draft to that county this would eliminate some of those services because

a hospital is not so you still would have issue with it.

Concern is this. If we are going to have the additional bill and if a
doctor drive 55 to 65 miles to sign off because he’s not going to be
there 24/7. He’s, he’s gonna work his hours and then he’s gonna move on.
So what you gonna supposed to do for those individuals. Are they just
not gonna have the CRNA service? Rural counties in California have moved
away and did an exemption so that rur, rural counties would not foul up
under this stipulation of supervision. They’ve always been supervised.
Always. It has never been a healthcare professional where you were
licensed in the state of North Carolina that you were not supervised by
a medical director or someone with a Doctor’s degree. It has never
happened. So I don’t see what the significant change is in it. The only
thing that I can see in it is this gonna be a possible way for another
billing cycle that Medicare and Medicaid is not going to be able to pay.
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hollo please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mr. Speaker. First of all I fully support the CNRAs and the service they
provide to the patients into the healthcare community. I would not
support a bill that would impede their ability to work in their
profession. This bill makes no changes in their delivery of anesthesia.
It only clarifies the law. This bill was heard extensively for one and a
half hours in the HHS Policy Committee and passed overwhelmingly. It was
then heard in Regulatory Reform Committee where it also passed
overwhelmingly. I would appreciate your yes vote on this bill. Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Fulghum please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker.
As some of you know I spent several thousand hours in an operating room
in the last 35 years. And this is kind of how it works. You go and
engage a physician to diagnose your problem. They may be the surgeon or
the physician they refer you to a surgeon. And you have contract
verbally sometimes. Sometimes even written with a surgeon to say I’m
sick. I need your care. What do you recommend? They recommend and you
agree. And then you go to the hospital. And you enter into a formal
situation. The hospital they have you sign a what they call a consent.
And the consent says and this pretty typical around the country, not
just unique in North Carolina, hereby authorize the surgeon’s name to
perform the following procedures or treatments upon myself the patient.
Per that permit references I authorize administration to myself the
patient of anesthetics to be determined to be necessary in the hospital
by the physician, responsible for administrating or for supervising the
administration of anesthetics. Now folks you go to an outpatient surgery
center. You have a colonoscopy or you go get an ENT procedure done or
any other kind of various environments. Now whether there’s an
anesthesiologist around really doesn’t matter. The decision to operate
is between the surgeon and the patient. And when the surgery starts, and
how long it lasts, and when it stops, the decision is up to the surgeon.
The surgeon needs anesthesia. No one wants to do it without that. In
many cases the CNRA is the one who’s part of the team. But make no
mistake about this, this is not a democratic operation. This is a
captain of the ship situation. The surgeon is directing the care
supervising the care of everybody in the operating room. And the most
important person in the operating room is the patient. The critical
nature of everyone’s job is apparent. And I will tell you that in my
case I had a reputation for tolerating chatter for about 15 seconds. And
then you’re out of the operating room. Everybody’s got to be focused on
the task. I respect and I can’t tell you how much I do the efforts and
the training of CNRA people I worked with over the years. They never
however peeked over the drape separating me and them and said cut here.
Or I think you better stop the surgery unless the patient was in trouble
in bleeding or something of that kind. I mean I wanted to know things
like that. And pretty much I kinda knew that already. So I’m in full
support of this bill. They’re right. I can’t figure out what all the
fuss is really about. It doesn’t change anything. I hope</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lambeth, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I have also spent a fair amount
of time
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I've also spent a fair amount of my time in hospitals
and healthcare facilities, and I would point out that this bill does not
say anesthesiologists supervision, it say physician supervision. I also
point out the the North Carolina hospital association, which represents
large urban centers as well as small rural hospitals, supports this
bill. They say that physician supervision of CRNAs is the appropriate
public policy. I agree with that. They say physician supervision is the
current law and practice in hospitals. I agree with that. They also
state that codifying the public policy and current law and practice
assures that any change to that public policy occurs at the legislative
branch, not at the courts or state agencies. I can tell you that I've
talked to a lot of CRNAs over the last few weeks, and they are concerned
about this bill. They are concerned about what's not said in this bill.
And what I've tried to reassure them, each time I've talked to a CRNA,
is that if things are not as they seem in this bill, we will address
those concerns. But this bill seems to be good public policy and I also
support this bill and encourage you to support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Adams, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask Representative Dollar a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Dollar, there was a concern
raised about rural counties, that Representative Cunningham alluded to,
can you speak to that? How does this bill take care of those rural
counties, or does it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Adams. It does not affect
rural counties, because physicians supervise CRNAs. So CRNAs will
continue to be able to practice in rural areas under physician
supervision, which is the current practice. So it in no way impacts
access to anesthesia services within rural counties.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Just to speak briefly, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Like most of you here, I've
been in a lot of discussion around this bill. I have a very close niece
who is a nurse. I have other members of my family who are in the medical
profession, and some who are doctors. And I think about having had a
couple of surgeries myself, and going under as we say, and coming out
always wanting to make sure that I have the very best, I have a lot of
respect for what nurses do, and nurse anesthetists as well. But for me,
this bill is really about patient safety. I've looked at all of the
information, I am convinced that it does codify existing law. And if you
think about it, for the past couple of weeks, we have had at least two
bills that I can recall, where there's been some question back and forth
about interpretation and what we had to do was to clarify and codify.
And I believe that's what it does, and I'm going to support the bill. I
encourage you to do as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I'll be brief, I don't
want to say a lot. Most of the members that know me know that I'm a
dentist, you may not know that I've had the privilege of being married
for almost 22 years to a registered nurse. I just want to echo what Dr.
Fulghum had to say, and basically, from my perspective, just to say that
healthcare is definitely a team sport, and we're very blessed to have
healthcare professionals of many honorable professions. And I will say
that as a legislator, some of the bills that I have seen that have
probably bothered me the most I guess in my three years here, are issues
where different healthcare professionals are at odds with one another.
And you see where there have been court cases over and over again, and I
would just say that I think Representative Fulghum said it best, that in
the operating room there has to be a situation where someone says the
buck stops here. And that lies with the surgeon. And here at the General
Assembly we pass laws and the buck stops here, and I think we have an
obligation to bring clarity to this to try to keep these issues out of
the courts, because it is in the best interest of those citizens which
are the patients, as he said are the most important people</p>

in the operating room. So for that reason and more I would just say that
it's important that we bring clarity to the fact that we say that
there's not being any change made, we've received a lot of emails from a
lot of people that are apparently differently interpreting what it means
to have supervision in the room and I think that we need to clarify
that. So for that reason I do commend the bill. Thank you.

district court judges and is supported by superior court judges by the
North Carolina Academy advocates for justice and no opposition from the
North Carolina Bar either, and it simply increases the jurisdictional
amount for civil actions in district court from 10,000 to 25,000 which
hasn't been increased in some time, to allow those cases to be heard
more quickly and expeditiously in district court, as opposed to superior

House Bill 243. The Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Committee
substitute for House Bill 243, a bill to be entitled ‘An Act Authorizing
an Owner of a Self-Storage Facility who has a Lien upon Personal
Property to Deliver Notice of the Public Sale of the Property by Regular
or electronic Mail, to Publish Notice in any Commercially Reasonable
Manner, and to Conduct the Sale through an Online, Publically Accessible
Auction Website, and to Increase the Late Fees for Self-Storage Facility
Rental Contracts’. General Assembly of North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Stevens, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized
to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the House, this is a
bill that came to me at the request of people who operate self-storage
facilities. If someone is more than 60 days late in paying the rent on
their storage buildings, they then have to go through a procedure to
notify the person. They’ve asked that they be able to use email and
first class regular mail to try to get in touch with these. Email brings
them more into the 21st century and they can get those other contracts.
In addition, it tries to provide a better way to make sure we’ve got
people to bid on this by establishing a regular… that at least three
bidders need to show up – three independent bidders need to show up in
order for the sale to be deemed commercially reasonable. It does
increase the fees for not paying to whichever is greater, $20 or 20%,
and that’s consistent with the rest of the county. One other thing in
here has to do with vehicles that are left on the premises. It offers
them by this statute to be able to move them by returning them to any
lien holder. If the bank is holding a lien or whatever, it allows them
to be able to tow that vehicle and allow the lien holder to deal with it
in their process. And Mr. Speaker, I do have an amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The lady is recognized to send forth an amendment. The Clerk
will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens moves to amend the
bill on page 3, line 13, by rewriting the line to read… [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and this… We needed an effective date
and there was not one on here, so weeded time to promulgate this, and
it’s October 1st 2013, and then it will only apply to contracts that are
in or after that effective date. So I’d ask for your support on this
amendment and also for the underlying bill. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Chair observes two lights that were on, I think prior to the
amendment. The Chair will recognize those members at the appropriate
time. Further discussion, further debate on the amendment?
Representative Presnell, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
would like to be excused from the vote. We own storage buildings.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady will be. Further discussion, further debate
on the amendment. If not, the question before the House is the passage
of the amendment sent forth by Representative Stevens to the House
Committee substitute for House Bill 243. All in favor vote aye. All
opposed vote no. The Clerk will open the vote. All members wishing to
record, please do so at this time. The Clerk will lock the machine and
record the vote. 114 having voted in the affirmative and none in the
negative, the amendment passes. We’re now back on the bill.
Representative Collins, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] A
question for the bill sponsor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens,
does the lady yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
lady yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens, my question has
to do with not the main part of the bill but the manner of
advertisement. On page 2, end of line 29, it says you either have to
advertise it in a newspaper or the second thing is any commercially
reasonable manner, and it looks like to me according to ways to finding
this that you don’t know whether you’ve advertised it properly until the
sale actually happens. Is that correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I
may respond? Representative Collins, it is commercially reasonable if
you can get at least three independent bidders there. At the current
statute the way it reads, there is no standard. As long as you put it in
a paper, if nobody shows up or one person shows up then that’s deemed to
be commercially reasonable. So this is an effort to try and get more
bidders in. [SPEAKER CHANGES] A follow-up on that please. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Does the lady yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does that mean then that that manner
of advertisement deals with both part one as well as part two? It deals
with whether you’ve advertised it in a newspaper or in some other
manner; is that correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
One more question please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Lady yield? Lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I send a letter to my family members and three or
four of my best friends, is that considered commercially a reasonable
manner as long as I get three bidders there? [SPEAKER CHANGES] As long
as they are independent bidders. I don’t think they can be the family
members of</p>
