[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Calendar. Representative Moore please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to state his motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker I move that the conference committee report on House Bill
189 be removes from the Rules Committee and returned to the Conference
Committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection so ordered. The current conferees for House Bill 189
are hereby discharged new conferees for House Bill 189 or David Louis
Chair, Sera Stevens, Tim Moore, William ___[03:00], the Senate will be
soon notified.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
An announcement Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore please state your announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker I want to make an announcement for the members here and for
the public with respect with Representative Carney to give a heads-up of
what we are doing. The conference report for House Bill 189, there was a
very, very slight change that needs to be made and what we have the
reason we just did these procedure and maneuvers just because we have to
bring the conference report back and then have it resubmitted. So, what
will happen is the Rules Committee will meet tonight to take up the new
conference report. My understanding is the Senate is appointing three
new conferees because the three conferees who are named are not here.
So, waiting on getting that notice but once we get that the conference
report needed to be signed will get it in, it will then be sent to
rules, we are here and get report back in so it will be on tomorrow’s
calendar, I just wanna make sure folks and what we are doing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And are the members familiar with the content or the intended content of
the conference report, Representative Ray please state your purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A question for the rules Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore yelled.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore you did confer with Representative Carney and you
did mention about of him, could you give a little specific more.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ray that was the point I want to make, I want you all to
understand what was…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And again, as they are preparing an answer of that question just as I
announced last week there were provisions in the underlying bill, House
Bill 1224 that the house had concerns with and therefore, House Bill 718
which is a conference report addresses some of those it actually enclose
the TA fix or correction for a dispute between the County Commissioners
and the Board of Education on how they…

Local auction tax is enabled in 2024 would actually be expended, I think
balancing and to the satisfaction of the school boards and House Bill
189 actually has a correction in it that extends the Wake County
referendum to 2016. The current referendum is off the table and a couple
of other provisions that Representative Moore can expand on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To make follow up enhancement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just what we doing right now is I have asked restaurants is gonna get a
copy now that you read a new language, members have seen 189 the
conference report that’s there and I will just provide what the new
language is, it’s literally forwards.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ray please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At appropriate time I have an announcement and a point of personal
privilege please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his announcement and subsequently be recognized
for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The house democrats will meet in the morning at 10 o’clock in our
regular meeting room. The point of personal privilege, it’s my honor to
recognize Larry M. Bell from Sampson County the friend of ours Happy
Birthday today.
[Applause]
Representative Pears please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To clear some fact that get ready to work on that but you said the TA
fix I hear what you say but is that in 1224, just so much move…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No Sir, they are interrelated, the way that these conference reports,
the house had already or the Senate I should say had already adopted the
conference report so that what we have done with 718 is put the
correction for the teacher assistance that the house and Senate were in
conflict with and that separate bill along with the board of county
commissioner’s Board of Education fix. However, its passage is
contingent upon the passage of 1224 as 189 as part of the negotiation
with the Senate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[Inaudible]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Sir…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Floyd please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To understand that we are going to have rules at 06:15 in these and the
bill be ___[02:28]  615.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Sir, and I don’t expect a lengthy discussion but that’s the intent
to bring the conference report, we are waiting, the only reason it would
be delay on 615 as just the logistical challenge to get the Senate to
formally sign off on the consensus conference report, the better will be
as close to 06:15 as possible.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Sir, you may state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would just like to ask Stam to why need to stay overnight for it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don’t believe that it’s going to be a lengthy session and I decided to
move the session back to 11:00 so the people could commute in the
morning and allow time for the caucuses to get together.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good, ___[03:12].
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Wilkins please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Sir, inquiry of the Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is it likely then that there will be another recess in order for rules
to reconvene?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m holding that as an option and we were talking about just adjourning
subject too but in case there are some sort of communication between the
Senate it would be purely for the purposes of dealing with these matters
so we are gonna in rules tonight. So, if we do recess again
Representative Wilkins and you choose not to stick around, it would be
purely to move these and what we are trying to do of 189 is get it read
in tonight because it is a two day bill so that we get first reading
today and then by rule it will be on the calendar tomorrow for
consideration.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman state his follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Simply to be reassured that should there be another recess? The no vote
standards and order today still applies?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely and I think consistent with the ___[04:28] where I have done
that. We wanna break the street now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, I’m Floyd.
[Laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker just a general inquiry of the Chair, if I may?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker when do you anticipate sine die adjournment, Sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No later than Thursday and possibly earlier…
