[SPEAKER CHANGES]You are recognized for point of personal privilege, not

[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members, I just wanted to rise,
it&#39;s a little bit unusual, and I realize. I wanted to arise to thank
our pages who have been with us this week, many of which had they been
at home and school, would have been excused from school. But instead
were here because they care about their state government, they want to
learn. You all know that we haven&#39;t been as active this week as we
have in weeks past. Normally, to our pages, I would tell you that you
would have heard some good debate on the House floor. You would have
heard the lady from Mecklenburg, Representative Cotham rise to make
points about her passion on education. You would have heard the
gentleman from Union, Representative Horn, rise and tell you how somehow
this is related to something that Winston Churchill said at some point
in his ?? You would have heard the gentleman from Duplin, Representative
Dixon rise to tell you how important agriculture is to whatever subject
happened to be on the floor at the time, and you would have heard the
gentleman from Onslow, Representative Cleveland rise to disagree with
everything else that had been said prior to that. But with that said,
please know that on behalf of Speaker Moore and Speaker Pro Temp Stam,
we do sincerely, and all the members of the House, we do sincerely
appreciate your time. We hope that should the opportunity to come back
and to page with this Chamber or the other Chamber, or even the Governor
?? hope that you will take advantage of that. There are a lot of things
here that you can learn. There are a lot of good friendships that you
can make, and we&#39;re just very, very proud that you would spend this
week with us. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you and I will note --
