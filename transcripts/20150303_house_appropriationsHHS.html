  ...is one of the social determinants that help, but it is only one of
the factors.  And the estimates are the clinical care is only
responsible for about 20% of the health that people attain.
So a little bit more about healthcare, we usually wind up talking about
healthcare when we talk about health.  And it is important, but it isn’t
the primary determinant, so as a country, we spend 17% of our gross
domestic product on health, yet we have some of the worst outcomes
compared to other developed countries.
And the reason is not that our healthcare is poor, but it’s that we’re
spending money at the wrong time and in the wrong places, so all of that
money is at the end of the health spectrum instead of the beginning of
the health spectrum.
And it’s important to remember this because if we spend too much on
healthcare and focus only on healthcare, then we don’t have the
opportunity to address some of those determinants that could actually
help us achieve better health outcomes.
So healthcare related spending crowds out spending on a number of the
other areas that would help us achieve better health outcomes.  We spend
too much too late.  And if we want to get control of our healthcare
spending, we need to move it upstream.
America’s Health Rankings is a 25 year effort sponsored by the United
Health Foundation, the American Health Association and the Partnership
for Prevention that compares states on a number of different health
indicators.  That is the framework that I have used to pull the data
that I’ll be talking about.  This is an effort that I have the privilege
of chairing the Scientific Advisory Committee for this effort.
I do have a few copies, I’m leaving them with staff here, but just to
let you know that we do have this book if you’d like to take a look at
it.  It’s published every year.  The website, it’s completely available
online as well, and the website is listed in multiple slides.
One thing about the way that America’s Health Ranking does their job is
that they take all of those factors that we were just talking about in
terms of the social determinants of health, and identify indicators of
each of the factors.  And this model that I have on the slide here is a
simplified version of a socioecological model, so they take a number of
factors for behavior, a number of favorite for community, environment,
clinical care and policy, and they look at those as well as outcomes to
see, to compare the states.
And just graphically that model represents that those four categories of
conditions influence the health outcomes.
Now, the data that I pulled come from that, so I’ve anchored it in that.
 You may be interested in a particular piece of data that I don’t
present and it’s because it wasn’t in there.  That doesn’t mean it’s not
attainable, so if there is something that you’re interested in that
didn’t come out of there, then we can probably get it to you.
So what I have done is to pull NC and six southern neighbors, so we have
VA, TN, SC, GA, AL and FL.  I’ve also presented on the slides the US
data and the US data do come from the America’s Health Ranking, although
in a few places I have looked to see what the variation is at
the--within the state, looking at the county, and those data come from
the County Health Rankings, which is a Robert Wood Johnson founded
sponsored effort, and it’s very similar, but looks at data at the county
level.
So just the truth in advertising, I am a numbers geek and I have tried
not to overdo numbers, but when you ask for comparative information on
NC and the states that inevitably leads to a lot of numbers, so we have
a lot of of data that I will be throwing at you, but mainly I will be
leaving with you to consider.  And...

  <p id="05:00">
  It, you know, I just want to say in advance, the picture is not pretty.
North Carolina does not fare well when you compare on the number of
health outcomes, but I want to also say while it would be easy to be
frustrated that&#39;s, that&#39;s not the purpose of this. There are a
lot of smart people already working on this and we&#39;ll talk a little
bit about that. In most of these cases, we know what to do. We just
don&#39;t have the stars aligned to be doing it correctly or at the
right dose, so we&#39;ll talk a little bit more about that as we, as we
move on. But we aren&#39;t starting from scratch in terms of knowing how
to address these conditions. We do have a couple of frameworks I want to
orient you to. At the national level, there is an effort called Healthy
People 2020. This has been going on for a long time. They set new goals
every 20 years, but they define important areas and then set specific
measurable objectives and targets. Now, this is a little bit unwieldy.
There are over 42 topic areas and 1,200 measures in Health People 2020.
So our state has been a little smarter about how we tackle that, and so
they&#39;ve pulled together a group in 2011 to look at those indicators
and see if we could make a manageable road map for North Carolina, and
that is what they have done. We have this framework called Healthy North
Carolina 2020, and what that does is focus in on 40 objectives in 13
different areas, and that serves as our state health improvement plan.
Okay, so I know you&#39;re gonna be. Sorry. This, I love this. They are
balancing ?? I know you&#39;re gonna be talking about infants and
children later when Dr. Salinty comes and speaks with you, but I do have
a few measures that I wanted to share because my perspective is from the
national perspective, looking at North Carolina and then those
comparison states and when Dr. Salinty comes, she&#39;ll be looking more
inwardly within the state, and some of the variations within the state.
So the most common measure to look at when you talk about healthy babies
is infant mortality. This is expressed as the number of deaths to
infants less than one year old per 1,000 live births. So it&#39;s a
little bit different from some of the mortality statistics that you look
at. In this indicator, North Carolina does not rank well. We are the
41st state, and when I say these state rankings, one is good, 50 would,
would be where we don&#39;t wanna be. So you can see that our infant
mortality rate is 7.3 deaths per 1000 live births. The US average is 6,
so we&#39;re above the US average, and you can see that the best
southern state is Florida with 6.3. There are two other indicators that
follow closely with infant mortality, and these are low birth weight and
preterm births, babies that are born too soon and don&#39;t weigh enough
do not fare well. So in those indicators, North Carolina is also above
the national average. You can see at 8.8, and these are percents here,
so 8.8% of our babies are low birth weight, and 12% are born too soon.
You can see that Virginia has the best rate of the Southern states, so
the little red circles are just to highlight and draw your attention to
the highest among our neighbors, although I will note that for infant
mortality, Alaska has the best in the country, and that is 4.1. Another
indicator that we look at when we look at healthy children is
immunizations. So childhood immunizations has been called one of the ten
greatest achievements in the last century. Immunization has led to a 95%
reduction in these reportable, in these communicable diseases of
childhood.

children immunization what that represents that children age is 19 35
months who have their recommended serious immunization s 72&amp; of the
children&#39;s have the immunization that is above the state verge that
managed to ??  is 64.9 and this represents ?? who have received

one with the age 18 who don&#39;t have houses towards the poverty

  But on medication management, and then there are an even larger amount
of people who have risky, risk factors that would lead eventually to
them having the condition, and then that largest group at the bottom
would be the healthy population. And so, if we focus our resources at
the deaths at the top, then we wind up doing extraordinary measures to
save a few people, whereas if we were to focus our resources at the
population level, and work on preventing some of that movement up the
pyramid, then we would have much greater effect. So I&#39;m gonna move
away from mortality and start coming down this, this pyramid here and
look at first morbidity. I wanna talk about some of the conditions that
contribute to our high deaths from heart disease, and they are high
blood pressure, high cholesterol, and then diabetes. Now you can see
that our rates here are, for high blood pressure, we are higher than the
national average actually for all three of these, and then you can see
that there are Southern states, Virginia and Georgia, who have better
rates than we do. The rank for diabetes for North Carolina for example
is 43rd. And again, there&#39;s variability by county. In Orange county,
the diabetes rate, I believe I&#39;ve got this right. Yes, is 7%, but in
Warren county it is 16%. Another factor that&#39;s very important to
health, a healthy community and a healthy people is substance abuse and
mental health. So there are three indicators in the America&#39;s health
ranking that deal with this, and they are excessive drinking, drug
deaths per 100,000, and then suicides. And if you, if you look at this,
the excessive drinking is a measure that North Carolina is a, is below
the national average, and in this case below is good. The drug deaths
per 100,000 we are also below, but on suicides our rates are higher. And
then you can see there are other Southern states for comparison to, to
just see what their rates are. So I&#39;m gonna move further down the
pyramid now to address conditions that could help us prevent focusing at
the end. So what might those conditions be? Well, these three right here
are very important conditions. So you have smoking, obesity, and
physical inactivity. So why are these important? These are things that
we&#39;ve heard before, but it, it bears saying again. Tobacco is
responsible for 20% of all deaths. Smokers are more likely to develop
diabetes. If you smoke and have diabetes, you&#39;re more likely to get
heart disease. If you are overweight or obese, you are 10 times more
likely to get diabetes. If you are inactive, you are more likely to have
heart disease and get certain types of cancer. These guys, if you will
pardon the pun, travel in packs, and they go together and there&#39;s,
they have to be addressed in a comprehensive manner if we want to get
control of our chronic disease rates and ultimately our healthcare
spending and health of our communities. So I&#39;m wanna start with
smoking. This measure represents, for adults, the number, the percentage
of adults who are smokers and they have smoked at least 100 cigarettes
in their lives and consider themselves current smokers. And in North
Carolina our rank is 33rd in the country, and our rate is 20%. You can
see that the national average is 19%. There is, again, variation by
county. In Jones county, 44% of adults smoke

  <p id="20:00">
  ...44%.  In Orange County, 12% spent, so we have a wide variation there.
 The Healthy North Carolina 2020 goal is 13%.  In our youth smoking,
this represents high school students who smoked at least one day in the
last 30 days.  So this is what they call a supplemental measure in the
ranking, so it isn’t actually ranked.  I don’t know how we compare to
other states--I mean to other, I don’t know our ranking, but our value
of 15% is lower than the US average, but it is higher than some of our
southern neighbors.
So now I want to talk about obesity.  So obesity in this chart
represents the percent of adults who are obese with a body mass index of
30 or higher.  Now, if you’ve been reading the news, you know we talk a
lot about obesity and overweight, so this is just the obesity piece of
that and this is an extreme measure.  So it’s only those that are 30--a
BMI of 30 or higher.
Our rank here at 29%, our rank on this measure is 25.  Again, we have
variability in Orange County, which is one of our healthiest counties,
which is why I keep listing it, is 21%, Robeson County’s rate is 41%.
The youth obesity percentage represents high school students who were
greater or equal to the 95th percentile for body mass on the growth
charts.  North Carolina’s value on this, 12.5% is lower than the
national average, but it is not the lowest among our southern neighbors.
And then the last measure on this slide is physical inactivity.  So this
represents the percent of adults who did no physical activity, such as
running, calisthenics, golf, gardening, walking, nothing but their job
in the last 30 days.  On this, so you can see we have 26.6% of our
adults getting no physical activity and our rank on this is 29.
So the last measure that I want to show, show you from in there because
Health Rankings is the public health funding measure, so this represents
state dollars dedicated to public health as well as federal dollars that
have been directed to the state through CDC and HRSA, the Health
Resources and Services Administration.
If you look at this measure, NC has $49, spends $49.85 per capita, per
person on public health funding, and you can see that we are lower than
the national average and lower than any of our southern neighbors.
In this measure we rank 43rd.  Now, there’s a great deal of variability
in this measure because as you know, in NC, a lot of the public health
spending begins at the local level, and this measure does not capture
that.
But what that means is that we do not have consistent services across
the state because if it’s not funded by the federal government and it’s
not funded by the state government, then it is left to the localities to
determine how to fund that.  And as you can see, with the variability
that we have across our counties, some counties are better suited to be
able to do that than others.
In the most recent survey of local health departments that was done by
the state’s Center for Health Statistics, there were 39 health
departments who lost staff since 2011, so in the 2013 survey, 39 health
departments lost staff, but interestingly, 28 gained staff, so...

  <p id="25:00">
  ...What you can see is that we have this divergence here between the
counties who can and the counties who can not. Fifty-three local health
departments provided care, prenatal care, in this most recent survey,
and that was a 29% decrease from 2011. So we are seeing a loss of
staffing and a loss of services at the local level. Now, I have recently
completed a study in North Carolina that looked at the funding that was
provided by local health departments so I looked at local public health
funding and outcomes in the state of North Carolina. We specifically
looked at infant mortality, and we were able to calculate that the
services that the local health departments provided in those communities
averted 191 infant deaths in 2008 so these loss of services and loss of
staffing at the local level have real world consequences.
(Everybody&#39;s ignoring that so I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s not like a
fire alarm or anything. Oh, a ghost, OK). So we&#39;ve looked at a whole
lot of numbers very quickly, but I want to just stop for a minute and
say, &quot;OK. So what? What do we do? What works for a healthy
NC?&quot; Like medicine, public health is a science, and we do have
evidence and we know what works. So we have a base of evidence and
interventions for many of these. We know what to do, but we very seldom
have either the authority or the funding to fully implement the
appropriate dose of the intervention. There are a number of strategies
for each of these problems that we&#39;ve identified, and in some areas
the evidence is stronger than others, and where we have good evidence we
are implementing evidence based programs. But, as I mentioned, sometimes
we are not able to implement them as fully as we would like, but for
example with tobacco. This is an area where we have probably more
evidence than some of the other areas, but we know that the evidence
shows if you have programs and policies to reduce exposure to second
hand smoke then you can get better health outcomes. You have programs to
prevent youth from smoking. Programs to help people quit smoking.
Programs to help pregnant women quit smoking. These are all things that
are evidence based and in some cases we are able to do them and in some
cases we are not able to do as much as we would like, but in some cases
we have done - we have made great strides and we thank you for your
support on that. So the important thing is to remember that there are
solutions and that monitoring and evaluating the progress is important,
and that it takes partnerships across all sectors to work on the social
determinants of health because its not only about what happens inside a
health facility or a health clinic. I put this slide up here because
frequently when I talk with community leaders about a number of health
conditions I see eyes glaze over, and hands go up and its, &quot;OK. Now
what? There&#39;s so many things? How do we move forward?&quot;  And I
certainly can&#39;t imagine sitting in your seats trying to make these
recommendations, but I want to offer you just a comfort that there are a
number of tools that are out there, and there are processes that have
been used all across the country and in communities all across the
United States where you can take a look at a range of conditions and
look at the number of people effected, the severity, the effectiveness
of the interventions, and the return on investment from addressing a
problem, and use those tools to help identify where you might find the
best place to make investments. And those tools have been used across
the country, as I mentioned, and in local communities. And I just
mention that just in case that&#39;s something you would like more
information on. Finally, I just want to close by saying that we rank 37
among all 50 states. I looked at - I gave you the rankings on the
individual...

  <p id="30:00">
  . . . unusual measures.  But when they&#39;re all rolled up, our ranking
comes out to be 37 among the 50 states.  And your roll in this is
pivotal.  What I like to tell my students when they first come to the
school is public health is a team sport.  So this is not  something that
public health professionals can go out and do.  They can&#39;t go out
and do public health.  It&#39;s something we as a community decide to do
to protect the health of the public.  And so it takes working across all
sectors.  It takes thinking about those social determinants of health
and how every policy - every opportunity we have - might have health
impacts, and to think about those and how we might encourage better
health outcomes.  I also want to leave you with the knowledge that there
is evidence for successfully addressing these, but also with the concern
that we need sustained and consistent effort to be able to improve our
outcomes.  The two frameworks that I showed you - the Healthy People
2020 and the Healthy NC 2020 - are ten-year frameworks, so this is not
something we can accomplish overnight.  We need to take the long view.
But it is something that will need consistent effort over time.  And
then I just want to acknowledge all the support we got from both the
Division of Public Health, the State Center, and the Department of
Health and Human Services.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Dr. ??  We will now open up the questions for Senator Heiss.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Starting slide number 20 on slide 28, it&#39;s
the funding per state.  And I guess the basic question I wanted to ask
is in looking at these states that are listed here: is there any
correlation between public health funding and outcomes of health?  Based
on the state&#39;s list here, it would actually show a negative
correlation.  The more you spend, the worse public health outcomes you
have.  And as we go through this process and determine where our
resources need to be: what mistakes are these other state&#39;s as well
as us missing in where they&#39;re placing their funding?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sorry.  So that&#39;s a great question, and the devil is in the details.
 So some of the states are spending more.  What you are seeing is more
the bottom end of the card, though, I will say.  I did not show you the
full range of what some of the other states are spending.  But what we
don&#39;t know is what they&#39;ve chosen to focus on.  So, for example,
Alabama is spending a lot.  Their outcomes are poor, but you look at
their childhood immunization rates and they&#39;re good.  So it may be
that they&#39;ve decided to effectively fund a specific dose of certain
interventions and not others.  I have not done that research, but I can
tell you in North Carolina, when we did look specifically at funding, we
did see improvements in the infant mortality and we did see improvements
in the heart disease hospitalization.  Those are two outcomes that we
looked at.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hello.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And along those lines,  we get a lot of recommendations of where we need
to spend more funds and those type of things.  But I don&#39;t think
anybody who thinks we&#39;re getting all this additional money this year
- from where it&#39;s coming in . . . but where are we investing funds
that are least effective?  Where are those funds that are in the system
that would best be redirected to other services?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, I think that&#39;s the holy grail: where can we cut and then put
those funds in a better place?  I don&#39;t know the answer to that, but
I do think that we have people who can help look at the areas.  I think
it&#39;s important to evaluate everything we do.  We know we don&#39;t
have money growing on trees.  I know you&#39;re struggling to try to
figure out how we can fund basic services.  These are complicated
questions, and I think it&#39;s important to use the data to drive us.
So, first, focus on the evidence base and be sure we&#39;ve got
evidence-based programs.  And then look for being . . .

Senator McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Hise and I, I seem to think our minds are running along parallel
paths this morning, because my question was pretty much focused on
pretty much on one of the same characteristics here. I mean, given the
fact that we have limited revenues, assuming that the only thing you may
see is modest increases of 1% or 2%, I mean, knowing that we&#39;ve
historically focused so much of our resources towards this and kind of
in the life and related health expenses and things of what I call the
back end of the curve. How would we go about re-prioritizing to see how
to best utilize those monies in a more effective way to achieve a better
health outcomes? How do we sit there and approach all of this data to
give it some meaningful analysis that really helps us reallocate our
existing revenues so we can get a bigger bang for the buck, or greater
health related outcomes?

answer that&#39;s clearly something that you will have to struggle with,
but that is why I included the slide about the process. There are
processes that can be used, and I think that the professionals that we
have at the state could be tasked with helping lead some of you  through
that process. It is a trade off and I do recognize that. There are some
things that are more expensive than others, and there are some things
that are clearly more effective than others. Its a matter of taking a
holistic look at that and, as you say, I appreciate even the question
because its the type of thinking that I think will get us where we need
to go, which is prioritize.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
One quick follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Allow.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
And, its on that same chart on page 28 here, dealing with North Carolina
spending $49.85 per ca-pita, now you indicated that that did not include
local funding. If we did include local funding do you have any idea
where  would then rank at that time, so its more of an apples to apples
comparison rather than an apples to oranges.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Well, I can tell you where we ranked in 2008 because I did just, well
not ranks, but what the number was, it was about $80 per person, but
that was on the average. Now, I can&#39;t say this is apples to apples
because this type of variation goes on in other states as well. So, some
states that you know are centrally funded and then some states have a
more distributed model, like we do, where its a combination of local and
state funding, so this variation it might even be worse if you added the
local funding in from other states, that I don&#39;t have. If you&#39;re
following me on that one, but the variation across the state was about
three fold. So, even if you looked at the average, now this is a little
bit different year because that was in 2008, the data that I had. But,
there was still an extraordinary variation across counties, some
counties had well over $100 per person and some that had well, well,
less then this average that you see here.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Well, thank you for that excellent report.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you and committee members I&#39;ll just tell you that I&#39;ve got
eight more of this, ask questions, so the limit is to shorten it
possibly up. Senator Robinson.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you for that report and the
comprehensiveness. One of the things, I&#39;ve got kind of a two fold
question that is apparent in your report and as, quote a health
practitioner I can relate to that and see it. Is the impact of poverty,
starts at childhood, starts with infant mortality and how that impacts
straight throughout life, one of the things that you didn&#39;t cover in
that and my question is, as we get into, and you didn&#39;t do age
breakdowns, youth, etc. We know that habits, in terms of physical
activity, health, etc. Impact, have you looked at any of the data
regarding youth, in terms of

  <p id="40:00">
  [SPEAKER] The kind of disease rates. We know smoking may be one of
those, I see that all the time or hear it in statistics. What are some
of the other factors regarding youth? Because as a child grows then into
adulthood, we carry those habits as we get older, so that you look at
some of the health indicators regarding youth, what are some of those
behaviors? What&#39;s the impact, in terms of over that age span? Have
you looked at any of that data in North Carolina?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I did not look at that for this report. Partially
because Dr. Cilenti, who is with our Maternal and Child Health
Department at the school, is scheduled to give two different
presentations to this group. One is on the infant, the zero to birth,
the infant mortality, and then the other is zero to five. And so she
will be focusing on that. But I will say that you have pointed out one
of the important conditions and that&#39;s poverty. It&#39;s this whole
community environment, so we know that as children grow out of that five
and up, then they need healthy places to play, they need places to get
physical activity that are safe, they need to have efforts to keep them
from smoking. Injuries are one of the highest risk for our youth, so
that&#39;s an important thing as well. That and drinking, which-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just one follow-up Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The other end of that that I wanted to mention. When
we look at data in North Carolina, you mention Orange County several
times, in terms of, and we know the income rate is totally different
from Robeson or Warren or whatever. But have we taken those models that
have worked, for instance in infant mortality in one county. I know we
made progress in Guilford, one of those areas we focused on. But, have
we taken any of the models that work in one county replicated them in
another or have there been factors of funding or whatever. Do you know
any of that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I couldn&#39;t speak to the specifics of that, but I
do think that&#39;s something that maybe Dr. Cilenti or some of our
division staff that would be here when she speaks would be able to
address that. But I do know the people who work at the local health
department level do try to share best practices, but of course there is
the variation in funding. So that-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insko.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I actually have two questions.
One is, and I&#39;d like to ask them both because you may not answer one
of them. But one of them is if we don&#39;t have any money, are there
policies that we could deal with that would have an effect. A lot of
these diseases that you&#39;ve talked about are lifestyle diseases. Or
maybe this is the same question. So, are there policies that we could
take that would help intervene with obesity and cardiovascular disease
and cancer and the diseases, we know smoking is one thing. We know
obesity is one thing, and so that sort of leads me to the second
question. So we have passed bills controlling vending machines,
what&#39;s in vending machines in public schools, for example. But why
don&#39;t we do that in all public-owned buildings? We might not want to
do it in privately-we probably wouldn&#39;t do it in privately-owned
buildings, but public-owned buildings, it seems to me like there are
some policies that we could deal with that would help intervene in some
of these issues. The other thing then is that that gets into this
question of, this tension between individual liberty and common good.
And can you make a case for why we should be concerned at all about the
community health? Why is it a common good? Why should that even be
important to us? Why isn&#39;t that just an individual decision that
people live with? Why do we need it at the community level?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I appreciate that question. I actually, I&#39;m
in public health, so yes I&#39;m going to come out saying health is a
common good, and I think when we look at how we live and work as a
community, the fact that we have a number of factors that would
influence how that ill effect is held.

  <p id="45:00">
  If we have a healthy community, then we can get better jobs here. You
can raise the standard of living. If you have poor health outcomes,
you&#39;re not going to get those jobs. So it&#39;s actually in the
state&#39;s best interest to have a healthy population so that we can be
competitive as a state. Aside from our humanistic belief that everyone
deserves to leave a long and healthy life, this tension between our
individual rights and calling these individual behaviors, I think is
something that we wrestle with in public health because yes, we are
Americans. We do have our freedoms and we do believe in that, but what
happens is that we have a lot of forces that are trying to get us to
change our will. That&#39;s certainly happened with tobacco. So we had a
lot of advertising money and a lot of other forces that pushed people to
take up behaviors that were not healthy. What we need, and this is where
your question is going, is the healthy thing to be the easy thing. And
that&#39;s where the policies come in place. So having smoke-free
workplaces makes it easy for people who want to quit, and most people
who smoke want to quit. It makes it easy for them to quit if they have a
smoke-free workplace. So, yes, some of the things we&#39;ve done around
tobacco, and there are other areas where we could look at that. There is
a movement called Health in All Policies where actually health is a
consideration of any policy that is introduced, and I think that&#39;s a
wonderful way to understand how we can be sure that we are considering
the impact of health in everything we do. Not just when we&#39;re
spending money on health programs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tucker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Doctor, thank you for your
report this morning, and when I ask a question, I do it in all due
respect, and perhaps you were not prefaced on this meeting and what you
bring to us? I am extremely disappointed in an answer of I don&#39;t
know. We sit as a mechanical contractor, retired air force pilot,
statistician, former county commissioner, and try to, from a 50,000 foot
level, try to understand the complexity of what goes on in public
health. I would prefer that you would tell me what are the top three
things that we can spend our money on and reduce in other areas? Such as
you mention tobacco and cessation programs. We cut those two years ago,
but yet we continue to fund some high-cost alcohol treatment programs
throughout the state. I would prefer you to tell me, ma&#39;am, as 20
years in this business and having to work in the health department, if
we were to do a state match and perhaps redirect monies to public health
where they could hire more OBs to deal with women in their pregnancy to
reduce infant mortality rate? I see what you&#39;ve done here for us,
and you tell us where we rank, but I&#39;m looking for areas with no new
money to be able to reduce areas that we&#39;re not getting an ROI and
placing dollars in those. And I would expect, with your academic
credentials and all these smart people you mentioned earlier that were
working on all these things and these evidence-based programs, you could
suggest at least three areas, looking at our budgets and the monies
we&#39;ve spent over the years, that we could reduce and then we would
get a bigger bang for our buck. That&#39;s what I was looking for out of
your presentation. And perhaps you weren&#39;t told that, and I would
ask for probably an unacademic response by shooting from the hip from 20
years experience in telling me what you would do if I was looking at
this from where I look at?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I&#39;m sorry to disappoint you. I do aim to
please, and so that is not what I thought I was asked to come talk
about. I admit that these are complicated decisions, and I understand
that you are looking for guidance, and I think that we can provide that.
That would require an assessment of the spending that had been done, and
I have not looked at the spending that has been done on every program in
North Carolina.

  <p id="50:00">
  There are some easy, easy wins.  I do think you mentioned tobacco and
that is a place where we know that it’s important to help people who
want to quit, so we have the quit line.  Can we reach all the people we
want to reach?  These are questions that we need to answer.  I don’t
have the top three; I think that is a charge that this committee was
expecting and I think we could probably reconsider--maybe I’m not the
right person, but maybe I can get with the right people--so I can say I
don’t know, but perhaps can I can also say we can get back to you
because I think you’re going to hear some more data.  And I think that
those are when you have heard sort of the full complement of what you
have asked for, you then like to look at additional data about moving
things around.  I think that’s a little different type of engaging that,
but.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, thank you, I just didn’t know what you were asked to do or not do.
 It would be my charge for you to get with your professional folks that
are really smart people you tell me about, and give us as a committee
the top three things that we could spend our money on, and then the
places were our return on investment is not so high that we can move
those dollars over with the understanding that we have no new money
based on the growth we’ve had in the Medicaid program in Jan/Feb, which
is tracked at 8-9%, it’s gonna eat us alive.
We’re gonna need to move things around and be effective.  I do like your
term sending money upstream, I do understand that and realize that, but
and I do realize the cultural impact to North Carolina.  I grew up in
eastern NC eating fried chicken, and bbq, and breadsticks and working in
the tobacco field.  And I understand what that did to me culturally.  As
I grow up, I still belong--I’ve got a 16-year-old’s appetite that my
grandmother gave me from the clean plate club, and a 65-year-old body.
 But that’s what happens to us as we go along and gain weight and have
these other things.  I did stop smoking at 30, but you need to tell us
those things because we have got to have this information and we have
got to have it now, doctor.  Thank you, Miss J??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Minor comments, I’ve been in the health
insurance and employee benefits business for 38 years.  And there’s one
area that could be very beneficial and would cost very little money, and
that’s for your office and the state health director’s office to partner
up with say the National Federation of Independent Business, maybe the
NC Chamber, but they tend to just look at big employers.
 But under 50 employees, as most people know, are 85% of our employees
are employed someplace that has 50 or less employees.  Now, what we have
told people, starting about five years ago, if you will put in a
wellness plan and make it as mandatory as you can under federal
law...now the state employees health plan has done that for state
employees, so that’s fine.
So I’m talking about private employers and nonprofits.  To help those
people to be able to put in wellness plans, they have no one to help
them.  Now, we do help our smaller clients with that.  We have vendors
that we go to and they will do the wellness plans for them.  But people
all the time say I need to cut my health insurance premium.  Well, they
doubled in the last five years, and they doubled in the five years
before that and they’ll keep on doing that.
I said there’s one thing you can do, you can put, well two, you can put
in a smoker’s cessation program and you can bar smoking from your
company premises, okay.
The other thing is put in a wellness program, and basically what they
are, you probably know, but some of these folks may not know, is you say
if you participate in this wellness program, you will pay 20% less on
your health insurance.  Of the total cost, not just what the employers
kick in the total cost, and so it in other words, if you don’t, you’re
gonna be paying a lot of extra bucks, big bucks.
And that program is very simple.  They hire an outside vendor that will
come in and do blood draws on the premises, and the employees will fill
out online (if they can do it online, if they can’t then they can fill
it out on paper), and it asks about 65 questions -- medications, family
history, lifestyle, all these things.
Well what we found out, the first one we put in...

  <p id="55:00">
  The Raleigh Durham Airport was a phenomenal success and still is a
phenomenal success and I tell these other employers that it&#39;s the
only way you can keep your health insurance premiums in line. There is
no other way. A way that most employers do, they switch from Blue Cross
on year to United the next year to Wellpath the next year to Signa the
next year. No way to do anything. So if you could partner with these
organizations, maybe it would take two or three employees. You can
allocate your own services. The county health departments, and I have
been a county commissioner, the county health departments are mainly
oriented towards poor type people, and rightfully so. So we need to, if
we tackle this at the workplace, it is so cost effective, very little
money, and you&#39;re covering, you&#39;re going after millions of other
people.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So I guess that was more of a statement than a question. Senator Pate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chair. Is it Dr, how do you pronounce your last name?
Shank.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Shank, like golf.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Thank you very much, I&#39;m, that was not my question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A bad golf swing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I had that in my day. I had a shank.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Dr. Shank, we&#39;ve heard from over the news media for the last couple
of months or maybe three, four, five months now since the Fall season
began that doctors, health providers are turning people away from their
health services if they have not had their influenza shots because
they&#39;re afraid of infecting the people who are in there who they
might run across. Secondly, we have heard some reports that measles and
other childhood diseases are apparently on the increase because the
immunizations for that are not universal. Some people are making the
decision not to have their child inoculated, or vaccinated or whatever
the proper term is. Are there dangers to the public in these precautions
being taken, and should we take a harder look at maybe enforcing what
needs to be done to see if we can&#39;t eradicate or at least minimize
these diseases among our population?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for that question. The immunizations is, as I mentioned, one
of the greatest victories that we&#39;ve had, but we do have these
pockets where people have refused to immunize their children because
they&#39;re afraid of, of stories that they&#39;ve heard about links
with other diseases, and, and so some states have taken strong stands on
removing the option for parents to, making it more difficult for parents
to decline. There is a thing called herd immunity, and so if you get a
certain percentage of the population immunized, it protects the
vulnerable. So we need to achieve those because children are not fully
protected even if they&#39;re getting their immunizations if they
haven&#39;t had the full series, and people who are undergoing
chemotherapy or some other conditions that have reduced, or compromised
status can be vulnerable. And so it is important to the state to achieve
that, and there have been other states that have taken stronger stands
on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So then in your position, what would you recommend to us that we do in
North Carolina?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m gonna punt that down the road to our child health expert Dorothy
Salinty is coming, and she will be talking about immunizations, so if I
could hold that one, I would do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, we have about three minutes left, so I&#39;ve got three,
Representative Van Duyn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mine is really quick and kind of a comment, not so much a question.
I&#39;m curious, is there any data over the history of the evaluation of
the life span that looks at causes, because I understand that years ago,
when your lifespan was 40, 44, 45 years, you were dying for a lot of,
from a lot of things

  Speaker changes:?? it looks like we have succeeded in life style and
I&#39;m curious in knowing what could have happened in terms  influences
in life span and what we done with that and i can get with you later if
?? short answer find
Speaker changes:so there is short answer the history of is one of the
great things we do ?? and that is killing lot of people and so the some
of the things that we have done in improving the moralities it impacts
lifespan in that early age and that involves and wide expectancy i think
some of the expectancy in the coming days ? is important to keep in mind
as your talking about children that actually can impact life expectancy
and population
Speaker changes:follow up
Speaker changes:this is really questioned to say this is lot of really
represents sitting out in the audience health care organizations ?? have
reputations we are gong to be ??  lot of them with this new approach we
are taking with looking third questions what re you doing can you
measure that are you doing for the dollars that we give you I&#39;d like
to ?? with in the public health ?? to people that they would make people
 lot easier  if they didn&#39;t bet up on us because we change the way
we do things in terms of who gets money who doesn&#39;t gets money that
is extremely ?? our lives is to only ?? north Carolina
Speaker changes:senator ??
Speaker changes:thank you Mr chair this is  follow up ?? that my be one
answered the later session regarding the slide on page 17 ?? north
Carolina immunization has break outing how many people re opting out
because they have to opt for how many for those who visible that is
policy that is something  policy stamp point that we could something to
do with if people are opting out that&#39;s another financial situation
issue that we should do with  different way that detail is very
important if visible so i don&#39;t know if you have it now  can be
brought later if not i think ht is something later to be dealt into i
can pass that question to senator ??
