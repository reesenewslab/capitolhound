<p id="00:00">
I'd like to call this meeting of House Finance to order. I'd like to
recognize our pages, Margaret Honeycutt, Kayla Dawson, Corey Gross, and
Kendra Heartsfield. If I pronounced that incorrectly I apologize. I'd
like to thank or Sergeant at Arms Mr. Seals, Mr. Lee, Mr. Clampett, and
Mr. Brandon. Thank you all for being here. At this time I'd like to
recognize Representative Grier Martin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much Mr. Chair. I just want to introduce to the
committee, I have a senior in high school who's shadowing me today, his
name is George Elvira. He is from Harnett County. He decided he wanted
to follow, actually, a competent legislator so he's shadowing me instead
of Representative Lewis but I hope ya'll welcome, he hopes to, he's
headed off to Marysville[?] College and hopes to pursue a career as an
army infantry officer. You will learn a great deal from this committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I appreciate you recognizing those of us who, maybe cannot appear on the
cover of GQ.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's a pleasure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To espouse our great modesty, but I would like to also welcome the young
man from the Harnett Central High School and he just proves that those
of us in Harnett County are able to overcome great adversity.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We're pleased, again, to have him here. At this time we will take up
House Bill 1034. Representative chairwoman Howard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee and, we have worked
on House Bill 1034 for many, many months. The legislation actually stems
out of program evaluation and we had members of the program evaluation
committee, many members are members of the committee, and in order to
get into more depth with this topic we also had a subcommittee via
program evaluation and again, many members of, several members of this
committee were members of that subcommittee. I'm gonna ask Ryan, Mr.
Chariman, Ryan Blackledge, to go through the bill with us. Before we
start I will say that I believe we have an agreement with all of the
folks involved. That is the treasurer's office, the Department of
Insurance, the Fireman's Association, and the Chief's association, and
the North Carolina Association of Firemen. I think everybody, and I hope
I'm not misspeaking this morning, but I believe everybody has come to an
agreement and we have worked out all of the glitches. So, Mr. Chairman,
with your permission I'll ask Ryan to go through the Bill with the
committee. We do have a summary and, of the, and we do have a proposed
committee substitute, Mr. Chairman I would move that that be before you
for the purpose of discussion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, you've heard the motion for Representative Howard to have the
PCS reports for discussion, all in favor say &quot;I,&quot; all opposed,
motion carried, thank you. Mr. Blackledge.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One Mr. Chair, members of the committee, my name is Ryan Blackledge with
bill drafting, also staff to the program evaluation committee that
worked on this. As Representative Howard said this does come out of a
lot of study from program evaluation. There are actually four studies
that came out the bill with the four different areas of the bill that
I'll get in to. For my presentation, because a lot of you haven't heard
this before, I'm gonna give a little bit of background on some of the
different funds and some of the different benefits that are provided to
firefighters and rescue workers and then I'm gonna say how the bill
changes some of those and also, when I go through that, I'll mention the
differences between the PCS before you today and the bill as it was
originally filed and it was originally recommended by program
evaluation. Now, there are, there were four studies and the bill is
divided up into four different sections. The first section corresponds
to the first study that came out, the second section the second study
and so on. The first section deals with firefighter relief funds. Relief
funds exist both as local pools of money and there's also a statewide
firefighters relief fund and within statute there's some</p>

<p id="05:00">
there's some ways that local fund boards can spend those monies and
there's a statutory formula which determines how much each fire
department gets of those funds, and then there's also the state fund
which can be used for certain purposes. The second study from PED dealt
with worker's compensation. As you know, worker's compensation, if you
get hurt on the job you can get payments and get taken care of. If
you're a volunteer, though, you're not getting paid so that doesn't fit
into the typical worker's comp framework. So what is done for volunteer
firefighters is, if they get hurt while working as a volunteer
firefighter and can't go back to their job and can't return to their
duties as a fireman, they receive compensation through a worker's comp
plan. The third study dealt with a supplemental pension fund. Right now
there is a pension fund that if firefighters, rescue squad workers, pay
into $10 a month for 20 years and have reached the age of 55 and have
retired then they can collect $170 per month. Third, there is also a
grant fund, actually two grant funds, for fire departments and also for
rescue squads where they can get grants, it's administered by the
Department of Insurance, but they can get those grants and use them to
purchase equipment and supplies. Alright, so that's the background.
There's the four main areas that the studies covered and now I'm gonna
go in to what actually has been changed in detail about those. If you'd
like to follow along I'm gonna be reading from summary, I'm gonna be
going through the various bullet points. So if you follow along that can
help you. At the very bottom of page one you'll see that first bullet
point. It increases from one to two percent the portion of certain tax
proceeds the Department of Insurance retains for administering,
administering the local relief funds. Within this bill, the department
is given additional responsibilities for reports for maintaining a
database of the funds, local relief funds, how they were spent, and so
they are given additional amounts from the tax proceeds. Up until a year
or so ago that was two percent, it was brought down to one, with this
additional responsibility being put on the department it brings it back
up to two percent. If you turn the page to the top of page two the PCS
and the original bill also provides guidance on minimum and maximum
amounts for the local relief funds. One of the things that the PED study
found was that some local departments were holding on to funds and not
spending them. They were just holding on, some of them thought they
could only spend the interest on those funds like it as some sort of
endowment. Of course, the amount of money in some of these funds is
very, very small so you don't get much interest, money isn't spent, and
the recommendation of my PED was to provide some guidance for what a
maximum fund balance should be. So that is provided within the bill.
There's also a minimum within the list of allowable expenditures,
basically if you look under the first half there are about eight in the
list. The first four can be done without the permission of the Fireman's
Association, the next half you have to have the permission of the
Fireman's Association and you would have to make sure that your fund
balance was above that minimum amount. Now what happens if they exceed
the maximum amount? Well, if a local department exceeds the maximum
amount then their portion, when there's the next annual allocation, is
put back into the big pot and it's reallocated to the department's who
don't exceed the maximum amount. The second point on there, it's, the
bill explicitly says that everyone who is managing these local funds and
the folks who are also managing the state-wide funds are to act as
prudent trustees, prudent managers of those. There's a particular
chapter in the statutes, the Uniform Prudent in Institutional Funds Act,
which says how folks are supposed to invest funds. It basically just
says they to do it in a prudent way, they have to carefully think about
where they're going to invest them. This deals with one of the issues in
that there was concern about some of the investment that was being done
so this just clarifies that it has to be done in a prudent way. That
third bullet point on the top of page two mentions line of duty benefits
to firefighters who departments are not members of the North Carolina
Fireman's Association. Right now, in order to get line of duty benefits,
and that is of course if you pass away int he line of duty, those
benefits go to members of departments who are then members of the
state-wide Fireman's Association. Some departments are not members oft
he Fireman's Association and right now they're money that they would
receive if they were departments instead goes to the state-wide fund.
What the bill does is it says from that money that's going to the
state-wide fund, instead</p>

<p id="10:00">
use that to pay line of duty death benefits to the members of
departments that aren't members of the state-wide group. Does that make
sense? Okay. The fourth item on there makes an adjustment to the list of
allowable expenditures for local firefighter relief funds. You recall I
mentioned there's a list of, it's about seven or eight things, and it
makes some adjustments to those. The next bullet point requires
additional reporting of local firefighter relief funds. One of the
issues that PED determined in it's study is, for a lot of the
expenditures there just weren't adequate records, adequate reporting on
how that money was spent, which makes auditing those funds very
difficult. It makes it difficult to know that the state funds that are
being given to these local groups is being spent in accordance with
statute. So there's some additional reporting requirements, those then
go on to the Department of Insurance who has to maintain a larger
database with all that information. Additionally there's a provision in
here that repeals certain local laws that are inconsistent with
expenditures that are allowed under that list that I've mentioned
several times. There are a lot of local bills out there that would do
things like give permission to purchase supplemental insurance or
supplemental retirement plans, those are now covered under general law
so there are a lot of old things that were allowed at one point, now
apply generally and so those older ways of doing it are repealed in
here. Alright, that's section one, that was the relief fund. Section two
deals with worker's comp. If we look on the summary you'll see section
two and some couple and three bullet points there. One thing it does is
it allows what is already happening with respect to the state-wide
associations. Right now the state-wide associations are participating in
the worker's comp fund. The statute says that it's only for the
firefighters. So technically, according to law, they shouldn't be in
there. If you look at the claims experience though it's an overall net
benefit to have those associations involved int he workers comp fund and
so there was a statutory change to allow them to continue to be
participants within the worker's comp fund. Also in section two, there's
a requirement that there be an annual actuary study of the worker's
compensation fund. One of the issues with the worker's comp fund is the
question of whether or not it will be adequate to fund things in the
future, whether the premiums for the participants, whether those
premiums are adequate to fund it. So there's a requirement for a
detailed study. One note, the PCS differs from the original bill in that
the PCS pushes the requirement oft hat study back to 2016. The original
requirement was to have a study by 2015, so a little bit more time to
get the study together. I will interrupt myself and back up just to
clarify, on section one there was something that was taken out. Within
section, excuse me, no, let me say in section two. For section two, at
one point within worker's comp there was a sentence that said if the
fund is inadequate than the board that administers the worker's comp
fund will have to perform basically a special assessment on the
participating departments in order to make up any shortfalls. That
sentence has been taken out. Finally, within section two, final bullet
point, there's a detailed list of requirements that the State Fire and
Rescue Commission must use when renewing it's contract with the worker's
compensation third party administrator. There are a lot of things that
weren't in that contract that PED thought should be included and so
there's about two and a half pages of what should be covered in there to
ensure there's adequate oversight and enough information for the state.
Now, section three deals with supplemental pension. Supplemental pension
is indeed supplemental, it's not any regular pension, and it's that
amount if they pay ten dollars a month for 20 years firefighters and
rescue squad workers can collect 170 dollars at 55 and at retiring. What
section three does is it does away with the retirement requirement.
Right now, after you've paid in for 20 years and have reached 55 then,
after you've paid for 20 years you don't pay any more. So if you started
paying in at the age of 20, pay to 40, you would stop paying at 20 and
would continue to go on and there was a change made to say that if you
get up to 55 there's no need for you to retire because a lot of the
volunteer firefighters will go on to work for fire departments after
that. So it says that once you've paid your 20 years and you reach 55
you can go ahead and start collecting supplemental pension. That does
have a fiscal cost, that fiscal cost is paid for</p>

<p id="15:00">
... by making a reduction to the grant funds that we’ll talk about a
little bit in Section 4, but it makes a reduction in the money going to
those grant funds, sends the money over to the general fund, and then
there’s some appropriations from the general fund of 1.4 million dollars
recurring to pay for the cost of allowing people to start collected the
pensions a little bit earlier. There’s also a belief that within that
pension fund there’s going to be some overall savings because the
Department of state Treasure is going to be making some adjustments to
how they calculate who is going to be eligible. Right now they’re not
assuming that people are going to fall off, but it is possible that
there are going to be volunteers that are going to stop being volunteers
and will never collect, so there’s going to be an adjustment to that
there. Finally, Section 4 deals with the grant funds. As I mentioned,
there are grant funds administered by the Department of Insurance. What
it does is it says that departments that have 50 thousand or less of
income can get a lower match rate. One of the issues is that there’s
some very small departments out there that don’t have much money and
can’t meet the 50/50 match rate to participate in the grant funds, so
there’s a lowering of that to 25/75. There are also some additional
reporting requirements from the Department of Insurance, there are some
additional oversights on how the Department of Insurance watches those
funds and how they’re spent, provisions for what happens to equipment if
a department dissolves, and also what happens if the equipment is taken
out of service – what the Department of Insurance does in that case.
Mister Chair, that was a pretty quick run-through. I know it’s 17 pages.
If anyone has any detailed questions, I’ll be happy to answer them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Chairwoman Howard? No. Representative
Warren? [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chair.
Perfect time, I’d like to make a motion that we give a fair report on
this but with permission for staff to make any grammatical or technical
changes as needed. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Any further questions
from the Committee? Representative Jones. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mister Chairman. I just wanted to say briefly, I’m here at your 9
o’clock position, so I just wanted to take the brief opportunity to
thank the volunteer firefighters in this state for what they do for us.
They provide an invaluable service, and in doing so, they not only
provide a much needed service but I know they save taxpayers of this
state money in doing so. From what I can see, this is a very positive
Bill for them. It is a long Bill. I just, I guess I would ask the
question, is there anything in this Bill that you could identify that
somebody might come back to me later and say “I can’t believe ya’ll did
this, ya’ll voted for this”? So is there anything embedded in 17 pages
that the volunteer…? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That happens all the time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] … firefighters going to come back and say “You
shouldn’t have done it”? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I concur with Mister Setzer –
that happens all the time. You can do the best you can and we still may
have a blooper, but as far as I know, Representative Jones, we have… as
I stated, everybody has given a sign-off on this, and with the Chair’s
permission, I would ask that the Fireman’s Association, Tim Bradley – I
believe he’s in the back of the room, and Mister Chairman…? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Absolutely. Mister Bradley, please step forward. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mister Chairman, Chairman Committee. We appreciate
the work done by the ?? with the PED staff, the research and tweaking
that was done on four major fire service programs. We support the Bill.
We believe it promotes the use of local relief funds. We believe it
makes the issuance of grants fairer and allows smaller departments to
get a better match for their money. We also believe that it makes the
pension fund more fair. We have suggested a few technical changes that I
believe the body has made the motion to allow those to be made as it
moves forward, which will take care of some unforeseen problems that as
we worked through the draft we didn’t see. Most of them are date
changes. The most significant one deals with some technical requirements
in the supplemental retirement to ensure they can continue to do those
as the law allows, but we do support the Bill with those technical
changes and appreciate the hard work that ?? did, the PED division and
Representative Howard for allowing us to participate along the way.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.</p>

[BEGINNING OF RECORDED MATERIAL]
Please, for a moment, does any members have questions for mister
Bradley? Thank you, represent Tine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you mister chairman, um, I have had some emails
from local departments, and I think there may be a misunderstanding so I
want to make sure that I can explain the two of them properly. There was
mention that there is a limit in section one in regards to the amount
per firefighter that they can retain before they, and the only penalty
is that they don't have to give it up is my understanding, they will not
have anymore of the state, the department of insurance collected money
from the premiums the next year, until they go below that amount. What
is that per fire fighter amount that's the max? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
would like to draw your attention to page seven, section one D, and just
to note, there is a delayed effective date on this particular section,
it's effective July 1/20/2015 so local departments do have some time to
spend their money. But you can see there is a new statutory section put
in maximum fund balances and it's twenty five hundred dollars, 2500 per
member on the departments roster is the max. Follow up mister chairman?
Follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] And I'm correct that the only penalty is
that they do not receive additional funds the following year from the
department of insurance, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, you are correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hull.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you mister chairman, and I guess this question
is for staff or for representative Howard and I heard mister Bradley say
he submitted some technical changes to be included and wanted to know
are they currently included in this bill, and if not, is there a reason
they are not before this morning so we'll know what they are and what
the impact is?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] We didn't get the notice until late yesterday and we
were trying to get the bill ready to come up this morning, so we have an
agreement with the senate that they will handle the, and they are
technical, purely technical, and then it will come back to us for
concurrence if there is an issue but I understand they are purely
technical changes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Carney.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you mister chair, I just wanted, I served on the
sub committee of the full committee and I will tell you, and I said this
on the committee and sub committee and I'm saying it again here. I've
been here 12 years and some bills have been fully vetted, this bill I
give my total hats off to chairman Howard for being very open and
transparent. Everybody involved in this bill that had any, any piece of
it under their purview were included. Staff worked diligently trying to
bring everybody's concerns to the table. I'll reiterate what chairman
Howard said, it really was one of those times that everybody was really
heard, their issues were addressed and worked through. yeah, there are
always some areas where moving forward we need to tweak, but there were
a lot of unanswered questions, concerns. Well, clarifying language
really is what we really had to come up with because of different
entities, volunteer and paid, having concerns about what the statute
said and they've been clarified. And yeah, I guess moving forward there
will be changes down the road as we work through the process but thank
you for extending that date and I recommend that we support this.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, at this time do we have anyone in the
audience that would like to address this bill? Seeing none, any further
questions from the committee? Representative Warren, you are recognized
for your motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you mister chair, I would recommend that, or I
would like to make a motion that the committee give a favorable report
to house bill 1034 with permission for staff to make any technical and
grammatical changes as necessary with referral to state personal.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee you heard motion on the
floor, is there any further discussion or debate? If not all in favor--
yes mam.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mister chairman, would representative Warren strike the
last three lines of words in his motion that we will send it, I believe
we are moving to send this bill straight to the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] ??Amended, I will do that, yes mam.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Unfavorable to the original bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes sir, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Members of the committee you've heard the motion on the
floor, is there any further discussion? If not, all in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] All opposed? Motion carried.
