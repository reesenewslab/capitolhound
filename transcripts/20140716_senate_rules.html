<p id="00:00">
Ah, let's see. Pages today, Charles van Dyke, Charles, where are you in
this big room? Welcome.  Is it Richard Perigot? Is that right? Welcome,
Richard. Tamara Williams, welcome. Jordan Raglan, welcome. Ruth Parsons,
welcome. Who do we have? Is it Michelle Allred? Welcome. And Sophie
Hennings? Welcome. And Davis Braswell. Welcome. A fine looking group. I
wish the front rows looked that well.
Okay. Sergeant-at-arms, they're running around here, I don't know if I
have a list for them. Nope, so we won't do that.
Okay do we want to start off with busses? Rep. Brawley, are you going to
handle the busses? Let's do House bill 375, increase allowed size of
passenger buses. Rep. Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, always a pleasant day in the Senate. This bill
is to benefit the larges t suburb of the town of Matthews, it's a small
town called Charlotte. They have some bus routes that are overcrowded,
and rather than run 2 buses, they want to run a articulated bus, it's
got a joint in the middle that will allow it to make turns. Right now
they're not allowed in North Carolina law, this would only be allowed on
major streets in the city of Charlotte, it's really more of a local bill
but it needs to be public, I believe. I would appreciate your help.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative. Sen. Rabin?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. We've reviewed this pretty well in Transportation and the
committees and we certainly move for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Sen. Rabin moves for a favorable report to House bill 375. Any
further discussion or debate?
Hearing none, seeing none, all in favor say &quot;aye&quot;,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any opposed, &quot;no&quot;?
Rep. Brawley, one quick question. Who is your senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It would be Jeff Tarte.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Jeff Tarte? Oh, I was hoping you'd be in Rucho's district. We're looking
for someone to run, we'll talk some other time.
Okay, let's do House bill 1096. Rep. Walters I saw you around here?
Union county contracted ambulance service.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate the opportunity to present
this. This bill allows Union county to collect on delinquent ambulance
service fees. Currently the state law allows for counties to use a tax
?? garnishment to collect for wages if they provide the services or
franchise. Union county contracts for these services, so technically
they're not able to use those methods and this will allow our county to
collect those delinquent
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative. Sen. Brock's over there giving us the okay
over there for a favorable report, any futher discussion or debate from
the committee?
Okay, hearing none, all those in favor  say &quot;aye&quot;?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed, &quot;nay&quot;?
They &quot;Aye&quot;s seem to have it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, who's going to run that on the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, good choice.
Tucker on the floor, I guess Tarte did the first one.
Sen. Goolsby, are you around here? Good morning Senator Goolsby, I hope
you had a good time last night.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I did.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Brown and I wish  we could have been with you all, but we weren't
invited.
Let's do House bill 369, criminal law changes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well thank you sir, that didn't stop Sen. Rucho from coming.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well he figures someone would pay him for it, Sen. Goolsby.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Appreciated him being there, appreciated the sophomores honoring me last
night.
We're gonna jump into House bill 369, a lot of moving parts, it has
changed a lot since it was originally put forward. The worker's comp
portion dealing with illegal aliens, we think Mr. Chairman's more
properly dealt with in long session, so that has been dropped out of the
bill but if you'll run through it with me there, 12 sections, let's
start with section 1. That deals with expunctions, it expands
expunctions to felony breaking and entering offenses, and attempt
offenses. Again, to get an expunction after 15 years, you can have
committed no crimes, have been a law abiding citizen, complied with all
requirements of your probation for the crime you committed 15 years
before. Section 2 ammends the statutes to replace all statutory
authorization for deferred prosecution-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Goolsby, let me interrupt you one moment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes  sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Brown moved we bring the PCS before us for discussion, let's do
that.</p>

<p id="05:00">
All those in favor of bringing PCS before [??] for discussion purposes
say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any opposed? Sorry, go back to it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. It basically turns deferred
prosecutions into conditional discharges This is a request from local
district attorney who deals with what we call felony district court,
where we hear HNI felony cases in district court. The problem that we
had with deferred prosecutions is that the defendant who enters the
agreement, if he reneges on it we then have to sort of start everything
over, I'm sure that Senator Jeff Jackson is aware of how that works and
we hope that this will prevent that. They'll have to enter a guilty plea
in order to get the equivalent of deferred prosecution under a
conditional discharge. If they renege on it they can then be found
guilty because they pled guilty, and sentenced accordingly.
Next section three deals with separating the offense of drug
parafernelia, currently marijuana itself is a class three misdemeanor.
Since class three misdemeanors you can only be put in jail on the third
offense, the problem we have with the fact that we treat all
paraphernalia the same is that paraphernalia itself is treated as a
class one misdemeanor. So if a defendant is arrested for possession of
marijuana class three, possession of drug paraphernalia typically
happens, class one, they then rate a lawyer provided by the state. If we
excise out marijuana paraphernalia as a class three misdemeanor just
like the drug itself, they would not rate a free lawyer until they have
three prior offenses. This is a money saving attempt to equalize the law
and the punishment and I hope that you'll support that.
Section four deals with the Human Trafficking Commission and Aaron's law
which we talked about a lot a few weeks ago. What we end up doing here
is we will allow the Human Trafficking Committee to study the prevention
of sexual abuse of children. Senator Robinson and I have worked on this
and we'd appreciate your consideration. Including that we don't have to
create an additional and separate commission in order to study this and
to help us adopt some guidelines for our schools.
Section five increases the penalty of an inmate with a cellphone from a
class one misdemeanor to a class H felony. It also deals with the
possession of a cellphone by an inmate and the local confinement
facility it moves it up also to a class H and does the same for an
inmate in a state prison. Six deals with creates a class I felony for a
person who assaults a person in retaliation because the exercise of the
duties of any legislative executive or court officer, that is some
legislation that's come out based upon of course what has occurred in
here in Wake county.I don't know how many of you all has the opportunity
to meet the assistant district attorney when she was touring the
courthouse with the DA asking that she was the one whose family member,
whose father had actually been abducted and abused. We came forward with
this and we would appreciate it if you would support that bill.
There's also another portion of it making a class I felony for anyone
who knowingly or willfully makes any attempt to inflict serious injury
or kill any other person in retaliation. So, tries to cover all those
bases, similarly on the back on the summary you'll see that.
Section seven adds qualified retired correction officers to the list of
officers that are exempt from taking firearms courses for concealed
carry. Section eight authorizes forensic and chemical analyst to testify
from remote locations by video if certain conditions are met. Section
nine authorizes detention officers who are employed and authorized by
sheriffs to carry firearms on educational properties when acting in the
discharge of their official duties.
Section ten basically takes air rifles, air pistols and BB guns, not
including the definition of dangerous firearms, off that list in certain
counties, Hanson, Cleveland, Harnett, Stanley and Surrey. Section 11
authorizes plaintiffs in summary ejectment proceedings to complete
service of process by using a person who's at least 21 years old.
Basically what it does is it strikes from the current section of the law
the requirement that if the sheriff is not able to serve an individual
then in most cases except in summary ejectment and executions, you can
then hire a private process server. What this does is basically it
includes summary ejectment with all the other cases. So the sheriffs if
they're able to serve the person do it, if they're not after a certain
amount of time a person is able to seek private process, which is the
way it is for everything else but summary ejectments and executions in
the state right now. And lastly, section 12 amends the stature
authorizing expunction of...</p>

Defense for 15 years dealing with finger prints and such A lot of things
that had some controversy in this bill had been taken out. I would
Appreciate your support if they have any questions that I and my staff
would try to answer, Mr Chairman.
[Speaker Changes] Lets Start with Senator Stein
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr Chairman. Senator Goolsby, Thanks for the
changes you had made in the bill. I like it a lot better. Appreciate all
the work you had done to it. Question about section11. And I don’t know
if Sheriff Harrison was able to make it this morning. But he called me
last night said he couldn’t make it. But that if could he would make it.
He called about section 11 and expressed some reservation about allowing
9 law enforcement process servers and that his fear is that process
serving is an inherently conflict ridden process and that to allow 9 law
enforcement to do that work may end up resulting in escalation of
violence that isn’t in society’s interest. Just want to get your
comments on that.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Stein, yes the concerns that Sheriff that
initially had, we had tried to addressed those. What we did was to
completely take out that section and instead the staff can correct me if
I am wrong, is it rule is it A1or 4A I can’t A1.
[Speaker Changes] Yes 1-1A rule 4
[Speaker Changes]: I had the numbers correct just didn’t have them all
together
But what basically happens right now Senator Stein, is in all service if
the Sheriff doesn’t serve somebody within the allotted time, all we are
doing now is striking some rejectments and executions of the two that
were left out of the law. So, the sheriff  is still be able to get their
fees and still be able to do their service. And part of the problem that
understand from the , I don’t do this kind of law, but from the folks
who multi-family dwelling and those kind of places and folks who rent
them. The sheriffs are more than  happy to come out and  post it. And
you can sure reject somebody with posting. But if you don’t get actual
service, you can’t get money damages. This just gives the ability for
folks who have rental property to then be able if the sheriff is unable
to serve someone who makes themselves unavailable for service that is
when the sheriff is not able to do that after the appropriate period of
time and in this site. Please correct me if am wrong. Then it’s like all
the other cases in the law you are then able to have some one to go and
serve the process as currently is the law. We are only striking some
rejectment from the exclusion list which only is execution from
rejectment list right now.
[Speaker Changes] So, is the  Sheriff’s association now supportive of
the language.
[Speaker Changes] I do not know. But it is significantly better than
what they had before
[Speaker Changes] Fair Enough, Mr Chairman, we see someone from the
Sheriff association is here to address this point.
[Speaker Changes] Sure. I see a couple of them sitting in that row. One
of you would like to speak on this. Mr Stall Please grab a mike.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr Chairman Senator
[Speaker Changes] Let us know who you are not everybody knows
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Senator Greg Stall North Carolina Sheriff’s
Association. Senator, we had not seen the language although we had some
discussions with some of those who had worked on the language and we
would agree this looks better that it did before. But we would like some
time to do some analysis of this and contact our sheriffs, particularly
some of our sheriff attorneys, who do this regularly and see if it
passes muster. We are sympathetic to the issue. But just want to make
sure this do not what we would be concerned here and that is to have
some conflicts in your communities over these ejectments and not having
an uniformed officer serving court issued paper. We can get the
paramount issue any time the court issues that paper that it gets served
it gets served properly and that there is no conflict where conflict
gets avoided. Thank you.
[Speaker Changes] Thank You Mr Stall we will have time to check this out
before it reaches the floor. Yes you may Senator
[Speaker Changes] Senator Stein and other committee members. I would ask
you to turn to page 13 of the bill you will see at the top section 11 A
. You can see that only thing that is still there in the last senate.
This subsection shall not apply to execution pursuant to article 28 of
chapter 1 and then we strike or some rejectment  pursuant to article 3
of chapter 42  general statute. All that’s doing.</p>

<p id="15:00">
summary ejectments from that list of 2. Do you see that Sen. Stein?
Again, it's a very simple change, and what it'll allow is allow property
owners who have been successful in having the sheriff's department post
the property to eject the tenant, to then be able to actually, if the
sheriff can't serve them, then to at least to try to find someone else
to serve them so that they can then get a money damage for the damage to
their property or the loss of rent, whatever it might be. We thing that
is a wonderful compromise, Mr. Chairman, and we'd appreciate the
committee's consideration of that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Jackson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The old Jackson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's right. The one without the hair.
Sen. Goolsby, I'm just trying to get a little understanding on section
10, and why those 5 counties are just singled out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Jackson, I cannot tell you why it's those 5 counties. I do not
know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, that's honesty. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can anybody answer that? Sen. Brown, can you answer that or do you want
to ask a question? Okay, can we answer that question? Staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair.
I can't tell you why we were removing those 5 particular counties, but I
can clarify though what this is doing is currently under this particular
statute of permitting young children to use dangerous firearms, those
listed items, the air rifles, air pistols are not considered dangerous
weapons under that statute except in the listed counties, so what we
were doing is deleting 5 counties from that list so that those air
rifles will not be dangerous weapons for the purposes of this statute in
those 5 counties being deleted. As for why those 5 counties are now
wanting to not considering them dangerous weapons when they previously
before, I can't answer that question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Jackson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could maybe we get some clarification as to why we're even doing this in
section 10?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Jackson, you may want to give Rep. Lewis  a call. I think he might
be able to help you out on that one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, yes I'll do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. Thank you.
Sen. Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Follow up on Sen. Stein's concern on the
sheriffs? My sheriffs have a concern as well on that piece. I understand
Sen. Goolsby you're working on it. I do think we just need to make sure
that we've just got this worked out. Because I think it is a concern by
a lot of sheriffs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Brown, the original portion of the bill actually allowed private
process servers to immediately do all the work. So this is not what was
originally in the bill, that has been excised from it and all this does
is allow property owners the ability to actually have a private process
server of the sheriff's unable to do it. It'll not affect the ability to
get their fees, it'll not affect their ability to do their work, it's
just if they can't do their work, there is relief now for property
owners to seek money damages.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I recognize the voice. Yes ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I'm not on the committee but if you will allow-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well we're glad to have your input.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you will allow me, I would like to address section 10 about the bb
rifles? This came as a request from a constituent in one of my counties
because the father had gone to a local store to buy his son a bb gun,
and he was told by the store that he could not purchase the bb gun
because his son was under 12 years of age. So this was brought forward
on this father's behalf, and when it was brought forward there was 4
other counties that wanted to tack on to the bill, so we ended up with 5
counties wanting the same option, to purchase bb guns for their little
children just like all the other counties in the state of North
Carolina. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator.
Sen. Jackson, you good with that now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir Mr. Chairman, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, who else? Young, the before Jackson please go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Goolsby, I want to thank you for this bill. There's a lot of good
stuff in here, in particular the creating a separate offense for
marijuana paraphernalia has been common sense waiting to happen for a
long time. So I thank you for that. My question here, the issue is
regarding the conditional discharge issue on page 2, section A4,
compliance with terms of additional discharge. Basically with deferred
prosecution and conditional discharge, the idea is you get someone who
made a stupid mistake, and you find a way to give them a second shot,
they have to jump through a bunch of hoops, but if they do it, and
complete everything successfully, then the charge gets dismissed like it
never happened. One of the concerns in the transition we're making into
conditional discharge is that for future applicants</p>

<p id="20:00">
Of employment. On those applications, a lot of times it says have you
ever pled guilty to an offense, and my concern is that under this bill,
those people who successfully go through the conditional discharge
program, which exists to help people get a job and keep their record
clean, would be forced to say yes, under the changes that we’re making
here. They’d be forced to say that they did plead guilty at some point,
which would defeat a large part of the purpose. To that end, I do have
what I intend to be a friendly amendment. Colorado has addressed this
issue, and they added just a few words which would be added to A4,
saying upon fulfillment of these terms, once you jump through all of the
hoops, in addition to the court discharging the charges, the plea or any
finding of guilt will be withdrawn, which I think may solve that
problem. If you think it’s a friendly amendment, I have a copy here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, thank you. The only other redress would be of course an
expunction, which would then give that same ability but in case the
person didn’t apply for an expunction or the time limit it takes to do
that, I would consider that a friendly amendment and would be in favor,
Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Do you have it written up, to send
forth? Senator Jackson sends forth an amendment, moves to amend the bill
on page 2, line 41, by re-writing the line to read conditions of a
conditional discharge granted pursuant to this section, any plea or
finding of guilty previously entered shall be withdrawn and the court
shall discharge. Senator Jackson, comments on your amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Personally, I’m for it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [LAUGHTER] okay. Well
that is good. Okay. Anybody in committee have a question of Senator
Jackson? Senator Goolsby. Senator Jackson is for the amendment, okay?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Are you for it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I am, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sounds good to me. Are we
ready to vote the amendment? Okay, we have the amendment as read and
presented by Senator J. Jackson. All those in favor say aye. Any
opposed, no. All right, squeaks through. Okay, amendment’s adopted. All
right, further discussion or debate on the bill? Senator Barefoot. Oh,
I’m sorry, Senator Brock, you’re next. Go ahead, Andrew. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Relating to section number
4, we’re hearing reports that the federal government is transporting
some children that are undocumented or illegal aliens into states
without the knowledge of states, into, without any prior knowledge to
the state government. You know, one of my concerns with that, not only
is the federal government not letting us know about children being moved
to different states, it could also lead to a type of situation where we
might have some of these children delivered into some of these
predators’ hands, that you know if they came here, the parents came here
for what ?? for a better life, that the federal government has their
hands dirty by delivering them to a bad situation. So if we could take a
look at that in the trafficking commission. I believe the federal
government is just as guilty of transporting people as anyone. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] If I may, Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Please. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] When we created the bill last year that actually pumped up the
power of the human trafficking commissioner, human traffic or sex
trafficking bill, we have substantially increased the punishments in
this state. I can tell you having been at a meeting last week down in
Wilmington, dealing with one of the groups that’s out fighting this, our
law enforcement across the state is now receiving a lot of intensive
training on human trafficking, sex trafficking and we are starting to
see more and more prosecutions popping up. The federal government is
doing that but now that we’ve empowered our state and local officials to
do that, we’re seeing more and more of that Senator Brock. So I think
the fruits of the bill we passed last year are starting to bear.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Barefoot. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chairman. I’d just like to make a comment, then I have a few amendments
to offer. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] My first comment,
I’ve been contacted by my local sheriffs. They do not raise the issue of
fees for the service to process. I think their concern is with the issue
of summary</p>

If you have a 22 year old college kid traveling down a dirt road in
Franklin County, to tell someone that someone’s trying to kick them out
of their house, there may be a problem. And so theirs is one of public
safety, and I just would like for you to take that into consideration.
The second thing I’d like to do is offer a few amendments. The first of
which moves to remove Chowan County from the accepted section, or from
the exceptions under the language in section 10. And I can send that
forth. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Send it forward. Senator, if you have a couple
of amendments, you said? Can we go ahead and get them passed out, do you
mind? [PAUSE] Senator Barefoot moves to amend the bill on page 12, lines
44 through 47, and that is you’ll see it when passed out, I guess you’re
striking Chowan, is that correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Apparently someone’s
daddy in Chowan County wants to get their kid a Christmas present.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okey-doke. Senator Jenkins? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
A question of Senator Barefoot. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Barefoot, do
you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yep. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Go ahead. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Barefoot, in that I represent Chowan County and have
heard nothing from anybody in Chowan County about this, how did you get
ahold of it, out of curiosity? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Cooke. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Cooke doesn’t represent Chowan County. I would ask that
if I can speak on the amendment, Mr. Chairman? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Please,
the floor is yours. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would ask that this amendment be
set aside until I can have a conversation with the leadership of Chowan
County as to whether they do or do not like this. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, I think that would be appropriate. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I have an
objection to that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So let’s just table this for now.
Okay, do you have another amendment, Senator Barefoot? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah the second amendment increases the penalty for second offense of
carrying a concealed weapon that is a firearm. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay,
where is that? Do we have it up here? Is it being passed out? I think
it’s being passed out now. Senator Barefoot moves to amend the bill on
page 13, lines 26 through 28, offense in a class H felony, for a second
or subsequent offense, a violation of subsection A1. Is punishable under
the GS14415-21(A). Not punishable under this section. Senator Barefoot,
you have the floor to explain the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And Staff
may want to explain the reference to the general statute. My
understanding is this does not apply to people who have concealed carry
permits who happen to leave them at home. The purpose of this amendment
is to basically get at people who this is their second time they’ve been
carrying a firearm without a concealed carry permit, and it increases
the penalty. I think this is something that law enforcement run into in
urban areas with certain types of gang populations, etc. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Goolsby. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you so much for
bringing this forward, Senator Barefoot. My local and I can also concur
with that, my local police chief and mayor and city council have been
begging for this type of legislation. If the committee members will look
at the last sentence, a violation of this subsection A1 in this section
punishable, is not, basically what it’s doing is making sure that you
understand that this is not dealing with concealed carry holders who
don’t have their carry permit with them. It is people who are carrying
concealed weapons multiple times, who are just doing it as often as they
want to and the law is not punishing them very significantly and what it
ends up doing as you can see, is moves it to a class H felony, from an I
felony. So we would appreciate your support of that. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. ?? Jackson. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Senator Goolsby. I’m not an attorney as most everybody in this room

Miss Sikes has the punishment chart,  Senator, she can tell you. I don't
have it memorized, but it is greater punishment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I assume then I'm just curious as to how much greater.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? The presumption ranges.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. Senator Jackson was ?? it depends on your prior ??
level. But just for the largest difference between H and I is in an H
you can get an active sentence with any prior record. Whereas with an I
felony you have to have at least 10-13 points before you can get an
active sentence. And I felony  the absolute minimum you get with no
prior record would be three months and H Felony the absolute minimum you
can get with no prior record would be four months and not that much
difference there. When you get to the highest record levels then for an
I felony the maximum that you would be looking at would be 24 months vs.
a maximum of 39 months. So, a little bit higher month-wise but the
biggest distinction really in my opinion is you can get an active
sentence at any level for an H.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK. Thank you Miss Chairman, thanks Senator ?? thanks staff.  In front
of the discussion on the amendment Senator Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think we need incarceration note on this. If this does increase prison
time we will need a note on this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I may, Chair. The PCS as it was put before you does have it in form 1
incarceration amendment because it's not an official version of the
bill, it's not official yet. This section if it's added is very ??
provision that was in Senate 594 so I don't think it will take long for
them to update the incarceration memo to include this provision.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let's see if they can update it and we'll move forward with it now
anyway. Further discussion and debate on the amendment. All those in
favor of Senator ?? amendment say &quot;aye&quot;.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
aye
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
any opposed no. It so passes. Bill's back before ?? amended. Further
discussion and debate? Listening for a motion. Somebody. Senator Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll make a motion for approval as long as we can still work through the
provision that the sheriffs have concerns with.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Lord knows we want the sheriffs to be happy. They like to complain. OK.
Any further discussion or debate? I am hearing none. Senator Brown puts
forth an unfavorable ? to the original bill favorable to the proposed
committee substitute as amended. Senator, one moment, Senator Barefoot
will check on Shawn and we can do that on the floor. OK, I just want to
move it on out of here if you don't mind. OK. All those in favor say

adopted both amendments. Well, no, we adopted one in table one and
adopted two in table two. it's a busy day. Ok. Let's start House Bill
1181. PCS brought forth Senator Brown moves we bring to PCS to force for
discussion and consideration all those in favor say aye, aye, it is now
the force. Well, getting ready to, they're passing it out. OK, and I
like if we have questions from the gallery I'd like them to sign in with
a Sergeant in Arms so we can get a sheet started and our intent is to
start this bill today, discuss it as long as we can, we'll come back
tomorrow and talk about it a little more, and see if which direction
we're going to go. Senator Hise, floor is your's, and Senator Pate,

Jackson,?? Jackson, who they are.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity
to take a look at this bill and get better understanding of it. Glad to
see all the members of the public here as well. In the 2013 budget a
provision was put in there that talked about making Medicaid more
predictable to budget more predictable for Medicaid and to</p>

<p id="35:00">
And treat the whole person, and to make it more accountable to the
General Assembly. From that time, the department undertook a very, I
think a very good hit at taking Medicaid to a better position than we’ve
experienced over the past several years. As you know, since the
Republicans came in charge of the General Assembly, we have had four
straight years of budget overruns from Medicaid. And we have had to
appropriate about 2 billion dollars extra in order to stem the flow.
That is no fun, ladies and gentlemen, to do that, and we’re having to
cut things that should not be cut but we’ve cut to the bone now. So and
at any rate, the department worked very well and very diligently on
trying to come up with a better plan for Medicaid. And then the House
has worked since the commission report to develop a plan as well, and so
we have the Governor’s plan which the department came along with, and
also the House has developed their plan. And now the Senate has
developed a plan, which we think is more inclusive and will give better
results to the outcomes of Medicaid. And also better health care for the
citizens who rely on Medicaid. And that’s the purpose of this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I think probably best as we go forward, if
the Chairman will allow, I think most of this will come, there’s several
questions in, but I think it may be best if we could have Staff, Mr.
Chairman, Ryan Blackledge come up and go through the sections at a high
overview. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’d be fine. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair,
members of the committee, I’m Ryan Blackledge with legislative drafting.
Good morning. You should have before you a copy of the PCS and also a
copy of the summary. What I’m going to do is just give a brief overview
of the main components of the bill and then go through in a little bit
more detail, talking about some of the specifics up there. So the bill
itself has sort of three main areas that it’s trying to address. It’s
trying to address the goals for reform, then provide some general
direction for the reform. Oh ok. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah if you’ll hold
for just a minute, and let the feeding frenzy in. [LONG PAUSE] Seems to
have died down a bit. Ryan, go ahead. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir.
All right, so as I was saying, the bill deals with sort of three large
areas. It provides goals for the reform, it provides a little bit more
information on the general direction of reform, and then it gets into a
little bit of the governance and authority model that’s going to be
necessary. This particular bill does not go all the way to make all of
the statutory changes that will eventually be necessary. That will have
to come in a later, much longer bill. But this does set up a new
department. What this particular bill does in comparison to the third
edition of the bill which the House passed, is this says that the
capitated health plans would not just be provider led but would also be
non-provider led. The other big thing that this does different from the
House is that it creates a new department to handle Medicaid and also
the NCHealthChoice program. And that new department is to be the
Department of Medical Benefits. The bill itself, as I said, covers
goals, direction, governance and authority. Before I go through in
detail, just a general overview, the bill itself covers the intent in
the goals, it goes through those building blocks, provides a timeline,
gives details on what the detailed plan is going to have to look like,
it provides for reports. There’s a portion on maintaining funding
mechanisms. Also it talks about DHHS’ role in the reform, and then we</p>

<p id= "40:00">
  Get in to the specifics of the new department to be created as well as a new oversight committee here at the general assembly to be in charge of the new department. Alright so lets turn to page one and take a look at section one, these are the intents and the goals. These are very similar to what was passed by the house there are a couple of additional items on there. For example I’ll point out on line 12 number 3 it does say that one of the specific goals is whole person care. But the goals set the general overarching direction. The building blocks, section 2 provides a little more detail on what components of the reform are going to be. So you can see those there is everything from a new department to full risk capitated plans. Mr. Chair in the interest of time when we go through these I’m not going to hit every particular item in detail I’ll let the members read through. I can answer specific questions but I’ll just be hitting up a few highlights unless there is any objection.

[speaker change]
No, thank God, that’ll be fine.

[speak change]
I thought so. If you turn to page 3 I do want to point out there’s that time line there in section 3 that time line also appears on the first page of the summary. This timeline is a little bit more aggressive than what the house had. The house had full capitation by 2020 for the majority of those covered under medicaid. What this timeline does, if we’ll just sort of go through, August 1st of this year there would be the new department created as well as the new oversight committee. By September 1st there would be an identification of a central medicaid and NC health choice personal and also a transition team identified by the secretary of health and human services. We’ll talk a little bit more in detail about what that actually involves in a few moments. By the end of September the board appointment should be made, we’ll talk a little bit more about how this new department is going to be governed by a board rather than a secretary. By march 1st there’s to be an initial report on the details of the plan that’s going to be prepared by this new department. By January first of 2016, that’s the date to receive the final approvals from CMS. That’s six months in advance of the actual shift in plans occurring so there’s a little bit of wiggle room but also so that we know what the federal government is going to approve so in those last six months we can just work out the details and know what is actually is going to be approved. July 1st of 2016 is when the capitated plans would begin. Initially the non provider lead plans would be full risk capitation. The provider lead plans though would have 2 years to ramp up so there needs to be some sort of  mechanism designed whereby they initially come in and their participating within the system but they are given until July 1, 2018 to then be at full risk. Section four calls for a development of the detail plan and I won't go through everything in here but there are a lot of details as what needs to be in that plan. Things that the department needs to consider is then to come back to the general assembly for review. That plan is to come back by March 1st, if you turn to the top of page 4 you can see the report of that detail plan in section five. Section six calls for a semi annual report going all the way until 2020 just on regular updates on the reforms  process 2020 is two years after the full risk implantation in 2018. Section seven just deals with one of the issues we have there. A lot of medicaid funding comes from provider assessments, it’s not clear how those would necessarily fit into the new capitated model and so this is just a directive here that the new department of medical benefits, look at the options and try to see what can be done to maintain some  of that funding. Section eight covers the department of health and human services role within the reform process. The basic idea with the reform and the reorganization is that the issuance of medicaid  through these capitated rates is something that is so new and so different that we need to set up a new department to focus on ramping up to that  for a good year and a half, two years. But we need to have the existing system maintained. So section eight tries to deal with the maintenance of the existence system as well as insuring that the HHS works with the new department heading forward. So you can see that section 8A on page four

<p id="45:00">
It just says that the two departments should cooperate on reform, enter
into appropriate memorandums of understanding to make sure they're on
the same page.  Section 8B is something important.  It's the
identification of a stabilization team.  It's a directive to the
Department of Health and Human Services to identify the key leaders
within Medicaid, form this group, recognize this group of individuals,
and ensure that they are working on several items that you can see
listed in the subdivisions there.  Section 8C provides an incentive to
keep staff working in Medicaid.  Many of the staff positions within the
Division of Medical Assistance, although it's not provided for in this,
those positions would disappear, on the theory that what the new
department is going to be doing is going to be something that's very,
very different from what's being done now.  And so, there needs to be
some sort of incentive to keep those essential personnel within the
departments, so there's a 5% bonus payment that's provide for.  And
there's an additional bonus payment if they stay until the very end,
equal to the sum of all of the bonus payments that they received.  On
the identification of the essential positions, this is to be done by the
Secretary, and the language does make it clear that essential is not
just top leadership, but it's non-supervisory staff, it's state
personnel protected positions, it's the person who carries the piece of
paper from Point A to Point B, or puts things into envelopes, without
whom the system couldn't function.  If you'll turn to page 6, there's
just something dealing, Section 8E, just to be sure all of the contracts
going forward that are related to Medicaid that the Department of Health
and Human Services enters into, just to ensure those have a 30 days
cancellation clause, so when we start to look at what contracts are
necessary for the new entity, those can be cancelled as necessary.  And
finally, Section 8, and I apologize Mr. Chairman, I will have a
technical correction.  I have two Section 8Es, but the Section 8E that
appears on line 30 makes a change to when the Department of Health and
Human Services may submit state-planned amendments.  This just adds that
they may do it, at the request of the Department of Medical Benefits.
Section 9 sets forth a commitment by the General Assembly.  The first
sentence is identical to what appeared in the House, just that the
General Assembly recognizes and commits to the time and the funding for
this change.  It goes a little bit further with that second sentence to
that the General Assembly commits to allowing the board to do its work,
and also commits to a slightly different approach with some of the
funding and the forecast, in which we'll talk about in a little bit more
detail.  Section 10 creates the department itself.  As I said earlier,
there's going to be a lot of addition changes within statutes and
reorganization of some statutes later on down the line, but what this
does is, establishes the department itself, the framework.  It's created
and organized to be managed by a board.  This board is going to be
appointed by governor and the General Assembly.  Three appointments are
made by the governor, four are made by the General Assembly.  The
General Assembly, four, as you might imagine, two are on the
recommendation of the Senate pro tem, and two are on the recommendation
of the Speaker of the House.  If you look over on page 7, you can see
that there are provisions to ensure that those appointees have requisite
levels of expertise and experience to manage such an entity.  And you
can see those listed on page 7, line 6 through 21.  There's also a
concern that these individuals be fairly independent, and not be
beneficiaries from actual Medicaid payments, so they don't have an
incentive to just increase the rates as they would go.  And so you can
see, at the bottom of page 7, beginning on line 32, there's some
exceptions, some individuals who may not serve on the board.  And so,
there's some requirements there.  And Mr. Chair, I am getting close to
the end.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Good to know, thank you.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
 Yes, thank you, sir.  On page 8, you can see the powers and duties of
the board.  Several of these are fairly standard as to what you might
see for a state department.  Some are a little different and I'll talk
about those.  One that I do want to mention on page 8, beginning line
37, and going through 46, is a requirement that there be a detailed
5-year forecast presented by January 1 of each year to this General
Assembly, so that you all know--</p>

<p id="50:00">
in advance what the expected changes to the enrollment numbers, and also
the enrollment mix, would be.  So that’s the first portion. There’s also
on line 42, sub-sub division B, an outline of what program changes are
going to be made by the department in order to keep the program within
budget, the idea being, if the program is capped at this level, there’s
going to be some enrollment growth, the department is going to have to
plan for the changes that will be made in order to keep it within total
budget.  In addition, on line 45, then, they should also present that if
they want to keep the same level of services, how much additional money
would be necessary to fund the projected enrollment growth.  Over on
page 9, I do want to point out there are some variations from some other
state laws.  Generally, state laws that are applicable to any State
Department are going to apply, but these are the particular exceptions.
For example, on page 9, line 15, you’ll see that employees of the
department will not be subject to certain portions of the State
Personnel Act.  That’s initially, after July 1, 2016, the board may
designate certain persons as subject to the State Personnel Act, as long
as they fall under the definition of not exempt.  In other words, if
they’re having trouble recruiting clerical staff, for example, and they
wanted to say “you will be subject to the State Personnel Act”, that’s
something that the board could do, after July 1, 2016.  There are other
things in there, such as the Department may choose to retain legal
counsel other than the Attorney General.  There are some exceptions from
some State Contract Review by some other departments.  There are some
additional reasons to move into closed session. Lines 30 to 35, you can
see there discussions of rates, discussions of the forecast, are all
reasons that they could go into closed session.  Additionally, materials
prepared for those closed session discussions would not be subject to
public records requests until after the report had been submitted.  In
other words, there couldn’t be a public records request for the draft
versions of the forecast until the forecast is actually made public, at
which point, public records requests could be made on that.  If you turn
to page 10, I just want to point out there is an initial board
compensation that is set.  One of the powers and duties of the board
would be to set compensation for the board and also for the employees.
Initial board compensation is set at $8,000 per month.  The state share
of that would be $4000 per month, so it’s $280,000 for the first year.
That’s assuming 10 months.  Section 12, continuing down on page 10, sets
up a new Oversight Committee.  It has all of the regular things that you
would expect to see in a regular Legislative Oversight Committee. And,
with that, Mr. Chair, I shall conclude, and I’m available for any
questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir Hise and Sir Pate, would you all like
to wrap that up a little bit? [SPEAKER CHANGES] So since the advisory
commission last met, we have taken a look at what we felt like the
charge of the general assembly was in 2013, and from that we have this
bill that has been developed, and I commend the bill to you, and Senator
Hise and myself would be glad to answer any questions Mr. Chairman.
Senator Hise has a statement to make, I believe, before we get started
with questions.  We will take your questions, Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] OK, let’s do it this way, folks.  We’ll do questions from the
committee first, and then we’ll branch out to - I see we have a lot of
other members here - we’ll be happy to allow them to ask questions also.
 I want to fully vet this.  I want to say up front, I want to thank the
two gentlemen here for all the work and effort they put into this.  I
think that you should be complimented, and its a job well done, and
needed to be done.  OK, questions from the committee.  Senator Clark.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, under this new model, will the Medicaid
director serve at the pleasure of the governor or the pleasure of the
board? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Pleasure of the board.  Subject to the contract
issued with the board, but they serve at the pleasure of the board.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Blue, did I see your hand? Please.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  Thank you Mr. Chair, you did.  Under the prohibitions of
individuals who cannot serve on the board, I’m wondering what the
thought process is of excluding those who, say</p>

<p id="55:00">
The health care economist and folk like that who would be found
primarily in the Universities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Provided that those individuals that they would
represent a large business, so if they're an economist that comes form
the business aspect, they would be allowed. I firmly believe in looking
at it and similar models like in Oklahoma, individuals from the provider
communities and others that are invested seem to collapse their system
when they were part of the board as were moving forward. So that's why
we placed most of those exclusions there, but if someone had
particularly the actuarial experience or experience in a large business
with a corporate model there are slots that those individuals would be
eligible to fill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Now the point that I'm getting at is that whether it's
in state system or in private universities in the state, the people who
are more knowledgeable about this, trends and everything else, usually
are found in the universities, and I wonder why you want to preclude
their participation in helping set the direction. They're the ones that
write about it, who study it intensely, not just health care economists
but the academicians who probbaly understand this better than anybody.
Not just the - and I'll ask you another question about the corporate
participation because it seems that to some degree you're excluding
corporate participation also given the breadth of Medicaid spending and
the kinds of things it's related to. Whether it's pharmaceuticals or
various other things of that nature.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll take that to be a two part question Senator.
Senator Hise go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] First of all I think you'll see none that's exquiring
corporate and matter fact two of the positions on there are required to
be individuals with experience in large business and corporate boards.
That work in that we're specifically looking for those individuals and
in prioritizing of the seven lineated positions that we have we were
looking for individuals that contained the corporate experience in
working in the healthcare industries or in actuarial settings to try to
set this board up, and I think that's what we reflected in the board.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Did you answer both questions? I couldn't tell. Thank
you. Senator [??] any follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me ask you a what if question then. Why wouldn't
somebody from Glaxo be precluded from serving on this board?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's to my understanding that provided that Glaxo did
not receive their direct payments or they weren't a member of Glaxo's
direct board from Medicaid, they were not a provider to Medicaid, they
would not be excluded from serving on the board.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Next question then Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Why would a professor at Wake Forest in the RUNC in
the school of health be precluded from serving on the board?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Provided that individual has corporate experience and
experience in working in the corporate setting in a corporate board,
they would not be precluded.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But they would work for one of the - they would work
for somebody who has - they would be an employee of a provider who had
received compensation from Medicaid if you work for UNC or you work for
any of the private universities that have health systems.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] They would be precluded if they had received that
payment within a year. So if they had not received that payment within a
year they would be eligible.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One last follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You said that a moment ago. I'm gonna give you some
leeway Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm chasing him, I'm trying to catch him.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good luck with that!
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Routinely the health system whether it's UNC, East
Carolina, whatever their arrangement is with Novine, I mean the group
down there, Wake Forest, [??] Vidant or Wake Forest or Duke for that
matter will be continuously receiving payments from Medicaid because
they run health systems. what I'm asking you is, why would you preclude
any employee of those institutions from serving on the board because
that's where you'll find the people who are most knowledgeable about
what is happening in trends and payments, drug use and stuff. They may
not necessarily work for the East Carolina Medical School or Duke
Medical School, or Wake Forest or UNC, but they work for an employer who
is receiving money from one of those boards, I mean from Medicaid.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think you will.</p>

Look, in [??] the caucus we are looking for someone specifically with
healthcare system experience, we are just looking at the requirement
that they have severed themselves for at least a year to avoid the
conflicts of interest that could occur to their previous employer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. The idea of having the
provider led ACO's is one that's appealed to me and I worry that by
compressing the time schedule that it may be too quick for them to get
to fully capitated care, and I'd also like to understand what the
consequence to those ACO's would be by having the manage care entities
to compete. And I was wondering if Mr. Chair your plan was to allow the
providers to have an opportunity to comment, I didn't know if folks
signed up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank  you, we do have a sign up sheet and we're going
to carry this through til' tomorrow also for folks that have questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think you will find that our plan is a compressed
schedule to what has been previously proposed, however is not
inconsistent with what has happened in other states. At this point you
basically have a four year time window in which we expect the provider
led plans to be at fully capitated. We have multiple examples from
Florida, from provider led, hospital led, FQHC led programs that reach
the full capitation rate within a two year window. Some went to partial
capitation within 18 months, and we've got a two year for that, and then
full capitation within another year. So there any many examples and
particularly in Florida which you'll find our plan is most similar to.
Where provider led plans have been able to do it on even a much more
aggressive time table than we've put forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] further questions? Senator Clark?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair could we have an explanation or
amplification of what CCNC's role would be under this model?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There are two specific, and I say that delineated
roles that CCNC plays. The first is their networks are a consideration
in the boards development of regions. That is one of the areas that that
I'm [??] is not the exclusive area that the regions are based on that is
an area of consideration. The second explicit role in the bill has CCNC
developing the factors by which we measure quality within these plans,
that asks for CCNC. I say beyond that CCNC is a private organization
that will still continue to operate the HIE, that is nothing that we
have changed within this bill, but their ability to contract to others
and provide that information to help the providers is still open to
them, or if they made the choice to become a provider or those in any of
these regions those options would be open to them as well. They're not
prohibited from doing so.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My favorite, Floyd not you, Senator Robinson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair, just to follow up Senator Hise on
the CCNC's, based on the - and I'm trying to read quick, does this, the
board appointments preclude them from being or some representative from
being on the board? Because they do get provider payments, so is there
strict preclusion from CCNC's [??].
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The preclusion is in just that, they have received
direct payments form the Medicaid system for services, so any of those
individuals who are on that board or have received those payments for
one year would not be eligible to serve on that board.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any way since CCNC's also have boards and the
board member would not be a direct recipient of the payment, is there
any way to have a representative maybe on the board to be on this board?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think that was a consideration in excluding boards
that receive their funds, that would - to open it up would open it up to
all hospital boards, all doctor associations boards, those type of
things. We wanted to keep that arm length from the individuals who are
receiving payment in order for that to occur. So the way they would
serve is to not have received payment for a year prior to filling those
board positions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Mckissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] First I want to thank you for your work on this. I
know you guys have spent a lot of time so I do appreciate your efforts.</p>

<p id="65:00">
I do have a couple of questions. How do you envision this system working
with the provider-led as well as the non-provider-led, you know,
accountable care organizations, in terms of territory, in terms of how
they determine who is competing against each other, actually functioning
and operating, since the original model envisioned four accountable care
organizations split up by geographic areas. And to what extent has there
been communication with Health &amp; Human Services and their consultant
Bob Atlas and others related to what you have before us now for
consideration? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think what you’ll find right now is
that the regions are not yet drawn. That is a section we leave up to the
board, to develop regions. I would imagine you’d see the state in some
sort of range from three to ten regions that are set up. We’ve also left
up the notion that they declare rural and urban regions, that you have
priorities for urban regions if you have rural regions within those.
They also, the board also has the limit to limit the number of providers
who are, plans that would be available in a region. That is coming out,
so if they set a cap of three or four, an individual would have the
choice then of four plans for their region, that would cover them. And I
think the competition to get patients to your plan as well as to bid for
the process to come into a particular region, is what we believe will
hold the costs down, and increase quality within each region. We have
left it up. The regional model is not suddenly unique, and suddenly a
first-Senate idea. It was the direction that I think clearly the, they
began the process then and the Governor’s plan this year and was part of
their initial considerations. We think it had a lot of merit for a final
plan and that’s what we’re looking for. I think you can look clearly at
Florida and see how they’re working, interacting with each other. But we
also do give priority to provider-led plans, in requiring that every
region must first have a provider-led plan, that is coming in barring
some exceptions that they can’t get a plan to form within that region.
But if provider-led plan forms in a region it will have priority for
being a plan offered in that region. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Quick follow-up,
Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] In terms of input
from Health and Human Services, where do they stand in connection with
this particular proposal? And I’ve heard you reference Florida a number
of times. Is it the state that has in operation today a system that’s
most closely analogous to what you are proposing, and if so how long has
that been in operation? If you could address that, then I have one other
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] First with the department I think the
discussions with reform and others have been going on with the
department for probably two years now. As to the specifics, that’s been
a much more limited time window. I think when we look at what plans are
out there, we’ve had discussions with Bob Atlas about regional plans,
NCOs, ACOs, which is how they’re coming in the department. You know,
it’s a different concept when you’re talking with somebody about whether
a new department should be created without them, but we have evidence
that goes back in Florida to hospital-led plans being formed in I think
2006, that are coming in that are operating within Florida. So they have
some history with it. We’ve had some consultation with Florida about
what worked and what didn’t. And I think we’re using that. But yes
Florida would be the most similar. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And if you could,
Senator Hise. I’ll get with you later, I’d like to see what that data
looks like from Florida, and what insights can be provided to us. Now in
terms of compensation of board members, it looks like we’re up around
$96,000 a year. I mean, how did that number come to be the appropriate
benchmark for compensation and what are boards in other states
compensating their members? I mean, how much you know, I don’t know
because I’ve not looked at models like this. But I’m trying to determine
if that’s an appropriate level of compensation, how that benchmark was
established, obviously we’re asking these people to do a lot of work. I
assume they’ll be some kind of bilaws created related to the frequency
of meetings. I assume at that point in time we’re compensating them at
that level, it’s reasonably anticipated they’re going to give a
substantial amount of time to these efforts ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
McKissick, let’s tighten our questions up just a bit if we could.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ve got to get a much as possible. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]?? about five minutes ago. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I know we’ve got to
get in as much as possible because we may not be able to get more in.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise, are you good with that question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I will go with this. The model we looked for
established was corporate boards. We looked at boards like Blue Cross
and Blue Shield in the private sector, and what</p>

<p id="70:00">
Compensation set. The ultimate concept is we are setting the initial
compensation of the board, the board will set its own compensation as it
does in corporate models all over the U.S.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ask one [??] on compensation, that's simply this, are
we envisioning that this is when they're getting that level of
compensation, individuals that will not be actively employed, engaged in
other professions or is this really supplemental income for these people
who will be serving, and what time commitments are we anticipating?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Initially I think we're looking at something that
would be close to a large or full time time commitment. Most boards when
they set their own compensation set it commencery [SP] with the time
required to be on the board as it moves forward. So I think you'll see a
lot more requirements of the board when it's initially formed, and I
think you'll see those diminish over time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would now like to add onto that Mr. Chair. Senator
Mckissick we're going to try to see that these people get up to the
minimum wage.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] Did you have any questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, our minimum wage.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair if you will I have a few.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let's take a couple of them right now and go down that
road.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right, first of all, if we can go to page three
under section four, I notice that we have waivers. We have the SPA's and
we also have 11-15's which I believe are demonstration waivers. Any
reason why there will be no need for 19-15 waivers under this plan? Do
we know?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Because we've providing for whole person care and are
not looking to carve out specific populations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So that everybody will be included. Okay, I appreciate
that. Another follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] On item 14 have we given thought to what will happen
to NC Tracks and has their been any thought as to where IT will reside?
Will we have a new IT organization here or will they link back to Joe
Cooper's staff? Any thought yet?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have thoughts but I think they're probably different
than Senator Hise's. Go ahead senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] DMB will have IT and IT responsibilities and I suspect
that if those are the contracts they want to go with and move forward
that the programs will be transferred over to the new department.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I may continue?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] These are good clarifications and appreciated. Under
item six with the regions as we define them, have we given any thought
as to whether we would adopt CMS transportation standards as part of
that definition for those reasons, or whether that will impact anything
Ralph?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The transportation standards are not required for the
board to look at but they are open to be able to have other
considerations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, anything else from the committee at this point?
All right I want to go to the audience, Baggett you out there somewhere?
Chip? Cody you're backing him up, don't push him, he can wander your way
also. All right. Hear form Mr. Baggett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Baggett, Director of Legislative Relations for Medical
Society. Always a pleasure to be before your committee Senator Apodaca.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good to have you Mr. Baggett always.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. Everyone of your knows from the
conversations that we've had individually over the years our priority
that is set on Medicaid every single year for the physicians of the
state of North Carolina, and this year is no different. I have been
working diligently for the past three years to come up with a new value
driven system of delivering health care to Medicaid patients that moves
away from the fee for service system that we're currently in because we
recognize the challenges that lie ahead if we continue on the same path
doing the same thing that we've been doing in the past. So we have
invested millions of dollars, we have invested staff time, we've
invested research, we've done national grants in order to produce
materials to train physicians on how to move to value driven care. All
in a major effort to avoid going to out of state manage care entities,
and as you know we've had two priorities and that is one major priority
for us is opposing out of state manage care entities coming in and
taking money that could be used within the state to apply to other
priorities and instead send it out to profits for other companies. At
this point in time we believe this bill incorporates many of the manage
care principals that we oppose, and so without detailing all those
different hings I will point out two specific things. The first is, it's
manage care layout where we go into competition where there is going to
be some money to provider led organizations and some going to
non-provider led organizations or insurance companies or HMO's, however
you want to use the terminology. That sets up the state to sending money
to somebody other than North Carolina citizens, that is not going to be
reinvested in the state, that is not going to be used to solve your
budget problems, that is not going to be used.</p>

to pay taxes in North Carolina or buy gas, or buy groceries, or pay home
mortgage loans in North Carolina.
The second piece that we oppose specifically around managed care is the
idea that on the new entity that you've set up, you have a great wealth
of insurance and managed care experience there while specifically
excluding any physician experience. And I think we've shown great
leadership experience over the years in bringing forward good ideas and
bringing forward solutions and bringing forward plausible, realistic
ideas on how to move forward, to move to the ?? system. And yet we are
specifically drawn out here while the non provider-led entities that are
allowed to compete with us on the local level are allowed to be on the
board. So those are 2 specific things. We haven't had a lot of time to
go through all the specific complaints, er, go through all the specific
provisions on this bill. Sorry, Freudian slip.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We're going to let you go over tonight and find some more things you
don't like.  ?? Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I bet you are, yes sir.
But we have been given the opportunity to work with staff after this
evening is over today and we look forward to continuing to work with you
to try to solve this very important problem. So thank you for letting us
have the opportunity to talk to you about it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There are some things in it you do like, let's be honest.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, good.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't want you to be totally negative. Cody, step up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Sen. Apodaca and committee, my name is Cody Hand from the
Hospital Association. Again I wanted to thank you all for working with
us on this bill, and this has been a process that we have each, Chip and
I and all of our provider groups, dragged out members along kicking and
screaming. We need budget predictability just as much as you all do. We
applaud you for looking at ways to do that.
Sen. Apodaca, there are many  provisions in this bill that we do like.
We think, all due respect to the state and the department, we think your
providers can do a much better job managing your medicaid population and
dollars than the state can, and frankly more than managed care companies
can. One of the reasons that I think we can do that is we have quality
metrics that we have to meet. We've set them for ourselves and the
government has set them for us, and we have doctors that are working to
meet those  quality metrics. We have skin in this game more than anybody
else. The thing that I don't like is that if you allow companies to come
in that really don't have a vested interest in the patient out come,
they're living and profiting off of the quality metrics that we are
having to meet. So I would encourage you before you turn this over to
ACOs and MCOs, that you give the ACOs a chance to prove that we can do
it before you do anything else. There are many provisions in this bill
that we do like, as I said, and I do appreciate you allowing us to work
and continue to work on this bill. Now I would encourage you, as much as
we've heard from you about this, you're going to hear from our members
over the next 24 hours about their thought on this. So I would encourage
you to take their phone calls and consider what they say as we all work
to provide better care for not only our medicaid population, but
everybody else who's not on medicaid that we also provide care to. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Feel free to have him call Louis and Ralph. Cody thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They've got your number too.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Adam are you out there somewhere? Come on up.
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Adam Scholler, legislative liaison for DHHS. We
appreciate the Senate's recognition that medicaid reform is important
and the desire to keep the momentum going on this issue but we do have
some concerns with this version of the bill that I just wanted to point
out. First on the reform plan, this is kind of a different approach or
there's some new things that were added on here that a bit different
that what we've spent the last 16 months working with stakeholders
around the state and the department to come up with. We're concerned
about, particularly on the mental health side, a potential destabilizing
effect that some of these changes could have. And we're also concerned
frankly about the timeline, it's very aggressive and we're concerned
that it's potentially not achievable. Not sure that CMS would approve
some of these things within this timeline.
On the reorganization piece, this is a more recent development and we do
have concerns about splitting out medicaid from HHS, we appreciate some
of the institutional barriers that the Senate has recognized and
attempted to address in this bill, such as flexibility around hiring and
that kind of thing, we do appreciate hearing us on these issues and that
recognition, but this is an issue that we thing is very important and we
would ask that it be studies rather than voting now, but we do
appreciate the work you do working with us and we we look forward to
working with you going forward. So thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Adam, thank you. Hold on a second, I think</p>

Hartsell has a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Just very quickly you
mentioned  you thought it would destabilize the mental health.  Can you
identify a little more about what you mean by that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hartsell, it's my understanding around the
change in this bill, the ???CO's would change the nature of the way that
they presently operate taking more of the whole person, the physical and
behavioral healthcare care either becoming provider organizations or
health plans for physical and behavioral healthcare and the path that
the State has been on with these ???CO's for behavioral healthcare this
would be a bit of a change for that while that system is still maturing.
 It's a path that hasn't had a chance to finish yet.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up or are you good?  Adam, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I think we're going to wrap it up today. Louis,
Ralph, you have any final comments you want to make before we adjourn?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think it's just been an evolution from three ???
managed care to an open door and I think we've come at a good position
moving forward to use this computation to control costs in this state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES ]Louis, anything?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for the indulgence of the Committee, Mr.
Chairman, and for the other people who are here to hear about this.  I
think that we are working very diligently to see that Medicaid becomes
predictable to the State of North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Senator. I'm glad to see our friends from the
House with us today.  I know they'll want to concur when it goes over to
them so they've gotten a lot of information on it.  We are adjourned.</p>
