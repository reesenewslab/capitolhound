  The House will come to order. Members will take their seats. Visitors
will retire from the chamber. The sergeant in arms will close the doors.
Members and guests in the gallery are asked to please silence all
electronic devices. Today&#39;s prayer will be offered by Representative
Riddell. Members and the visitors in the gallery are asked to stand and
remain standing for the pledge of allegiance. Representative Riddell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker. I&#39;d like to read a verse from the old
testament, the book of Micah, chapter six, verse eight. He has shown the
old man what is good and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do
justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God. Please join me
in prayer. Father we thank you for this day and for the privilege to be
in this body on this day. You have indeed shown us what you require of
each of us. Help us to do justly according to your definition of
justice. Help us to love mercy according to your perfect definition of
mercy, and help us to remember that you, alone, are God, and we are your
servants sent here to do the people&#39;s business who have sent us, and
to do what is right and pure and acceptable in thy sight. May all that
we say and do in this day will be pleasing to thee. We pray in
Christ&#39;s name, amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Amen. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,
and to the republic for which is stands, one nation, under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Harnett, Representative Lewis is recognized for a
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister speaker, the journal for March 18 has been examined and found to
be correct. I move that it stand approved as written.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lewis moves that the journal for March 18 be approved as
written. Those in favor will say aye. Those opposed no. The ayes have
it, and the journal is approved. Members, if you would join me, and I
know the hour is drawing late, but if you would, please join me in
thanking our pages who are with us today. They&#39;re gonna be leaving
at three o&#39;clock. We want to thank you all for being here this week.
We hope you had a great time. Board of Governors election, first item of
business. Members, pelase take your seat as we proceed with the
University of North Carolina Board of Governors election. Pursuant to
House resolution 37, the rules for voting are as follows. Number one, no
nomination may be received from the floor. Two, in order to be elected a
nominee must receive the votes of a majority of all members in present
of voting. Three, each member present voting shall vote for as many
nominees as there are positions to be filled, and any ballot not so
marked shall be deemed void. What that means is you have to vote for
eight, no more, no less. Four, if fewer than eight nominees receive the
votes of the majority of all members present in voting, a run off to
fill the open position or positions shall be conducted amongst the
nominees who are not elected, but who received the highest number of
votes cast and the number of nominees eligible to be voted on in the
runoff shall be twice the number of positions to be filled. Five, if
there is a tie for the last position between two nominees who are
eligible for the next runoff, both nominees will be included in the next
runoff balloting even though they would be more than two nominees per
available position. Six, if more than eight nominees receive the votes
of a majority of all members present in voting, then the eight nominees
receiving the highest numbers of votes shall be deemed to have been
chosen. I believe the gentleman from Cumberland, Representative Glazier,
the gentleman from Durham, Representative Luebke, the two members wish
to be excused from voting today. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir, under rule 241A.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further excuses from voting? For what purpose does the lady from
Mecklenburg, Representative Carney rise? Did the lady accidentally press
her light? Okay. The sergeant in arms will distribute the ballots to the
members. Members we ask that you please take your seats so that the
sergeant in arms can place a ballot with you.

  Members, while the Sergeant-at-Arms is distributing the ballot,
don&#39;t get up for this purpose, but please join me in welcoming our
nurse of the day, Stephanie Leach from Raleigh, who is in the back of
the chamber. Thank you, Miss Leach, for being here. Members, if you will
notice on the ballot, you please print and sign your name. You&#39;ll
notice on the, to the, I believe to the bottom right--the Speaker--I
don&#39;t yet have a ballot myself, but maybe I&#39;ll get one in a
minute. On the bottom, sort of on the bottom you&#39;ll see &quot;print
and sign.&quot; Please do that. Have all members completed their voting?
This looks remarkably like the SAT.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Mr. Speaker?
SPEAKER CHANGES
For what purpose does the gentleman from Rowan, Representative Warren,
rise?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Would you like us to turn our light off when we&#39;ve completed voting?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Denise says please don&#39;t, it may crash the system, so… For what
purpose does the gentleman from Gaston, Representative Torbett, rise?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Do you have another Number 2 pencil?
SPEAKER CHANGES
We just sold the last one from the dispenser outside. Thanks for asking.
You can use whatever you want to, yes, that&#39;s fine. Except for
Representative Hamilton. For what purpose does the gentleman from
Scotland, Representative Pierce, rise?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Mr. Speaker, but can we at least hit our buttons so--the number of
people that voted today? Can we do that? The number in the chamber, see
how many people were here to vote?
SPEAKER CHANGES
The clerk reports that we have seven excused absences, and two members
who have request excuse. I don&#39;t know if anyone was off the floor.
Is there anyone who did not receive a ballot who was off the floor when
the process started? Looks like it should be okay. Yes sir.

  [NO AUDIO 25 SEC] Are members finished voting? Is anyone still voting?
Help him, Mike. Again, just to make sure everybody knows the rules. You
must vote for eight. No more than eight, no less than eight. And you
must sign print and your name on the ballot. Please be sure you have
printed and signed your name to the ballot. It does not have to be in
cursive, except for Representative McElrath. Hers has to be in cursive.
I mean Hurley. That was [LAUGHTER] Randolph, not ?? correct. Just turn
it into open mic night up here. Is anyone else still voting?
Representative Harris. [PAUSE] Members, while we&#39;re wrapping up the
voting, just to let you know the procedure today. I&#39;ll be naming the
Teller Committee. You all will be glad to know I am not a member of the
Teller Committee. I will be here, thank you. And I&#39;ll announce the
Teller Committee in a few minutes but what will happen while the folks
are off counting, the only business that we will do will be the
introduction of bills, the messages from the Senate and the committee
reports. We will not take any votes until the folks return from the
counting. But there are a number of bills and so forth to read in.
Representative Harrison, are you done? Anyone else still voting? All
right, the Sergeant at Arms is directed to collect the ballots. [PAUSE]
Pages are free to go. We thank you for your service this week again.
Have a great weekend. [APPLAUSE] [PAUSE] Members, the Teller Committee
is as follows: Representatives Brian Brown, Dollar, Hastings, Speciale,
Jordan, Carney, Hamilton, Hanes and Insko are appointed to canvas the
ballots. Those members are asked to please retire to the members&#39;
conference room, just off this side of the House chamber. Did everyone
get their ballot collected? All right. Members, we have a recognition to
do. We actually have a school group with us today. Coddington Elementary
School from Wilmington North Carolina. If you all would please stand so
we could welcome you. Glad to have you here today. [APPLAUSE] To the
school, your members are Representative Catlin who is standing here if
Representative Catlin wants to wave up, Representative Hamilton who I
think may have just had to step off the floor and Representative Davis.
Again, we&#39;re glad to have you all here with us today.

  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, I&#39;m advised by the clerk that there are
no messages from the Senate. This would be an opportune time, if any
member intends to rise to a point of personal privilege. For what
purpose does the gentleman from Wake, Representative Stam, arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  A parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In other words, if we do our personal privileges now,
we won&#39;t have to stay so late this afternoon before we want to go
home. Is that what you&#39;re saying?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman&#39;s observations are both astute and
correct. For what purpose does the gentleman from Mecklenburg,
Representative Jeter arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Point of personal privilege, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The House will come to order. The gentleman may speak
up to three minutes to a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for the time limit. We hear a lot in this
room, in this building, in the newspaper about how we don&#39;t get
along, how we don&#39;t like each other. Yesterday I was sitting in the
other building and I was having a problem with my thumb, which as you
can see now is all wrapped in blue and everything. And I had a member of
this building come in, comfort me, treat me like their brother, made me
reassured in what I was doing, which was a service situation I was
getting nervous about. And I think too often we forget how much
admiration there is between us regardless of party affiliation,
regardless how long we&#39;ve been in this building and I would just
like the members to know how much I appreciate Representative
Adcock&#39;s incredible kindness to me and made me feel better in a very
difficult personal situation. I just want to thank you in front of this
body because too often we forget how much we do have in common and how
much we are trying to develop personal relationships, so I&#39;d like to
thank you in front of this body.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, if I may have your attention please. At the
request of the bill&#39;s sponsor, without objection, on page three of
your calendar, House Bill 82, short title Execution Non-Secure Custody
Order Child Abuse, and House Bill 211, Expand Use of Toxicology Funds,
will be removed from today&#39;s calendar and re-calendared for Tuesday
next week. Is there objection? Seeing none, so ordered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, the Chair is aware of no other members
seeking recognition at this moment, so the House will stand at ease as
we await- The House will come back to order. The gentleman from Wake,
Representative Dollar is recognized to announce the results of the UNC
Board of Governors election. The gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, members. The results are as
follows, and I&#39;m going to try to read these from the, from the
highest to the lowest, and I&#39;ll try to be clear when we&#39;ve got
to the eight. Pearl Burris-Floyd 99, Mary Ann Maxwell 96, David Powers
93, Alex Mitchell 93, Philip Byers 82, Jim Holmes 79, J.T. Knott 63. And
I believe those are your top eight vote-getters that will be elected.
Seven? Okay, who have I missed here? Walter Davenport 64. Those are your
top eight vote-getters.

SPEAKER CHANGES
Pursuant to Article 6, Section 5 of the North Carolina constitution,
that persons named have received a majority vote of the members present
and voting, be elected to the UNC Board of Governors. And let me read
the eight  names again, Mr. Speaker. The eight names again would be
Pearl Burris-Floyd, Mary Ann Maxwell, David Powers, Phillip Byers,
Walter Davenport, Alex Mitchell, Joe Knott. I believe that&#39;s eight.

I believe the gentleman may have left off Mr. Holmes&#39;s name in

Jim Holmes. James Holmes.
SPEAKER CHANGES
The Chair is going to repeat the names, not in a particular order, but
just in the names that are on the sheet in front of the Chair. The
gentleman from Wake, Representative Dollar, has moved that the following
individuals be elected to the UNC Board of Governors, which will be an
electronic vote. Again, the Chair will read the names again. Byers,
Davenport, Holmes, Knott, Maxwell, Mitchell, Powers, and Burris-Floyd.
Representative Dollar moves, pursuant to Article 6, Section 5 of the
North Carolina constitution, that the persons just named, having
received the majority vote of the members present and voting, be elected
to the UNC Board of Governors. All in favor will say aye, all opposed
no. The ayes have it and the voice vote passes. The election will now be
confirmed by an electronic vote. The question before the House is the
adoption of the motion that the UNC Board of Governors be elected. So
any in favor of the confirmation of the persons named heretofore will
vote aye, those opposed will vote no, the clerk will open the vote. The
clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. One hundred and six
having voted in the affirmative and none in the negative, the motion is
adopted. This election is confirmed and the Senate will be so notified.
