Come to order. The committee will come to order. The members will take
their seats. We'll get going this morning and get you out of here. First
we wanna recognize our pages if they're here. Robert Jenkins from
Mecklemburg county sponsored by speaker Tillis. Curtis Johnson from
Cureone County sponsored by representative Steignburg. Oath McCeathan
from Boford county sponsored by representative Tine. And Sarah Newbie
from Wade County sponsored by representative  Hurley. There you are. Ok
Very good. Of course our sgt at arms today, Yon Bay. Bob Rossy, Joe
Crooke, Marvin Lee, Antoine Marshall and Martha Gadisen. First we only
have three bills on the agenda I think these will be, move along
relatively expeditiously. And our first bill is house bill 980. It is a
PCS. And representative Brown moves that the PSC be in front of us for
discussion purposes without objection and chairman Burr is recognized to
explain the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you chairman Dollar. This bill
seeks to address the current fiscal year that we're in. The Medicaid gap
that we have as German Dollar said last night, there seems to be an
annual occurrence that we're working to address. This has been something
that has been a long term problem. And a large sum of the funds needed
to fill the gap today that we have is due to a structural problem with
forecasting that governor McCoy's administration discovered from former
Governor Purdue's administration when it comes to putting together the
numbers that the general assembly uses for Medicaid. And this bill will
tap into the extra collections that are fortunately available today as
well as unspent funds that we need to close this bill. This is just
another example of why we need to work with governor Mccoy to try to
reform Medicaid in this state and make sure that we get the spending
under control. I'd be happy to take any questions Mr Chairman or perhaps
you want staff to address the details of exactly where the funds are
coming from.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] We'll see if.. Representative Speciale
you had a question?[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just wanted to make a statement
Mr chairman I don't have a problem with the bill but if this is a
problem representative Burr, it has existed because of certain things.
Not because of any person or anybody at all. We have always suffered and
I tried to tell yall last year you were gonna run a 400 million dollar
deficit on Medicaid. I've been in the same situation and I had to cover
it the same way. It just happens every year and thats because of the
forecast and whats happens during the year to create this. So you cant
blame it on, its happening and somewhere down the line its gonna happen
again. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further comments or questions? If not,
representative Blackwell. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I dont wanna drag this out.
But I wanna follow up on representative Michaux inquire well actually
his comment. Representative Burr, can you tell us, do we have any
indication as to whether other states have this same problem and that
nobody can figure this out. And that every year its nobody's fault and
that its just one of those things that happens? Or have we not looked at
other states to determine if this is something somebody's doing well?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well obviously growth with Medicaid is a problem
around the country. As when it comes to the gaps that tend to happen at
the end of the fiscal year, I cant speak to that. But I know we've
worked over the last three years to close that gap. There's a slight set
back as I said, due to what governor McCoys administration discovered.
Which was a forecasting error that had been used in previous years may
have potentially caused some of those gaps in the past. So hopefully
with what they have discovered this will address the issue and we can
continue to work to close the gap. It obviously is difficult because
this is an entitlement program and you're limited and some respects to
that. But if we can do a better job at forecasting and those things then
hopefully...</p>

[SPEAKER] It will not be as a major of a problem in the future.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. Maybe you said before and I missed it. Of
the money that we are appropriating here, do we have an idea
approximately what portion of that is related to this forecasting error
that we've discovered?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I think staff should have that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Susan Jacobs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   Susan, do you have the piece of it that is the,
what’s the forecasting issue?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of Appropriations Repres . . . Mr. Chairman. I
think roughly it was a little over a hundred million dollars that was
associated with the forecasting error and about a hundred and twenty
million I think is the most recent document I saw from State budget was
associated with a short fall for claims.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And I might add it was around $118 million of it
that’s actually what’s called the thirteenth payment for Federal Drug
rebates and what Representative Michaux you will probably remember this.
You all took the twelfth Federal drug repayment and you tied it over to
the next year. And I see you shaking your head, yes. So, this bill
finally fixes that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You hope.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [laugh] Trying to fix it, people’s messes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It wasn't a mess.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right. Representative West is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to make a motion, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I move that we give the proposed Committee Substitute
for House Bill 980 a favorable report, unfavorable to the original bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You've heard the motion for the discussion, further
debate. If not, all those in favor say aye. [aye]All opposed say no. The
ayes have it.  The bill is agreed to.  Our next bill is House Bill 767,
Brass to Class Act. And Representative Murry is recognized to explain
the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s a PCS and Representative Avila moves that the PCS
be properly before the Committee without objection.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’m proud to present this
legislation to you to help encourage retired military personnel and
honorably discharged military personnel to encourage them to become
teachers and principles in our school system.
I’m joined with Representatives Whitmire, Szoka and Pierce on this
legislation. We have worked with this legislation with the North
Carolina Association of Educators and the Troops to Teach Division in
the Department of Public Instructions to develop a program which directs
the State Board of Education to establish rules for awarding credit for
prior work experience given to certain veterans for the purpose of
placing them on State salary schedules.
Patsy Pierce on staff has helped us strongly with this legislation and
we’re just trying to encourage lateral entry for our military personnel
to become teachers and giving them experience credit. If they have
teaching experience in the military, we’re going to give them credit for
that and develop rules to help further and keep North Carolina the most
military friendly state in the country and encourage our military
personnel to come back and serve in our education system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Floyd.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, this is a good bill since the 87th Air
Borne Division is the Center of the Universe. At the appropriate time,
I’d like to move for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right. We’ll hold that motion for just a moment. I
think we have a couple of other hands.  Representative Bell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to ask a
question. How does this differ from the lateral entry program that we
have right now? You know, I know you can place people on a certain pay
level based on their experiences. I mean, we've been doing that for
several years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly, the current lateral entry program is
bachelor’s degree experience forward.  And this addresses situations
where we have military personnel who have training and experience prior
to earning their bachelor’s degree. And we’re trying to give them . . .
[SPEAKER CHANGES] . . . or some specific rules for military personnel</p>

[Speaker changes.]...is gonna work on this very well.  I mean, the
sentiment, the exchange between their key people is tremendous to be
able to make it very...to get your mind around &quot;you don't know what
you don't know&quot; and someone who has had multiple formal training
items that are very relevant. You gotta know where to look in order to
give the credit for that and I'm not sayin' this very short and I'll be
quiet with that but this definitely helps expedite giving credit where
credits due for credentialing to expedite someone making a lateral entry
to go into teaching and that's a very big piece of this bill.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Floyd is recognized for his motion.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Chair, if I could just make a comment prior to
makin' a motion.
[Speaker changes.] Yes, sir.
[Speaker changes.] I sit here to my right here and I see my colleague
here is clicking on this machine here, whatever she call it but
Representative Cleveland can bear witness to when we was in the
military, this was already in place. What has happened now is that it
has been enhanced and that's what that military community brings...that
skill set.  And so, Mister Chair, I move for a favorable report for the
PCS and unfavorable to the original House Bill 767.
[Speaker changes.] Members of the committee have heard the motion.
Further discussion, further debate. If not, the question before the
committee is approval of the proposed Committee Substitute for House
Bill 767. All in favor say &quot;aye&quot;. (Ayes.) All opposed say no.
The ayes have it and the bill is agreed to.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chairman, thank you, members of the
committee.
[Speaker changes.] The last item we have is House Bill 560, economical
school bus replacement criteria. Before Representative Arp starts, I
want to make sure that we explain why this...why we're not gonna take a
vote on this per se.  This bill won't come to the floor by we wanted to
air this bill as a potential addition to the House's budget.  And so,
what we're doing is...come on up, Representative Arp. What the House is
doing, what we're doing is getting the sense of the committee on this
and we have the PCS in front of you. Last time, our apologies, we were
discussing the bill and the PCS was not actually before the committee,
which will adopt.
[Speaker changes.] Representative McElraft?
[Speaker changes.] To make a quick announcement. I know some of you are
in environment and environment will meet at 9:30 and the room has been
changed to 544 again. Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] So, if you need to go to environment in a coupla
minutes, feel free to do that. We do need a motion, we'll take it from
Representative McElraft. Proposed Committee Substitute for 560 B in
front of the committee for discussion purposes without objection. So
ordered. Representative Arp.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Ladies and Gentlemen, I appreciate the
opportunity to come back before you with the PCS before you now so I'd
also like to say that this has been a long evolution.  When I was on the
School Board as Chairman, back last year, even began working on
this...it didn't get into last year's bill.  This year, we worked on it,
I'd like to commend my fellow co-sponsors, Mr. Szoka...Representative
Szoka, Representative Floyd and Representative Lucas. So you can see
that this is a bi-partisan effort and I believe it's a very common sense
effort to just simply change the way that we procure school buses and we
can save substantial amounts of money.  As you...what I...just a
recap...what this bill proposes to do...right now there's  not any
statutory guidelines. DPI has some guidelines and it's currently 20
years or 200,000 miles. What this bill does is put in statutory language
to gain a little bit more use out of these buses.  I don't know of a
single family that hasn't driven their car a little bit longer in this
time of recession in order to save some money....maybe defer a little
bit of things in order to save some money.  This bill basically does
that but it does it, in my opinion, in a very responsible way.  What it
does is it says a bus is eligible for placement when it's....</p>

<p id="20:00">
Sold by model year or has reach 50,000 miles. Except that a bus less
150,000 miles must remain in the service beyond 20 years until it
reaches a 150,000 miles. So we want at least 150,000 miles on the buses.
And a buss 15 years of age is eligible for replacement only until it
reaches 300,000 miles. What we do in this, is also stress safety, we try
to balance that trough mayor approach because some LEAs drive  buses
much longer and there fore the buses were out a lot sooner. Other LEAs
drive the buses on longer trips. But he age would phase them out they
would be 20 years and older and they would not have that many mileage on
it. The other unique thing about this, is to encourage the LEAs to run
the buses longer. We provide an incentive bonus and that is 2,000 per
bus, per year that they extend the life of the bus, by maintenance and
use and good practices. We reward that where you get a 2,000 dollar per
bus, per year incentive going back to the LEAs. They don't have to use
it for school bus maintenance they can use it for anything that they
want to, in order to provide that incentive. The third aspect is that it
provides a grand fathering. Because the LEAs had been anticipating this
20 year model. They had been using they buses to that term. I think it
would be unfair to suddenly put this on there. So what we done in this
bill, is provide a two year grand fathering to allow the LEAs to
transition into this program and allow them to change the way they
operate the buses. Still be held harmless for what they were
anticipating. The way that they been doing it. So it provides a glide
path in to this program. And then finally, probably one of the most
things I'm most exited about, is the savings for safety. Out of this
saving and the saving are truly significant. We are gonna create a grant
program, that allows the LEAs to apply for this grant program to put
stop cameras, stop arm violation cameras on the buses. We had tragically
five children killed, this year, by people passing stop school buses.
Representative Lambeth  and representative Hanes, I don't see him here,
but ran a great bill to address that is tragic, and its needless
actually but. This grant program allows LEAs to put cameras on the bus
to assist in the prosecution of this cases. It does not mandate it. Its
a grand program, because it quiet frankly, it takes the volunteer effort
of the DEA working with the school to persecute this cases and there has
to be and effort there, this cameras provide additional  tools. But
there is much work that needs to be done, and this creates a grant
program. Here is the savings trough this program. The projected saving
incorporating all of that is a 172.5 to 185.1 million dollars over five
years. And this budget cycle is projected to save 67.5 to 70.8 million
dollars in savings. That's in this budget cycle. It would be more but we
got that grandfathering coming in. fiscal years 2015 to 17 we actually
pick up a lot more. And so the saving would even go up, if the
incentives kick in, that's not even including the incentives. So that I
think is a substantial savings. I did talk with several people after we
did this. Mrs. Joice we had a great conversation, she said that, she
talked with the transportation director, who serves at legislation. He
thinks that the current proposal is fair and reasonable. He especially
likes the 30 buss safety margin. This bill what it does, is provide 30
buses allocated for each year in case there is something bad happens.
The state has available, the ability, with this 30 buses to handle those
anomalies that occur the lemons the unsuspected crash or bus or
something like that</p>

improvise and with flexibility. So this is a well reasoned, of course
I'm biased in that, but approach to a very economical way to save
taxpayer money and maintain safety and security for our schools.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Thank you Representative Arp. I think there are a few committee
questions. Representative Horn.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Representative Arp, please two questions. One is
why do we need a law? Why can't we do this by directive? Why can't it be
done the way it's been done, just change the directive?
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Well, that's the way we speak is through laws, right?
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
I understand, but...
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Follow up?
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
I understand. Yes, that's the way we speak. All I'm asking is if DPI
thinks this is a great idea, they could implement this without another
law on the books. Yes or no?
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
I guess they could, yeah. I don't know.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
There seems to be some disagreement.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
If you will just hold that thought Representative.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
I have a second question.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
If you'll just hang on to that for just a minute, because we have staff
and I'd like them to respond to the question.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Brian Maddison with Fiscal Research.  The
current standards for school bus replacement are set out by the state
board of education in the absence of a law to codify such standards.
However, their allotment of school buses across the state is contingent
on the appropriations you make. So if you were to alter the
appropriations any way, you probably would want, if you were to be
considering this bill, some mechanism to articulate to the state board
some of your thinking and you how might be modifying it from the
existing guidelines they've set out.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
That's a better answer.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Yes sir. Follow up. I have a second question.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
So
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Second question. On page two, C3 at the top, line six. You talk of,
there's where the two thousand dollar incentive payment is.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Yes
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Now is that for all the buses they have in their fleet? Brand new ones?
They start getting two thousand. How does that, where's that start?
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
What it does is every year that they go past the thresholds I mentioned
earlier, that they track past the threshold, the minimum thresholds that
we talked about, they are eligible for that incentive bonus. They're not
required to do that. They can turn it in. And as you well know, the
counties buy the original buses, and then as they wear out, the state
replaces those.  So as the LEAs go past the minimum threshold, this
incentive bonus kicks in for those eligible buses.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
The only follow up is, is that actually what it said in that sentence
there? In that C3 paragraph? I understand that that's what you mean. I'm
just not convinced that when I read that, that that's what it actually
says.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
There can be an offline conversation with staff to clarify that.
Representative Avila.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I'm not finding it. You keep referring to the
grandfather clause. How exactly does that work?
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Under section two. Again, I'm not a lawyer. I'm an engineer. But I think
that's how they wrote that grandfather clause. Under section two. Is
that right, Mr. Maddison?
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Staff is shaking their head in the affirmative. Representative McNeill.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Yes sir. Thank you. I have a question and a comment also. I'll kind of
roll it all into one. I like your bill Representative Arp. I think it
does a good job. You're well on the way. Something that you mentioned to
me brought up a question. As far as school bus crashes, do you know if
we insure our school buses, or are we self-insured, or how that goes?
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
I'm going to try. I think each of the LEAs have their own policy. I
think in terms of court they go something back to the state thing. We've
got Mr. Graham from DPI.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Mr. Graham, if you would identify yourself for the record.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Yes. Derrick Graham, Section Chief for Transportation with The
Department of Public Instruction. The tort claims covers the negligence
of the driver and the mechanic if we do damage to another vehicle or
person while operating our vehicle. As far as insurance on our buses
themselves we're self insured. If we damage our own bus, for lack of a
better term, we just</p>

appropriations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up representative McNeill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I understand we have liability on it. This is just a comment while  you
were studding it. I would like to know. How mush this. And this is in
the old part of the language. I know you haven't look into it yet. How
much is costing us with this two percent bio diesel that's written into
this bill. I know bio diesel is hard to get and some times. Is a lot
more expensive than regular diesel. I just personalty like for you to
consider that. How much extra that is costing the state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
That's not in my bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Brandon
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you Mr. chair. I don't know how I feel about the bill. So I asked
Tomas build buses who is in my district. What they thing about the bill.
I just wanted you to know, I hope that you reach out to them cos they
are one of our largest employers. They only just build buses, but a lot
of people around the area depend on those jobs. But one of his concerns,
and I just wanna communicate to you, is that he said that, Toma build
spoke with personal, that they are very concern with the removal of age
limitations. They have research this, that do to low mileage some buses
would take 37 years to reach 300,000 miles. The resort ?? that ?? only
?? fleet, which is the oldest in the nation. Removal of the  age limit
would be detrimental to the state in terms of new technology. And would
likely result in increase maintenance for the district, as they would
operate vehicles longer. The older the bus the more they spend on the
maintenance. We feel that the current requirements work well for the
state but we are will to work with the representative. I just wanted to
let you know, that is what they said, in the hope that you reach out to
them. Cos they are one of our largest employers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Brandon what we did is exactly what you are talking
about. Haven't spoken to them directly. but to address that very
situation, that's why we did the tier situation. And so we still have an
age limit of 20 years. Its call a by-level matrix in here. That you got
an age requirement as well a mileage requirement. In order to do that.
To prevent buses from going 37 years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Ether or.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Brody.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Tank you mister chairman.  Representative Arp. I make the assumption
that when we don't want the buses we sell them. One of the things I
wanna ask you, because being in business, a concern about business is
that when they buy vehicle is a concern that they can't just get anymore
for them. And they calculate where that points is, were we can get so
much for them and if we go beyond that it falls off drastically. Could
one of the consideration for DPI program now, or criteria now is just
that. That this buses when they reach this point, we can get the most
value for them on the marker and then beyond that it falls off.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Brody. I appreciate the comment. I guess what I would say
is there is an aspect to that. But I would ask you to reconsider it
differently. Our primary purpose is not in the sale and resale of buses,
is in the transport of students. And is all ways cheaper if you can make
that car run a little bit longer and achieve that primary purpose. That
question would have to be studied and aspect of what this is. But we
know what the savings are by making our buses run a little bit longer.
Which is really the primary purpose of operating not the resale value of
it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Pittman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you Mr. chairman. I have, if I could, a couple of questions, and
one comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
We got a long list.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I try to do it quickly. And Stam  made it ask for some of this. I was
wondering. On page two, line tree, the mention of the replacement of up
30  buses each year, raises questions in my mind of how many buses do we
currently have state wide and what is the minimum necessary to maintain
adequate fleet state wide. He might know that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
You want Stam to respond to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I can tell you that we didn't appropriate any money for buses last year,
because of the budget cycle. But if we can get mister Graham
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Gentleman will identify him self for the record.</p>

…here at Greymouth EPI. We operate about 14,000 buses every day on
school bus routes across the state. The 30 buses would be for…and we
have current practices for doing this occasionally. Those of you in the
mountain counties know about the rust situation there and we have buses
that have to go out of service earlier because they’re no longer
structurally sound. An occasional crash, the engine blows up. Those
kinds of things that put a bus out of service and are no longer safe for
students.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I was wondering on page two, lines nine and ten. It
says for additional maintenance or other school purpose. I’m wondering
why we could not require say at least 50% of that had to be kept for
maintenance and moved 50% for other things instead of the whole $2,000
being open.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Pittman. The idea is to
create an incentive for them to run and operate the buses over and above
their natural efficiencies that they get. Right now there’s no
preparation made to each LEA for the maintenance, so the states already
taken out the maintenance involved with that. What this does is allow
them to use that for maintenance or maintenance-type projects but it
really opens it up for them to incentivize it because they don’t have a
dollar in the game because the appropriations come from the state and
the replacement comes from the state. So what we’re trying to do is
bring them as partners in and say look, help us get this longer in a
safe and creative way to run these buses longer and if you want to you
can share in the savings that we produce because each year we run the
buses longer defers us replacing a $90,000 bus. So what we want to do is
return an incentive back to them out of the savings and say thank you
for helping us be frugal.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bumgardner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I have a question for
Representative Arp. Did you say that your bill’s going to have this
section here on page one, line 15-21 taken out?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry give me the reference again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Page one, line 15-21. Did you say that was coming out
of your bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, I’m just simply saying my bill doesn’t address
that. That’s in current law. I think there was a question about some
biofuels. I don’t know if that’s a federal requirement. That’s current
law. Mine only talks about the replacement of the buses, not the
operating of them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To clarify, that’s not part of his bill, it’s just
there for statutory instruction. It’s existing language here, as in
currently in the statute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That may be something you want to do outside of here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Elmore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. My question is with this
incentive component of this also. How did you come up with the $2000
amount? What was your thought process on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What I wanted to do was have a substantial enough… We
don’t want to over incentivize it because safety is the main concern but
we do want to reward the frugality and the buy in and the creativity
that’s available In the LEAs. The $2000 thought was a striking and good
balance between the savings per year that we get on the bus versus some
incentive that we can share back to the LEAs. We opened it up so they
could apply it to special creative educational programs and not
restricted to just transportation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you have any estimates on the amount of money or
any projections of the amount of money that the county’s maybe getting
back with this incentive program? Like for example, maybe an urban
system like Charlotte-Meck and a rural system so we can have some number
about what you are predicting that the systems will be bringing back
with your incentive program?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Elmore. We don’t have that
data. That was part of the challenge of trying to create the fiscal
note. The numbers that I gave you do not include any incentives coming
back so the…</p>

Representative: meetings that I have told you about are without any
incentives. If they run those buses longer, those incentives increase,
and we have got a range where we would say maybe 10% of those would take
advantage of that. We just don’t know. We may find that the incentive
bonus is too low, but we can adjust that, or maybe it is too high, but I
don’t think they will say that.
Speaker: Representative Hurley?
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chair. A couple of comments. I talked with
one of my school districts yesterday just to see how they felt and they
said that the parts were expensive and hard to find sometimes. He said
that every time they got a new bus, the safety features were approved.
Speaker: Representative Floyd?
Representative: Mr. Chair, and the staff may correct me, when the first
250,000 miles were set, that was base upon the gasoline engines. Today,
it is set based on diesel engines, which, as Representative [xx] has
said, they run longer. If you talk to a truck driver, he will tell you
that 250,000, its engine is not even broken in - most come off the road
with 500,000 miles to rebuild the engine. So this is a tremendous
savings. When it is asked in relation to the safety features and the
maintenance of the bus, the department has the manual that is distinct
right here that insist in the overall maintenance of the bus. So the
question is that over some part of time, like Hertz rental, would I
rather buy a used car from Hertz rental or from Elma Floyd? I would buy
one from Hertz Rentals because they have a constant maintenance on their
vehicle. So this is a good bill and saves the state and county money, by
them not putting up a lot of upfront money in replacing the buses. As an
example, Wade County student population, as you know, is constantly
growing. This will save them some dollars and cents. So, this is a good
bill. What it is actually doing is setting forth a policy that had not
been in place, again, the 250,000 miles was sort of mentioned by DPI,
but not fixed in statutes. That is what this bill is trying to do and at
the same time, provide safe transportation for our students and save
state money that can be used elsewhere than in the DPI system.
Speaker We have to leave here at 10 til, so we maybe only have 2 or 3
more minutes. We have got three people on the list and will try to get
to you. Representative Adams?
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chair. I will try to be brief. Just a
couple of questions on the incentive. First of all, do you have a cap on
how many buses you will get the incentive for?
Representative: In the bill it says that you cannot run a bus past 23
years, and that is in the effort to address Representative Brandon and
provide some cap on the safety and the length we run these buses. So, it
depends upon if a bus is eligible for replacement at 15 years, then they
could run it to 23 years, well that, in effect, is a de facto cap, not a
cap per se, just in the sense of the model year.
Representative: Follow up? Well is there a cap on how many buses you can
get $2000 and an incentive for?
Representative: No because every year they run that, saves us money, and
we are paying the incentive out of that savings.
Speaker: Representative Tourbit?
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chair. A question to the bill’s sponsor.
Representative, good morning, thank you for bringing this bill forward.
Would it be possible to ask you to, before we move into the
transportation process, that you can get a probability reading of how
close you feel those numbers can be obtained if those be implemented?
Representative: Are you talking about the incentive, or…?
Representative: Overall savings you mentioned to…
Representative: I have a fiscal note, yes.
Speaker: Representative Baskerill?
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chair. I just wanted to thank
Representative Arp</p>

Prior experience in education to the table here. I think this is a
creative way to try to address a problem and save some money.  I think
we ought to give a shot and lest try it so I think this a good idea.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Wit. Alright last question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Just a couple of thing to ponder representative Arp has done an
outstanding job with a lot of adept study on this. There is probably a
couple of more questions to ponder the two thousand dollars item just to
put that in perspective. On a set on a bus that is basically set of
tires if you are lucky. That is not a whole lot of money just so you
know when it comes to engine and wear and tear the engine is, depend on
the type of engine, gonna outlast the clutch fans the chassis and just
the wear and tear in many, many other components of  a complex machine.
And here is the numbers I have in  my home county and its a mountain
county a whole lot of winding roads with undulation, elevation rises and
so on. Out fleet and our super indented it was out former buss director.
And he is just as tight a banjo string when it comes to conservative
principles, that is why he is there. And we can only squeak about 20
years out of our buses and they only average 200,000 miles. So on the
matrix as it continues to be vetted, just keep those mountain counties
in mind because they do have a whole lot more wear and tear and do not
accumulate the miles years fast. But thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Arp thank you for bring this before us. We are past our
time and the comity is adjourned</p>
