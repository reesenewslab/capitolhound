Good Morning. Calling Senate Appropriations Committee to order please.
Morning everyone. We'd like to start by welcoming our pages. If you
would just raise your hand: Chandler Bird, Thomas McBryer, Sherri
Cogeha(?), Robert Banner, Paul Wood, Destiny Morton, Kaitlyn Ebert, Will
Dabbs, and Tyler Dabbs. Thank you for being here today. And thanks to
our Sergeant-at-Arms Ernie Cheryl, Charles Marshalls, Annette Kessler,
and Canton Lewis. Without objection we're going to make Senator Ford.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Madame Chair, at the appropriate time can we get some staff help with
placing these documents within the committee website?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes. Without objection we're going to make three changes to the agenda
today. We're still waiting for some of the staff presentations so we're
going to bring the two bills that are at the end to the beginning of the
agenda. Also, on the Medicaid differences report fiscal research is
still waiting for some information so we're going to put that report
over to tomorrow. Thank you. We'll go ahead and call Senator Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you Madame Chairman. I think everybody's looked at this bill
probably enough. It's the P3 Bill. We passed our version out of the
Senate a few weeks ago, a couple weeks ago. This is the House version of
the bill. In commerce yesterday we went over the changes in the bill.
I'm to the point and I think I've talked to the secretary about the bill
as well, that I think it's time we moved this bill on with the
understanding we'll probably have to continue working on this bill in
long session. So, I'll try to answer any questions but I just ask for
your support to leave the bill as it is and again we'll continue to work
it as it progresses. So, Madame Chairman that's it. And I'd like for the
secretary to speak if she could as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Apodaca.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Madame Chairman, I'd like to make a motion of favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Discussion.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Let the secretary speak please.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Alright. Ed we're going to hold that motion for just a moment and allow
Secretary Dacker to speak. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you Madame Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity to speak and ask
for you support as Senator Brown has to move this bill forward as it has
been presented. There's no perfect bill I have discovered in my short
tenure here. But I think this is a strong bill that does what you and I
had agreed we wanted to do. Which was facilitate the movement forward in
the creation of partnership for North Carolina that positions us for
better competitiveness. This is the first step in the process, an
important step. And you've got the opportunity now to approve this so
that it might move forward and we can make this into law very quickly.
So, I appreciate your support. I think it's a bill that facilitates this
in a very, very positive way.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you Madame Secretary. Senator Rabin.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you Madame Chair and Madame Secretary nice to see you this
morning. All members of the committee I very much in favor of this
partnership bill that's been brought forward and the work that's been
done by our friends in the House and by Senator Brown. However, it cause
me a great, great concern to see that the film portion that Senate had
in this has been taken out. I can't emphasize that enough because that
is an industry that if we do not support and if we don't come up with
some money in this budget process we are going to loose. It's not like a
normal bricks and mortar and bring them in business. This is a business
that will not survive without what we do. I want to just make that
forward and to air that and to make sure that as we go forward those of
us that's supporting that bill are also trying to support the film
program in some fashion. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you Senator Radin. Senator Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Radin, this is the companion bill coming over from the House. So
the Senate bill that we passed is still over in the House with the film
piece in it. So, it's still there it can be negotiated. So, I feel
pretty confident that that will take place.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you. We have a motion on the floor for a favorable report. All in
favor say, aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Aye
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Opposed. Bill passes. Thank you Senator Brown.</p>

Senator Apodaca. Also I would like to announce to the committee that all
committee documents are available on the committee's website. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chairman. i just heard the comments the
secretary made and I want to let her know that she is now seeing the
perfect bill. She said one didn't exist. Senate Bill 729 is the perfect
bill. Senator Rucho, I'm trying to say, Senator Rucho, I'm trying to say
something to the secretary, if you'd leave her alone and sit down. I was
just telling the secretary this is the perfect bill she's been wanting
to see so I wanted her to pay attention to this because the
appropriations part of this bill is what is masterful. It hires, to
synopsize it, we're going to hire 25 people, additional folks for Deener
and 4 people for the Coal Ash Commission, and the beautiful thing is
Duke Energy's going to pay for it, so I think that is the perfect
appropriation. That is the only appropriations part in this bill and I
ask for your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Questions or comments from
committee? Senator Tillman? [SPEAKER CHANGES] A lot of work has been
done on this bill and I believe both sides may not like it just a little
bit so I do think, therefore, it probably is a perfect bill. I move for
a vote on report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All right, we'll hold that motion
for just one moment. Senator Robinson? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Madam Chair and just a comment and a question for Senator Apodaca. Thank
you for, it looks, you know, you're doing better. You're doing a little
bit better. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I can't take that kind of praise today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And I think Senator Ford has probably indicated too we
got a letter from North Carolina NTA in regards to the work it's been
doing for 11 years on coal ash in terms of how to use the residuals and
all of that and I certainly hope you'll, as we move forward, that we'll
include them in that process. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, ma'am, that is a
key point in this bill because it's been said the plain reality is we
don't have enough room to dispose of all this, so we've got to come up
with creative ways so it will be welcome I'm sure. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator Robinson. Further comments or questions from
committee? We have a motion for favorable report on the floor. All in
favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed. The
bill passes. Thank you Senator Apodaca. All right, so the main purpose
of this meeting is to review the budget differences between the House
and the Senate. The budget's not covered by subcommittee reviews that
are being conducted this week and we're particularly interested in some
of the major differences, especially differences in the areas of the
lottery and salaries and benefits. Is lottery prepared. All right, we're
going to stand at ease for just a moment. Alice Garland, would you
please come to the podium. If you would please come to the, well, thank
you, for your presentation. While she's making her way, some of the most
fundamental differences between the House and Senate budgets are related
to the lottery. Alice Garland of the North Carolina Education Lottery is
here today to explain the differences in the lottery revenue estimates
in the House and Senate budgets. Later this week Fiscal Research and
OSBN will provide us with a revised consensus estimate of lottery
revenues. Ms. Garland. You're going to need to turn your microphone on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning. I'm Alice Garland, Executive Director of
the North Carolina Education Lottery. I have with me in the audience my
commission chair, Keith Valentine. Thank you so much for this
opportunity to talk to you today about lottery sales and advertising.
The Education Lottery's a sales and marketing organization. As such,

<p id="10:00">
Is we advertise our products in a very similar manner to all other
retail sales enterprises. Our mission, as designated in our legislation
is for us to maximize sales in order to maximize our return to
education. Our instant ticket sales in this fiscal year that ends in a
couple of weeks. Our testimony to the effectiveness of our lottery
advertising; in fiscal 14, we changed our advertising strategy, we put
more of our advertising dollars into prime time. We conducted our first
Tuesday campaign and we advertised an entire group of tickets being
launched as opposed to focusing on just one ticket. There changes
produced a 16% increase in instant ticket sales in that product which, I
think, really shows what advertising can do. The House appropriation
chairs with very short notice, ask the lottery to provide scenarios for
increase in the return to education by various dollar levels. We
provided multiple scenarios, all of them based on today’s advertising
conditions. None of the scenarios that we provided took into account
additional advertising restrictions. You have requested that we discuss
three different scenarios, advertising at one half percent, at 1% and 2%
and the 1% is what we are allowed in out statute today. And what the
impact on these scenarios would be of additional restrictions on
advertising. As you review these scenarios, as we review them together,
please keep in mind that the lottery primary sells at gas and convenient
stores and we’re competing for our share of the player’s disposable
income. Other retail products those stores, largely snacks and beverages
spend anywhere from 4-10% of their sales on advertising. I’d like to
turn to the handout, I believe that you all have – it’s a multicolored
column. And these are the scenarios that we’re asked to present. I just
wanna quickly review the 2 columns on the right. These are both fiscal
15, this upcoming fiscal year budgets. We provided the far right column
in March of 13 for the biennium budget and then in the second column, we
revised in April of this year; we had more fiscal 14 sales on which we
based the revised budget, you’ll know if you look down at the dark green
line at the bottom. That between March of 13 and April of 14, we
increased that projection by about 20 million dollars, you have budgeted
that 20 million dollars. That 20 million dollars is in your budget for
fiscal 15. So if you’ll look at the middle green column labeled June 3,
2014 fiscal 15 commission. This is the budget as adopted by the
Education Lottery Commission. It says that we’ll have sales of 1.8
billion and we will return to education, 488 million. This is based on
having 1% for advertising and actually we’ve budgeted 0.94%, we still
don’t budget the full 1%. It includes two new draw games, one in October
of this year and one in March of next year. North Carolina has a very
low number of draw games, we have 5 games; most states have 8 or more.
This will start to bring us more in line with other states lotteries.
The last time that we introduced a new draw game was in January of 2010.
So, it’s been quite a while and that was the mega millions game and we
have total confidence in meeting this number. If you move to left to the
red column, this is what would happen if we only had one half of the
percent to spend on advertising. Looking at a study done by the
university of Texas using an econometric model and I will tell you that
some of the study was pretty dense. Every one dollar decrease in
advertising leads to a 20 dollar and 50 cent decrease in sales. So, this
is the model that we used. It would reduce our sales by 186 million and
reduce the return to education by 45 million bringing it to 444 million
which really reverts us back to the amount that we returned to education
in fiscal of 11. The impact on our advertising spend, because we would
be spending essentially half of what we spend today, it would cut the
agency fee ?? advertising out of ?? is our advertising agency.</p>

<p id="15:00">
it would cut our production costs. We would not be able to produce as
many ads. It would seriously cut the dollars that we have available to
make that media buy. We would be able to have no digital advertising on
the internet and no print advertising. Our media buy, when we're buying
actual airtime, radio or TV, would go from 12.2 million to 4.9 million
for a statewide 12 month a year campaign that is a very small amount of
money. It would seriously impact our ability to keep our product in
front of our players and keeping product in front of players is critical
to any sales and marketing organization. And in the final column, the 2%
advertising shows what we could do if we had double the money and this
is the column that we provided to the House Appropriations Chairs and
this is the number that you have been seeing, that's the number you see
in their budget. This would allow us to maintain a very strong,
consistent player base. It would bring the total return for fiscal '15
from the lottery to 594 million, almost 600 million dollars. What this
additional 1% would allow us to do, first we could place a media buy to
advertise the Powerball and Mega Millions jackpots. Right now rely
solely on our billboards and our jackpot signs. We don't make any media
buys for those jackpots. It would allow us to have a monthly media buy
for our instant product. That's that first Tuesday campaign. We do that
about eight months, we did that about eight months this year. It would
allow us to do it all 12 months. It would allow us to be able to
advertise our in-state draw games, Carolina Cash 5, pick three, pick
four, which we don't advertise, for the most part, right now. It would
allow us to advertise our core instant games, we have two core families
that are always available, much more regularly than we do now. It would
give us sufficient dollars to advertise those two new draw games that I
mentioned and that's really important. Again, from tihs same University
of Texas study, they noted that a lottery needs well directed and well
informed advertising efforts on new games or the games may not realize
their full potential and if we're going to introduce two new games this
year we absolutely want to meet the full potential of those two new
games. Other changes that we would make in our strategies, in order to
meet that 106 million dollar target, is we would move that March of '15
draw game that we're planning to September of '14, giving it six more
months of sales in the fiscal year. That would then actually open a slot
where we could add another draw game in March of '15, giving us four
months of sales that we've not built in to any budget and it would allow
us to add a higher price point game to our instant product. So all of
this that I've mentioned in terms of what we could do if we had 2% would
be a much more aggressive approach than the citizens have been
accustomed to from the lottery but we believe, with this approach, that
we can hit the 106 million increase in our return. The final thing that
we were asked to talk about was the affect of House Bill 156, the
provisions that the House added into the budget that would add lottery
advertising restrictions. I would like to start by saying that the
lottery has operated very responsibly over the last eight years. We keep
our players, we look at our players as our customers and we take great
pride in keeping them informed. We want our players to understand
lottery games. We want them to know what the odds are for winning and
what the prizes are. We share that information daily on multiple
channels, advertising, marketing, communications and we have a customer
service hotline dedicated to our players that answer questions every day
from players about how to play our games. So we've worked really hard on
that. And I will tell you that the author of this language wants to see
the lottery fail and wants to put the lottery out of business and that
is why those restrictions were put into the House budget. These
restrictions would waste lottery dollars for making our advertising
spend less efficient and this would result in getting a smaller return
for that investment in advertising. As a sales and marketing
organization we need to use.</p>

  <h4><a href="https://requester.mturk.com/bulk/workers/A17GN0W9MBIA6L">Worker</a> | <a href="https://requester.mturk.com/mturk/manageHIT?HITId=3BA7SXOG1IPNC8CBOQDNFJB2V8Z8RA&amp;viewableEditPane=manageHIT_downloadResults">HIT</a></h4>

<p id="20:00">
...our advertising dollars absolutely to their best advantage and that
needs to be making efficient buys. And the other thing is that when our
sales drop it means that our retail commissions drop so our retail
partners would also see a drop in their income.
So what's the impact of these new restrictions that are in the house
budget bill? The first is that there's a language in the bill that says
that any time that we advertise a game that is an annuity we must also
provide the cash value and we do that every place it is feasible to do
that. The two places that we don't are on our 60 billboards and our
3,000 jackpot signs that are at retail. This would require that all that
signage have both the annuity jackpot and the cash value. No other state
does this. We would be the only state providing this kind of information
on signage. It would require that the billboards have a second digit box
so if you'll call to mind the billboard as you're driving down the
highway would have to have a second digit box and the jackpot signs that
you see at retail would have to have a second line of numbers. It would
require satellite feed to send to the board that second number. That
feed's not currently available. No one is sending that feed. That entire
process would have to be established. There would be about an 18 month
time frame for replacing the billboards and jackpot signs and we would
be replacing boards and signs that still have a useful life. Absolutely
not a wise investment of money. We also believe, and we have estimated
this and the numbers, that we would lose powerball and mega million
sales. On billboards you have a very short read and what we really want
the player, when they see that billboard, to know is what's the jackpot.
That's what folks care about. So if there's going to be a second number
it's going to be confusing, no other states going to have this. One of
the lessons of advertising is you've got to keep it simple and all we're
doing is making it more confusing. We absolutely believe that we would
be pushing sales to other states because other states wouldn't have this
dual message.
The third thing that these restrictions would do that would have, we
think, a serious impact is that we would have a lost advertising
opportunity by not being allowed to purchase a top tier programming
during college athletic events. For the football season we have three of
the top 25 media markets. For basketball season we have three of the top
10 media markets in the country. This is prime TV time and we're able to
purchase that time now to try to get the same number of eyes, the number
of viewers to see an ad, we would have to purchase about 3x the amount
of time to make up for the loss of being able to advertise during
college athletics. Again spending more money to receive the same value.
Completely inefficient way to spend your money.
So if the lottery is to operate like a business, which we very much try
to do, very focused on our bottomline, these restrictions would
seriously impact our ability to do so. So if you want to look at the
dollar impact, if you'll go to your chart to the bottom two rows, mainly
in red and... I've lost my page. So if you look at our current budget,
the budget that my commission has passed. The budget under which we
anticipate operating in fiscal '15, it would reduce our return to
education by $44 million, taking us to $444 million back to fiscal '11
return amounts. A half percent advertising, that return would be reduced
by $43 million, taking a return to $401 million which takes us back to
what we are providing for education between fiscal year '08 and fiscal
year '09 numbers. A serious turn back. Two percent advertising would
reduce that return by $47 million taking us to $548 million for that
return. So still an increase over what we are projecting. A steady state
but obviously less than we could accomplish if we had 2% with no
restrictions. One of the reasons that we have provided this information
in kind of a financial state form is that we thought it would be helpful
for you to see exactly how lottery dollars are being spent. So this is
essentially a...</p>

Our budget is showing revenues in and expenses out. And, that is what I
wanted to bring to you and I’m happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Ms. Grand. Questions for our committee, Senator Brown?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, Ms. Chairman. Ms. Chairman, that’s what I said.
Ms. Carl. Obviously in the budget that the house put together you used
an additional I think you said 106 million dollars of lottery proceeds.
What you’re saying is with the restrictions they put also in their
budget, that that’s just not a feasible number in your opinion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct. We will not be able to get 106 million dollars with
those restrictions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I know you having a projection here that the restrictions would cost
about 47 million dollars. I feel that you feel certain about these
numbers to a point, but it is still hard to be certain, I guess.
Because, the restrictions that are in the budget as well. These are the
best guessed estimates I guess that you could come up with in a short
period of time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, and really similar to how we do budget projections. We’re looking
at sales figures from the past year, extrapolating from those figures
for an impact on sales. In the other direction we’re doing the same
thing. It’s our best projection but we believe it’s pretty close to
accurate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madame chairman. I would like to ask my first question to
Senator Brown, if I may?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown, I was just thinking, and this goes for Senator Tucker
too. If you going to have a big sale at your car business, next month.
Would you go in and cut your advertising budget in half and expect to
sell a substantial amount of cars more than you did this month?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Actually, believe it or not, I do have a big sale so I would like you to
come by (laughter).
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ll be happy to talk to you about it if you’ll deal for once, but
anyway.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely not. And, I think the restrictions as well on the advertising
is important. Because, where you place those buys and how you can place
them is definitely important as far as returns go.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator Tillman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madame Chairman. Thank you Ms. Calla. You know, either you’re
send a budget over like this. Putting something as important teacher
raises on lottery receipts, and then cutting your arm off on how to
raise this money. You either want to defeat the lottery and get rid of
it, or make it ineffective, or you’re not serious about teacher raises.
You cannot reduce your revenue from lotteries with this silly
advertisement restrictions. We see how you can raise the money, and I
think these figures are pretty good. The lottery’s track record on
predictions have been very good. And, you’ve done an excellent job
madam. Whether you’re for the lottery or not. That’s not the question.
The question is now, let’s make it work. So, we need these silly
restrictions off and we don’t need to put teacher salaries in the
lottery money unless we are pretty sure we’re going to reach the 106
million dollars or whatever we happen to come up with. And, you show a
whole lot more than that with your unrestricted 2%.  What I’m saying is
if you’re serious about teacher’s raises, you won’t tie your hands on
the way to raise the money.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for your comments Senator Tillman. Senator (??)?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madame Chairman and Ms. Calla (?). I found it interesting of
all times that someone from the lottery were to come here. The first
time they’ve ever admitted the fact they’re competing for the disposable
incomes of the working families in our states. I’m going to come from
this from a different perspective saying using this as a source of money
for ongoing government expenses is really not a good business decision.
What’s worse is if you look at your scenarios of between 2.75 and one
eight billion dollars. That money that you’re competing with private
sector, pretty much hits a dead end and doesn’t do anything. In essence,
you’re actually hurting the economy by the more you expand this. By
using disposable income for lottery rather than for purchasing Senator
Brown’s car or Senator Apodaco’s products that he’s selling. The last
thing I would want to do is expand this because we are working so hard
to make the North Carolina economy a lot stronger...</p>

And it would be an absolute disaster to base teacher salaries on
something that is actually detrimental to this economy. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, excuse me, Sir Rucho. Would you like to respond Ms.
?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, thank you. I would I like to say that actually
there are number ways that the lottery this money back into the economy.
First and foremost are the prizes that we pay. Those, those dollars are
going back into the economy and the big winners who come in… the first
thing we say is what are you going to do with this money? And they say
buy cars, buy houses, send my kids to college, renovate my house, take a
vacation. That’s money going right back into the economy. The second
thing is that we pay retailer commissions and that's income going to
retailers. So, that’s money going back into the economy. And the third,
is that we spend money with vendors in North Carolina. We have a
significant ??? with their ad agency. We have a number of other
contracts where, we’re spending money with contractors so, we are
actually putting pretty decent amount of money back to the economy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Sir Rucho [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes ma’am, thank you.
Aye do understand what you're describing but the real question was how
much of a new economic impact would you get? And Aye would probably not
ask everybody in this audience how many of them have been winners in the
lottery. To win enough and buy a care from Senator Brown. So, Aye think
that's a false premise but, thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Sir
Apodaca. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m going to have to take issue with my dear
friend from Charlotte. Well it’s the Charlotte thing. Senator Ford if
you move will be fine. Okay, Mecklenburg County but anyway, I regress.
We, we never bought lottery tickets until these big mega things and my
wife, and if it goes over 200 million she goes out and buys lottery
tickets. Now we don't spend a massive amount but Aye do feel like those
of monies that you know, we were able to manage. And Aye don't think
we’ve hurt the budget, and Aye think it puts money into the economy. Aye
disagree with that Aye do think it ends up back in the economy in some
fashion. It might not end up in a way that we want it to but it still
comes back in. So, Aye just disagree with Senator Rucho. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Madame ??? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for your comments
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And Aye know that doesn't happen often but. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Madame ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can we
ask if Senator Apodaca won one time? [SPEAKER CHANGES] He won five..
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye
do, Mrs. Apodaca won twenty dollars, one time. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Congratulations! Senator Tillman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Madame Chairmen. Aye
think we are talking about, we got the lottery, we’re not talking about
wether we ought to have it Senator Rucho. Or wether it is good for the
economy or wether it is bad for the economy. Fools will play the lottery
and now if we can attract more fools to play the lottery and they choose
that. I'm not sticking a gun to their head. We are talking about will it
produce enough revenue to put something like teacher raises, what Aye am
looking at, in lottery receipts. Whether there dependable or not the
Senator Rucho. Aye don't know but, Aye know there figures have been good
ever since I've been looking at them. All Aye want to know is let's
generate the money if we're going to go this route let's generate enough
money to do what we’re talking about doing rather than, having a hundred
million dollars hole in the budget which we will we will be looking at
under the scenario of reducing the amount and in restricting the
advertising. That's what we're building. We’re building a deficit if we
did this crazy plan. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you for your comments.
Senator Brown. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Madame Chairmen. Ms. ?? Aye
know that I’ve tried to look at the history of the lottery. Aye think
every year, but one the projections of what they were generating was
been more than, and what we think we thought, except that for that one
particular year. And Aye think the economy dictates a lot of that as
well, and… Would you say? Aye think Aye would say. And I'm just
wondering your opinion on this. Is the way the system is set up now we
do the best we can to project revenues and if it generates a little more
we’ve been able use those in different ways in our education budget. To
me that's the prudent way to run this instead of Aye guess pre spending
those dollars on what we think may happen, and because you never know
what the economy could do or if we go into recession three months now
Aye think your projections on all these numbers would be a lot different
probably, and so you know again, if you spend those dollars on the front
end instead of the backend of which what we've been doing, Aye think
that's the safe way to predict these. Aye know in business surely that
would be the way I’d do it. Because, you never know what could happen in
the economy. Would you say that is accurate?Aye mean, if we go into
recession these numbers aren’t accurate anymore. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms.??</p>

There are any number of factors that can impact sales. We have typically
conservatively estimated for our budget. I’ve said several times that we
would much rather overproduce and give you more money than you had
budgeted than underproduce and have you scrambling to try to figure out
how to make up for not getting lottery dollars. We don’t wanna put you
into that situation, we don’t wanna be in that situation and fortunately
that’s proven to work for us. I will tell you that the numbers that
we’ve provided under the2% scenario, they’re not conservative numbers.
They’re aggressive numbers. I have an amazingly dedicated staff that
likes challenges. We were the fastest lottery startup in the country
when we began and I think we just had a nice record, strong steady
growth. We believe we can hit that target.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator ?? follow up. Senator Tucker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Ma’am Chair and Miss Garland over here.
First of all, I think that gambling on teacher raises of a gambling
entity is not a good, wise budget decision but that’s ?? here or there.
The sincere original intent of the lottery was set up. There have been
changes in the allocation of those dollars ?? that the general assembly
has made. I remember when I was county commissioner. 40% of the lottery
used to go to retire capital and capital debt for counties. Now it’s 25.
So, it’s changed. Can you clarify a number for me, since the lottery
started roughly 37% of the proceeds went back to the state and that
number has consistently reduced down to around 26%. Can you tell me if
that is correct and what the reason for that is coming from the lottery?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Miss Garland
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You. Yes, Senator Tucker that is correct. The
2007 legislature changed our statute to remove the percentages as
mandates and instead made them guidelines and instead directed us to
maximize sales in order to maximize revenues and that’s really what
we’re about. So, that percentage doesn’t tell the story, it’s really the
dollars and that’s what we focus on completely as how can we raise more
dollars. States that have mandated a return of 35% are very low
performing states and then several of those low performing states, the
mandate has been removed and their sales skyrocketed. So, there’s a ton
of hard solid data in the lottery industry to show what happens if you
mandate a percentage return that’s high instead of focusing on dollar
return and you really really do wanna focus on the dollar return because
that’s how you can fund programs that you wanna fund.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tucker, follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a follow up. So, you’ve dropped the percentage
but the dollars that are going to education are going up. Is that what
you’re telling me?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Correct. The dollars have gone up by typically 4-5%
every year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just one more follow up, Ma’am Chair and I’m done. So,
by reducing the percentage you’ve increased the dollars but if you
maintain the same percentage as original intent we wouldn’t even be
getting more dollars from the lottery for the education? Help me with
the math.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You’d be getting significantly less. In fact, there’s
a very recent audit – the Georgia lottery by the state auditor that
looked at this very question and I spoke to dollars vs percentages and
I’ve got data out of Texas, I’ve got data out of California. The product
that we produce, we’re sales and marketing organization. The product we
produce, the product we sell is priceless.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tucker, follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just one more clarification. My sixth grade math
teacher would be mad if I didn’t ask this. So, if you’re contributing
the old way, 37% of a 105 million; in the new way you’re contributing
26% of a 105 million, how is that more money for education?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Miss Garland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We would not produce the 105 if we were returning 35%.</p>

… to education. Players buy our games, players buy our tickets because
they want to win money. If they have a lesser chance of winning because
we’re reducing what we put into prizes, they will not buy our tickets,
and so we want… The sales figure will drop considerably, and so you’re
going to get 35 percent of a lower sales figure, so the question is do
you want 35 percent of a lower figure, or do you want 26 percent of a
significantly higher figure? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tucker? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, that’s fine. I just want to share with you that I
firmly believe that I got a better chance of being struck by lightning
than Ms. Apodaca winning the lottery. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
Senator Ford. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. I’d like to get
the opinion of the fiscal staff on the presentation from the folks from
the lottery. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That is actually next up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] So are they going to give us their opinion based upon the
presentation that we’re hearing now? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Evan Rodewald,
Fiscal? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chairman. Evan Rodewald,
Fiscal Research. The finance team of Fiscal Research is working with
state budget to investigate the lottery revenues, and they’re going to
be presenting a consensus revenue forecast later this week. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow-up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. So thank you very much
for that clarification. Folks, the jury’s still out as it relates to a
second opinion, even on the numbers that we’re hearing here this
morning, so I’m very, very interested in hearing from our own staff
about what those look like, and last comment, Madam Chair. I agree with
the comments. It’s very difficult to, in my opinion, to gamble on
gambling to pay teachers. To me it’s fiscally irresponsible, and I don’t
know how you get the consistency out of it unless you ma’am can share
with me with some certainty that based upon your financial model, that
you will be able to predict these kind of returns on a consistent basis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Ford. Senator Robinson. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. I had my hand up so long ago that I
really forget I did. [SPEAKER CHANGES] A lot of people in the queue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And then Senator Rucho was pulling my attention away,
talking about Senator Apodaca’s wife. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And the
Department of Revenue, actually. [SPEAKER CHANGES] But the question, and
I’m not Senator Ford, so I was kind of looking at what we’re investing
the operating expenses as opposed to the revenues, which gives us that
net, and on the other end of it, we’re investing more than… in terms of
the returns, it’s not a real great return, and I see what you’re saying,
which supports the fact that we are not to be gambling with teacher
salaries, is my point. But I saw an article in the paper in terms of who
plays the lottery most, and do you have statistics on that in terms of
who… what segment of the population of what area…? I know it’s not
Senator Apodaca, but can you tell us who plays the most? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] We… [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms. Garland. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I don’t
have statistics. What I would like to share is kind of empirical
evidence, I guess. Every winner who wins 100 thousand or more must some
into our headquarters to receive their winnings, and we interview every
one of those folks, and that’s anywhere from three to five people a
week, and they are a true cross-section of North Carolina. They are
doctors, lawyers, accountants, bank executives, engineers, and they are
blue collar workers, they are housewives. It is a real cross-section.
They are in all 100 counties. They cover the gamut and they are North
Carolina. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Ms. Garland. Senator Bryant?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I was trying to get a handle on the restrictions. I
presume they are – and maybe this is a question for you, Mr. Garland, or
staff. Are they all covered in pages I guess 10 and 11 or so of the
special provisions, or are they scattered throughout, and could somebody
sort of highlight the key components of these restrictions? And then I
was going to ask you something about the impact. I just want to know
what we’re kind of all talking about. And is 156 just a sort of catch
name?</p>

<p id="45:00">
Before the same items that are in the budget or is it a separately
passed bill. That's the follow up question Senator Harrington. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. I'd like to recognize Brian Madison to give the
details of your first question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chair.
Over here, straight in front of you Senator Bryant. Good morning. The
items you are looking for in the House Budget begin on page 9 in section
5.2. You'll see below the area in which the lottery funds are
appropriated in the House budget, there are a series of additional
provisions that would govern and make changes to how the lottery may
advertise under the House budget. Miss Garland had reviewed those with
you in some detail, but you'll find them in block in that area. It's not
identical I believe to the House Bill that was referred to, but I
believe the bulk of that House Bill is reflected in the House budget
with respect to advertising and changes there. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Bryant, did you have a follow up with him or Miss Garland. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, I heard you discuss or talk about something about
advertising and if you could just review with me and I hope it's not at
length one more time what are these restrictions and sort of the impact.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Miss Garland. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For example, I see
something about the kind of games you can do or something and I don't
really understand what that really means. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Right, and I
apologize, I don't have that language right in front of me, but I think
I pretty much have it printed in my head. The language on the games
really just captures what we're doing today. We can provide instant
games, which are the tickets that you scratch off, and draw games which
are, draw games are ones where your numbers are drawn and that's why we
call it a draw game. So that doesn't restrict what we're doing today.
The three main concerns that we have in terms of those restrictions, the
first is the language that speaks to the wins and annuity jackpot that
you also have to also provide the cash value. We do that everywhere
feasible. Where we don't do it is on the billboards and on the jackpot
signs, that's the only two places we don't do it. It would be a
tremendous expense and create great confusion to the players if we made
that change. The second is the not being allowed to purchase advertising
during college athletics, and I'm sure everybody in here realizes that
college athletics I think in North Carolina are more important than
professional athletics in terms of TV, and to deny us the opportunity to
purchase advertising during that prime TV time would absolutely have an
impact and would be very expensive to try to replace that with some
other purchase. And third, we believe that the confusion created with
having two sets of numbers on billboards and jackpot signs would
actually push people away from Powerball and Mega Millions. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Ms. Garland. Follow up, Senator Bryant. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes. So in the case of the annuitized, the payments over a
period of time, your concern is not that if the buyer knew the value
they would not buy it, it's just the space it takes. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Miss Garland. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Or it's both? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It's the
confusion of having two numbers. So they're used to a billboard that has
one number and if they're traveling from state to state they see that
same number in South Carolina and Virginia that they see in North
Carolina and all of the sudden there's a billboard with a second box and
a second number and what on earth does that mean? What's that telling me
and has North Carolina changed the game somehow? I'll just go to South
Carolina or Virginia. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant, follow up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] And in terms of your odds, I'm looking at the provisions and
you have to state the probability of winning the lowest prize and the
largest prize or something, and how is that different from what you do
now when you say what the odds are. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Miss Garland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Our current statute requires that we put on everything
that we do the overall estimated odds of winning in that game, and so
that's what we do because that's what our legislation tells us to do.
What this provision would ask us to do is to include the odds of winning
the top prize and what's the dollar value of the lowest prize you can
win. After House Bill 156 was introduced, we started looking at what we
could go ahead and do, and that was a</p>

Easy one. We were glad to do that, had we been asked we would have done
it voluntarily. We were just doing what our statute told us to do, but
we already now have on all of our tickets and our point of sale that's
in stores and our how to plays the odds of winning that top prize. We
have left the overall estimated odds because that's still in our
statute. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Miss Garland. Follow up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] And this to staff, in this section about advertising in sports
it says in connection with any sport or sporting event, are those
different or something for some reason? I was just curious in terms of
the drafting. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So Madam Chair, Senator Bryant, I'm not
in a position to have an opinion on that. Looking across at my
colleague, we'd have to talk to an attorney and get back to you on that.
We'll do that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Thank you, Senator Bryant.
Senator Apodaca. Senator Apodaca. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam
Chairman. I was wondering about these mega million things. Hasn't that
been a real boon to the lottery, all the large jackpots over the last
couple of years? When Mrs. Apodaca really gets involved in the lottery.
Is that not, what kind of money has that brought in? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Miss Garland. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, first I would like to say that
Mrs. Apodaca is like a huge number of North Carolinians that waits for
the jackpot to get to $200 million because a measly $40 million isn't
enough. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] But, yes, and
quite frankly Senator and one of the reasons that we have surpluses is
we don't project for the year those large runs. We can't count on them,
we can't predict them, we can have a year where we have 3 or 4 of those
large runs, great year, we can have a year where we have 1 large run,
but typically, I wish I had a sales chart to show you what happens when
that jackpot gets really big. It's not unusual for us, I actually can't
tell you minute for minute what we do on a normal day, but literally
minute by minute when that jackpot is high, we are selling $20,000 of
tickets a minute when that jackpot's high, and 38% of that, the draw
games have a higher return than the instant tickets, 38% of that is
going to education. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Those
games have been great for us. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Miss Garland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Two more questions
from committee, we're trying to move through. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I want
to do a quick follow up to that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Statement please. All right, I don't want us to spend a whole
lot of time worrying about House Bill 156 no matter where it is or where
it was put, that's just foolishness. And so I don't want Jamie going
into labor and I don't want you having a heart attack. And in finishing
up, I think lightning hitting Senator Tucker is probably greater than
anything I can think of odds-wise happening. It ought to almost happen
any moment, so thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for your comment.
Senator Brock. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chair. When you're
looking at advertising, you're looking at when the jackpots do get that
high you have your earn media where it's leading off with a new story
every night so when you're looking at actually sales advertising is that
the media's doing more of it for you than what you're putting in so your
numbers are, I think you're misinterpreting your numbers wrong. But the
question I have on this one and regardless of what Senator Apodaca said
on the bill, looking at our information that we're to make the decision
on on the lottery. We created you in the middle of the night. The
information that we got on House Bill 156 that it would be no impact,
did you talk to, I know they're coming up next, but did you, the Lottery
Commission, talk to our research staff and give us this information that
said it will be no impact. You said the numbers, now this is this year,
but last year you said you didn't have the numbers. Now you do. Can you
walk me through the dialogue you had with them? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Miss
Garland. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We were not consulted when that fiscal note
was put together in fiscal '13. When I spoke in the House Judiciary
Committee I laid out what I thought the fiscal impact would be and my
district liaison and I met Representative Stam and told him what we
thought the fiscal impact would be, so it was not for a lack of our
expressing what</p>

<p id="55:00">
Thought would happen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And what were your numbers?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Similar to what you see now. I don't have them with
me, but they haven't changed very much. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can you
provide me with that documentation that you gave to Representative Stam?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We talked to him verbally. I did not hand him a
document. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Miss Carlin. We very much
appreciate you sharing your time with the committee, and answering all
of the questions. Thank you. Next up we have Brian Matheson from the
fiscal research division. He's going to be discussing the differences in
lottery appropriations between the House and Senate budgets. Welcome,
thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madame Chair, members of the
committee, guests. Good morning. There will be a table handed out ot you
shortly so I'll get into that once you receive it. Just a few points to
make before we get into those numbers. The first point again, I guess it
bears reiterating Senator Harrington led us off with this but Barry and
his counterparts over at OSBM are working with the lottery committee to
come up with a revised consensus estimate that will take into account
the baseline, that is if there's no policy change, and lottery continues
operating as-is. And considering a few different policy shift scenarios,
they hope to be able to produce a formal estimate by the end of the week
that you will receive, so I don't anticipate my brief presentation here
will get into any of the estimate side of things, but rather I've been
asked to look at how funds were distributed and the respective House and
Senate budgets, how they compared to the enacted budget and to one
another. One other point to raise to you, I see some of you have the
handout and the rest of you are getting it. For the first time this past
year, 2 significant changes happened with respect to how you budget your
lottery funds. The first is that you budget it on a 2 year basis, the
lottery funds, whereas in the past the net revenues of the lottery for
education programs had been budgeted annually. So even in the short
session, you'd come back, take a fresh look and make specific
allocations that could be significantly different than what had been
done at the beginning during the long session. So this time you'll see
that we have a 2 year budget put in place. That is new. Secondly and I
believe Senator Tucker had raised the point earlier that last year had
made a significant change and had removed the statutory required
allocations for lottery funds for specific programs, so what you see
here on a going forward basis reflects the General Assembly's best
wisdom every year about where to allocate funds that you receive or the
projected funds that you receive from the lottery. So seeing that all of
you have the handout, let's get into the detail. FY2013 14, you see the
enacted budget of $481.1 million. Because you're not operating on a 2
year budget, showing you here what was budgeted this year. The Senate
did propose to make a modification, the baseline consensus re-estimate
in April that Alice had discussed with you earlier, Miss Garland, excuse
me, had anticipated approximately 37 million in overages from current
year operations. That is that the lottery would produce net revenues
$37-38 million higher than had been budgeted. The proposed Senate budget
would take 19 million of those projected overages in the current fiscal
year and put them into completing the UNC financial aid forward funding
that had been authorized in the budget. If you see with that item 32.5
million was enacted in the current FYI 2014 15. What the Senate budget
did with the additional available in the current year is to take about
half of that availability and finish out the work on the moving UNC
financial aid completely to a forward funding model. The House budget
did not make any changes to the enacted budget in 2013 14, so really the
only item of interest there is just the Senate shift to fully fund the
forward funding item. FY 2014 15 as you know is a considerably different
story. Both the Senate and the House had modifications there. What the
Senate did was to put 56 million into 56 million additional into the
classroom teachers. See actually there's an error on here in respect to
forward funding and digital learning. Just a line moved up on me. So
what you should see is that forward funding is a zero for the Senate in
the 2014 15 budget whereas the digital learning money stayed flat.
Essentially on a comparative basis, the only change</p>

<p id="60:00">
... here, or the only two changes are 56 million additional for
classroom teachers and the elimination of 19 million for forward funding
in the Senate budget, as that had already been taken care of in 13-14.
The House budget in 2014-15 made several modifications, the most
significant of which was an additional 160.9 million into classroom
teachers. That amount, as you see, considerably higher than the Senate’s
allocation, about 104 million. Also put 49 million into NC pre-k. In all
cases here, these were not additions, so didn’t provide more teachers or
pre-k slots, but changed the distribution of proceeds supporting those
programs, the mix between general fund and state receipt, so you see
between those two items an additional 219 million, or 220 really, from
the House into teachers in the pre-k. Also provided nearly 11 million
for an increase to textbooks, Textbooks program already receives about a
23 million dollar general fund appropriation through the DPI budget, so
this would be about a 50 percent increase to textbooks. Then lastly, the
House policy on the forward funding was not to complete it, so it also
did not provide the 19 million, and then lastly did not fund digital
earning. So just to summarize, you see the box at the bottom of the
page, Additional Budgeted Net Lottery Revenues. So you see the
additional budgeting over both years since the Senate had allocated some
of the funds in 2013-14. Senate was counting on about another 56.3
million over the enacted level, whereas the House budget counts on
approximately 190 million over the enacted level with the policy changes
that you heard about earlier. That concludes the presentation, Madam
Chair. I’ll take questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Brian. Senator
Apodaca. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. Brian, go in a little
deeper for us on the UNC financial aid forward funding, what that
involved and why we were looking at that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So I’ll take
a start at this, then I’ll look over at my colleague who handles this,
and if I get off track, I’ll defer to Denise. That’s right, sir. You
know. So philosophically, there had been certain timing constraints that
you all face each year with making financial aid awards, wherein you’ve
been making appropriations decisions that in some ways impact existing
policies. That is, if award letters had been sent out to students
anticipating a scholarship award, receiving those letters in the spring
of a year in which you’re considering the budget for the next year, any
modifications you made to that budget, specifically in the case of
making any reductions to aid, would result potentially in families and
students expecting one level of funding through financial aid and
receiving another. The General Assembly’s move here through lottery
funds, some other general proceeds and whatnot – the whole array of
funds that support financial aid – the General Assembly has moved over
the last several years to get the program on a fully forward-funded
basis so that you can make adjustments without impacting those award
letters and have a better sense of timing that wouldn’t negatively
impact students that have already been notified of awards. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So in simple terms, we would be
giving money that we had already appropriated. We would have the money
and then send it out to the students, correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam
Chair? Yes, that’s correct, Senator. You appropriate it up front, know
it’s there, and then you can send out the awards. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions or comments from committee? Thank you. Appreciate it.
Next we have compensation differences. Lanier McRee and David
Vanderweide are here to cover another major area of budgetary
differences, salaries and benefits. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Hi, I’m Lanier
McRee from the Fiscal Research Division. The Sergeant-At-Arms are
passing out a handout that shows the various proposals and budgets
passed for the compensation plans. The handout provides the Governor’s
proposal, the Senate’s budget as enacted and the House’s budget that
they passed. There’s also a handout, the second page provides the
various a: teacher salary schedules, so this is the Bachelor’s lane of
the teacher salary schedules in the various proposals. I’m going to
quickly go through the various employer groups on this page, starting
with educator raises. First, all three proposals increase starting pay
for educators to 33 thousand dollars a year. I’m going to focus on the
differences between the Senate and the House. In the Senate budget, if
you recall, you create a professional status teacher salary schedule
that only has 21…</p>

<p id="65:00">
steps. Starts at $33,000 and is flat at that rate for the first few
years and then provides $1,000 salary increased up until step 20 when it
caps out at $50,000. In order to move to that professional status
teacher salary schedule you have relinquish longevity rights, career
status rights, and also a technical issue related to the way that
supplements for degrees and certifications are calculated. On average,
the professional status salary schedule provides over an 11% raise for a
teacher. It's not 11% for every teacher but it's on average across all
steps of the schedule. Teachers at the top of the salary schedule who
choose to move to the professional status schedule don't actually get a
salary increase. If you look at the current schedule for teachers
someone on step 36 makes $53,000. When they, if they choose to move to
the professional status schedule they don't drop to $50,000. They're
held harmless and they keep their current rate of pay and they actually
get a 1% non-recurring bonus. The House did not choose to go with this
professional status salary schedule. Instead, they increased starting
pay to $33,000 a year and they increased all the steps on the schedule
by varying amounts in an effort to move back towards the schedule as it
was before the freeze. On average, the House provides a 5% increase to
all teachers on the schedule and it provides a 2% bonus to anyone who's
on step 36 that would go to year 37 or who is currently a 37 and would
go to a 38 because we don't have steps for those but there would be a 2%
non-recurring bonus for those individuals. I just want to look at this
page of the raises for educators quickly and explain how you would
figure out what a teacher would, salary increase would be. Because each
educator gains a year of experience a zero, let's use a 10, a person on
step 10 who currently makes $35,800 does not move to $40,000 under the
Senate proposal. They would actually move to $41,000 because they also
gain a year of experience. So they move from step 10 to step 11. So if
you have a person who calls you and asks how this would affect them make
sure that they understand you don't just move across but you also move
down a step to gain that year of experience. The second group of
employees on my list is the school based administrators. This are your
assistant principals and principals. The Senate budget proposed doing
the exact same thing as the Governor's budget did and this provides a
step increase to these individuals as well as non-recurring bonuses for
anyone who doesn't get a step. The House budget also provides a step and
it changed the schedule to match the school based administrator's
schedule is tied to the educator's schedule and it changed the schedule
to match the proposed salary schedule for the teachers. You can see the
cost difference there. These numbers are in millions so the Governor's
proposal for school based administrators costs just under 6 million
dollars while the House's cost over 10. I'm sorry I didn't state the
cost for the educators raises. The Senate was just under 469 million
dollars while the House's proposal costs about 278.3. Third are your
non-certified and central office staff at the public schools.
Non-certified personnel are your bus drivers, your cafeteria workers,
people who are not certified in education fields and your central office
staff are the superintendent, the school business officers, and those
people who work in the public school central offices. The Senate
proposal provides a $500 flat salary increase, it's $600 and some
dollars when you include benefits, and the House provided a $1,000
salary increase, which is closer to $1,236 when you include benefits.
You can see the cost difference for those here as well. Fourth are state
employees and the North Carolina Community College system employees. The
Senate provides an $809 salary increase and excludes the university EPA
in their estimate of cost. The cost for the Senate proposal is 75.5
million dollars. In the House there's $1,000 salary increase for these
employees and it specifies that state agency and science and math
teachers would get compensated on the teacher salary schedule. This
costs about 118 million. Turning over to the second page, these are the
non-educator and school based administrator step employees. So these are
your assistant and deputy clerks, your magistrates, and your state
highway patrolmen. All the proposals pretty much provide a step for
these individuals and anyone who's not eligible for a step would get</p>

<p id="70:00">
Either 809 in the Senate or $1000 in the House. However for the
magistrates, the House budget provides a general increase in the rate of
pay for the magistrates. You didn’t see in the box for magistrates there
have been increase of over $2000 for the ?? for magistrates and this is
to help address recruitment issues for magistrates. So everyone in these
cases will get the same, the flat or step increase which is more than
the flat increase provided same employees. Lastly the state highway
patrol, the House provided more than a step for certain Highway
patrolmen. For Highway patrol, one step is 5% and the House provided 6%
for patrolmen sworn since 2012. 5.5% for patrolmen sworn between 2008
and 2011 and 5% for those sworn from 2005 to 2007. You can see the total
cost for these plans here, the main difference is the market increase
for magistrates makes that cost 1.2 more than the Senate and then the
additional pay for the newer troopers makes the Highway patrol cost
slightly higher than what’s in the senate. In total, the house budget
cost proposal for compensation cost about 381 million dollars while the
senate proposal cost about 591 million dollars. Line 9 shows the retiree
column, the senate budget includes a 0.8% cost of living adjustment for
retirees while the house provides a 1.44% increase for retirees. And
then you can see total spending including the retiree component is 621
million dollars in the senate and 434 million dollars in the house. I’m
happy to answer any questions related to these guidelines.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Miss McCray. Questions or comments from
committee? Alright, thank you very much. Senator Tucker. Senator Tucker,
please turn your microphone on. Thank You.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ma’am Chair, Thank You. On the step increase for
principles in school administration on the Senate and House. Is that
different and how much is it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chair. Senator Tucker, the Senate keeps the
governor’s proposal which has a plan and if it matched the governor’s
teacher’s salary schedule. So the school base administrative salary
schedule in the senate budget no longer is linked to the teacher’s
salary schedule. It’s the same as was proposed in the governor’s
proposal. And the House updates the school base administrative schedule
to match their proposal for teachers and that cost 4 million dollars
more than what was proposed in the senate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Senator Tucker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No Ma’am. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You Miss McCray. Senator Bryant.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Miss McCray, can you review with us because I don’t
think it’s on here, two things. One is what happened with the $500,
$1000 kind that went to 4 year contracts. How was that handled
differently and I’m trying to remember, in the senate budget that we
budget assuming everybody would move to the career status and I don’t
know what amount of flux will be in that depending on how that happened,
if there’s  a simple answer but if you could?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant, I’ll answer your second question and
default to my colleague Chris ?? on the first. On your second question,
the cost to the senate proposal, almost 469 million dollars that does
assume all teachers who choose to move to new salary schedule. Teachers
who do not choose to move to the professional salary schedule remain on
what will be known as career status salary schedule and that is frozen
so that the 14-15 salary matches exactly the 13-14 salary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant, follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. Do we know how much was the possible amount
of money that could be involved in that for those folks? Do we have some
estimate or what the amount we’re looking at one way or another?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No Ma’am Senator Bryant we do not have an estimate of
the number that we have moved but for the first question then.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright. Thank You.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Chris ? from fiscal research, just a follow up Senator
Bryant with your question regarding the performance based contracts, the
House and the Senate did have different policies there. The House
essentially got rid of the program. They said for those teachers who
have signed contracts prior to June 30th.</p>

...team. They can chose to keep that contract or waive it. The senate
allows teachers who've signed contracts by June 30th to keep that
contract or waive it. Slightly amends it a little bit for additional
contracts to be offered due to, I think, due to some of the court cases
surrounding this policy. Some additional time is added in that school
districts would have until September 30th to offer contracts. Clarifies
that these contracts offer following the passage of the budget until
September 30th. Instead of pay raises of $500.00 increasing each of the
four years, these would be bonuses of $500, $1,000, $1,500, and then
$2,000. And then there are provisions in there, [CLEARS THROAT] excuse
me, to allow for additional contracts that would start in the 15-16
school year such that the total number of performance based contracts
offered by the school district could only total 35% of the eligible
teacher population. The eligible teacher population, those that have
been determined effective and have certain number of years of experience
in that school district.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, did you have a further follow up? Further questions or
comments from committee? Alright, thank you Ms. Mcrane(?) Next we're
going to have Mark Bondo(?) present with capital differences. Although,
the differences in the House and Senate capital budgets are not major.
The capital budget does not have a sub-committee. So, Mark Bondo is
going to quickly review for the appropriations committee the budget
differences in the area of capital.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hell, My name is Mark Bondo. I'm with fiscal research and I believe
you're getting the handouts for what the differences are in the capital
budget. While those are being passed out, in the interest of time, I
will go ahead and start. The first item that the Senate funded which the
House did not, was the Department of Agricultural Project. It was
funding the McGough Arena roof repairs at the Western North Carolina
Agriculture Center of $2,000,000. The House did not fund this project.
The House and the Senate both chose to fund planning for the expansion
and renovation of the Museum of History here in Raleigh, but they both
chose to fund it in different ways. The House appropriated 1.8 million
dollars directly to the Department of Cultural Resources and if you look
on the next page, on page two, the Senate chose to do a $1,000,000
challenge grant that the Department of Cultural Resources would receive
upon raising $1,000,000 in non-state funds. Both the House and the
Senate funded a North Carolina battleship but in different ways. The
North Carolina battleship needs its whole repaired. The Senate
appropriated $3,000,000 directly to the Department of Cultural Resources
and authorized them to raise an additional $10,000,000 in non-state
funds to repair the battleship. The House, on page two on item six,
chose to appropriate $3,000,000 to the Office of State Budget Management
to hold in a reserve as a challenge grant for the Department of Cultural
Resources in the friends group of the USS North Carolina raising an
additional $10,000,000. Item four, House and the Senate are in agreement
on water resources projects for $5.81 million. Skipping down on item
seven, the Senate chose to fund a $3,000,000 outerbanks land management
reserve in the interest of buying land near the Oregon inlet. The House
did not follow this policy so the $3,000,000 was not appropriated. Item
eight within the House budget for Capital there is $4,000,000
non-recurring to fully plan the Appalachians State University Health
Sciences Building. With the authorization that Appalachians State can
raise an additional $1.2 million to meet the full planning cost needs.
This is actually funded in the Senate budget but in the education
section there's a, [CLEARS THROAT] excuse me, $2,000,000 non-recurring
appropriation to Appalachians State to further planning for this
project. For two-thirds bonds there's no money here, just the
authorization. Which then it also appears in a special provision. The
House funded the renovation of the Aldemaro building, which is the
building across the street. This would be a full renovation using
two-thirds bonds and it was $42.23 million. Just a little bit of
history, the Aldemaro building is about forty-four years old. It was
finished in 1970 and about 135,000 square feet and this would be a full
renovation of that building. Both House and Senate agreed to fund...</p>

In the Department of Justice's Western Crime Lab in Ednyville and also
to essentially refinance existing debt that the State has with 2/3 bonds
at the amount of $206 million dollars. And those are the major capital
items, there are no major special provisions to be discussed. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Bondo. Questions or comments from committee? All
right, thank you. Next we have Kristin Walker from Fiscal Research.
She's going to review the final budget differences in the areas of
general fund availability and the reserve section of the budget. Thank
you. Welcome, Kristin. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mrs. Chairman. What
we have is a handout for you which details the general fund availability
differences, so this kind of wraps up a lot of the different pieces
you've heard about today. I will go through this quickly. I know we're
almost out of time. On line 2 you can see there's a difference in
undercollections between the Senate and the House. The consensus
forecast has not changed, but what has happened is that there was a
return of about $16 million from the high risk insurance pool, so that
is reflected in the House budget as an undercollection, changing that
number. The projected reversions is different between the Senate and the
House as well on line 3. The difference there is how Medicaid and HHS
carry forward funds were handled. There will be a later meeting to talk
more about Medicaid and those carry forward funds. In lines 5 and 6 the
savings reserve and R&amp;R received different amounts between the
Senate and the House, and then if you look at lines 8 and 9, those are
the same. Those are the revenues and the consensus forecast was used for
both of those lines on lines 8 and 9. Lines 10-26 show you various
differences. They're mostly minor in cash transfers and other
availability adjustments. We can go into the details if there's
questions or if time permits. Now as you look at line 27 we've broken
out the subcommittee budget for you. For each subcommittee we start with
the enacted budget and then from there we've pointed out a few major
differences, just a few of them, and subtracted those out with
compensation differences in each subcommittee being one of the biggest
areas of difference. When you get to the shaded line for each
subcommittee, so that's line 39 for Education, you can see the total
spend difference for that subcommittee between the Senate and the House.
As you look at line 40, you'll see Health and Human Services. The big
differences there are on lines 43 and 44. Those are related to Medicaid
and again the chairs have expressed an intent to have a meeting at a
later date that covers in depth Medicaid differences. Turning the page,
you can see Justice and Public Safety, NER, General Government, those
totals for those subcommittees and the major differences there. Looking
at, starting on line 69, these are the adjustments to the reserves. You
can see many of these are the same. There are just a few minor
differences as you look down at lines 81-84. You can also see on line
80, that's the Medicaid Risk Reserve, which is how the House chose to
handle the Medicaid funding. And line 84, I should note, this is the,
the Senate column has $20 million in there. This was actually not passed
in the Senate budget. This is the film grant money that was passed in
Senate Bill 743, which this committee heard a week or two ago. So there
was $20 million spent and if you flip back, the page back over, lines 5
and 6, the savings reserve in repairs and renovation, $10 million came
from each of those to fund the $20 million grant program, so those
numbers on lines 5 and 6 will not match if you open up your Senate
budget because that bill that passed subsequently has changed them, but
that will be in play in conference, the difference there between the
Senate and the House. And then the last section just details for you the
capital differences and you just heard those from Mark Bondo and finally
you can see the total spend on line 94. The Senate is at 21.18 and the
House is at 21.1 and both chambers left no money on the bottom line.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Miss, Thank you Miss Walker. Questions or
comments from committee, and I am told that this room is reserved for
another meeting at 10:00. All right, seeing none. Thank you, meeting
adjourned.</p>
