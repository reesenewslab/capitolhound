The meeting will now come back to order.  We’ll start a presentation of
the bill.  We’ll start with Susan Jacobs from the committee staff Fiscal
Research Division, and the rest of the staff will follow her.  Again, no
questions until this afternoon.  Please write them down and keep track
of them. We’ll take questions and discussion and amendments at this
afternoon’s meeting.
Miss Jacobs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, good morning.
The first document I want to review with you is a legal-size document as
a summary that is two-sided.
On page one is a document you saw when we reviewed the Senate budget
review that basically tells you percentage-wise the changes in the
divisions within HHS.  So on that first page, you see that the
continuation budget for Health and Human Services is approximately 4.6
billion the first year; a little over 4.6 billion in the second year;
and then the second line is the current House money report spending.  So
the first year the spending is 5 billion dollars, the second year
approximately 5.2 billion dollars.  For net changes of 405 million
dollars the first year; and almost 579 million dollars the second year.
Comparing that spending to the base budget, you see the increase the
first year is approximately 8 percent; the second year is 12.5 percent.
I will call your attention to the information in the box at the top left
page.  What we have done in this highlighted document is back out how
much money was included for the Medicaid rebates so that you can see the
real impact for other agencies ?? the agency as a whole, had it not been
for the funds that had to be added for the Medicaid rebates.  If you
deduct the 540 million dollars the first year and the 796 million
dollars the second year, the net change for the department becomes
approximately 135-million-dollar reduction the first year, or 2.92
percent; and the second year the reduction is 270 million dollars, or
almost 5 percent.
If you turn to page two, you have several columns there, starting with
the continuation budget by agency.  Then you have a comparison of the
Governor’s budget compared to the continuation budget, and the percent
change for that comparison.  You also have the Senate’s spending
compared to the continuation budget for both years of the ??, as well as
the House budget spending compared to the base budget as well.  If you
look at the very last column, you see if you compare the House budget to
the continuation budget, it is 8.777 percent.  As I referenced earlier,
the Senate spending compared to the base budget is a 7.98 percent
increase.  The Governor’s budget was a 3.1 percent increase.
Moving to the second year, the Governor’s continuation budget increased
the base budget for Health and Human Services by 7.21 percent.  The
Senate’s adjustments added to a little over 11 percent the second year.
And the House budget includes a 12.5 percent increase for Health and
Human Services the second year.  Mr. Chair, we’ll move on to the money
report if there are no questions on that summary document.
We have reviewed the presentation on the Senate items.  We’re going to
highlight the significant changes based on the Senate budget.  Those
items that are identical we will refer to as being identical as either
the Governor’s item or include it in the Senate package, and we will
focus on those items that are significantly changed.
Begin on Page G1, Item 1 is an identical item that was in the Governor’s
and Senate budget and it eliminates six positions.  You will see several
items throughout the budget that are similar to the Senate budget based
on historical transfers.  So Staff did an analysis of historical
transfers within agencies to help cover previous year’s shortfalls.
Based on those transfers that were made, we did an analysis of how much
could potentially be transferred on a recurring basis for the ??.  For
example, the first item you see, you will see several items throughout
the agency based on adjustments for historical transfers.
Item No. 2 in the Office of the Secretary is the same as it was in the
Senate budget and it is approximately 2 million dollars.  Both years of
the ?? based on historical transfers.  Item 3 is the same as it was in
the Governor’s budget and the Senate budget funds for NC ??. The
Department of Justice ?? the funds are the same as it was in the
Governor’s budget and as it was in the Senate budget.  The same is true
for Item 5. Items 6 and 7 are new items. Item 6 was included in the
Governor’s budget Medication Assistance Program.  1.7 million dollars
recurring funds for</p>

<p id="005:00">
??.  Item seven is also a House-only item, NC MedAssist Program.
Four-hundred thousand dollars for both years in biennium.
Item number eight had a similar item in the Senate budget, and in the
Senate budget it was a competitive lock-grant process where historically
funded non-profits would have to now have to compete for funds for the
13-14 year.  In the House proposal, these non-profits are funded at
approximately the same level they were funded at in the current fiscal
year with a slight reduction based on availability in federal funds.
And the special provision you will see shortly directs the secretary to
create a competitive block grant process by the second year of the
biennium.
Item nine is a new item as well and it is supplemental short-term
assistance for group homes in the amount of eight million dollars.  And
you will see in the description and see more detail in the special
provision what these funds will actually pay for.
State-wide Telepsychiatry Program was in the Senate budget and is
included in the House budget.  In the Senate budget, the funds were
provided to the Division of Mental Health.  In the House budget they are
provided to the Division of Central Management and Support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, committee members, I'm Debra Landry with Fiscal staff.  The
first item under Division of Child Development is county services
support, from four percent to three percent in child care allocations.
That was in the Governor's budget.  It is modified slightly.  The first
year is slightly less than the Governor proposed.  This reduces general
fund appropriation for local county departments and social services for
their administration of child care subsidies.  They will get three
percent of their child care allocation for administration of child care
subsidies.  This is being reduced because of the SEEK system.  The
subsidized early education for kids system is being implemented and will
reduce manual processes in the local county department of social
services, which will save administrative costs.
The second item, item 12, is regulatory positions shifted from state to
federal funding.  It is identical in the Senate and the Governor's
budget.
Item 13, SEEK management funding elimination is identical from the
Senate to Governor's budget.
Item 14, adjustments based on our historical transfers that Susan spoke
about earlier is identical to the Senate budget.
A new item is pre-K slots.  This item provides 24.8 million dollars in
lottery seats for pre-K slots.  It will fund approximately 5,000 slots.
Moving on to the Division of Social Services.  Item 16 is SEEK
management funding elimination and is identical to the Governor and the
Senate.
Item 17, adjustments based on historical transfers is a Senate item
that's been modified.  The second year of the biennium is increased.  It
was 1.875 million dollars like the first year, and the second year it's
been increased to 3.5 million dollars.
Item 18, contract administrative savings is identical to the Senate and
Governor's budget.
Item 19, federal funds for county child welfare services replacement is
identical to the Senate and the Governor's budget.
Item 20, NC REACH child welfare post-secondary education was in the
Senate and Governor's budget, and this has been modified.  This has been
modified to provide support for 10% growth each year of the biennium.
The Governor funded 200 slots, the Senate 100.  And this provides funds
based on a growth estimate.
Item 21 is a new item to the House and it's the adoption promotion fund.
 It provides 1.5 million recurring each year of the biennium to support
adoptions through a reimbursements to private, non-profit organizations
and this is to support adoption programs and to provide financial
incentives to county departments of social services who increase their
adoptions above a base line.
Item 22 is new to the House budget.  It's the  Permanency Innovation
Initiative Fund provides funds to improve and support permanency
outcomes for children living in foster care, improve engagement with
biological relatives, and reduce associated costs with maintaining kids
in foster care.  And that's 1 million in the first year and 2.75 million
in the second year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm David Rice with Fiscal Research.  Section six is Division of
Vocational Rehabilitation.  Item 23, independent living administration
reduction is a Senate proposal and Governor's provision.
Item 24, vocational rehabilitation services administration funding is a
Senate provision.

Denies Thomas will now discuss section 8, division of public health.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning. I am starting with the division of
public health. Item 32 is identical to Senate's item it tries based on
historical transfer in the first share enclosing four of the community.
The CDS says in the 2nd year. Item 33 is modified from the Senate and
governor's item. If the Senate have provided 6 million non-recurring

balance and the Senate then budget that 700 and 50 thousand dollars
savings to the public health's budget by adjusting those revenues the
house instead doesn't increase the fee quite as high increases the fee
from 75 dollars to 95 dollars and allows the counties to restrain the
full 20 dollar increase. Item 35 the autopsy fees is identical to the
Senate item 36 increasing the expansion funding for the public health
lab is identical to the Senate and the governor. Item 37 is modified to

those items. Moving on to the division of inner health. The item 38 is
identical to the Senate and the governor's so as item 39 of funding

elf etic association is a Senate item so as item 41 providing hospitals
beds is just budgeting the money that you have provided last year. Item

department to use that 9 million dollars to increase the number of three
raised beds but also to implement a two tiered payment system for the
three way contracts that will allow them to pray a higher rate for
patients who are assessed to have a higher equity need. Item 43 the the

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning Mr. Chair members of the committee, I am Joyce Jones, I am
a staff attorney in the Bill drafting division and I will be reviewing
with you, special provisions included in the house version of the
budget. The first provision is 12 8.1. It's Department flexibility to
achieve departmental priorities and enhanced physical oversight and
accountability. This is a governor's item that appeared in the senate.
It's modified, the house version now requires these real alignment in
any positions to be reflected in the authorized budget. That's the only
change from the senate item. 12 8.2 is Funding for non-profit
organizations, established competitive grants process, this was a senate
item that has been significantly modified, it differs from the senate
version and that it makes direct appropriations to the designated
non-profit organisations for the 13-14 fiscal year. It states the
general assembly intends to establish the competitive grants process for
14-15, it directs the secretary's office to develop  a plan to implement
this process and list the criteria that the department must consider in
developing and implementing the plan and it also gives the reporting
requirements and time frames for the completion of various phases
implementing this competitive grants process. We have a new item in the
house provisions regarding group homes which has been covered. It is a
provision which requires the secretary's office to provide temporary..</p>

Short term monthly payments to group homes. On behalf of residence

appropriated for that purpose. The health information technology special

your booklet. This first provision, 12B.1 is the NC Pre-K provision and
it has been modified. Basically, it adjusts the income eligibility to
130% of the Federal Poverty Level. Removes the language regarding other
risk factors. It also, towards the end of the provision, in sub sections
H and I, amends current statutory law that stagger the terms of the
initial new appointees to the Childcare Commission. And sets the

year and 610,817 for the 2014-15 fiscal year.  Moving on to Page 37,

House does not codify this language...that's the biggest change. Page 38
and 39, this is a new item in the House, the provision is revised duties
of state childcare fatality provision team, repeal task force. This
provision revises the duties of the state  team to allow a report to the
Governor/General Assembly regarding recommendations and it repeals the
child fatality task force and makes conforming statutory changes. And,
lastly, Page 40, this is a new item in the House. It's entitled A Family
for every Child, provision of foster care. This provision appropriates
funds for the adoption promotion fund and appropriates funds for the
Permanency Innovation Initiative Fund, for each year of the 2013-2015
fiscal biennium. It changes the name of the Special Children Adoption
Fund under GS108A-50.2 to the Adoption/Promotion Fund, it re-codifies
language under Article 1A of Chapter 131D. It creates a new part under
that particular article, Chapter, excuse me.  It creates a Permanency
Innovation Initiative Oversight Committee to be located administratively
in the General Assembly. It states the duties of the committee and
directs a report by September 15 of each year and it creates the
Permanency Innovation Initiative Fund to support permanency outcomes of

Moving on to the Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities
and Substance Abuse Services on page 54 of your packet. 12F.1 -
Establish Statewide Psychiatry Program. This provision has been modified
from what appeared in the senate. It now directs the department to
submit a plan a little earlier by August 15th of 2013 for a statewide
telepsychiatry program which is to be administered by East Carolina
Center for Telepsychiatry and Ebehavorial Health. It requires East
Carolina to report annually on specific performance measures related to
the program and it now appropriates money to the office of rural health
and community care to be used for the contract with ECU and to purchase
needed telepsychiatry equipment for the state facility under the
jurisdiction of the departments that participate in the program. You
recall that the senate version directed the department within the
Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance
Abuse Services to establish and implement this program. Turning to page
57. 12F.2 - Fund for Local Inpatient Psychiatric Beds or Bed Days. This
is modified boiler plate which has been changed slightly. In addition to
what appears in the senate version, the house version directs the
department to develop and implement a two-tiered system of payment for
purchasing these local inpatient psychiatric beds or bed days based on
acuity level. 12F.3, on page 59, Funds for the North Carolina Child
Treatment Program. This is identical to what appeared in the senate.
12F.4 - Single String Funding for Mental Health, Developmental
Disabilities and Substance Abuse Services on page 60. This identical to
what appeared in the senate and it’s also modified boiler plate. On page
61, this is a new house item. Behavioral Health Clinical Integration and
Performance Monitoring. This provision directs the department to require
LME-MCOs to implement clinical integration activities with CCNC through
its total care initiative. It also requires the LME-MCOs to submit
claims data to the CCNC informatics center and in turn the informatics
center will give the LME-MCOs and other eligible behavioral health
providers access to clinical data and care management information. The
department may expand or alter existing contracts by mutual agreement of
all parties in order to implement this action and the department must
also report to the oversight committee by March 1, 2014 and semiannually
thereafter on their progress outcomes and savings associated with
clinical integration activities with CCNC pursuant to this section. On
page 62. 12F.6 – LME-MCO Funds for Substance Abuse Services. This is
identical to what appeared in the senate and that completes the Division
of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Abuse
Services.</p>

<p id="035:00">
The Division of Health Service Regulation begins on page 63 and there is
only one special provision. It's 12G.2. Eliminate comprehensive report
on medication-related errors in nursing homes. This is an identical
provision to what appeared in the Senate. This is an agency request and
it's needed because federal funds available to fulfill this report have
expired. And Mr. Chair, that concludes my presentation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, Co-Chairs, Members of the Committee, I am
Ryan Blackledge with Bill Drafting. I'll be covering the Medicaid
provisions. A quick note before we get into them -- the Senate had
codified a lot of the boilerplate language. The versions here do not
codify the language, but in most instances the language is the same and
I'll be mentioning that as we go through. Starting on page 65, this is
very similar to what the Senate had in terms of the Department giving a
more detailed proposal back to the general assembly for Medicaid reform.
This, however, creates a Medicaid reform advisory group to participate
in that process and allow some public feedback. If you look over on page
66, starting at line 19, that's the new language that would create this
advisory group and you can see that there are appointments by the
Speaker of the House, present pro-tem and also appointments by the
governor. Turn to page 68. This is very similar to what the Senate had,
except there is an additional item. If you look at lines 21 through 22,
this was a suggestion from the Department that was included. This
version, however, deletes what was in position number five, which would
have allowed a state-planned amendment if it was necessary to continue
Federal financial participation for Medicaid. Additionally, this had
some boilerplate language that was uncodified on page 69 in subsection
C. Next on page 70, again this is a provision that uncodifies the
boilerplate language but the language itself is the same as what was in
the Senate. Turn to page 71. Again, this is very similar to language
that was in the Senate, but it's uncodified rather than codified. This
language, though, does include some clarifying suggestions from the
Department. Page 72. Accounting sharing and fraud recovery -- identical
language to what was in the Senate except that it's just not codified.
Over on page 73, the actual language is identical to what was in the
Senate. However, a good portion of it is no longer being codified. Page
75. It's the hundred dollar provider application [??] fee. Identical
language to what was in the Senate except it's not codified. Page 76.
Electronic transaction requirements for providers. This is identical
language to what was in the Senate except that it's not codified. Page
77. This is identical language to what was in the Senate, except over on
page 78 there's some boilerplate language that was not codified. Page
79. Medicaid eligibility. This also is identical language to what was in
the Senate except it's not codified, with the exception of a subsection
B that staff removed from the Senate version based on some feedback from
the Department. Turning to page 81. NC Health Choice, temporary rates,
Senate coverage. This is identical to what was in the Senate. Page 82 is
the modifications to the existing services. Steve Owen already discussed
the details but this is the special provision that follows all of those
money items and adjustments within the Medicaid program. Page 84 is a
new provision. This is entitled &quot;Additional Management Drug
Utilization&quot; and you can see there are two things that DHHS and
CCNC are directed to work on. One: Ensure better pharmacy management,
and two: Identify Medicaid recipients who are frequent users, and then
see if anything can be done to reduce the frequency in the use. Page 85
is very, very similar to the Senate provision except that there was a
subsection B in the Senate provision that would have changed the burden
of proof. Right now, for most cases, most admin law cases, the
petitioner has the burden of proof. The Senate...There's a provision in
law, though, that for the Department of Health and Human Services,
they're different from everyone else and have to carry the burden of
proof. The Senate repealed that difference in burden of proof. This
House provision takes out that repeal. Turn to page 89.</p>

provider performance bonds; again identical language to what was in the
Senate, it is just not codified.  On Page 90, this is the shared savings
plan with providers, as Steve mentioned the Senate had a 4% withhold,
this is a 2% withhold instead.  Additionally, the Senate began payments
January 1, 2015; this would direct the Department to begin payments no
later than June 30, 2014.  On Page 91 is the Hospital Provider
Assessments, the Senate had a percentage collection of 15.6% of the
assessments which was estimated to be about $50 million within the first
year, this version though, House version, just has a flat amount of $95
million and you can see online ??   that is a change from the existing
$43 million.  92 is some modification to rate methodologies and regional
rates, that is the same as what was in the Senate.  Page 93, this is
very similar to what was in the Senate except if you look at subsection
A, the Senate had a study being done by medical researchers, study of
CC&amp;C.  In the Senate version the Department was to hire them, in
this version the State Auditor is to hire those folks.  Over on Page 94,
this is transferring to CC&amp;C, the management of the per member per
month payments, this is identical to what was in the Senate.  Page 96,
this is boilerplate, identical to the Senate.  Page 97, boilerplate,
identical to the Senate.  98, boilerplate, identical to the Senate.
Page 99, some miscellaneous Medicaid provisions that are identical to
what was in the Senate.  Page 100 is new, it is a directive to CC&amp;C
and the Department to continue two programs.  One is A Plus Kids and two
is the adult safety with anti-psychotic prescribing initiative.  There
is one more provision that I do want to mention over on Page 101.  This
is a study to tell HHS Oversight to cite the issue of whether certified
nurse-midwives should be given more flexibility in the practice of
midwifery. One quick note, I just wanted to mention the ones that were
out, some of these were already mentioned in the money report
discussion.  There was the insurance premiums for pregnant women where
pregnant women from 133 to 185 were taken off of Medicaid and given a
premium to purchase on the exchange.  This was taken out of the House
version.
There was the additional personal care services for qualified
individuals.  It was based on a House bill, it has passed the House.
The Senate had included it
since it passed the House and in the Senate.  It has been taken out
here.  There was a modification to the Medicaid ?? statute that was also
a House bill.  The Senate had included it but it is a bill that has gone
through the House so the House has taken it up here.  Additionally
within the miscellaneous provisions, there was a reworking of the Board
of the North Carolina Institute of Medicine in Senate version.  This
House package does not include that provision.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Chair, Members of the Committee, it is Deborah Landry again. I'm
going to talk briefly about the block grants.  Most of the block grants
are identical to the Senate so I am only going to talk about those that
changed.  On Page 103-105 is the Social Services block grant.  As Susan
mentioned at the beginning of the presentation in the Committee Report,
the competitive block grant contains money for the non-profits.  Because
federal availability was reduced, the House has reduced non-profit
funding by slightly less than 8%; in doing so that freed up some federal
block grant money to put back into other areas that had been cut so for
the Social Services Block grant $800,000 less was needed for the
Competitive Block grant so those $800,000 were redistributed to the
lines in the Social Services Block grant that provide direct services.
So none of the admin dollars were put back in but the direct services
line were allocated across those items in the Social Services Block
grant.  On Page 107, the Maternal Child and Health Block grant, Line 11,
Health Promotion,
was returned to the Governor's position, that $1.3 million in the Senate
had gone to the Competitive Block grant.  After discussions with the
Department this was put back into the ??   Block grant at the Governor's
item and it was also not included in the Competitive Block grant.  Page
107, is the Maternal and Child Healthcare Block grant</p>

Lines 45 to 47. The Carolina pregnancy care was changed from $305,000 to
$205,000 and then a line was added fro the nurse family for 1.18 million
and I am sorry I skipped, Health promotion was in the competitive block
grand and now it's back to the governor's position at $89,000. That
concludes my report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee, we initially said that we were discussing a
question later on this afternoon however we still have about 15-20
minutes still left for committee time this morning so let's go and open
up for discussion, questions and amendments would still be held till
this afternoon.
Representative Insko.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Just on this last presentation the $800,000 cut
that was the matching funds. Is that right? The funds required for
matching federal dollars.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The $800,000 were SSVG funds and the senate budget, they use that money
in the competitive block ground process.And in the house budget, we use
some SSVG funds for the competitive block ground. We used 3 millions
instead of 3.8. The $800,000 was redistributed through those social
services block ground to items that provide direct services. So for
example, the County department social services received increase over
the senate budget. The child protective services, state in home
services, adult protective services, everything in the social services
block ground that is a direct service was provided additional funds in
the house budget over what the senate put out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That was partially due to sequestration and I'm really off on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative  ??, you asking about reduction in federal block ground
funds? Sequestration has not been taken into consideration in most of
this block grounds at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Lambeth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Two questions. I understand that Senator Hise
may have changed the autopsy fee and I think when you do see it did
occur not. Fee change in autopsy is that I do understand that it was
changed from $1500 from $1250 so we just need to follow that up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Someone from the staff wants to address that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative, the autopsy fee remains that what it was in the senate
budget at 1250.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Second question or observation. The provider assessment when that was
put in here I guess, a couple of sessions ago, that was thought to be a
temporary funding source to fill that gap between cost and reimbursement
and you got federal approval. I do worry about the growing dependency on
that by the state and then those funds being eliminated some point in
the future totally. You are increasing it and becoming more dependent on
it and then the feds eliminate that program then there is a big hole
that you are going to have to recover at some point. I don't know if
there is any updates on the assessment program feedback on feds as they
balance their budget try to shrink the deficit or that might be their
priorities of reduction and you may just not know anything about it at
this moment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, are you making a comment or asking a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess this is a question about if you heard anything from the feds
about the changes on the federal level in this assessment program.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Anyone in the staff wants to comment whether there are any updates on
that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The last information we have is what's still being contemplated is the
stage reduction down to 3.5 percent, the hospitals at this point even
with this change will still be below 3.5. We have heard no further, no
updates.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Martin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. I would like more information on provision 56 on
page D10 about the prescription drugs. if someone could explain that a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's still ?? for research.  What this reduction does is it converts
current payment methodologies for</p>

...product cost or the drug cost from using national indexes, a ? of
those national indexes, and a state maximum allowable cost to an average
acquisition or invoice cost, which would be determined through surveys
with the pharmacies.  It also introduces a new dispensing fee which
would go from the current three dollars for brand drugs and then a
tiered for generics to a, basically, a two dispensing fee item where on
average the two would average out to $9.87 with a two-dollar incentive,
if you will, for dispensing of generics and those on the preferred drug
list.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Insko.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  I have, I think, three questions.  One is on page 100 on
line eight it talks about prior authorization policy for off-label
anti-psychotic and safety monitoring.  How is that different from what
the Senate did?  It's new, but the Senate had...the Senate did prior
authorization for all anti-psychotic drugs, didn't they?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Senate did include a prior authorization for all mental health
drugs.  This is a replacement for that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you.  Second question.  On the provider...the page 75, which
is the provider application charging $100.00.  I don't think I
understand the rationale for this.  I'm concerned that this will be
a...will provide a disincentive for providers to enroll in Medicaid.  We
really want to keep our providers willing to serve Medicaid patients.  I
know that some of the specialties practices are Medicaid providers but
they never provide services.  So, if I could just get a little more
information for the rationale behind that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a little bit of background information.  That fee was first
authorized in the 2009 budget and has been charged since September 1st,
2009.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Thank you.  And on page 63, eliminating the comprehensive report
on medication related errors.  I understand that we don't have the money
to do that anymore, but what I'm concerned about is losing the
information.  You may not be able to get this to me today, but I'd like
to have some information on the course of medication errors in nursing
homes.  If we can see whether that reporting... if we use that reporting
to do anything.  I guess it's the rate of medication errors or the
number of medication errors that are coming through by year.  If I could
get the last three or four years, it would be a help.
And I have a question about the assessments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Did you want them to comment on that?  Did you want staff to comment on
that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, if they could, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Insko, I will say that this provision simply eliminates
the requirement that the department pull this report together for
through the use of a contracted entity, but it doesn't eliminate the
requirement that the nursing home keep this information.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a question about the assessments.  We... well, there's a
provision here that provides a state savings from an assessment that we
did previously.  So when we first did assessments, most of them, they,
the assessments, were used to increase provider rates, provider
reimbursement.  Across the board.  The state didn't take anything if I
remember correctly.  And so I'm wondering now if the state is sharing,
if there's a sharing of all the provider rates that we do or if it's
just specific ones.  And tell me if I'm remembering that incorrectly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead, Mr. Owens.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Insko, when assessments were first introduced for nursing
homes, and I.C.F. ??, 100% of the assessment went into the rates.  When
this assessment was put into place in 2011, basically what was done with
the hospitals was they proposed at that time 43 million dollars would be
retained by the state as retention.  At the same time ... [AUDIO ENDS]</p>

<p id="055:00">
Nursing homes were also increasing their assessment up to the maximum
amount.  So for the last half of percent, the nursing homes, when they
increased their rate from 5.5 percent to up to 6 percent of up to the
cap, the state retained up to two thirds of that increase on the nursing
homes.
[Speaker Change}
Thank you.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Earle.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you.  My question is concerning the ADAP program on the money
report G-6, number 33.  It’s basically taking $8 million out and I know
the Senate had put money in.  My question is, I am looking at the write
up, and it is saying, and am I understanding, that it’s going to be $5
million additional left after, overage after the $8 million, and is that
going to serve all of the approximately 7000 people that are being
served now. And is that at 125 percent of poverty or is it at 300
percent of poverty.  I know that is a lot of questions, but if you could
just give me a little bit of background.
[Speaker Change]
Alright, thank you.  Ms. Thomas.
[Speaker Change]
Yes Mr. Chair.  Representative Earle, even after this cut, the program
will have $5 million more to spend next year than the current year, and
they are currently serving everyone on the program.  There is no wait
list and they are serving everyone up to the 300 percent.  And so, they
will have adequate funding next year.  In addition there are people this
year who are on the inclusive health high risk insurance plan that will
continue to be served through December 31.  And then the expectation is
that ACA will kick in on January 1, so a lot of the persons who are on
the program now will be able to get coverage through the exchange.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Farmer-Butterfield
[Speaker Change]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  For purposes of transparency, I want to say that
I work for a non-profit corporation and indeed that non-profit
corporation contracts with Social Services.  But on page 104, where the
DHH gets funding for non-profits was reduced ?? at Social Services for
direct services, I just want to raise the issue that it is important to
know that when you do these cuts, when you cut non-profits you’re also
cutting direct services as well. I think it’s important for this
committee to know.
[Speaker Change]
Okay. Thank you.  Ms. Landry did you want, does anybody want to comment
on that.
[Speaker Change]
??
[Speaker Change]
Did you have a question at all, or just want to make a comment?
[Speaker Change]
??
[Speaker Change]
Okay, thank you.  Representative Avila.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  I think I would like to make a comment here,
because when these cuts happen, we get skewered for it, and it’s not our
cut.  These are passed through federal dollars that we have no control
over, how much or how little they send us.  So the state is not being
heartless, and we are not trying to put people on the street and not
give them services.  This requirement is coming because the cut comes
before we ever get the money. Thank you.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Lambeth.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  This may be a question for information that we
could use this afternoon, because I would be interested in line 70.  The
rate freezes for services subject to automatic increases, page G-13.
Could we get a breakdown, you know there is a dollar decrease there,
that represents the freezing of the rates.  I am particularly concerned
within those areas for hospice, because that’s an industry that really
is fragile.  And if it wasn’t for the golf tournaments and the United
Way contributions and some of other things, some of the hospices
wouldn’t survive.  I’d really be interested in knowing if we pulled that
out, and we did allow an increase in hospice. How much that would add
back?  I guess that is my question.  That’s something you could get for
this afternoon.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. Owen, do you want to comment now?
[Speaker Change]
Sure. Representative, actually this reduction specifically excludes
hospice, federal qualified health centers, all the mandated rates that
Medicaid has to pay, as well as nursing home case mix and then your Part
D, Part D premiums.
[Speaker Change]
Follow up. So that ?? solves that problem.  Thank you.

Member of, this my question about this issue has, the fact that it's
being administered, it's located administratively in the general
assembly. And so, are there other programs that the general assembly
administers? Isn't that a little, who's gonna do that? Who's gonna do
that?
[Speaker Change]
Lisa Wilkes for bill draft. And Representative Insco I believe it's
gonna be housed at the general assembly so that if the committee needs
access to staff and things of that nature, that it will come through the
legislative services commission. So it's for the purpose of being able
to facilitate the administrative needs of the committee, once it's
instituted.
[Speaker Change]
Follow-up. So this is like a study commission, only instead of being in
response to a study bill, it's a permanent committee. I mean do we have
anything else that's like this? We do, OK, thanks I'll get that later.
[Speaker Change]
Any other questions at this time? OK if not we will continue with
questions, and any amendments. And if you would please get amendments to
the chairs as soon as you can. We'll go into recess and reconvene 15
minutes after the house session, thank you. And also please take your
documents with you, and be sure to bring them back with you. OK we call
this meeting to order. We'll continue our meeting from this morning and
we'll go over discussion first. Representative Avila.
[Speaker Change]
I'm sorry. I thought you were gonna bring me an amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Hold on, we'll hold on for amendments for a minute.
[Speaker Change]
OK.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Insco.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Chairman I have just a couple of other questions. One has
to do with the, I think its page 90. That has on line 3 there's a
comment there at the beginning. The Department of Health and Human
Services shall consult with providers affected by subdivision B. So
what, what does that mean consult? Do you know how extensive that's
gonna be? Whether it's gonna be an advise and consent? Or an inform? Or
whether there's gonna be some kind of collaborative arrangement? Page
90.
[Speaker Change]
Hold on just a minute Representative. I think several of us were getting
alarms on our cellphones that there's a flash flood in the area. So
everybody keep your feet up. OK and the staff wanna answer that.
[Speaker Change]
?? and answer your question that the intent here is the department would
work with those providers in the development of the shared savings
plans. The specifics of how it would be implemented and what the
indicators and measures that would be used for the paybacks.
[Speaker Change]
So it's kind of a negations process?
[Speaker Change]
I don't think it was intended to be a negotiation. It was really work
together ??.
[Speaker Change]
I agree. I have a couple of other questions.
[Speaker Change]
Kay go right ahead.
[Speaker Change]
On page 82 of the bill, section 12h.13.E. This has to do with the 10%
rate reduction and that's associated with the assessments. And my
question has to do whether or not that would require a Medicaid spa
amendment. And if it does require a Medicaid spa amendment is that
covered under the allowable spa amendments?</p>

Explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This amendment has been introduced at the
request of Representative Blackwell. The area up in Morganton has been
hit pretty hard with some closures. One of those being the Bunken
Correctional Facility. Plus the fact that if we eliminate the Morganton
area all the burden then would fall on the one in Bunken County and
that's a fairly significant corner of the state. I would ask for your
support on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
There's no impact on the budget?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Chairman. No. They'll still follow the direction that they analyze
for the lowest use and do the closures based on that. All the savings
still should be recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Any further discussion on the amendment. If not, all those in favor of
the amendment say aye. Those opposed say no. The ayes have it, the
amendment is adopted. Next amendment S402-LU-11V1. Does everyone have a
copy? Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is just to rearrange, reallocate some
funding that was given in excess of what was actually the request. It
was $375,000 for the ACU High-Risk Maternity Clinic and we're taking it
down to $325,000, which will give us a $50,000 reallocation. With $5,000
of that going to the 17P program and then the balance going into the
state sleep campaign. I would appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Any questions on the amendment? If not, all those in favor of the

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Wait just a minute, Representative Fulghum. Representative Fulghum.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is a amendment to delay the effect of
implementation of this portion of the revision of the ?? County Task
Force Team language on page 38 and 39, up til July 1st, 2014. This is
simply to allow us to look at this, this is purely policy without
physical impact. Try to figure out if there is any problem with the
organization that can be fixed by the appropriate legislation. But, this
as it stands now would delete ?? County Task Force as it is and I think
that we can delay that until we can examine the situation better. I move
for the adoption.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Any comments on the amendment. Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I agree in the substance of the amendment. I
feel like the change really needs to have some additional study and I
feel like a year would give us a chance to look at the functions and
objectives of the child fatality task force. Because, many of you know,
most of our task force groups do end at some point in time and this is
one that has become a permanent fixture</p>

amendment is S-402-AME-26, B-4. Representative Insko is recognized.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  This amendment actually will expand the
Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act and do it effective
along with the roll out in 2014.  First of all, let me say that other
states are still making this decision.  So it's in no way too late to
make this decision and would not be for some time.  So I think we have
plenty of time.  All the Institute of Medicine studies have been done. I
think all the preparation work has been done.  I know we had the audit
on Medicaid and those issues have been addressed. So I think there's no
reason for us not to go ahead and expand Medicaid at this time. There
are several reasons why we really ought to do this.  You've heard all of
the ones about how it would cover 500,000 additional low income students
and the federal government would pay for it. 100% for the first three
years. Federal portion never falls below 90%. It would be, for the first
8 years, there would actually be an economic gain to the state.  It's
also a jobs bill. But there are some bad things that will happen because
we're not going to do it, or because we have not done it so far.  And I
hope you would vote to do it now and avoid these problems.  Employers
and small businesses will actually probably incur penalties if we don't
extend Medicaid, because many of their employees would qualify for
Medicaid.  If we don't extend Medicaid they'll be required to buy health
insurance on the exchange, and if they don't do that they will be
require to pay a fee, a fine. Many people will choose to pay that tax
assessment, but it will be a penalty against our small businesses and
our low income workers which we don't need right now. It'll be an impact
on our hospitals.  The disproportionate share money is going down. Our
rural hospitals especially are really very close to the break even
point. Many are losing money already. This would further put them in
jeopardy.  I think it's going to be very difficult for our rural
hospitals if we don't expand Medicaid. Then every year that we don't
expand Medicaid, our tax dollars, this is our money that we want to have
come back to our state to pay for this.  We're paying for this program
through our tax dollars. North Carolinians ought to be getting their
fair share of the tax dollars back in North Carolina and not be paying
for others. Plus the first years that non-covered people come onto
health insurance of any kind, but our experience with Medicaid is that
when you take a new group in, the first few years, the first 18 months
actually, they actually cost more than the average Medicaid patient
because they're sicker than the average Medicaid patient. So the longer
we delay bringing this group in, the more expensive it's going to be for
the state. It would be to our advantage to do that. So the bill itself,
line 4-6 just cover the change in the bill title.  Line 7-10 actually
are the Medicaid expansion.  Then, on line 16-25</p>

<p id="085:00">
This is some of the money that we would save that we're currently now
paying for out of other funds. So the first year we would actually save
14 million, the second year 28 million for our ADEP program. And then
for our mental health program we would pay, we would save $8 million the
first year and 16 the second year because those people would be covered
with Medicaid funding. On the backside this appropriates that money into
a community services for mental health patients. This is community
service funds so it'll cover mental health developmental disabilities
and substance abuse services. But over the past few years we have
actually cut $80 million out of our state funds for this program. In
2011 we had a cut of $20 million that was non-recurring that was
repeated in 2011, that didn't get replaced. So in this budget right here
before us we have a $20 million cut in our community based services for
our local management entities to pay for services for the people with
mental illness, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse
services. We are under serving that population and have been. We did it
under the Democratic administration and I hope that we will not continue
to do it as we go forward. Whoever is in the majority, but we really do
need this money in our mental health services. So I would appreciate
your positive vote on this amendment, and I move for its adoption.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. Blackpledge did you wanna comment on this please?
[Speaker Change]
Just to walk through some of the technical issues to make sure everyone
can see where moneys flowing and what not. As Representative Insco
explained it does expand the Medicaid up to 133%. You'll note online 11,
this is contrary to session law 2013-5 when the general assembly said
that the state would not expand, that's why there's the repeal of that
section there, online 11. The expansion then frees up some money because
some folks would then gonna be covered under Medicaid that are currently
being served through other means. So if you'll look likes 16 through 23
there's some savings to the age drug assistance program. Next on lines
27, 31, and going over to the next page there's some savings to mental
health. Now these savings are then used, a portion of it is put back
into community services funding. This was actually an item that was a
non-recurring cut from last year. And Denise can correct me if I'm
incorrect. But my understanding is that it wasn't put back into the
budget, and then also the money goes to pay for the administrative cost
even though 100% of the service cost are gonna be paid by federal
government for this. There is about 10 million in the first year, 14
million the second year admin cost with the 50/50 federal match that we
have to cover. And that's the remaining funds that are taking care of
lines 9 through 17 on the second page.
[Speaker Change]
'Kay Thank you. Representative Avila.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Members I would ask that we not vote in favor of
this and there are a number of reasons. First and foremost I think it
has been the sense of the entire government through the three branches
of the Governor and both branches of the legislature that it is not in
the best interest of our state to begin to move in to expanding a
program that we have no control over. And one of the things that we owe
to the citizens of this state is stability in their services. And to say
that we're gonna take three years at 100% and then we might end it is
not a certainty that I am willing to put out there for them to live with
for the next three years. I think the direction that we've headed in to
try to spend as carefully and as critically, and targeted as we have for
the needs of this state it will show people the direction that we're
heading in, and it is not to expand. We have some of these effects are
gonna be taken care of, we have a amount of money for the woodworking
effect which is gonna take care of some people that haven't been on
assistance that they were entitled to, or eligible for. As well as the
fact that this proportion is shared for the hospitals is not really an
issue because of the fact that we're still under that 3% where the cut
is coming from 6 to 3. So I feel like it's an irrational move on our
part to expand something that is putting us in the whole every year. And
would ask that you vote against this amendment, thank you.
[Speaker Change]
Any other discussion? Representative Farmer-Butterfield.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Chair. I wanna speak in favor of the amendment. I think
it's a way to generate additional funding that's desperately needed in
several areas.</p>

this is a good attempt to try to slide something in while we’re maybe

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I believe this one would qualify as a technical
report in the typing.  It was simply put 4% where it should have been 3
and I ask your support of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Insko.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I want to make sure I understand this, page 28.  So is there any
evidence that the Departments can actually do this?  That they’re not
going to have to cut into, well they have to do their administration.
And I understand wanting to keep the administrative costs low I agree
with that. I just don’t want to put the local counties in a position
where they’re going to be falling behind on the required reports.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would staff like to respond?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Insko, this actually follows the money, there’s on the
Committee Report page G2 there’s a reduction in the county services
report from 4% to 3% in child care allocations. And this just corrects
the special provisions, special provision inadvertently had 4% instead
of the 3% that would follow the money.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So this is a cut.  What is it now? What is the administrative part now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m sorry, right now they get 4% of their subsidized child care
allocation they can spend on administration.  This would go to 3%. The
money report already shows the cut in the money report, Item 11 on G2.
This just corrects the special provision.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I understand that.  My question is just, I didn’t ask this question
earlier because I just didn’t see this. But there’s no evidenced that
this is going to create any burdens on the department’s ability to meet
all their requirements?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This reduction is being taken because the Seek system is coming online
and the department reports that this will reduce manual processes at the
local county department of social services.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Other questions or comments on the amendment? If not, all those in favor
say aye
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.

Thank you, Mr. Chair.  Members of the Committee, I went around and

little bit, this is a service that’s offered in our community
rehabilitation programs that really include two areas. Some that fall

And some that are the adult developmental vocational program which gets
its funding through the local management entities. This program is
essentially providing some type of work environment for our more
severely disabled adults who are typically mental, mental retardation or
brain injury. I think the IQ has to be below seventy. And they come in,
and they spend a full day working at these facilities, and the
vocational rehab part of this community program, they learn skills for
the less severely disabled citizens to actually join the work force.
This is a, a highly utilized program, we have a waiting list in Wilson
County and around the state for these programs and it's a very effective
use of our funds because it allows for the other family members to do
work during the day so it's like a place where these people can go and
be productive and become more a part of society. As we are moving them
more into the community, I think we need to, to push for more funding
for this program, and get these folks off the waiting list. This is not,
the amendment does not provide what we actually need, but it would
provide for about forty more people to get off the waiting list and get
into this program, and hopefully we can talk to the ?? about possibly
prioritizing this. The funding for it comes from elimination of vacant
positions from wherever the department chooses, so it's not cutting any
services, so we're taking away vacant positions and moving this into
services in our community, and I urge your support.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fulghum.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman. This amendment is to delete language that
changes the existing state health Medicaid plan by restricting the
ability of the hospitals to use totally federal funds to supplement
faculty salaries at their medical schools, these are state medical
schools, in this case, East Carolina University, Brody School of
Medicine and UNC School of Medicine. I've talked with all the parties
here and have a better understanding of this, this upper payment limit
as it is described, which it gives a supplemental amount for Medicare,
Medicaid treatment to these hospital based practices in these medical
schools that allow these professors who have a substantial majority of
their time spent in their teaching positions. In most of these of these
cases, these is based at the medical school itself, and it's exactly
what the current amendment to this state plan that I'm objecting to
addresses. What it doesn't address are the off premises faculty who go
out into the community, in this case rural North Carolina, area health
care education centers and such and carry out their functions. These
would be the people be affected by this reduction, and their subsidized
salaries which in most cases, actually all cases, are actually losing
money anyway through the faculty benefit plans. Actually, faculty salary
plans, rather. So I would move that we delete this language, in this
case saving, for example UNC thirty one million dollars of federal money
and ECU School of Medicine sixteen million dollars. I just think this is
not the right thing to do. I advocate the support of this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman, and while I appreciate Dr. Fulghum's
argument, there is another side to this, and it's reason why I am

language does if we put it back in will allow doctors, whether it’s all
doctors or a special class of doctors, in any facility that is connected
within the university system hospitals or ECUs hospitals to receive the
full commercial reimbursement rate on Medicaid which none of your county
hospital physicians can be allowed to do.  In my estimation it is more a
question of fairness than it is as much of anything else.  These
physicians in the university system teaching facilities, I think make
very good salaries and then they practice as well.  I think that it is a
bad move to be able to give benefits to one hospital over another
hospital when the times are so tight and it can’t be passed out for
everybody to be able to take advantage of those types of reimbursements.
 If the staff would give a more technical interpretation I would
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Steve Owen.  What this prevision is intended to do is
to limit that commercial base reimbursement to those physicians that are
primarily in the teaching positions.  We would basically remove that
provision for those physicians that may become part of the practice plan
which are not necessarily spending the majority of their time teaching.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Follow-up Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The current language in the state plan and I’ll just
read you a paragraph which I think we ought to comply with and they do
comply with.  Except for professional providers in hospital based group
practices in which this case would include pathologists, emergency room
physicians, and the physicians employed in the hospital like
anesthesiologists to state these are totally hospital based physicians.
Except for these eligible medical professional providers shall exclude
any professional providers and member of group practice required or
assimilated by the hospitals. In this case ECU or UNC after July 1,
2010.  So this would exclude the group Representative Avila is concerned
about as being non-competitive.  These are not faculty teaching
positions.  The folks that are not in that case would not be affected by
this and would not be covered by the supplemental salary situation.
We’re talking about people who spend their time teaching residents and
have a primary focus of their practice doing that.  These are not the
physicians that come into the hospital, practice and then they go back
out into the private community.  I would disagree that the salaries
schedule most or any primarily university based in this case to be state
support university or competitive with the private physicians.  I just
don’t think that salary data will show that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mr. Chairman.  I guess the fact that our
university hospitals receive a lot of breaks because they are university
hospitals is one of the reasons that I feel they are not going to be
hurting in terms of cutting their physicians’ salaries to the point that
they won’t be willing to stay at the teaching hospital.  It’s an
advantage our university hospitals have in a number of ways both in
federal breaks as well as state breaks.  We’ve got rural hospitals that
are hanging on by the skin of their teeth and I just feel we need to
more or less level the field out there where people are having to
practice their profession.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. Chairman I’d like to point out we’re not talking
about hospitals reimbursements.  We’re talking about the differential
called the upper payment limit affecting professional salaries.  These
are not the hospital portions of that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Martin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I have a question for staff and then a comment.  This
money, this does not affect the state funds at all?  This money is
coming from federal dollars and is not impacting the budget.  Is that
correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The state portion of this funding comes from
inter-governmental transfer from the facility from the institution side.
 There is no state dollar here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you.  I would like to speak in support of this
amendment because I think with all the changes going on we are facing a
very significant physician shortage and provider shortage and we need to
make sure we are supporting our medical schools and that we are
encouraging doctors to be there and train our next generation because
maybe you all are going to have healthcare on paper but if you don’t
have</p>

think, though, because this is Federal money, we ought to take advantage
of that.  There are other ways that we probably ought to look at to deal
with the fairness issue, because we do provide lots of subsidies to the
UNC system.  I think we ought to take advantage of the Federal money,
since that money is available.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion? Representative Brisson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Dr. Fulton [??] did the question.  What's the
present salaries--I mean--what kind of base--salary base--are [??]folks
getting in [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I cannot answer that accurately.  I can only guess, and that's not
really fair to do that.  In my experience, having been in the field 35
years, faculty physicians versus private practice probably in the 50% of
what the private practice people get.  I would guess it [??] pretty
close.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess  since, and I don't really understand--you know--the folks that
we're trying to affect is--the teaching the programs; is that what--is
this where you're going and is that part-time student teaching, or what
is it?  These [sic] full-time employees, by the universities?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, Mr. Chairman. Yes sir.  These are faculty appointments.
These are full-time faculty appointments that their primary goal--their
primary job--a substantial amount is what the state plan refers to
teaching residents and other physicians.  So, they are appointed by the
medical--state supported--medical schools in this case.  And, they're
not part-time; they are people who have a job teaching.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I certainly understand that--and I know we got [sic] a lot of folks
[laughter] in this state today that would love to have a pay raise.
There's probably about 700,000 state employees that would love to have
one.  And, you know as well as I know whether we're spending the Fed's
money or the state's  money, it's--it's still tax dollars.  I'm not sure
that I can--right now I don't feel very comfortable with supporting it,
unless we can--you know--[crosstalk]  [??] help some of the other folks
out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, could I ask--attempt to ask--your Representative Brisson's
question? [crosstalk]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative [??]Foushee?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think this refers to an existing contractual situation where these
people are hired based on--for example--UNC a 31 million dollar salary
supplement preventing the state actually from having to pay these
people.  In the case of ECU, 16 million dollars.  And, I've been told by
both groups--I didn't have this term myself--they said it would bankrupt
their  faculty payment plans at both state-supported universities.  And
I--those are terms that I've been told by both groups.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Farmer-Butterfield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I am asking that this amendment be supported.  It is critical in eastern
North Carolina that we have these funds to keep people in place.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.  Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I may--Representative Lambeth--may I ask you a question?  If you're a
non-university affiliated hospital, and you have a physician that has to
make a decision between your non-university affiliated hospital and a
university-affiliated hospital that has this increase in pay, where's he
gonna [sic] go?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah--there are lots of variables.  And, it would depend on the
specialty to some degree, it would depend on the patient load--the
challenge within that patient load--so there--I'm not sure there's a
simple answer to that question.  Just like there's probably not a simple
answer to the compensation question because it varies so much across the
state, depending on the market and depending on the--the site that
you're at--if it's academic or non-academic. [end of data]</p>

Any other discussion or comments?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Brisson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you Mr. Chair.  Members of the Committee the
problems I'm having throughout the budget I don't think you're gonna
find any pay raises for any folks, all the other folks that we're
working with with this budget and I just hate to pick out this little
group and move that way.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative iii.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you.  I just want to point out that this is
not a pay raise but this is a significant cut that puts our university
system and physician training at risk.  These doctors are getting this
extra money because they are trainees, as well as residents alongside
them and doing on-the-job training portion of the medical school, which
is years of residency training and I think they're needed in that role
and if we ask them to see just as many patients as a private physician,
they're not going to be training our new doctors, and we're not talking
about a pay raise here we're talking about taking this away and putting
our university system at risk.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Okay.  All those in favor of the amendment say aye.
Those opposed.  It appears that the ayes have it.  The amendment passes.
 Next amendment is S402-ANG-18V1.  Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you Mr. Chairman.  This amendment, as well as
in the technical nature it refers to the tiered state county specialist
assistants pilot and the adjustment here is just gonna make the timing
work in such a way that everything will fall into place and the staff
can give a more technical answer to my explanation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Avila, the change really deals with
how the pilot is to operate and we've added language which directs the
department to insure that it operates in a manner that complies with any
agreements that are in place with the federal government.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Any other comments on the amendment?  Not.  Those in
favor of the amendment say aye.  Those opposed say no.  The ayes have
it.  The amendment is adopted.  Any further comments? Questions?
Representative Insko.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Well, I'd like to make a comment on, we don't have a
motion but I really do appreciate the improvements that have been made
in this Bill.  There is significant improvements over what we had in the
Senate but we have still some omissions that I think are critical to the
health and welfare of our citizens.  I'll find my notes here I'll...Let
me just comment on the ones I can remember easily.  I'm very concerned
that we're not paying attention to the needs of our vulnerable citizens
with mental health and developmental disabilities and substance
addiction disease, and also with our traumatic brain injury patients,
the veterans that come back.  We have been under-funding those programs
for many years and to make additional cuts in those programs I think
really is not acceptable.  We have got to make that</p>

[xx] priority i think that theres a provision in here that freezes our
physician rates, I think thats ill advised as we grow into the
affordable care act. One of the things about North Carolina that makes
it very special is that we have most of our primary care doctors and
many of our specilty doctors seeing medicaid patients, that is unlike
most other states. During my first session here in 1997 we paid
providers 103% of medicare, so thats one way, when we go to other states
and we tell other states how many of our primary care physicians are in
our medicade program, they are amazed, they want to know how we do it,
and since then every year our payment rate has fallen. I think now we
are somewhere between 83% and 95% of medicare based on the specialty,
and if we continue to freeze our increases to our providers, especially
during the time when the affordable care act is going on, we're going to
continue top lose physicians and that will destroy, really undermine a
really critical program we have. There are other examples I think
through here, some other cuts that will effect our low income patients.
Over the past 30 years, we've seen a constant eroding of the buying
power of our working class families, sometimes we talk about our
government programs like food stamps and medicare, medicaid, as if we
are making our citizens dependent, and that their weak, and if we would
just get rid of those programs somehow they would get stronger, but our
public policies are one of the reasons their poor, so I think that there
are some provisions in here that will continue the undermining of our
low income families, and for that reason I'll be a no vote on this
issue.
