  <p id="05:00">
  Discussions. I&#39;d like address the question asked by one of my
colleagues during a finance meeting the other day. He said, when is a
tax decrease a bad idea? When is a tax increase, I mean decrease, a bad
idea? And no question, or should I say no answer was forthcoming as to
when a tax decrease is a bad idea, but over the course of this week, I
guess some people have had an answer to that, or suggested an answer to
that, that a tax decrease is a bad idea when it is used to mask a tax
increase. Now, I&#39;m not suggesting that that is what is being done
here, but I do know that that sentiment has also been expressed,
expressed in some of the media out there. Like in the Fayetteville
Observer, they had the heading, is this a spoon full of sugar to help
the medicine go down? So what causes our folks to think like that? Well,
I&#39;d like to draw your attention to the first slide on the dashboard.
Okay. Okay? Let&#39;s see, trying to make sure everybody&#39;s on the
same spot. Okay, there&#39;s a diagram there that shows the total
revenues that will be generated as a result of passing Senate bill 20
between the fiscal years 2016 and 2019. It&#39;s almost $1.2 billion in
tax revenues that will be generated by increasing the motor fuels tax.
Now most of, my constituents look at that and they say, well, yes
we&#39;re gonna be bringing in more revenues, but the way we&#39;re
doing that is by increasing the motor fuels tax. And I do know that it
has been stated that what we&#39;re gonna be doing is we&#39;re gonna be
cutting taxes, as a matter of fact, I think I&#39;ve heard we&#39;re
gonna cut, and then eventually we&#39;re going to stabilize. I think
there&#39;s another factor that&#39;s been thrown in there but not quite
sure what the three factors are, but I would say it looks, seems more
like we&#39;re gonna cut jobs, then we&#39;re gonna cut taxes,
temporarily, then we&#39;re gonna increase the motor fuels tax, and then
after that then maybe we&#39;ll stabilize the formula and make sure that
we fund transportation parties, projects. Now, it is not my desire to
have any transportation projects pulled off the books. I understand that
we need to raise revenues in order to take care the business of the
state in terms of meeting transportation needs, in terms of the
highways, the bridges, et cetera, et cetera. But I guess I&#39;m
concerned about the way we&#39;re going about this process and the
message we&#39;re sending to the people. Could you go to slide two,
please? Okay, so slide two actually shows what&#39;s going on in terms
of the motor fuels tax. We currently have a law in place and under that
law, the motor fuels tax would go to about maybe a little under 30 cents
a gallon, effective 1, July this year. Now, we also know that Senate
bill 20 proposes to cut tax based on the current rate of motor fuels
tax, which is 37 cents a gallon, so they wanna take it down to, Senate
bill 20 proposes to take it down to 35 cents a gallon. But let me show
you another chart that makes it even clearer, because what this chart
does is shows is hey, over time we&#39;re certainly gonna be increasing
the motor fuels tax that our citizens will have to pay over the next
four or five years compared to what we would do if we left well enough
alone. So could I get the third slide? Okay. Okay, now in the center
what you see here, let me put on my little glasses so I can see as well.
Okay, shows under current law what&#39;s gonna happen to the motor fuels
tax this year if we do nothing. Currently is indicated as set at 37.5
cents a gallon, and it will stay that way until the end of June. Now
under current law, beginning in let&#39;s see, July, it would go to
approximately 30 cents per gallon and it would be there for the next six
months. Okay, so to me I think most of my constituents would say, well,
that looks like a motor fuels tax cut already in the making that
we&#39;re gonna have for the second half of the year. Now, what happens
under Senate bill 20? Okay, under Senate bill 20, we would have for the
next two months, it would stay at 37.5 cents per gallon, but effective
March, we&#39;d go to 35 cents a gallon, which based on the current tax

  <p id="10:00">
  right now, yes that would be a tax cut. That&#39;s why I represented
that 35 cents/gallon in green. But also under Senate Bill 20, we see
what happens in July relative to the current law is that 35 cents/gallon
tax would actually be higher. So that&#39;s why some folks say,
&quot;Oh, well we&#39;re going to cut taxes to turn around and then
increase them.&quot; They&#39;re speaking of relative to what would
happen with the current law. Folks, see that is the problem, that is the
concern I have. Certainly I agree with the need, if we have to, to raise
the taxes as indicated in that first slide if it is truly necessary. But
I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve explained it to our citizens in enough
detail why raising those revenues or those taxes is needed in order to
maintain the transportation infrastructure of our state. It&#39;s for
that reason that I will be voting against this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin yield for a question, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin, do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin, is there any way we can carve out Cumberland County?
Because I sure don&#39;t want them to be hurt by this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;ll put my best man on it, Senator. I don&#39;t know whether we can
or we can&#39;t but I will put my best man on it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let&#39;s see if we can do that because I&#39;ve never heard the back
aisle complain so much about taxes being dropped. It&#39;s just amazing
to me. It&#39;s a new concept but it&#39;s something I&#39;m really
enjoying hearing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Meredith, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a question for Senator Rabin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin, do you yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin, I appreciate Senator Apodaca&#39;s suggestion but, based
on me representing Cumberland County, I do not, I repeat, I do not want
$14M dollars worth of projects, which are going to create jobs for our
community, which are going to improve the infrastructure, to be carved
out. So I appreciate your point, Senator Apodaca, but I do not, I want
to repeat that, want $14M, $14M dollars taken out of my community. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator, and I will ask my best man to stand at ease.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Smith, thank you you very-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I rise to speak against the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There are many things that I find wrong with this bill, but just to keep
it simple I want to bring to your attention the fact, my colleague just
talked about the jobs that it would create, but I want to highlight
today on this floor is the fact that 500 jobs from the Department of
Transportation, hardworking state employees, will be cut, and it only
saves $6M dollars. Now, I listened yesterday to the debate and I know
that there is some give and take. There are some pros and cons with
every deal but I think we as constituents, we as those who are
representing our constituents who are not here to speak the floor, we
have to look at the impact that it will have on them. I understand that
I&#39;m preaching to the choir but I would like for my colleagues to
consider, look at the cuts, look at who&#39;s being hurt by this
increase in taxes. According to the North Carolina State Constitution,
Article I, Section V reads as thus: &quot;Every citizen of this state
owes paramount allegiance to the constitution and government of the
United States and no law or ordinance of the state in contravention or
subversion thereof can have any binding force.&quot; When I look at what
the IRC did in terms of the college tuition deductions, in terms of the
mortgage insurance premiums, and looking at this in totality, we are
putting the citizens of North Carolina at a disadvantage with the other
49 states of these United States. We are causing our citizens of North
Carolina to not benefit by our decoupling, and last by not least just
say what it is. Our state motto, someone said it before in this chamber,
is &quot;To be rather than to seem.&quot; If this isn&#39;t a tax
increase, just say it for what it is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Will Senator Brown yield to a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown, do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown, I was thinking back to our good times with the budget the
last couple of years and were there not cuts to DOT and personnel in the
budget?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, there has been a request for those cuts in DOT and as
this bill is being proposed there has been a lot of conversation with
DOT about how to balance this budget with the tax cut and the gas tax
cut

  ?? in the bill. The OT has seem to be okay with this scenario. In
committee, when we had it debated in committee, the OT responded and
really had no objections to what we were trying to propose in this bill.
So, I think if DOT had some concerns, I would think they would have been
lined up with the committee and expressed those concerns, and I
don&#39;t think we saw that. Also, on the other piece I&#39;ll just wrap
up if I could, Mr. President this comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, would you like to speak to the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I could.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, senator, you have the floor. Speak the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] As far as the decoupling from the federal government
own several of those issues. What you are talking about is
seventy-something million dollars of revenue the state will have to come
up with if you don&#39;t decouple. Now it is easy to stand up and talk
about that, I guess, but nobody has gone on to say, &quot;where are you
going to find the money?&quot; And if you want to make that argument,
I&#39;am okay to have that debate, but I think if you are going to
debate it, tell me where you are going to take it from. Are you going to
take it from teachers? Are you going take it from AJJS? Are you going to
take it from the court system? Where are you going to take the money
from? I think that should be part of the argument if you&#39;re gonna to
talk about spending those dollars, but nobody wants to talk about that.
Again, I think that&#39;s the important piece anytime you talk about
spending more money. It&#39;s easy to say it, but it is never easy to
find where you are going to take it from. So, I think let&#39;s make
that part of the argument if we gonna make it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator  if ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] See if Senator Brown will yield to one question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown, you make a very good point about the
fact that no one found the seventy-one million dollars, but if past
history is any example, and even my colleague from ?? would probably,
can be in that same group, the only way the macro?? ever found was to
have tax increases to pay for this stuff. Is that what they&#39;re
proposing, tax increases?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well again, you&#39;re either going to have to propose
a tax increase or you are going have to tell where you are going to find
the money. Its got to work both ways. Again, it&#39;s easy to say I can
spend it but tell me where you&#39;re going to find it. That&#39;s the
other piece.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Ford, to??? rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Mr. President. May I speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Ford has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much Mr. President. Ladies and
Gentlemen, senate, a lot&#39;s been made here the last few minutes about
the decoupling from the federal exclusions, so I want to address a
couple of those. The challenge is that the state is short on revenue by
200 to 71 million dollars. You are looking at a 21 billion dollar budget
senators, and so as it relates to families, the money is there, we just
need to prioritize working families in the state of North Carolina
instead of corporations and special interests. So, when you talk about
where to find the money, you have 21 billion dollars. You mean to tell
me that you folks cannot find 71 million dollars and prioritize that for
working families in the state of North Carolina. If you can&#39;t find
it, you need to be ashamed of yourself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brock full ?? to rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brock has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let us think about how we got here in the first place.
I am a historian now, I&#39;ve been here for half my life. When I sat on
the back row, Senator Clark, I can see fifty, I talked about the ??
Bridge over the Yankee River, and how year after year political
projects, ?? projects took precedence on the major commerce artery for
the eastern United States. The traffic was shut down for twelve hours at
a time. ?? getting corporations, companies  ?? &quot;hey, we would like
to go to Rodeway county, to Bears county, Davidson, Davy&quot;
&quot;Sorry, our roads are blocked off because some other areas of the
state got a lot more money in transportation dollars.&quot; We got hit
harder in 9/11 and the recession than anywhere else in the country, but
the politics kept going on. The transportation plan that we put out
prioritizes our ??  where the projects should go, where the money should
go. This is a good a idea. It stabilizes our funding sources because
many times it&#39;s used as an excuse by the ?? majority of the party.
Well, that bridge will go from anywhere from 150 - 400 million dollars
and our rate keeps fluctuating, so we&#39;re not going to build your
bridge. But a lot of y&#39;all got a lot of dent lines on your Mercedes.
We are going to prioritize our projects, stabilize our revenue, and put
the money where the data is. I urge you to support the bill.

  President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho, for what purpose do you
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
Senator has the floor to speak to the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mr. President and members of the Senate. I sat in the committee meetings
earlier, and I heard one of my colleagues talking about pink elephants.
Apparently he’s dreaming about pink elephants during the appropriations
meeting. But I think it’s important to understand that this bill and all
the other parts of the taxes, when you talk about a target, ladies and
gentlemen – what a target is, is an estimate or best guess by our
economists to determine the value or the amount of money generated. And
what’s very important and no one ever seems to recognize the fact that
when they say 217 million shortfall on the target, the best guess, no
one mentions the fact that we’re at 586 million dollars more this year
than last year with a tax cut. Now how do you explain that? Do you think
something might be working right different than what the other group
does? Because for the first time you have more money in your pocket. And
it won’t stop there. You look at the others. You look at the estimates,
the targets. 579 million dollars in the year, and then 800, almost 900
million dollars after that. Ladies and gentlemen, we’re on the right
track, despite all the rhetoric from the back row. We’re going to stay
the course, and we’re going to put prosperity in all of North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Reluctantly, I want to speak a second time on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, you have the floor to speak a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Ford, I’ve got to address your comments, and I
normally don’t get as worked up on some of this stuff but you made me do
it today I think. When you want to talk about middle class, and I think
that’s the new phrase for some now is about the middle class, you know
we took over, we had a two and a half billion dollar budget and there
were about a billion dollars in taxes that were set to expire. You
didn’t want to do that. You didn’t want those taxes to expire, and those
taxes affected the middle class probably more than any other tax I knew
of at the time. We’ve managed that two and a half billion dollar
shortfall, and also let those taxes expire, which helped the middle
class as much as anything we could have done at that time. If I look at
the tax reform that we’ve done, it’s probably helped the middle class
more than any other group of people in this state. The middle class. And
again, it’s easy on this bill to talk about this 70 million dollars in
priorities. And you can make priorities again, but my argument to you or
anyone else, if you want to spend that money, where do you want to find
it? And there’s other ways you can do it. I guess you can tax the middle
class, if you want to do that. Or you can cut teachers or you can cut
other things. But you’ve got to find the dollars. And I think we’ve done
a great job managing this budget. You’ve heard today in committee, this
budget is as sound as a budget we’ve had in a long, long time and I take
this job pretty serious and I think we’ve done a great job with it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Ford, for
what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to speak a second
time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Ford has the floor to speak a second
time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much, Mr. President. Senator
Brown, you know I have a tremendous amount of respect for you, and
having balanced more than one payroll myself, I understand what it means
to balance a budget. I understand what it means to make tough decisions.
I also understand what it means to pay other people before you get paid.
I want to remind this chamber that while I’m on the back row with my
colleagues, you’re dealing with a new set of Democrats. And I have not
advocated for one tax increase since I’ve been here. And when I talked
yesterday, I talked about cutting taxes for working families, so I just
want to remind this chamber, this is not the old Democratic Party.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do we have any further discussion or debate? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Blue, for what purpose
do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue has the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you very much, Mr. President, and to my colleagues here in the Senate.
I’ll give you a quote from one of my favorite Republicans. And he said
that you can fool some of the people some of the time, you can fool all
of the people some of the time, but you can’t fool all of the people all
of the time. And when Abe Lincoln said that, I think he understood the
nature of people. I want you to understand that the debate here is
twofold on this bill. First, a significant provision and not conforming
with the Federal change on the mortgage deduction means that we kick
people while they’re down. If they had money, they wouldn’t be in
foreclosure. If they had money to even give the mortgage company a small
amount of what they

  Build, they could probably forestall foreclosure and short sells. But
what we do is say now you got to come, come up with money, typically
probably 15, $20,000 because you managed to get the mortgage company to
forgive your loan. It&#39;s not gonna be forgiven in bankruptcy.
That&#39;s tax debt. And so you&#39;re, you&#39;re wrapping something
around their necks, probably for the rest of their lives, and it makes
sense. Some of you in here were involved in it, but we spent a lot of
time in 2008 trying to get North Carolineans in a favorable position
based, 2009, based on what the economy was doing. And we passed more, I
think, protective laws for our consumers than most other states did, and
in fact we became the model for the country on trying to deal with some
of the predatory loaning practices that got our people into these
positions. You&#39;re ignoring that, but that&#39;s just one part of the
argument that we&#39;ve tried to make. Second part of the argument is,
is one that I&#39;ll honestly tell you that I&#39;m uncomfortable with,
because I know what the infrastructural needs of this state are, just
like you do, and I know that this $1.2 billion that we&#39;re generating
in this tax increase is just a drop in the bucket in addressing the
transportation infrastructural needs. And you know it too. I feel
comfortable, and I felt comfortable following Senator Rabon and Senator
Harrington as they changed the formula last year on how we would build
roads, because I was here when the formula was initially devised in 1989
in a way so that you could get a bill passed to do for transportation
what everybody agreed needed to be done. And let me remind you that
Governor Jim Martin and Lieutenant Governor Jim Gardner were in the
executive branch, and with everybody working together, we passed a
transportation bill that is the Highway Trust Fund that now generates
more money than the highway fund, the traditional way of building roads
and infrastructure in the state. And we passed it because all the ideas
that people had at the time were put on the table. I have told Senator
Rabon and I&#39;ve told Senator Harrington, and I mean it. I&#39;m
willing to work with them and have the back road, work with them in any
way that makes sense to come up with a plan to address this overwhelming
infrastructural challenge that we have. But you can&#39;t do it
piecemeal. You can&#39;t do it piecemeal just as, again, when Governor
Martin in leading the effort to do the Highway Trust Fund in 1989 and
playing a significant role understood that as I&#39;ve told you before,
even a broke clock is right twice a day. That you get ideas from
everywhere, not just from legislators, but from all the stakeholders.
And you sit people down, and this bill on, on this tax increase goes
just the opposite, and let me tell you why. Because what you&#39;re
going to do is again, the people aren&#39;t stupid and you&#39;re not
gonna fool them. And they already have in their minds that this clock is
gonna tick down, and although they may only be paying $2.20 a gallon,
they know it&#39;s more comfortable to pay only $2.15 a gallon. And so
they&#39;re gonna be aware that, and what we&#39;re doing here is
poisoning the water, so when we can sit down and start talking about how
we fix this problem comprehensively, people are gonna be mad because
you&#39;ve raised the gas tax and it hasn&#39;t been part of an overall
solution, and it&#39;s gonna be almost impossible to pull the people to
a plan that we can then enact that will address this problem. Now,
I&#39;ve heard these threats made against people about what&#39;s gonna
happen if we don&#39;t get this, stabilize this thing right now. Thanks
to Senator Rabon and Senator Harrington, those decisions aren&#39;t
political decisions anymore. You heard a reference to that. DOT has
already decided where the projects are based on the formula that
we&#39;ve come up with that they need to do. They&#39;re being done on
priority. So if your project is a priority, I wouldn&#39;t be that
concerned or that threatened by someone saying that it&#39;s gonna come
off the chart if you don&#39;t vote a certain way on the bill.
That&#39;s extortion anyhow, and that&#39;s not the way we should be
operating in this body. Now, let me say one last point. Whether you call
it just using the words or coming up with a new theme, working families
and middle class families are the things that make this state what it is

  And makes this country what it is. It&#39;s what has distinguished us
from the rest of the world as we developed in an astronomical way in the
last half of the last century. Building a middle class and a working
class. What we do in this thing here prestidigitation, slight of hand or
whatever you want to call it. And this tax increase does affect the
middle class more than it affects everybody else. That&#39;s why
everybody needs to be a participant in this discussion on how we solve
this problem. The governor has talked about a bonding issue. That needs
to be on the table. People are talking about taxing electric cars a
different way. That needs to be on the table. The chamber came out with
a list of 15 or 16 different ways that we could do it or think about
fixing this problem. That needs to be on the table, and we need to
collectively discuss those things. That&#39;s all we&#39;re trying to
say in this debate. Would I vote for a tax to improve the infrastructure
of this state given the fact that I know how urgent that it is?
You&#39;re darn right I would, and my constituency would appreciate me
voting for it to fix the problems in this state so that it can be as
promising for my grandkids as it has been for me. But you know, I tell
them straight up. Friends, this is what we gotta do. Do you want me to
vote for a tax, or do you want, as I tell folk. I hate taxes like
everybody else, but I&#39;ll tell you what I hated worse. I hated living
on a dirt road where you ended up spending more to repair torn off
mufflers, when you spent more in fact to fix blown out towers, broken
steering rods, and those kinds of things. Would I choose a tax over
those? Sure I would. And some wise people decided that we would pay
taxes so that I wouldn&#39;t have to live on that dirt road anymore. And
those are the kinds of debates we ought to be having. We&#39;re not
having them, we&#39;re not calling this thing what it is, and I think
that we&#39;re doing a great disservice to the citizens of this state by
telling them that we&#39;re doing something that we&#39;re not, knowing
that transparency gives us, oh, the kind of credibility that we&#39;re
gonna need to seriously address this problem. Again, I want to reiterate
to Senator Rabon and to Senator Harrington that the leadership
they&#39;ve provided in addressing these broad issues is the kind of
leadership that serves the state well, and it&#39;s the kind of
leadership that can get us where we need to go, but we can&#39;t do it
playing tricks. And everybody has to be involved in the discussion and
all issues have to be part of it. I thank you for listening to at least
my very limited viewpoint on all of this, and I hope that you will come
clean and call this what it is, and let&#39;s go ahead and fix this
problem.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak briefly. I heard something that was historic. Senator Ford says
there&#39;s a new class of Democrats and a new way of thinking. I, thank
God for that, because the old class was voted out. And I&#39;m glad to
see that. That&#39;s probably a good day for all of us. And Senator Blue
that was a superb piece of oratory as always, and I think you about on
our side with what I heard with that because you admitted and I think
it&#39;s true that a lot of good things are being done. Whether this tax
is up or down or sideways, it is a start and it&#39;s not the end all
and be all. But I appreciate all the work that&#39;s been done to fix
this problem, and I think it&#39;s being addressed, and now it&#39;s our
turn to address it, and I believe that we could use a bipartisan effort
on this as to get the job done and yes and no, it&#39;s not perfect, and
I&#39;ve not seen a perfect bill other than one or two of mine
that&#39;s come out of here. But it&#39;s Thursday and I&#39;m wanting
to go home, mister President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Is there any other discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Meredith, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I had a question for Senator Blue, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue, do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator Blue, I just had a listen to your statement and your
conversation. I appreciate, I did have one question, though. You had
mentioned the word extortion and threats about projects that are
currently prioritized that wouldn&#39;t get done or could get done, and
I just, I wanted to ask, you do know that the list of projects that will
not get done was brought to us based on the department of transportation
and the funding. So I just, I&#39;m, I&#39;m

  <p id="35:00">
  I&#39;m curious where you got the word extortion and threat when these
projects will not be done based on DOT stating if the funding is not
there they will not be able to do it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I didn&#39;t say who the extorter was, who the threatener was, but
if in fact you tell me that if you don&#39;t behave a certain way this
is going to be the consequence, common sense tells me you&#39;re trying
to tell me that I&#39;d better do what you want me to do or I&#39;m not
going to get what I need. This is a good quid pro quo to get what I
need. So that&#39;s what I said when I said extort. When you pull out a
list... And let me tell you, I&#39;m familiar with the $33 million worth
of projects for that list for Wake County and that is a rounding change
for the transportation needs of this county. So if the effort was to
make me feel extorted about that it&#39;s a very feeble effort.
That&#39;s what I mean when I say extorted because every time somebody
raised a point, Senator Apodaca jumped up and said these are the
projects that aren&#39;t going to get funded in your district and I
assumed that that meant you ought to really vote for this if you want
these projects funded. Pretty good quid pro quo.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, what perks your eyes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You know people around me know how much I appreciate lawyers and their
turn of a phrase. Well, being called an extortionist by a lawyer is kind
of hollow.

Senate Resolution 69. Honor Boy Scouts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Daniel is recognized to speak to the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, each year in the
General Assembly we honor the Boy Scouts of America. For over 100 years
scouting programs have instilled in our youth the values found in the
scout oath and the scout law. While we are most familiar with the Eagle
Scout award, whose ranks include former scouts like President Ford,
Astronaut Neil Armstrong, Actor Jimmy Stewart, and baseball legend Hank
Aaron, this year the Boy Scouts are celebrating the 100th anniversary of
the Order of the Arrow.
The Order of the Arrow is a service organization and a National Honor
Society for the Boy Scouts. Members are elected from within their units
and recognized as those who best live the ideals of brotherhood,

  service. The Order of the Arrow, among whom Senator Brown was a member,
was founded in 1915 and has enjoyed a long history of service. It
emphasizes servant leadership nationwide in nearly 300 Boy Scout
Councils. As an example, in 2008 the Order of the Arrow improved five
national parks during an event called Arrow Corp 5. In 2013, service
projects were conducted by more than 2.6 million scouts and in a single
year 17 million service hours were provided by scouts and their leaders
to communities across America for a total contribution of $384M dollars
worth of volunteer service. So today Senator Brown, Senator Curtis, and
I present to you this resolution honoring the Boy Scouts of America and
their honor society, the Order of the Arrow for their historic and
continuing role in raising up leaders of character for our nation and I
ask for your support for the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator. Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing
none, oh, Senator Curtis, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I&#39;d like to speak on my experience in scouting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Curtis, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Scouting very definitely changed my life. My father was an illiterate
textile worker who spent his life working in a textile mill and the Boy
Scouts taught me a reality that I never forgot, and that is if you work
hard you can be successful and getting the Eagle Scout was probably the
first success that I ever had in my life. So whatever success I&#39;ve
had since then, I owe to boy scouting. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator. Any other discussion or debate? Senator Daniel, for
what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak a second time on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It would be the first time but you can speak to it, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just wanted to also point out that I forgot one member of the Order of
the Arrow, probably an unexpected member of the Order of the Arrow,
Senator Bingham was also a member of the Order of the Arrow.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any other discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question
before the senate is the motion to adopt Senate Resolution 69. All in
favor vote aye, opposed vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the
voting. The clerk will record the vote. Tillman, Apodaca, aye. Rabin,
Senator Rabin, aye. 49 having voted in the affirmative and zero in the
negative. Senate Resolution 69 is adopted. That concludes our calendar
for the day, Senators. This time we&#39;d like to just say thank you to
pages, there was only a few of you this week and I&#39;m sure you were
pulling double duty but thank you very much for serving the senate, hope
you come back to see us.

Do we have any notices or announcements?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton, you have the floor for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. I know I&#39;m a little late in reporting back
to the Senate. I&#39;d had a lot of people ask me when we had our
wildlife exhibition and the competition with the pellet guns. I still
haven&#39;t been able to find the final score or exactly who was the top
shooter but I do know that the Senate cleaned the House&#39;s clock once
again. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other notices or announcements? Any further business to come before
the Senate? If not, the chair recognized Senator Berger for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Just briefly, Senator Newton, I think it&#39;s
possible that Senator Soucek, he had those scores, because I understand
that the clerk serves us and actually got a better score than he did.
So, you might want to talk to Senator Soucek. Mr. President, I move that
the Senate do now adjourn subject to the standard stipulations set forth
in rule 24.1, to reconvene on Monday, February 16, 2015 at 4:00 PM.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The motion is that the Senate do now adjourn, subject to the standard
stipulations, to reconvene Monday, February 16th and 4:00 PM, seconded
by Senator Tart. All in favor say aye, opposed no, the aye&#39;s have
it. Th e Senate stands adjourned.
