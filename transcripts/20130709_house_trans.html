<p id="00:00">
Good afternoon. A quorum being present, the House Committee on
Transportation will come to order. Our Sergeant at Arms today are
Carlton Adams, Jesse Hays, Marvin Lee, Martha Parish, Carla Farmer, and
Lynn Taylor are our committee clerks. And Giles Perry and Brenda Carter
are our staff.
We’re going to deviate slightly from order and take Senate Bill 372,
Omnibus County Legislation. Senator Davis.
There is a Committee Substitute?
Representative Brown moves the Committee Substitute without objection,
the bill is properly before us. Welcome to the House, Senator Davis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity. This is the same
as the House Bill that was passed in this committee in April with a few
exception. The Senate added section 2.1 which clarifies that the new
informal bid amount established by section 2 applies to contracts
awarded to disadvantaged business enterprises. In addition, the House
Environment Committee clarified in section 1 that the notice to county
commissioners requirement only applies to solid waste, not liquid waste
and the PCS in this committee, as a representative of the League of
Municipalities to the Payment in Lieu of taxes study. I’d be glad to
answer any questions you have and ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any questions? Representative Shepard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir, Mr. Chair, for a question of Senator Davis. Senator Davis in
conflict in any way with the landfill bill I’ve been reading so much
about in the counties?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, if I may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not that I know of.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there a motion? Representative Iler.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I move for a favorable report to propose the House
Committee Substitute, unfavorable to the original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right, Representative Iler moves favorable report to propose House
Committee Substitute to Senate Bill 372. This will be referred directly
to the floor. Unfavorable to the original bill. So many as favor the
motion say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed? Motion carries. Thank you, Senator Davis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and committee members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell. Senate Bill 344. Vintage Auto Inspections. Welcome to
the House, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the House. I appreciate the
opportunity. Vintage Auto Inspections actually arises, I’m not sure how
I got drafted, but I think I know. It’s because I happen to own two
vintage Studebakers that I kind of keep in storage and have develped
friendships with some of the folks who are the clubbers who do these
kind of things. What the bill does is simply direct...as you may know,
there are no inspections, as such, required for vehicles that are over
35 years of age. However, if a vehicle comes in from out of state and/or
is a kit type vehicle, there is at least a requirement that these
vehicles, not necessarily being inspected, but at least they verify
certain kinds of information so that a North Carolina title can be
issued. Many of these vehicles actually are transferred or a lot of the
works done at these car shows. The largest of which, probably in the
eastern United States, happens to be at the Charlotte Motor Speedway
which happens to be in my district. That’s kind of where all of the
history of this. What it does is to assist these folks in these
situations to expedite the issuance of those titles in those very
unusual….those situations. There are some car buffs who are here to
address this. If you’d like to hear from them, I’d be glad to try to
answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Bumgardner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Being a car buff myself, I’d like to make the motion that we approve
this bill when the time comes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jeter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I talked to DoT and they referenced some concerns they have with the
timing that they thought would be...</p>

...a cost associated with adding a couple employees. It would take up to
forty days, otherwise they’d have to add employees. Are they present,
can they comment on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is DoT present?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I can go ahead and grab the microphone first, I’m Nick Tennison, an
acting commissioner of DMV. We do have concerns about this legislation.
I’ve got much better informed folks behind me here to give you the
detail, but the core question at DMV is how do we protect the subsequent
purchasers of vehicles who may be receiving a car that actually is the
age that it’s purported to be, but may also not be and may, in fact, be
a car that’s transferred legally along the line, but may also be one
that was at some point stolen. The question of assigning priority in the
form of a time limit says things about what  priority we attach to other
duties discharged by the people that are going to be having to carry out
this work. The detail on the number of folks that are required and what
changes to process I think would be best explained by people that are
doing it. Suffice it to say, the division is aware of the need to have
prompt customer service and we are working on that. In fact, much work
was done by these folks before I ever got involved. Did you want to
weigh out the changes that we’ve had here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The second gentleman is recognized. Will you please tell us your name
and your title sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. Steve Watkins. I’m the director of the license and theft
bureau. Just like the commissioner said, one of our concerns is that we
have inspectors that go out and they look at these vehicles. In most
cases we can get out in three to five days to look at that, but there’s
a process and we’ve established a fraud lab that not only looks at
vehicles, but also looks at identity fraud. When cases such as this come
in, concerning an antique or whatnot, our inspectors assume that
responsibility along with their other responsibilities which are
identity theft, vehicle fraud, vehicle theft and also the emissions
program. Our concern is the time line there. Having an inspector go out,
that information is then sent back up to our fraud lab, they examine
that photograph, numbers, all that paperwork. It then goes over to our
registration department, if everything’s good, it’s then mailed out. It
is a time...we’ve done what we can to improve that and expedite that,
but I definitely believe with some of the time concerns here that we
don’t want anyone to get a vehicle that comes back stolen or we rush to
look at the vehicle and not collect all the information that we would
like to see.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, can I have one other thing?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, would you state your name again for the…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m NicK Tennison, acting commissioner of the DMV. We have attorney
general’s representatives here that are concerned about just language in
the bill as to its effect on what would ultimately be the documentation
that would be required for titling and if you have questions about them
as to those details, that’s a drafting question, but wanted to bring
that up. Thanks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, let me just…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
...Senator Hartsell
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me explain to the committee that some of these issues were in fact
raised when this bill came up on the Senate two months ago. We extended
the time, actually voluntarily extended the time from 10 days to 15 days
in both cases at that time thinking that that was going to solve this
alleged problem. I’m not, there are folks here, Mr. Chairman, who are
here today who can give you war stories and very serious problems
associated with some of the delays that have been incident in doing this
because there is a fudge factor left out...set forth in the bill even
with the time frames. That is, if the department, or any inspector
simply says we have probable cause to think there’s a problem, then
these time frames are not there. It just bothers me that folk don’t look
at we’re trying to come up with a fudge factor to at least get some of
these things done much more quickly than what has historically been the
case. To be honest with this committee and…</p>

<p id="10:00">
with the chair...I thought we had this worked out until I didn’t learn
about these other alleged issues until yesterday when someone raised it.
I’m not trying to diminish this in any way, but I can assure this
committee that there are folks here associated with some of these ?? who
can give you very significant war stories. I’m not an unreasonable sort
of fellow, but I’m not sure I’ve heard anything, thus far, that says
that there’s any particular problem with the time frames.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Torbitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair, my question is more along the dollars and cents,
wanting to know if a fiscal note has been prepared, if so how much.
Maybe I think I heard from DoT, perhaps additional staff needing to be
had and need to know how much and I don’t think this has also gone
through the Appropriations process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I don’t believe it’s gone through Appropriations nor will it go
through it...I don’t have a referral, it will go directly to the floor
from here. You have a followup sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The question would be, I guess, the members of DoT...or  the Senator had
a fiscal note been prepared and the DoT is, do they have an estimation
on addition costs that whether they can be covered internally or if they
feel additional funds would need to be applied?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jeter, did you have a question also?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was going to make a comment to Senate Hartsell’s point, which I think,
if I could, Mr. Chair..
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’re recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. To me, it sounds like we’re dealing with issue of whether
it’s 10, 15, 20, 30 days. I would somewhat...not somewhat, but I would
agree with Senator Hartsell that we probably need to move the bill
forward out of committee. We can talk to DMV and if there is a date
issue, we can do that with an amendment on the floor and consultation
with Senator Hartsell. Since this is the last week of committees I’d
like to go ahead and get this out even though I do think there is a date
issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman’s point is well taken. The Chair would like the indulgence
to ask DMV 15 days is too short, do you have a number?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sir, the schedule that we’re working on now is a 30 to 45 day schedule
for getting the title out the door. Again, without wanting to quibble
with the drafting, there are some terms that probable cause is a very
strict standard and we think that it’s reasonable to have an out, but
that would be an example of a place where we think maybe we want to
change the language to make sure that it’s clear that there is something
less than probable cause that would allow this time change. 30 to 45
days is what’s we’re working on right now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Iler.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, the question if for the gentleman who was at the podium
just a moment ago. Does DMV,  or anyone else going to answer it, does
DMV have an estimate of the number of these vehicles we’re talking
about? Is this a significant…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A thousand a year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A thousand a year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Plus another five hundred kit cars. So there are a thousand antique,
five hundred that are kits that need to be certified.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And this is out of eight million vehicles, is that right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir with a substantially more complex problem about trying to issue
the title.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m sorry. I apologize. 7,000 antique cars, I apologize. 7,000.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My initial question has been answered. This problem came up a number of
years ago and I don’t think it actually got out of committee at the
time. I think the Department of Transportation has been reasonable in
what they’ve been doing. I have had no complaints in the past four or
five years from anyone in my area. To arbitrarily restrict them to a
time frame I think would actually hamper their ability to do what’s
right for the state, number one, and the customer they’re serving,
number two. I honestly think that the process they’re using now, even
though we can find horror stories, we can find horror stories any place.
I think the process they’re using now is satisfactory.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Shepard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. For a question for DoT. My concern is I was looking here at
the second edition the bill will engrossed on the 18th of April...</p>

<p id="15:00">
and we've just been told that the DMV didn't express any concerns about
this until yesterday and I'm a little concerned about that.  I mean,
that we didn't hear anything about that until today. I just want you
guys to address that as to why we have just heard about that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm afraid I can't give you a long term answer but I
can tell you that I'm upset about it too. We did not respond the way we
should have as soon as this was passed and I'm disappointed about that.
I know that representatives from DMV were involved in conversations and
candidly I'm afraid that we just didn't get as aggressive as we should
have as early as we should have and I regret that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Faircloth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Question for DMV.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.  Out of the 7,000 you mentioned antique
vehicles how many of those 7,000 approximately would you find a problem
with?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] 843. 843.  More than 10%.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And can you give me an example of what the problems
you find might  be?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Among the problems would be someone who's purchased a
frame that's of a different date than the car body that's placed on top
of it so that it appears to be a 1955 Chevy and it's really a different
frame.  There are problems about cars that have been stolen and that are
now attempting to be titled and then resold.  We need to do as complete
an investigative process as we can to make sure that we protect that
second purchaser, not only just the first purchaser.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Boles.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker.  To ask DMV a question please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. You had mentioned 7,000?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And those are 7,000 out of state per year?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] 7,000 verifications that are being brought into the
State of North Carolina are titled for the first time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually that's 7,045 I think was the exact count in
2012.  Wasn't that it? 2012.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay and follow up.  Also I know Senator Hartsell had
mentioned that one of the largest shows was in Charlotte which I tried
to attend.  Do you have - sit up John.  John. - Do you have inspectors
at the facilities like at Charlotte doing tests or can a gentleman get
an inspection there?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No.  The process requires having a member of the
License and Theft Bureau visit the vehicle, take photographs, document
that the vehicle is as advertised. That's forwarded to the office in
Raleigh.  A background investigation is done to determine whether that
car is listed on any of the national databases or in any other way is
reported or if there's something about the VIN number. There is a member
of the staff who can actually from memory quote VIN's for types of cars,
which I think is amazing. That's not what he relies on.  In any case, I
think that the identification of this show is clearly something that we
may not have been as sensitive to  trying to make sure we build that
into our workload and I think that's the kind of thing going forward we
want to do but a blanket 15-day restriction for the whole year is a
problem for us and I want to take the opportunity to apologize to the
Senator for the fact that we didn't  communicate more effectively on
this earlier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And one other follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have a follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I want to comment. I think, not speaking for your
department but you're in the middle of a transition right now without a
Commissioner, correct? Besides an Acting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I like to think of myself as the Commissioner. They
call me that so I enjoy it but yes sir, we're in transition.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But have you been appointed yet?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I am appointed as Acting Commissioner. I took the
oath.  I got the badge.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright, good.  Then you're the man.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So I purchase this car and I have it in my possession.
That's when you do your investigation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We do it upon request of a person who wants to have
verification  that the car is as it was described to be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And a follow up.</p>

<p id="20:00">
So I have to request it in order, before or can I just get a title for
it? I was waiting for the Commissioner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Commissioner’s going to ask for License and Theft
Bureau to help him out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What happens after the purchase of that vehicle if you
were to purchase that vehicle out of Florida, and you have the title in
hand for that vehicle?  In some cases, even back when I was in the field
you get called to look at a vehicle, and we’ll like you said on site, we
do send inspectors out. They can request that at their local offices.
Not only their districts, but there’s local offices all around. In some
cases they’ll bring the antique vehicle to us, but in the examining of
that vehicle we look at that Florida title, for instance, would be that
car may be a piece together car, what we used to call a kit car. And
that title may come out of Florida as a 1942 Ford, and you've paid 24
thousand dollars or 25 thousand for that car, and when we look at it, we
look and it’s got a 1989 or 1995 Chevrolet engine in there, and we see
screws all in that frame where they've pieced that car together.
Unfortunately, they've bought that car, and it may have been titled in
Florida as a 1942 Ford. In our case we’re going to make that a custom.
So the next purchaser doesn't buy that car thinking that’s a 1942 Ford
and that’s a small for instance. In looking at that also we have an
individual from our fraud lab, and they look at and see all kinds of
stuff, and they collect that kind of information so after I go check it
I send that information in to our fraud lab. We have civilians and sworn
personnel that do that. They look at photographs and numbers on it and
see if that inspector has made a good choice or a good decision in how
they recommend titling that vehicle here in North Carolina. So back when
I was in the field we didn't have that afforded to us. We kind of made
the call, and we've had some of our inspectors get in pretty big trouble
in trying to rush through that, that’s our concern, even to the point
where they may not work with us any longer. So not only do we want to,
we want to make sure we check those things out, make sure we’re titling
that car the correct way.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just want to follow-up and then I’m through. So if
I’m in Charlotte and I purchased a car and I go ahead and pay the man
and he leaves and goes back to Florida and he leaves me a Florida title,
in order to get a North Carolina title you’re going to have to come and
inspect the car or can I just go to the DMV?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That inspector will come out and look at those numbers
on the vehicle.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Regardless, he has to inspect the vehicle?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He looks at that out of state vehicle. Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Before I can get a North Carolina-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, you said you've got some people on the other
side of this issue that are here today. How about get the best on to
come up and make the case so we can hear a little bit of the other side?
I've still got six members that are wanting to speak and we got to be
out of here at a quarter till because we have session. Would you tell us
your name, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My name is Jim Laura, and I’m an attorney, and I’m a
collector car owner. My offices are in Cary, North Carolina, and I
suppose because I've been providing the car owners free legal services
for problems they've had repeatedly with DMV that I've kind of been the
central focus of a lot of this. What DMV doesn't tell you is the fact
from the view of the consumer, that’s us, and most of us are my age or
older. They cause more collateral problems then they assist with us, and
this happened, it all started a couple of years ago. I’ll just give you
an example. Out of the ones they’re counting as they found problems.
Gentleman is an engineer. I knew his wife, a defense attorney in
Greensboro. He called. The inspector wasn't going to approve his
pristine out of state ’62 Corvette. They demand he take his car off the
frame so they could look at the frame numbers. There’s one number out of
sequence they can’t read. All the other numbers match. DMV refuses to
give him a title. Lady with an English Ford in Anglia, we call them. She
inherited from her father. She had it 30 or 40 years. She brings it down
from Michigan. She wants to get a title on it. They can’t find a number
on the engine, not all cars have numbers on engines. Takes her over one
year with my assistance to get a title from DMV. She has to post a 1500
dollar bond. She’s got that car and setting with her family all those
years. They count that as a</p>

Problem that they find with the cars. From the collector of cars stand
point and the organizations like Semen who opposes DMV's position.
Antique car club of America, which is represented in the Charlotte area
by Mel Carson who heads up the Charlotte most frequently event this
considering Harts is different. All of these people are consumers who do
not like DMV's involvement. Who resent what DMV is doing. Who'd rather
have it where if we needed DMV we can call DMV. To be frank with the
committee we know a lot about the cars that the DMV inspectors ever
will. There's no way they could possibly know about all these cars. They
bring up issues  based on their misunderstanding which holds up our
titles for extended periods of time. And thats the picture from the
consumers stand point. We don't mind their involvement. We want their
involvement when we ask for their involvement. Their repeated
involvement in the way that its set up now, hampers our ability to get a
 title and to transfer the title when people want to sell it to other
members and be able to just enjoy their car. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Moore, Can I ask you to give me one sentence to wrap up? [SPEAKER
CHANGES} The point is when we originally asked, when they originally
asked for this legislation about two sessions ago. We agreed to the
inspection process initially on the representation of DMV that they will
give us an expedited inspection. They have not done that. They don't
give you any 3 to 5 day inspections. Even in Rally is more than 60 days.
In our experience so often and the inspector will not even call you on
the phone. And the way they treat you when they come is just shameful.
So I'm just asking to try to do something to help the collective car
people, who are just a bunch of mostly old guys with the cars we had in
our youth. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. I've got Edmonds, ??,
Cleveland, Bumgardner and Dollar. Does anybody got anything to add?
Representative Bon Gardner. Ok. Yes representative Dollar. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr Chairman I'd like to offer a motion for favorable report and
the only question I had for senator Hartsfield was. And you may have
said this before I got in and if you did I apologize don't worry about
it you don't have to repeat it. But I thought we fixed this a couple
years ago. I thought we did a bill and I thought we had the problem
fixed. And basically what you'r saying it we didn't get it fully fixed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's  fair statement. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well
actually representative Bumgardner was ahead of you. Representative
Bumgardner would you like to make your motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir
I'd like to motion we give this favorable report. And bring it to the
floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion by representative Bumgardner to
favorable report senate bill 344 with report to the floor. As many favor
the motion say aye. Opposed no. The opinion of the chair the ayes have
it. Motion's passed. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you mr chairman. Let me
point out that representative Pitman also represents the ??
[SPEAKER]Yea. Alright I wanna bring the senate bill 653 there's a PCS
for this. It's gonna be run by representative Stone. On Motion of
representative Stone. PCS for senate bill 653 is now before us without
objection. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you mr chair. Ladies and gentlemen,
members of the community. Senate bill 653 looks familiar, because it was
actually sent back. It was former house bill 513 and it clarifies the
dealer plates. The change in here is basically section 1G. IS employer,
dealer the employees at all times no less than 3 motor vehicles
representatives who are required to be licensed under article 12 of this
chapter or sold a hundred of more vehicles in the previous 12 months
ending December 31. In the original bill it was 0 and DMV had some
questions and so we made it 3. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any questions for the
sponsor? Is there a motion? Ok. I'm sorry. Representative Ford is
recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you mr chair.
Whats this whole section here on ring ways? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir look
at the PSC. The original bill is.. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't have a PSC.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright. Will the sergeant at arms provide
representative Ford with a PSC? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER

...recognize them, fixes the pump, there is no follow-up inspection
needed so businesses can get back to business quicker. That's my
understanding.
(speaker changes) Follow up
(speaker changes) Yes sir.  So, is the department currently following up
because the guys are not registered?
(speaker changes) No, but they did not know that they didn't have the
authority to do that, and that's what they've asked for. So maybe they
will start following up if we don't do something.
??
[Speaker Changes] Oh, Representative Stein
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Chair.  So, I want to make sure I
understood this correctly. So, currently when the gentleman comes out to
repair the pumps, we have a state inspector to come by and check it
before they are allowed to sell, and this bill will allow the state
inspector will not have to come back and reassure that the pumps are
fixed and they will go straight to sale?
[Speaker Changes] That's my understanding, like when the inspector or
when the petroleum device technician does his fix, he has to put like a
seal on it and then the inspector, the seal can't be broken until the
inspector gives the okay and my understanding is that by recognizing, by
the state recognizing the certification of the petroleum device
technician, the gasoline and oil board already uses registered petroleum
technicians, but by the state recognizing them, it would remove a step
from that process.
[Speaker Changes] Follow up
[Speaker Changes] Well, I guess my follow up question is if we're not
going to require someone to go back out to recertify that the pumps have
been correctly maintained, are we getting rid of any personnel?
[Speaker Changes] Well, that was a question that was asked in the
Senate, and the answer to that is there's only ten inspectors in the
whole state.
[Speaker Changes] But we're still not getting rid of any personnel,
correct?
[Speaker Changes] Ten inspectors can cover every petroleum based product
in the state of North Carolina
[Speaker Changes] One last follow up
[Speaker Changes] Follow up
[Speaker Changes] How many problems did we have last year? Anyone have a
clue of how many pump problems?
[Speaker Changes] The department's here
[Speaker Changes] Would you please step to the microphone to answer the
question and tell us who you are please
[Speaker Changes] Sorry, I'm Joy Hicks, I'm the legislative liason for
the Department of Agriculture. I do not have the answer, but we do put
out an annual report and I will have that sent to you and to the
committee if you would like to know. If you would like. Representative
or Senator Barefoot is correct we have ten inspectors that go around and
check all gas pumps for the entire state. They're set up into regions
and when they do find a problem they do tag out the pump and then we
have these registered technicians that come in and they're acting on the
behalf of the state. It was when we went through an audit done by the
Auditors Office on how we assess these in fines we we through our whole
standards divisions statutes and looked at our authorities and our rules
and the fines that we collect and how we do that and we discovered then
that we do not actually have the authority, even thought the general
assembly had in the budget bill back in I think '08, given us the
authority to actually institute a fee to register these technicians. We
have been registering technicians to act upon behalf the state so that
the inspector didn't come out. But these people were trained and were
knowledgable. The industry likes the fact that they don't have to wait
for an inspector to come back out to just calibrate or fix the
instrument. And it's something that we've utilized so that we don't have
to have additional staff. And so, what we're looking for in this bill,
we almost see it as almost a technical fix for something that you have
already expected us to do because you've given us the authority to
charge the fee, however, we didn't have the express authority to
actually register these folks on behalf of the state.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Stein, is that what you needed?
[Speaker Changes] Yes, thank you
[Speaker Changes] Representative Iler
[Speaker Changes] For motion Mr. Chairman
[Speaker Changes] It's time
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Chairman, I recommend, excuse me, I move
that we give Senate bill 454, a favor report with referral to finance.
[Speaker Changes] Submitting his favor the motion say aye
[Speaker Changes] Aye
[Speaker Changes] Opposed? Motion carries. That completing our agenda,
we are adjourned.</p>
