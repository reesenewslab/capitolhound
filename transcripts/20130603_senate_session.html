[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  Members, I’d like to move that we

sent back and differs quite a bit and we would like to not concur so
that conferees can be appointed.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate,
I find myself almost in agreement with Senator Pate. Which is not that
bad. But I read the language of this House version of this bill and it
is some of the most ridiculous stuff I’ve read lately.  I’m going to
vote to concur.</p>

Even though I don’t agree with very much of the language in the House
version. But I do think that it rightfully creates a situation where the
city and the state can talk. Where they can figure out exactly what’s
what. The city as this bill says, there are some redeeming values in it.
The House Bill points out that it is a subdivision of the state, and
it’s ?? to the state, and I agree with that. And so I think that since
they’re closely related, they ought to have an opportunity to sit down,
talk together, figure out how and whether they ought to work this deal
some of way. So I hope that you will vote to concur with the House
changes to Senate Bill 334 and let Raleigh and the department of
administration go ahead and try and get some kind of workable solution
on this. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein has the floor to speak to the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually I ask all the members of the chamber to vote
to concur. The lease between the city and the state is valid. We
shouldn’t be passing any law but at least the redeeming value of the
House Bill is that it says all right, Governor and Mayor, why don’t you
all talk for a year before we do anything rash. The bill that this
chamber passed out immediately abolished a valid contract between the
city and the state. Thereby jeopardizing the good word of the state of
North Carolina, which undermines everything that the state’s good name
is. To abolish this lease is unbelievably shortsighted. There’s an
incredible opportunity to create a world-class port here that would
benefit not only the county but the whole state. It will serve as an
engine for economic growth in this region which again ?? to the benefit
of the entire state. I think the lease is valid. I don’t think we need
any law whatsoever. That said, there’s at least some modicum of respect
in the House version, so I ask you to support this conference, this
motion to concur. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or
debate? Hearing none, the question before the Senate is concurrence in
the House Committee Substitute. Senator Pate recommends that you do not
concur. All in favor will vote aye. Opposed will vote no. Five seconds
will be allowed for voting and the clerk will record the vote. [PAUSE]
Bryant, Bryant, aye. Bryant, aye. 18 having voted in the affirmative and
28 in the negative, the Senate does not concur and the House will be so
notified. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I want to change my vote, please. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Raybin changes his vote from aye to no. [PAUSE] Final
count 17-29. [PAUSE] At this time, it’s time to introduce our pages for
the week. So if the pages will come to the front of the chamber and line
up here, we will recognize you for the week. And as soon as they get to
the front, the clerk will read. [PAUSE] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Pages serving
