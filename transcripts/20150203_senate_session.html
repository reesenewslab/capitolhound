Senator Daniel, your light is. Do you mind ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] At the appropriate time I&#39;d like to ask for a
point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, this would be the appropriate time. So
Senator Daniel, you&#39;re recognized for point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President and members of the Senate.
Today, a member from my district named James Hamby is being honored at a
ceremony at the State Capitol. Private First Class Hamby served with the
29th Field Artillery Regiment in World War II. The 29th FA was the first
artillery unit to land on Utah Beach in Normandy. The 29th FA continued
on through Cherbourg and participated in the Liberation of Paris. They
went on through the Battle of the Bulge and on into Germany.
After that, they returned to the United States only to prepare for a
possible invasion of Japan.
In order to express France&#39;s eternal gratitude that those who
liberated it from oppression from 1944 to &#39;45, the Consul General of
France in Atlanta, Georgia, Denis Barbet, today will bestow the Legion
of Honor upon seven American World War II veterans from North Carolina
in a ceremony at 2 PM at the State Capitol.
Founded by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802, the National Order of the Legion
of Honor is the highest honor in France. It recognizes eminent service
to the French Republic. American veterans who risked their lives during
World War II and who fought on French territory qualified to be
decorated as Knights of the Legion of Honor. Veterans must have fought
in one of the four main campaigns of the Liberation of France: Normandy,
Provence, Ardennes or Northern France. Recipients of this honor are
designated by the President of the Republic, Francois Hollande. Other
recipients today who are receiving this award are Harold Eatman from
Matthews, and Fernnie Letchworth from Sharpsburg, James Seitzer from
Chapel Hill, Julien Highsmith from Brasstown, Donald Judd from
Burlington. In addition, Miss Candy Bernard will be present to receive
the medal on behalf of her late father, Leon Bernard, who also served in
Normandy.
I just wanted to bring this to the attention of the Senate and make you
aware of members of your district who may be receiving this award today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Daniel. Are there any other notices
or announcements?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown, for what purpose do you rise?

the Sportsmen&#39;s Caucus Reception across the street at the Natural
Science Museum. It begins about 5:30, and all are welcome.
And tomorrow morning, we will have the Sportsmen&#39;s Caucus Breakfast.
And again, you&#39;re all invited. It&#39;s starting at 7:30 down in the

trying to claim your title as Deadeye of the Senate in the pellet
shooting competition, but we have some freshmen senators here and I know
