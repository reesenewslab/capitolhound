morning, morning morning. morning, members, morning guests.  If the
members will have their seats we’ll get started here in a moment.  The
Sergeant at arms today are Ashley Mickens, Steve Wilson, Ed Kessler
All-American Ed Kessler, Betty Fricher.  Glad to have you with us today.
 You're doing a good  job always for us.  And our pages today which sent
Senator Soucek can read of course he’s got an education, Marcus
Alexander,  ?? Stanley, Senator Curtis, ?? Lindsey from Reedsville,
Senator Berger, Gabriel Gordon, Somerville, Senator Berger, Antoinette
Dyer, Raleigh, Senator Nesbitt, Jacob Burnett, ??  Senator Davis, Justin
Scott, Raleigh, Senator Jenkins, Ariel Harris ??, Senator Berger.  Thank
you all.  I hope you have a good week and learn a lot.  We're going to
go right into the agenda today; just briefly; we’ll tell you the order
that we’re going to take these.  We’re going to do House bill 317
improve education of children who are deaf person first and ask
Representative Blackwell and then we're going to take House bill 591
reporting and terms for our longitudinal data that is Representative
Blackwell also.  I believe he’s got bills on other committees so it
means you’re getting things done.  Representative Blackwell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Thank you, Mister Chairman, I appreciate the
committee letting us come here, I believe you all may have already heard
this bill that was Senator Daniel and Senator Newton introduce
essentially the same bill over.  Mister Chairman I think there may be as
one small technical amendment that needs to be offered and I think
Senator Daniel is doing that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Senator Daniel.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Mister Chairman I’d like to send forth a technical
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Send forth your amendment and if we have it and
members have it.  I believe they’re getting ready to get it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   They’re changing an and to an or where it says who
was deaf or hard of hearing instead of and hard of hearing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   The amendment is before you, and if you would
explain the amendment Representative Blackwell, or Senator Daniel who
offers the amendment.  Senator Daniel.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Mister Chairman I think it just makes a technical
correction and changes the word and to the word or on his page two, line
twenty seven.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  So it’s merely technical.  I have a motion before
you.   Motion, motion.  All in favor aye.  Motion passed.  Now the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   Mister Chairman, I want also at knowledge
Representative Martin and Representative Farmer Butterfield and
Representative Holloway.  He's not here with us for their support on
this. I don't want to take the committee 's time since you have already
been over this bill before I'll just say quickly that this has been a
bill that we have worked on with Senator Newton and Senator Daniel and
members on the house side and a lot of the interested parties over more
than one session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  And then if you like what we have a motion I wouldn’t
talk myself out of it if I were you.  Senator Daniel moved for a
favorable report.  Discussion?  All in favor aye.  Any opposed.  Passes.
 Thank you.  Who wants to handle that on the floor?  Senator Daniel.
Alright we’re going to hear your other bill because I know you’ve got to
go and then Representative Hurley will be following you.  She's up on
deck on there.  Go ahead sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Mister Chairman this is a basically a fix for a
bill that we passed last time.  The concept of the bill last time was to
set up board that could try to effectively force different state
agencies to work together and effectively sharing data that would allow
the General Assembly simply to make better judgments over time about
what kind of programs, particularly in education were working in terms
of student outcomes and we did this as a result for recommendation of
the joint committee that we had on efficiencies in state government that
Senator Hise worked on with me as co-chair.  We did  the bill last time,
but in the bill last time we had a house and senate members serving on
the board after the bill was passed we were advised that there was a
constitutional</p>

Issue that because the board had the ability to make rules, that that
violated the principle of separation of powers between the executive and
the legislative branch. This changes to eliminate the House and Senate
members and creates new appointees. It further changes the dates and
provides for frequent reporting to the legislature so that we can remain
involved in sort of righting hurt on this problem, and it designates
state’s Chief Information Officer is Chair of the Board rather than
leaving it open for them to elect whomever they choose. I’d be glad to
answer any questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Very good. You’ve heard the
bill. Questions from members. I have a motion for a favorable report
from my good Senator from Durham, Senator Woodard. Any discussion?
Motion. All in favor, aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any
opposed? You want to handle that one on the floor, somebody? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Daniel maybe, or Senator Hise. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let
Senator Daniel have it. Hise has got to where he talks more. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Senator
Stein, I believe you would have written that bill yourself, you could
have thought of the words to it. That’s a good one. But Representative
Hurley, my gal from Randolph, I’m going to tell this. She’s older than I
am, folks, and that defies all logic. I don’t understand it. She don’t
look it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. That is the truth. He
did tell the truth. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hurley, now we’ve
heard this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So we don’t
need anything but your little explanation because I know you’ve got
another bill to run. Go. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. This
bill you have heard three times I think, and I ran it because of
fourth-graders who printed their letters, thank you notes to me, and I
would appreciate your support on it, and it also has the students to
write cursive, learn to write cursive between kindergarten and the fifth
grade, and also to memorize the multiplication tables, and
Representative Warren is on the bill with me along with Representative
Shepard. I’d appreciate your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have questions. I saw Senator Allran first, then
Senator Cook. Senator Allran. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I’d like to move
for a favorable report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You know that bill well; you
wrote one just like it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Very true. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Cook. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He beat me to it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He
wanted to make a motion and so we’ve got a motion for a favorable report
from Senator Allran and Senator Cook. Discussion? All in favor, aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any opposed? Passes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Who wanted to handle that on the
floor? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Allran or you. Either one. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Allran. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Next we’re going to call House Bill 537, Representative Steinburg. This
is Edenton-Chowan School Board Terms and it is not a local bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning, ladies and gentleman. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. I think this bill is pretty self-explanatory. We are changing
the… proposing to change the school board terms from six years, which
they currently are, to four years. There are I think three school
districts in this state that continue to have six year terms, so we’re
just trying to get in compliance with everyone else. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr…. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Saw Senator Cook, Senator Apodaca. Questions or
motions? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I move that we vote. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Move
for a favorable report? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Bryant, I’m guessing you’re not moving for a favorable report. You want
to speak. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I just wanted to ask a question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Alright. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I just wanted to know what the
position is of the local school board members or get some local
feedback. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure, Senator Bryant. I’m sorry, Mr.
Chairman; I should have gone to you first. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s
alright. Proceed. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant, the school board is
opposed to this; the board of commissioners are for it. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Have a motion for a favorable
report. Discussion? All in favor, aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Any opposed? Passes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate is amazing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative, who do you want to handle that bill?
You want someone to handle that bill for you? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Mr.
Cook. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Cook. Senator Cook. Senator Cook it is.
Excuse me, that bill will be re-referred to State and Local Government,
so it’s got another stop to make. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I believe we’re down to House Bill 903, UNC</p>

community college credit transfers.  Representative Johnson,
Representative Starnes, are either one of them here?  In their absence,
I'll tell you what this bill does.  Representative Starnes is here, I'll
let him tell you.  I already had my version ready.  We'll hear
Representative Starnes.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, ??.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  I think you're right.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr.
Chairman, members of the committee.  I'm the late Edgar Starnes, I'm
glad to be here.  Let's see.  You're on House Bill 903, is that correct?
 [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes, sir, we are.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  House Bill 903
is U.N.C. and community college credit transfers, is a bill to require
the University of North Carolina system to accept college credit
transfers in from the community college system.  This transfering of
credits is known as the comprehensive articulation agreement, and this
bill was first passed in 1995 by former representative Robert Grady.  18
years later, very little progress has been made in getting the
University system to accept community college credits.  Currently,
English is the only subject universally accepted in the University
system.  The original intent of this legislation was to allow students
to take core subjects such as English, math, science, or history, at the
community college and then have these subjects transfered to the
university of their choice.  Sadly, this has not happened.  Students
enrolled in courses at our community colleges, they enroll with the
expectation that these credits will transfer.  Some U.N.C. institutions
are accepting these credits, while others are not, and we need this
articulation agreement to be in force so that community college credits
are universally accepted.  This bill requires a biannual review of the
comprehensive articulation agreement, with a progress report to be made
to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee by November of each year.
And Mr. Chairman, I think it's a pretty straightforward bill, and I urge
its adoption.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you very much, and see if we
have any questions from a member.  Senator Pate.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Representative Starnes, you and I were both
young pups when this originally came up under Representative Grady's
work, and hard work, in the Education Committee in the House.  I recall
that.  What is the problem?  Why can't the University accept what is the
law?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Well, I will let the universities speak for
themselves, but what we all recognize, that a college education has
become very expensive, and in many instances it's not even affordable to
the average families in North Carolina.  Our community colleges strive
to develop quality courses and offer students an opportunity to have an
affordable education.  So we tell these students, well, you can go to
the community college, and you can take your basic requirements.  It
might be English, history, a math, or a science.  And they take these
classes with the expectation that their credits will then transfer to
the university, where they can work on their degree.  What's happening
is, a lot of times these credits are transferring, but it's as an
elective.  And then they're required to take the history again, or the
science, or the math, whatever.  English is the only subject that is
universally accepted.  And it's not fair to the students and the
community college system, and we just want this articulation agreement
to be so that if you take a science at the community college or a math
at the community college, it's accepted in the University system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Representative Starnes.  Senator Apodaca,
and then Senator Stein.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. Chairman, do we have
anybody here from the University system that could give us a little
explanation of what's happening here?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  I met with
them this morning, and I said, what's the problem?  And the problem is
they've just been dragging their feet a little bit and not...it's a
territorial situation that we find with universities a lot of times, and
I think they realize now we're serious, and that they're going to go
ahead and coordinate well.  And I hope</p>

This log jams broken, because if they come before the oversight
committee they're going to get pointed questions with the camera on them
about why you're not taking these college credits as credits for the
course and not some elected junk.  I think that's going to be solved.  I
did meet with them this morning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]And it sounded like they enjoyed their meeting.  With
that being said, I'll move for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Well, okay, but I'll hold that just for a minute.  I
see Senator Stein and then Senator Tarte.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chairman.  My experience in Wake County
is that Wake-Tech has a transfer program that feeds into NC State, where
NC State gives full respect and credit to the academic programs that
feed into the university system, so I was hoping if there were, I don't
know Mr. Chairman, if there are members from the college system, or
university system who can speak for a minute and give us a little
background, because from my experience, it isn't so.  I'm not saying it
isn't so in other parts of the state, or with other institutions, I'd
just like a little more background.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Well, it's sold to the degree that they're working well
with NC State, but we've got 16, or 17 of these great universities, and
we've got many community colleges, 58, and they're not working together
everywhere.  RCC is working well with one, UNC-G, and most of its stuff
is transferring fine, but they've got so many pockets of resistance,
that this needs to be uniformly done.  Though it's working well in Wake,
and in Randolph, not everywhere.  Senator Rabin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I'm trying to understand if there's a standards issue.
Nobody's really said it, just plain out like that.  Is there a standards
issue that isn't being met?  Is there something written, or is it really
just foot dragging and lack of cooperation?  If it's a standards issue,
that's a bigger issue than just they're not doing their job.  The
expectation of the student is nice to consider, but if there's a
standards problem, then we've got to figure out how to fix that before
we just say it's okay to articulate this stuff, in my opinion.  Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Senator, I don't believe that's the problem.
Senator Bryan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I just wanted to mention that one of the university's
liaison came by my office this morning, and they made it very clear that
they do not have any opposition to this, and it is something that does
need to be worked on.  That is their position.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The position at the top has always been, but I want
that disseminated down to the people that are actually sitting in the
Registrar's office.  I do think Sharon Morrisay is here from the
community colleges, if you want to comment, Dr. Morrisay.  And Senator
Tarte, I'll come back to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Senator.  And thank you for considering this
bill.  I am happy to report that the community college system, and the
university system are working collaboratively right now to strengthen
the articuation agreement that was developed 18 years ago, as
Representative Starnes mentioned.  It has not worked well over those 18
years, primarily because the basic premise of the articulation agreement
is that if a student finishes 44 hours of what we call the generic core,
then all of those courses will transfer to fulfill general education
credit at the university.  The problem is that only 13% of our students
finish the general education core, hence when they go to the university,
their courses are articulated on a course by course basis, and often
they receive elective credit, instead of course credit, for science, or
math, or whatever the discipline is.  So, we are making great progress
in strengthening the articulation agreement.  The community college
trustees association, and president's association full support this
bill.  UNC's general administration does not oppose the bill, and
they're working very collaboratively with us.  We like the bill because
it holds us accountable.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you very much DR. Morrisay.  We have, Senator
Tarte, are you happy with this?  We have a motion from Senator Apodaca,
all in favor of the discussion of the motion?  Hearing none, all in
favor, aye?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Any opposed? No?  The ayes have it, Senator Starnes,
Representative Star, I want you to realize we did, how many House Bills
today? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  How many bill you got holding up over there in
education?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]They've all been released.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Send the message,  Thank you.  we love you.  I believe
that does it for today folks, thank you.</p>
