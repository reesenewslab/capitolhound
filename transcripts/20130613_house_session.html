Members and visitors to the gallery please silence all cellular phones
and personal electronic devices. Sargent at Arms will close the doors.
The prayer will be offered by representative Steinburg. Members and
visitors in the gallery please stand and please remain standing for the
Pledge of Allegiance.
[speaker changes]
Good morning fellow representatives and ladies and gentleman. Before I
offer the prayer, I want to point out that I was given this book that is
dated 1947- you can all see it right here- and these were prayers that
were offered in the senate of the general assembly. They actually had
booklets that each one of the members had and so I will be offering a
prayer from this booklet this morning and I ask you to all please join
me. Let us pray.
Our heavenly father, in this brief moment, we look to thee with love and
praise and gratitude for another day in which to do thy will. We bless
thee for the comfort and rest of the night and for thy promise of a
daily portion for a daily need. May we have strength for our toil,
cleanness of mind for all decisions we must make, and grace to overcome
every temptation to do wrong. May our fellow men and women recognize
something in our acts, speech and disposition that will make them know
that we have had fellowship with thee. There are causes that call for
assistance, wrongs that need redress. We also remember that within the
shadows standeth God keeping watch above his own . So, we pray for
guidance and courage that will enable us to take our places and to do
our full share to answer the call and meet the challenge as men and
women who bear the name Christian. Thou has said if any man lack wisdom,
let him ask of God who giveth to all men liberally and unbraideth not
and it shall be given him. Trusting in thy never failing word, we begin
our work today with thanksgiving in our masters name, we pray. Amen.
[speaker changes]
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God,
indivisible with liberty and justice for all.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bell of Sampson, for what purpose do

[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House.
Though I very seldom get up to talk about anything, I am concerned about
the education portion of the budget, and I want to thank all of the
Chairs for the input that they let us have into it. I sit over here next
to Representative Horn, and I’m always whispering in his ear and talking
to him about different things. And I just appreciate him letting me
giving some input. You know, I came here after 36 years in education,
and my purpose was to try to continue to have an input and to things
that are going on in public schools. One of the things I did find out
that kind of baffled me a little bit, I didn’t know that we had so many
people who had such negative attitudes toward the public school system,
and I’m not talking about this group. I’m talking about ever since I
have been here for seven terms. I’ve not had a budget as Representative
Dollar said yesterday, where I agreed with everything. Not in the seven
years that I’ve been here. There were always some things in there that I
didn’t like, especially when it comes to salary increases for teachers.
When it came to doing some other things for the school system, the money
and whatever, and I know we were limited as to what we could do, but I
just feel like education is the central thing for everything that we do.
It is the basic foundation, and I guess if I had my way I would just
give unlimited funds to it because I believe that’s where the answer is.
You know, we talk about work, and I understand that all of us have
worked real hard last few days, few weeks, and ever since I’ve been
here. But when I was teaching science in school, I remember telling the
kids that if you can push against a wall, exert a force, if you don’t
move that wall, you</p>

...haven’t done anything. We have worked and everything and if we
haven’t done anything positive for the people of North Carolina, then we
haven’t done any work, as far as I’m concerned. So I look at that as I
look at this budget to see just what we have done. I can go along with
probably lots of things I saw in the House budget that were not in the
Senate budget that I like. One of the things I like in particular was
the gap. I think that is going to be a really great for my grandchildren
and for all the people coming along and I really think that’s good. The
end cap, I was glad to see that put back in, and also the teaching
fellows. I remember when that started and I was glad that we can do it
and I hope that those persons who served as conferee will not back off
on that before we get to negotiating with the Senate.
The things that we have in this budget, I want you to hold fast on what
we have because it’s so much better than what they had given to us. The
only thing that really troubles me, and I think it troubles most of the
educated in here, and that is something that I’m not ready for yet and
that is the opportunity scholarships. I don’t know whether I ever will
be, but right now I am not for that, I don’t see that as anything that’s
helping education. I think, and I raced to the top, that’s one of the
things that’s going to carry us to the bottom because I don’t see where
it’s going to do any good. We already have a system going wherever you
want to go, to private schools, you could go, and everything. But I
don’t think we need to take money and use it for private schools. Not
yet. Until we get our schools, the public schools that we have now in
good shape, and we have a long way to go.
One thing too, I’d like to challenge you on, in Sampson County, I think
we have a good school system. In the last two or three years, in the
last four years, ten years, I say, we have built three new high schools.
Representative Langdon knows about that. We built three new high
schools. $26 million each. We have to thank the General Assembly for
some of that from the lottery money and all of that used it to pay for.
Those schools are second to none. We have a good program, we had a North
Carolina teacher of the year. We’ve had a  principal of the year. We’ve
got another one pretty soon and all of that. And we’re doing really good
and I think if you talk to the people back home you’ll find out that
they feel like the public schools are good as well. I haven’t had
anybody to ask me about any scholarships. Not a single one. I don’t
think, I couldn’t come up here and say, in my district I was going to
have their vote for a scholarship program whenever they’re not
interested. They’re interested in improving those schools that they have
in Sampson, Duplin, and Wayne counties. They’re doing a good job and
then they’re getting better all the time. They’re improving. That’s what
I think we should do, work to help improve the situation. I hope that as
we go forward, I know that I can’t stop anybody from passing this budget
because it’s already gone so far that we can’t turn it around, but I’m
just hoping as we negotiate with the Senate and the Governor that we
hold on to what you have here as much as possible. Don’t let them take
anything away. That’s all I have to say.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Wake, Representative Jackson, for what purpose do you
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning, Mr. Speaker. To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good morning everyone. As Sesame Street likes to
say, today’s episode is brought to you by the letter P. People,
priorities, and process. People in this state are hurting and I don’t
believe this budget does much, if anything, to help that. Especially in
the rural communities of this state. You heard Representative Graham
speak yesterday what cutting this prison is going to do to his area.
This budget makes it worse.</p>

…people lay off in the area of public safety, cutting teacher’s
assistance across the state and on that particular thing I wanna speak
to that. Teacher’s assistance who are those in our classrooms everyday,
who help our youngest children, if there is a child that is falling
behind on that effort to get at reading level, at grade level in third
grade, who gives that child that extra help, when you have a child
that’s sick who helps that child so the teacher can focus on the rest of
the class, when you have a child he is had an accident, who is there to
help them to take them to the office we are cutting those teachers. And
off course this is another year without pay raises for our state
employees. Now, it’s easy to come in here and talk about seat warmers
and talk about how we have bad customer service but the truth is if you
want good people to do a good job you have to treat them well and that
has to apply to all of your state employees and not just your top level
secretaries. The second thing I wanna talk about is priorities, the
priorities to this budget or something I just don’t agree with we put
200 million dollars in the Rainy Day Fund and I know that when you have
extra money that’s a good idea we should all have an emergency fund or
savings account but we are putting 200 million dollars in savings but we
are cutting our education budget by 250 million dollars. We are putting
52 million dollars in the reserve fund to repeal the state tax on people
with how about the states why we are putting no money to extend the
earned income tax credit which helps by definition the working floor. We
are putting just this first year of 38.5 million dollars into our tax
reform and 4.5 million dollars extra to pay the Department of Revenue to
implement it. Well, we are taking a tax reform bill that people on the
lower end who are paying next to nothing or nothing an income tax and
now we are gonna pay a lot more in sales tax and then finally the bottom
number on the budget is a 143 million dollars that we have even
appropriate so that’s like our ___[02:20]fund, that’s like our emergency
fund, our average fund and we are doing that while we are cutting 52
million dollars to our hospitals, some of our rural hospitals as you
heard in the medicate whether or not extend medicate or already gonna
get hammered by that decision and now we are gonna cut another 52
million dollars and then the final priority I wanna talk about was
school ___[02:42] and I know my friend Representative Jones will gonna
like my use of the word vouchers to make him feel better I looked it up
last night and Representative Jones I have to know if you go to
Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary the third definition down for voucher
as a noun is a ___[02:58] issued by the government to a parent to use
the fund the child’s education either public or private school. So, I
think the definition does fits on voucher. We have got 12 million
dollars the first year in vouchers I think maybe 50 million dollars the
second year and we have got 24 million dollars going to our teacher’s
assistance and I just don’t understand it. The third thing I wanna talk
about is process and the vouchers is kind of leads me into that and I
wanna talk about the process of putting vouchers in the budget and how I
disagree with that? My friend Representative Brandon, I couldn’t
disagree with him more on this issue but he is very passionate about
vouchers, he worked very hard for these vouchers and yeah yesterday
after day not…But I’m pretty sure he voted against the budget and to my
friends other side out there at least 10 to 15 of you who I know are
against vouchers because that’s all the committee votes but yeah at the
end of the day, you have voted for the budget. So, next time when you
are up for re-election and you run and somebody is gonna be able to say,
“You voted for vouchers and your response is gonna have to be John.”
Well, I voted against him before I voted for. I just don’t think that’s
the way to address a major policy, I just don’t think and that’s right,
somewhere recently talking about all this internet monitoring and
everything, I have heard a quote on radio that someone and you said,
“The democracy dies in the darkness.” And I think the last example I had
is a perfect example for that and this is special provision in the
budget to start on page 246 about re-organization of our district
courts, procedural districts. Representative Baskerville asked a
question yesterday and Representative Baskerville we never discuss that
on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday morning at 08:30 on our appropriation
committee.

It was not discussed. Not one time. Not one time. There was no separate
bill. It was not identified by AOC. It just showed up on last Friday
morning in our Special Provisions. On Tuesday in Appropriations we ran
an amendment, and we ran an amendment to fix what someone realized is
hey guys, the superior court judges that you threw into the same
district, one of them is hearing our redistricting suit. She’s one of
the three-judge panel. We might want to fix that, so somebody ran an
amendment on Tuesday to fix that. Then yesterday another amendment was
run to fix another problem that addressed some issues in some Republican
counties, and I noticed that no Justice and Public Safety chair stood up
and spoke about that provision or about that amendment, but the Rules
Chair did, and he’s not here this morning so I feel unfair picking on
him. There he is. Rules Chair did, and I couldn’t figure that out until
I looked at the numbers. It turns out that Rules chair got a new
district judge in his county with that last minute change in Special
Provision, so of course he supported it. I don’t blame him. I’d support
it if my county was getting a new judge too. Even though there was 33
counties who had more of a need than Cleveland County, he got that
judgeship. Now Representative Mobley had an amendment. She had an
amendment on Tuesday in Appropriations, and there was some back and
forth and everything and she was asked to withdraw that amendment and
said that if she withdrew that amendment, they would work with her on
the floor to fix the problem created with Halifax County. We’ve got
three elected female district attorneys in this state. Two of them are
being put into the same district by this consolidation. They’ll have to
run against each other, and we’re losing two district court judges,
sitting district court judges, one long-term, in Halifax County, and so
she had an amendment to fix that. She was asked to pull it from
Appropriations and wait to run it on the floor, and people would help
her work on it and get it done, and then when she introduced her
amendment yesterday, it was tabled. We didn’t even get a chance to vote
on it. I think that’s wrong. I just think that’s wrong. Representative
Dollar in his closing comments yesterday said a lot of people don’t like
this budget because their fiefdoms aren’t being protected. Well I
disagree with that. Apparently we are creating new fiefdoms at the
expense of our criminal justice system, so for the three Ps – people,
process and priorities – I think this budget fails on all accounts. I’d
ask you to vote red. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Rockingham rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To ask if my friend Representative Jackson would yield to a few
very short questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Wake
yield to the gentleman from Rockingham? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do, Mr.
Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thanks, Representative Jackson. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] He yields. The gentleman may propose his inquiry. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative Jackson, I appreciate
your dictionary definitions. Would you agree with me that one of those
definitions in the dictionary for “voucher” would have to do with a
piece of paper that is similar to a coupon, if you will, that could be
exchanged for goods or services? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to respond. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I
would, and I think if you were actually to take a hardback dictionary
from 15 years ago, that’s the definition that you would find. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow-up, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Would the gentleman
yield to an additional inquiry? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jackson,
would you agree with me that for instance the example I gave yesterday,
that if you took such a coupon or voucher to McDonalds for an ice cream
cone and received that, would you agree with me that before they gave
you that ice cream cone, that McDonalds actually owned the ice cream?
Would you agree with that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would. They have a
product for sale, yes. Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Would the gentleman yield to an additional inquiry? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative, would you agree with me that Burger King would not have
the authority to grant you a voucher or a coupon to go to McDonalds to
get that ice cream? Would you agree with me that that would be fair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would agree with that Representative Jones as well,
and I believe my only point was that I don’t think the use of the word
“voucher” as the News and Observer used it down on their headline,
‘Private School Vouchers at Center of House Budget Debate’, I just don’t
think that’s an incorrect use of the word “voucher” as well. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Last follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] will the gentleman yield to a
final inquiry? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He
yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative, whose children are they? Do
they belong to the parents or to the state? Who has the authority?</p>

Mr. Speaker, of course the children are the children of their parents,
and they're in the legal custody of their parents or legal guardians.
However, our state constitution gives us all in here the legal
responsibility to provide them with a sound basic education. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman from Wake, the representative Martin, for what
purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman, you're
already hearing some ways in which this budget does not prepare us for
the future and let me just add one more part of the budget that falls
line that same pattern, one that folks may not have been aware of. In my
vacation away from this body, I've spent a good amount of time up at the
pentagon, and I think if we're all watching the news, we know that our
military is under great financial pressure from both sides of the
political aisle in congress and it is inevitable that cuts are coming.
And I think it's safe to say that while congress has not yet admitted
it, another round of BRACK is on the way. And the last round of BRACK,
those of you who we're paying attention, will remember that North
Carolina did pretty darn good. You see, at Fort Bragg, we've got Army
Reserve Command, and we've also got Forces Command moved up from
Georgia. Two huge head quarters in a huge building on Fort Bragg. We've
got Pope Air Field, no longer Pope Air Force Base, but we've still got
another Air Force planes there. A little disappointed we lost 7 Special
Forces Group to Florida, but overall Fort Bragg did great. Campus ??
doing just fine also. Seymour Johnson survived, so the last round of
BRACK was good for North Carolina. There are many reasons for that. But
one crucial reason, one piece of that puzzle, was the invests that we
made with our Natural Heritage Trust Fund. And let me tell you why
that's important to our military communities. If you go down to Fort
Bragg and my friend, representative Szoka, I think is a paratrooper;
spent some time at Fort Bragg and perhaps fallen out of a perfectly good
airplane might know what I'm talking about. On the southern part post at
Fort Bragg is St Mere-Eglise Drop Zone. Now when that was built decades
ago, it was kind of in the middle of nowhere, so when they dropped the
paratroopers out, they would just see kind of what looks like a desert
with a bunch of pine trees. The area in Fort Bragg has grown, and that's
brought a lot of prosperity to Sandhills area. But what happens now, is
when you jump out of a plane at St Mere, particularly if the winds are
blowing south to north, the Air Force drops you out of the plane south
of the drop zone, and you look down, if you're not a chicken like me and
can open your eyes up, and frequently it looks like you're looking right
down a subdivision. My point being, growth is right literally at Fort
Bragg borders. It makes it harder and reduces the areas that Fort Bragg
can drop paratroopers. It means there's a lot of people around, Mr.
Speaker, perhaps even in your district we've rattled some of your
windows with our artillery fire at Fort Bragg. It puts a lot of pressure
on Fort Bragg and our military and other military installations, on the
account of training they conduct. Now, the Natural Heritage Trust Fund
has invested money to preserve buffer areas around North Carolina's
military installations. That has been very calculated and that
calculation paid off in the last round of BRACK. This budget cuts funds
like that, that have been intimately invovled in setting up North
Carolina for success in BRACK. This budget does [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just to see if the gentleman from Wake would yield to
a quick question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Martin, do you yield
to an inquiry from the gentleman from Wake? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Speaker, I'd be happy to yield to my colleague from Wake when I'm done.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He does not yield, you have the floor sir, please
continue. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This budget here
with its' cuts and the shifting around of the funds is going to put us
at severe risk. If you want to know one reason why essentially Eastern
North Carolina didn't fall off the economic cliff in the last resession,
look at the growth we got from the last round of BRACK and the high
level of activity in our military installations. Essentially the wars
are one thing that kept Eastern North Carolina alive. That's going away,
we can't depend on that anymore. If you wanna know what impact it can
have, ask the folks that we stole reserve command and forces command
from how they're doing. We don't want that to happen here. Ladies and
gentleman, this budget flat out puts us at risk of losing jobs in the
last round of BRACK, it's something that I hope we don't do or at least
something that I urge us to try and fix in conference. And Mr. Speaker,
I'm happy to yield now to my friend now from Wake County. Representative
Dollar, do you still wish to propose an inquiry to the gentleman from
Wake, if so, he yields and you recognize. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just curious
if he had his parachute on. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry Mr. Speaker, I

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Stokes, Rep. Holloway rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
As I said yesterday, budgeting is not an easy process. And when you
craft a budget that is large as $20 billion, there's gonna be some
things that you like, some things that you don't like. And I think that
the responsible person looks at the budget and weighs what you like as
opposed to what you don't like, and you have to make that responsible
decision. To make comments like &quot;Well I voted for it before I voted
against it,&quot; I think is an example of an irresponsible legislator.
From all I've heard, I've heard a lot of critique and a lot of criticism
about what you didn't get and what you still want. But my question is
where were all the amendments yesterday to help you get those things?
And the reason that a lot of those amendments weren't filed is because
you couldn't find a way to do it. The money's not there. Of course we'd
like to have more, of course you always want more money to budget. But
you've got to live within your means and that's why it's important to
always spend what you've got and run a state budget like a household.
I want to take just a minute to talk about teacher assistants, because
I've continually heard about how we've cut teacher assistants despite
the fact that this budget does far far better than the previous two.
First off, counties have flexibility with every single dollar that we
send them for education. The only thing that they cannot do is move
money from the classroom to the central office. This budget puts funds
there to fund K-3. Yes, there's a $24 million cut, but let me also tell
you that most school systems, there might be a few, but most, have not
had teacher assistants in grades 3 for years. A lot of systems don't
even have assistants in grades 2. So then the question is, what happens
to that money? And this is not a bomb being thrown at superintendents,
but superintendents use that flexibility and spend it on other things.
And I guarantee you, with this budget though there's plenty of money
there to fund grades K2 and K3. They will spend it on other things. No
one's gonna lose teacher assistant jobs because this budget, because we
have more money there, than what there'll be teacher assistants there
are already been hired for that, in my personal opinion.
We've heard comments, they've tied tax reform back into this. Yes, we
know you want the earned income tax credit. That in itself is not tax
reform. Where was your tax reform package? It's easy to criticize and
say you wouldn't do this and you wouldn't do that, well what would you
have done? That's what this all boils down to. Yes, I can find things in
here that I don't like. I know you can. When you were in the majority,
if you had your members to not vote for a state budget because there was
something in there they didn't like, you would have never passed a
budget. This is part of the process. You have to weigh again the good
with the bad, and by far this budget has far, far, far, more good than
things that folks do not like. Yes, we want to do more for our schools,
yes we want to do more for this and more for that. But again, you've got
to live within your means because you never know when the bottom's going
to fall out of the economy again. We just experienced that  last
session. It was because of years of overspending. Years of not putting
what you needed to in reserves. Well those comments Mr. Speaker I will
conclude, but I ask you for the vote for this budget because it is a
good budget for North Carolina, and it does help move us forward. Thank
you.</p>

The lady from Buncombe, Representative Fisher, for what purpose do you
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the budget, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I rise today
to talk about how this budget is irresponsible and unresponsive to the
needs of the most needy people in the state. And to highlight the idea
that this budget is inextricably tied to a controversial Republican tax
plan that gives tax breaks to the wealthiest in our state, to
corporations and individuals, who--while raising the burden on the
middle class and those who are less able to pay. In the example that I
want to use in illustrating how the tax plan is being used to pay for
some of the cuts that you see in the budget is the program called the
Displaced Homemaker Program. We were successful in restoring one year of
funding for that program in the budget, which puts it in contention, and
I'm glad of that, because now it will go to conference and there will
have to be some discussion about that program. But I want you to know
that before that, it would have been zeroed out completely. And
currently, or last year, that program, the Displaced Homemaker Program,
which by the way helps women and men, not just women, 5,700 individuals
received training through those programs. There are 34 of them across
the state. The training helped them learn job skills, achieve financial
literacy, and work toward community college certification, and it gave
them the skills necessary to move them from dependence to independence.
And it includes a category of people called, that are known as
&quot;persistently underemployed.&quot; And sadly, North Carolina ranks
fourth in the nation in underemployed individuals. So we can talk about
how North Carolina is heading into the future, and we know that the
Democrats were responsible for at least one of those recessionary
budgets that had to, that included a lot of cuts, but for three biennium
in a row, we have seen cuts that are specifically a burden to the middle
class and the lower class of our citizens in North Carolina. We can do
better. We must do better. And I hope that this budget will improve in
conference, but as it stands right now, I am not going to be able to
support the budget, and I urge my colleagues to vote against it. Thank
you, Mr. Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, many of you know that I don't speak a lot, but the
words I heard about this bill puts the military at risk. Made me stand
up. As many of you know, I cover four counties in the east of North
Carolina, one of which houses the greatest Fourth Fighter Wing, it's
Seymour Johnson, and the other is Cherry Point. This body, this session
has done more in legislation to protect our military bases. Whether it
be House Bill 484, protecting against windmill encroachment, House Bill
433, which protected a five-mile buffer all around ?? ??. We have done
this. Representative Szoka put a bill in to allow military individuals
to have CDLs when they leave the military to go right into jobs here in
our state. Not only that, our budget, both House and Senate, sets aside
a million dollars to help us defeat ?? when it comes up. So to say that
this budget</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar, for what purpose do you rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if the gentleman is in the room. Is
Representative Martin in the room, gentleman from Wake County? See if he
would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Wake does yield to the other
gentleman from Wake and you may propose your inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are you familiar with page 169 of the budget lines 32
through 34?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I left my copy at the budget on the other side. So,
I’m not having photographic recall memory. But, Mr. Speaker, I’d yield
for him to go ahead and enlighten me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman wish to propose an additional
inquiry?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Propose an additional question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I asked the gentleman this question, do those lines
not read as follows? And this is additional language to the clean water
management trust fund. Purposes of that fund, quote. To provide buffers
around military bases or for State matching funds for the Readiness and
Environmental Protection Initiative, a federal funding initiative that
provides funds for military buffers. Does the budget not say that on
page 169 lines 32 through 34? And in fact it does say that, referring to
the same clean water management trust fund that once had one hundred
million dollars in it including 2 million dollars set aside in the last
round of bracks specifically to preserve that. You can name it whatever
you want, you can shuffle things around, call it whatever you want but
when you cut it, you’re not making responsible investments to protect
North Carolina in the next round of brack and that is appalling. Final
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Will the gentleman from Wake yield to an additional
inquiry?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And what party was in charge when the clean water
trust fund was originally cut?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We were together to create it and we funded it
together at a 100 million.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Durham, Representative Luebke, for
what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House. I
want to remind everyone that this budget cannot be separated from House
Bill 998, the bill that we passed last week to provide massive tax cuts
to the millionaires of this state. And I make that point, some have
already referenced it this morning, but I make that point because this
morning, my friend Representative Holloway and yesterday afternoon
evening, Representative Dollar; both emphasized and I wrote it down – we
have to live within our means. Living within our means or I think
Representative Holloway used it and I have jotted it down, the money is
not there. Well friends, the money is not there because 290 million
dollars was given via a tax cut to 8500 tax filers. These 8500 tax
filers, millionaires and multi-millionaires receive a tax break of 290
million dollars under the tax bill that we’ve sent to the senate. So
when we talk about living within our means, well excuse me, but you had
290 million dollars additional that could do so much as; beginning with
Representative Jackson, folks on our side have said – pay increases for
state employees, pay increases for public school teachers, not cutting
teacher assistance so badly. Those are just some that come immediately
to mind. So, it’s just not right. It’s not correct to say that we
couldn’t do more for the people of this state. And I think each of you
who supports this budget will have to go home and tell the state
employees and the public school teachers and the teaching assistants
that you on, as you put the two things together, you decided that
millionaires and multi-millionaires.</p>

&lt;h3&gt;needed a tax cut more than they needed a raise or even to keep
their jobs. That is just wrong, what you did, but I also think, I hope
the people of your district will ask you about it and ho9ld you
accountable for it. Now let me say secondly, and this is something I
wish, I very much wish I would not be having to discuss today but I very
strongly, although I was ?? I very strongly supported Representative
Hanes' amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

purpose do your rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Wonder if Representative Luebke would yield for a question,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would the gent from Durham yield for an inquiry.

When I am finished Mr. Speaker, Representative Collins, I'm happy to do

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He does not yield, he has the floor, sir. You may continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I didn't want to debate this, I wish I weren't
debating this today, but we have to because of the vote yesterday. And I
thought about hits last night, and it can only be this way to those who
area advocates of the ?? Bill.  What are you afraid of? What were you
afraid of? I mean, I'm trying to put myself in your role.  If this
voucher program is such a fine idea for the people of North Carolina,
why not have the courage to vote, have it as a standalone bill, and vote
for it up or down. What you really did was duck that up or down vote.
And the people of North Carolina deserve that vote. Each of us I'm sure,
each of you have gotten as much mail as I have on this bill. This is a
critical question for the future of this state. Because even though it's
been paired back 230% the draft of firstly the original bill was 300%
and that probably tells us where the bill's sponsors want the income
level to go. So what were you afraid of? It just doesn't make sense.  If
your bill is defensible, you should've been happy to vote for the Hanes
amendment and have it as a separate issue. But you didn't , so I need to
make a couple points, and this, if members of the House Education
Committee will remember, I am very concerned about the conflict between
religion and schools, the church/state separation, and I mentioned in
com a couple examples on what I had done research on and how I'd done
more, and I looked at a school, and my question is really how can we, to
get to the bottom line, how could we put taxpayer money in the schools
that are openly, and above board, committed to a specific religious
belief. I don't understand how that will sustain a test. I do know that
the US Supreme Court has given a wide latitude on this issue by saying
the money goes to the parents. But I think we're reaching, we're at a
new point. Let's me just list the top objectives of what I will call
Piedmont Christian School, I pulled it off the school's website, I'm
going to keep it anonymous. The first objective of Piedmont Christian
School is quote to lead each student to a knowledge of Jesus Christ as
his Lord and Savior. Members of the house, that is absolutely an
important belief system. It is part of our country's belief, we have
freedom of belief. We should not, in my judgment, be putting taxpayer
money into the school who's #1 objective is that. And if you're not
convinced, let me read you objective #2. To encourage students to
utilize their spiritual gifts in the work of evangelism and
discipleship. Again, an honorable goal. But, with taxpayer money? You
know, I searched here in the bill for any issue of accountability, for
curriculum that are used in this school. There is no accountability for
a school's curriculum, and to have a school, and this was not the only
one, I just gave this one as one would ??s stated straightforwardly, I
would just ask the advocates for the bill, not going to ask ?? question,
don't want to prolong it, but Representative Bryan and others who were
primary sponsors, my democratic colleague Representative Brandon, how do
you make this work? Allowing taxpayer money to go to a school that's so
openly declares that its curriculum point 1 point 2 is ?? the Christian
faith. Thank you members, I urge you to vote &quot;no&quot; for this
bill.

...yes, what I'm saying is an example of what, how priorities were
established in your budget and linking it to your, Chairman Lewis's tax
cut bill. 8500 filers -- that's 0.2%, a fifth of one percent of North
Carolinians, would have a $290-million-dollar tax break.
Maybe I've been misinformed, but you were talking about...
Additional question?
Does the gentleman yield?
I yield.
The gentleman may propose the question.
Thank you; sorry for that. You realize, in the budget, that we have had
to spend an additional, for the biennium, $1.2 billion, in new money,
for the biennial budget, for Medicaid and for the woodworking effect of
the Affordable Care Act. You realize that we're having to pay for that
in this budget, $1.2 billion.
Representative Dollar, in this budget and in the tax bill, the middle
class of working families are hurt. You mentioned $1 billion-plus; I
didn't get it exactly, but $1 billion-plus. Let me assure you that that
$1 billion-plus would be $290 million less of a hit on all of us, all
the rest of us, if the priorities of your caucus were not, would not
have been -- I know what you're going to say, you're going to say I
sound like a broken record -- we'll say it again. 8500 filers, less than
one-fifth of one percent, receiving $290 million.
Those numbers come, Representative Dollar, from our fiscal staff. They
were never rebutted by anyone on your side as we debated this bill from
the House Finance Committee through second and third reading on this
floor. The $290 million given to the millionaires and hurting the middle
class and working families, that's what I object to in this budget, and
I vote no, thank you.
Rep. Collins: Mr. Speaker.
The Speaker Pro Tempore: Representative Collins, please state your
purpose.
Rep. Collins: To ask if Representative Lewis would yield for a question?
Does the gentleman yield for a question?
Mr. Lewis you mention that if we had not done away with that tax, we
could give a pay increase to state employees was one of your examples. I
was wondering, back in 2009, when your side was in charge of the General
Assembly, and you had an historic tax increase, putting an extra percent
sales tax on everybody in the state, including the poorest of people,
and also increased the income tax, how much of that went for raises for
state employees?
Did you want me to answer that, or is that a rhetorical question?
Do you have the floor? Only a handful of you on the Republican side were
here in 2009, but I think if you were reading the newspapers you'd know
that 2009 was the worst, the worst year for the economy of the United
States since the Great Depression. It's during 2009 that the term Great
Recession, juxtaposed to Great Depression, was coined. And in that
setting, we had to make as the Majority, and I was Senior Chair of
Finance, Representative Shaw was Senior Chair of Appropriations, Speaker
Hackett [??] at the time.
We had to make a decision. How bad did we want to make it, particularly
in the area of public education. How far down did we want to go? We had
temporary, and they were temporary two-year increases. Anyone who was
here knows that I had a big chunk of that bill. It was focused on higher
income tax rates for millionaires and those making more than $250,000.
And we caucused, we had a caucus debate, and a few people thought we
ought to put a little more emphasis, partly on the income tax surcharge
-- it wasn't a tax increase, it was a surcharge for the high-end people
-- and there was a temporary sales tax.
Mr. Speaker?

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the budget Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much Mr. Speaker, and members, let me start off by saying
my thanks to Representative Horn and Representative Blackwell and
Representative McGrady who were the co chairs of the education
subcommittee that I was privileged to serve on. I've been here 10 years,
my first 4 were in finance, my last 6 or now 7 on appropriations, and I
have never been part of a budget subcommittee better than the one that
I've sat on. From a process point of view, the committee's chemistry was
incredibly good, there was information sharing at all levels. There was,
in my view, genuine requests for priorities. There was , in fact, and
I've told them this, I think I learned a great deal if I ever have the
opportunity again, about to how to chair a budget committee far better
than I did when I had the opportunity to do it. So my comments that will
explain why I voted last night against the budget should be prefaced
with it has absolutely nothing to do with the process which I think was
incredibly open, transparent,and fair in our subcommittee, and I thank
the gentlemen chairs for what they, how they proceeded all the way
through the year. Nor, should I say, that my opposition is from many of
the decisions that we made in the subcommittee, although, with the
exception of the voucher decision, which we have now all argued, to the
point that we may never want to utter the word again. There are, as
Representative Dollar said last night, every budget, no matter who you
are, there are things you're going to like and things you aren't going
to like. So that's true in this one. But on the whole the priorities
that were in the education budget given the constraints they were under
were not ones that I disagreed with. But now let me talk about why I do
strongly oppose the budget with that in mind. There's no way to separate
out obviously revenue from the resources that you're expending. And I
can't help but follow some of my colleague's  thoughts that the sort of
naked tax cut for the wealthy that we just passed that's barely covered
with the fig leaf of reform, seriously affects availability. And
regardless of what we end up doing on reform, at some point, there had
always been a thought that to get something substantial passed, it would
have to be revenue neutral. Of course, our's is not revenue neutral, nor
is the plan in the Senate. And so, the constraints that that puts on the
targets that the subcommittees have to do their job is really
fundamentally, for me, the big issue that we have here today. With some
other exceptions. And, I think again Representative Dollar is right and
Representative Holloway, that you have to sort of balance the good and
the bad as a good friend says you have to also remember in context we
try to do a little bit better each year and try not to harm each year,
but in the context of that balancing text, for me this budget fails for
a variety of reasons. My job today on the floor is simply to talk about
the things I know a little bit more about than all those things I know
nothing about, and that's the education side. In K12, we've now assumed
a position that I feared several years ago when we were in charge, and
that is we have come to believe that the revenue figures that we're
operating under are the new normal. Well now three years down the road
under the Republican control they're not new anymore.
&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

<p id="065:00">
..and I will say after looking at all of our southern states they're not
normal anymore. This year when we fund at the same levels or in some
cases less than what we did last year in education. Florida realizing
the error of their ways pumped an additional 1 billion dollars into
their education budget this spring. We just got data from Georgia which
has a 6.4 percent increase in it's higher education budget and a 1.1
percent increase in it's elementary and secondary. Mississippi had a 2.5
percent increase in elementary and secondary and a 5.6 percent increase
in it's higher education budget and Texas much like Florida has
desperately struggled to put together well over a billion dollars to
refund cuts that they took in the last couple years in their education
budget. All recognizing I think that if we fail at the most important
task we are given which is education of the next generation we fail at
everything. Here's what my problems are in K twelve. The two highest
priorities that I think every member of the sub-committee said when we
went around the room at the beginning of the year were to make sure that
there were substantial teacher pay raises and that we did as much as we
could to cut in to the discretionary cuts for the schools. Those
discretionary cuts I will remind many of you are cuts that began in 2008
and 2009 because we had no choice. As hard as the budget is for you all
this year you can't begin to imagine how hard it was when that hit when
the state loses 40 percent of it's revenue in a 90 day period and so we
did a number of things, including starting what we now call the
discretionary cut but that was meant to be short lived and it was meant
to be reduced over time and where are we now 5 years later the third
under republican budget we haven't reduced it a wit not really a wit and
in fact some of the budget proposals suggest it will be increased. Short
term sacrifice in the schools was what we had to demand at a time of the
greatest recession but we cannot continue to suspect and believe that
teachers can continue to due in the short term sacrifice was required
for the long term and not have it dramatically effect quality. The
second issue we said was teacher pay and aside from the minuscule 1.2
percent raise last year there hasn't been one in the 5 years since the
recession hit. I would rather get rid of every new item in the budget in
all budgets and fund state employees and teachers a substantial pay
raise this year and next year and continue to put additional things in
the budget that we cannot fund and sustain without using the money that
we would have for our people. The Governor talks a lot about marketing
the state and that's wonderful but you know the market is right there
and what we market our are people, our natural resources, our
universities, our community colleges and this budget invests in none of
them in any serious way and that is to me when you are 46 or 45 pick a
survey in the nation in teacher pay and headed down with all these other
states are increasing pay absolutely the wrong way to go. Cuts to public
education continue this year 24 million more in teacher assistance, 26
million next year, 4 million in supplies, 2 million next year in
supplies but those figures aren't great in the large amount of money
that's there but they are great in the context of all of these
categories have now been cut every one of these years, going into this
year there is an ongoing recurring cut for supplies of 38 million non
recurring, 3 million recurring.</p>

personnel 23 million, for non-instructional personnel 60 million. That's
on top of the discretionary cut. These are people. The education budget
is 85% people. There is no longer any way to avoid the conclusion that
we are seriously in a modu constitutionally affecting the ability to
provide children a sound, basic, fundamental education. There's no way
to avoid that. What else am I concerned with in this budget? I'm
concerned with the fact that we have in effect eliminated from this
budget over the last several years any semblance of professional
development. Any semblance. I am really grateful to our Chairs, who had
the courage to put back the teaching fellows positions and NCAT, which
was taken out I might add-- in my view, last session for entirely
political and non-?? reasons. But they are at least back in and they
should be given credit for that - we should as a body. But if you look
at all the countries around the world where students are excelling in
which we love to compare the charts on, what they will tell you is
professional development is one of the biggest things they invest in and
we do almost none of it. And then there's community colleges. Now I
think-- I had not seen the last two years, or the two years prior, an
attack of the community colleges that they were seriously being hurt.
They understood and they dealt with the cuts. But you all have seen what
I've seen in the last couple days and that is, the President Rall(?)
says, and I got a call from my president, &quot;This is a bad budget. It
will not allow them to do the things that we are now continuing to
assign them to do.&quot; And then we have the university system. We have
yet another year of large tuition increases, exacerbated by the
additional increase we put to non-residents students in the budget. The
university is whopped with another 110 or 120 million discretionary cut,
on top of an existing $580 million cut. Their budget from us is only
about, as I recall, two and a half to three billion dollars. And we're
talking about, about $700 million worth of cuts to them, that they're
supposed to absorb, and then somehow with a straight face say that's not
affecting quality or access or availability. And then we don't increase,
luckily we don't cut financial aid, but tuitions we shoot up. We know
there's problems in Washington with financial aid being matched, and we
don't increase financial aid for students. We know that we had a number
of students dropping out early this fall because they just couldn't put
packages together. And so there's no way to avoid saying that this
budget doesn't hurt access and availability and quality at our
institutions. I'm sorry that I disagree about the budget because I
really think one of these years it would be nice, no matter who's in
charge, if we could actually all come together and find a common ground.
And that may happen at conference, but this budget does serious harm.
And the argument that's being used, that we have no choice, is not true.
We have choices, it's just that we don't like some of the other choices.
Well, for that four-year-old who can't get into preschool, for that
18-year-old who can't get into college, for the K-12 teacher who no
longer has a teacher assistant and has to handle 25 kids, 24 kids, in
second grade, for that university class that's not available so it means
a student can't graduate on time, for all the resources that aren't
available for our underprivileged children who come in at a disadvantage
to begin with, they don't have another year for us to wait. We have an
obligation to them. The highest priority of this state is to educate its
next generation and this budget fails to do that. All the reasons I've
articulated, and I'll be glad to answer any questions where I would find
the resources, and for all of the reasons I've articulated I cannot vote</p>

For this budget, despite the yen my closing comment, that I believe that
the chair is operated in extraordinary good faith. And in the best
process of involving us as possible. But the final product hurts the
state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from spokes representative Holloway
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the budget a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has recognized to speak on the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to start off by first addressing some of
the comments that representative Luebke made. He talks about these tax
cuts for millionaires and how that is impeding us in what we need to do
with the budget. But I want to remind you that the first thing that he
said when things first started going down hill that his party's response
was to raise taxes. They created a temporary tax. If my memory serves me
well, last session, when that temporary tax expired, his party wanted to
keep it, wanted to keep moving forward with it. I also wanted to remind
you that probably for nearly a decade, and definitely for the first six
years that I spent here for the minority, their answer for revenue needs
was always going and taxing the poor. Sales tax increase, sales tax
increase, sales tax increase. That's all I ever saw, that's all we ever
heard. We know that is a very regressive tax, and it hurts the poor. The
folks that the democrat party wanted to help. They constantly went and
took it out of their pockets. Sales tax hurts them worse than anyone.
The budget that we started with last session was the worst shortfall in
state history. That temporary tax that they created didn't work. In my
opinion, it dug the hole deeper because you spent money on banking a tax
that you didn't collect. The economy was going south. And folks, we
still are in tough times. But even that budget where you put that
temporary tax in place, you put no pay increase in there. None. Why
didn't you? Our budget that we have here, it does have a compensation
for a year or two. We understand the importance of giving pay-raises. We
want to do it. We still have conference. But we're trying to make steps
towards giving that pay-raise in a year or two. We gave one last year.
Yes, it was 1.2%, but it was better than the year before. 1.2%'s better
than zero. And the discretionary cut. There's comments made about that.
And I may be wrong, but my memory serves me that the discretionary cut
was actually born in 2002, 11 million dollars. And it had grown to over
400 million dollars by the time that we took control. We reduced that
discretionary cut, the money that counties have to send back to the
state. We reduced it last year to around 376 million dollars. We've got
a long ways to go, I'm sure, but we didn't build it. We didn't create
it. And every year that we've been in charge, we've chipped away at it.
This budget here chips away at it here, ever so slightly, but it does
chip away. And in a year or two, it keeps it constant in year one. It
chips away at it in year two. And I'll remind you that the dollars that
they're sending back, that was billed into their budgets last year. We
didn't increase it any this year. So we certainly have done no harm with
the discretionary cut, and again, we have tried to repair it. The budget
that we took so much criticism from you all last year, actually we came
back with a surplus this year. But our surplus was eaten away from the
affordable care act that your president passed in Washington, DC, and
sent it to us, and it ate all of our surplus. So folks, again,</p>

Tell me what taxes you want to increase for this budget. I'm, I'm very
curious. I wanna know. More sales tax increase, if so how much? You
wanna tax those millionaires that you keep talking about. How much you
gonna get? How much is it going to yield? Does it pay for all the wish
list that you put out on the floor today? Mr. Speaker I'll end my
comments there, thank you.
[Speaker change]
The gentleman from McDowell, Representative Dobson. For what purpose do
you rise?
[Speaker change]
To debate the bill.
[Speaker change]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[Speaker change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I wanna first begin by touching on what
Representative Glazier talked about with process. Because process is
very important to me. I don't like overreaching or heavy handedness, and
I want to start by saying I think our chairman have been more than fair
with the process. I think that's been overlooked to a certain extent.
Yesterday or the day before Chairman Dollar in the subcommittee, or in
full approach allowed every amendment to be heard, full debate,
everything was discussed, everything was debated, and everything was
voted on. In my subcommittee in the ENR Representative Mcelrath and
Representative West listened to our concerns. Both democrat and
republican had on the rule center and worked to include funds for that,
because we had concerns with it. I had an issue yesterday,
Representative Blackwell, I talked to him on an education issue, he
looked at it. He said he didn't have a problem with it, talked to me
about how we can make it better, and the amendment passed on the floor
yesterday. Representative Cleveland, Representative Brown in general
government I had some issues there that I had some concern.
Representative Brown had lunch with some folks from my district. Talked
to Representative Cleveland many times about it. So and Representative
Holloway I've met with several times on some things from the budget that
I would like to see. So I think the process should be commended for the
way this process has went forward. Nobody can say that things have not
been heard, things have not been discussed, things have not been voted
on. I think that's important. So I wanted to start with that. And I also
wanted to say that when it comes to budgeting I know as a former county
commissioner and now in this body, you don't get everything you want.
Every policy that you'd like to see, everything in funding for your
district or less funding here, we do not get everything that we would
like to have in budgets. I've made no secret that I'm opposed to the
opportunity scholarships. I've made that clear from the beginning. I
voted against it every time that we had a chance to vote on it. I would
like to have seen a crime lab for the west, it was something we just
didn't have the funds for and I understand that. But when you don't get
everything in a budget that you want, you just don't take your ball and
go home and say I'm done. You look at the overall package of how things
are, you look at each section of the budget, you look at each committee,
you look at each area of appropriations and then make your decisions
based on that. And overall I think our chairman, I think those in the
committees did a great job. I think it's a reasonable budget, I think
it's a measured budget, and overall I think it's something that we can
support, and I encourage you to do the same. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker change]
The gentleman from Guilford Representative Brandon. For what purpose do
you rise?
[Speaker change]
To debate the bill.
[Speaker change]
The gentleman has the floor to speak on the bill.
[Speaker change]
I, when I first started this year, I was very excited about the
opportunities that we had as a body to really change the course and the
way we deal with budget issues. And I thought when we dealt with finance
and tax reform that we would actually do that. Instead what we did was
just more of the same. And I thought that, I don't know why, but I
thought for sure that we would look at tax reform and say how much money
does it take to really run this state. And then create the revenue to do
that. But we didn't do that. We didn't even come close to doing that. So
we're still here, everybody's ?? this great reform but we're still here
debating budget issues that we're talking about core issues of this
state that we cut. I'm not talking about what we go and talk about at
the county convention. All these people are wasteful spending, and this
is wasteful spending, and this is more.
[Speaker change]
Mr. Speaker. If the gentleman will yield for what purpose.
[Speaker change]
Will Representative Brandon yield for a question?
[Speaker change]
I'll yield as soon as I finish.
[Speaker change]
He does not yield. You have the floor sir, please continue.</p>

<p id="085:00">
Well I know that we can go to the county convention and we can say oh
this is forks bill spending and this is that and the other but the truth
is none of those people ever get cut. It's teacher's assistants that get
cut. It's roads and projects that gets cut. That's the reality. All of
these things that we talk about in the county convention are not even
budget line items and so we make these promises to folks that so we'd
have to cut the budget and so we're being lean and we're doing all of
these things and everybody's excited about it until they realize that it
was a program that they liked that got cut. It was their teacher
assistant in their third grade class that got cut. It was their schools
that got cut. It was their health care program that got cut. We don't
talk about that at the county convention and we had a very great
opportunity this year to be able to deal with tax reform and create
enough revenue so we won't have to have this debate every single year. I
think somehow subconsciously we like to do it. We love to come in here
and talk about oh we want to do this is the priority for this this is
the priority for that. We've done it for years and decades. We finally
had the opportunity not to do that and we're still here having the same
conversation that we've had for 40 50 years. The same exact conversation
so nothing has really changed and people want to know how does Marcus
support the opportunity tax scholarship or vouchers and not support the
budget. It is because of the budget that I support opportunity tax
scholarships and vouchers because it's the same budget that we've always
seen. We have never adequately supported public education. We have never
done the things that we needed to do to make sure that all kids have a
fair shake. We have never made sure that we got rid of the of the summer
fiasco where all of my kids have to go take a two month break and get
far behind. It costs too much money. We don't deal with the face that we
want to raise the age to 18 to make sure that people don't drop out of
school cause we don't have enough money. And then everybody looks and me
and says oh you should just wait until we make all these changes and
then all of this fantasy world with public education will be great and
everybody will be happy and everybody will be learning. Well guess what.
I know better than that. I have seen it happen since I was a kid budget
after budget whether it's the State House or in county commission people
throwing chairs people yelling at each other about what the budget looks
like and how it's not adequately funded and you want me to continue to
wait till my kids adequately be served. I will not do it. I support the
opportunity scholarship because of budget. I hope that in the future
that when we're debating budgets and we're debating tax reform that we
will just be realistic. How much does it cost to run this state
adequately. How much does it cost to make sure that all of our teachers
are paid a good salary. How much does it cost to make sure that all of
our roads and projects are done. How much does it cost to make sure that
no one is sitting in the hospital with a bad bill or has to get sent
home because they don't have adequate coverage. How much does it cost
for all of those things to happen? And then you make a tax reform plan
around that. We did it backwards. So there is no way to know. We came up
with the plan and never looked at how much does it really cost to run
the state. Why would you ever do that? My point is that we have the
excellent opportunity to in conference and elsewhere to be able to look
at this in a reasonable manner. But I have to vote against this budget
because of all of the things that's in the budget and all of the things
that hurt regular people. Not just poor people but middle class people.
Folks we're still at 9.4 percent unemployment. Hadn't moved a bit. Not
one inch. That is a realistic conversation and we gotta have it. You can
say all of these things create jobs by the transit of property but the
people of the state of North Carolina look at one property. The number
9.4 percent. That's where it was when you came in power. That's where it
is right now. Not moved an inch. So I say that we need to take a look
back and revisit what priorities are and what makes moving forward
moving forward. What really runs this state, how do we do it adequately
and if we can do that we can all sit down and we can all vote for a
budget. But today I'm gonna urge my colleagues to vote no.

<p id="090:00">
[Speaker changes.]...first begin by acknowledging the good job that
Representative Hollo and Representative Avila and Representative Brisson
did with the Health and Human Services Budget.  We had...came into the
budget with many issues on the table...many, many of them were
addressed.  They were very responsive in committee.  I hope...I will
appeal to you to do everything you can to hold those gains that we made
in conference committee because the Senate budget is significantly worse
than our House budget. Even tho' I am very happy with what we did and
the gains that we made in the Health and Human Services Budget.  Taken
as a package, our budget overall and our tax package fall far short of
what we could do or what we should do.  I think that this comment about
living within our means is very significant. A low income family that
was working two jobs wouldn't buy an expensive bauble for a rich ??????
while they were putting their children to bed hungry and that's what
this package does.  The budget and the tax package together takes money
out of our budget, that our hungry children need...that our hungry
education system needs. With all the bills that we pass every year, the
budget is clearly...is the one that most clearly reflects our
priorities.  This budget continues a three-year trend of hurting our
middle and working-class families. A three-year trend of jeopardizing
our children's future. A three-year trend of ignoring our desperate need
for jobs and stimulating our economy and a trend of undermining the
ability of our rural parts of our state to compete with the urban parts
of our state. You've heard a lot of other people speak about the cuts
that were in the budget...we did have an opportunity to address some of
these through our tax package but also through taking this opportunity
through our budget to expand Medicaid.  We rejected that earlier on.  We
could've fixed that in the budget. We chose not to do that. If we had
done that, Medicaid expansion would've brought ???? 10 billion dollars
into our funds, into our state over a period of five years. It would've
boosted our local economies, the regional economic model that was used
to estimate our Medicaid expansion would've created 25,000 new jobs.
We're supposed to be focusing on jobs.  That bill would've helped us
expanded our job market. Even the indirect costs, the multiplier effect
would have been estimated 2300 healthcare related jobs that would've
come in part of our expansion. We also, because we rejected Medicaid
expansion, lost access to preventive care that would've reduced the cost
of operations and treatments for the uninsured and low income.  We
talked about our re-base this year and how much money we put in for the
'woodwork effect'? That is an investment in our future. That will result
in a savings to our state. Our CCNC has demonstrated that it saves money
in Medicaid. The way we save money in healthcare is to keep people
healthy and the Affordable Care Act has free, preventative services in
it to focus on keeping people healthy. The Kaiser Family Foundation
found that 2/3 of the uninsured are the working poor.  These families
are working but their employer does not offer healthcare. Through an
expansion in Medicare we would've been able to cover these families. I'd
like to remind my friends that...if...that also if you... if helping
bringing money into the state to help our economy or bringing money
into...or expanding Medicaid in order to create new jobs.  If that isn't
convincing enough, we could take a look at the fact that it actually
saves lives. A recent study showed that a Medicare expansion, including
the 500,000 people who are not insured...if we had covered those people,
provided them healthcare, we actually would've saved almost 3000 lives
next year. People who don't have insurance die because they don't have
insurance.

I recently heard a man who lost his job who was diabetic, his insurance
cost – his prescription drug costs – were 500 dollars a month. He
couldn’t afford those so what he did was try to do more lifestyle
changes – exercise more, eat better food, cut his prescription drugs in
half. He began to show his symptoms of diabetes again and he now faces
the reality that he may die. Another gentleman that I heard of recently
had a job for 110 thousand dollars a year. When he lost his job, the
only job he could find was a 30 thousand dollar job a year that had no
health insurance for him or his family. Those are people in our
counties. Each one of us, we have uninsured people in every one of our
counties. We come to the General Assembly to take care of those people,
to make sure that we do what we can to provide healthcare for them, to
provide jobs for them, and we’ve made a decision not to do that. That’s
an intentional decision. Finally I’d like to just remind people here
that by rejecting Medicare, we don’t hurt President Obama or Democrats.
We hurt the people who live in our districts. For that reason and for
others, I cannot vote for this bill, and I hope that you will take the

consultation with the speaker and with the minority leader, the Chair’s
been asked to announce that after all members who seek that chance to

minutes to pass before the actual vote. There are several members of the
House who have been called to presrnt bills in Senate committees, so the

I have no Churchill quote for today. I have plenty but I’m not going to
use one, and I really don’t expect to change any votes, but I can’t help
but give just a couple of brief observations. Can’t help myself. I
should know better but I don’t. My first observation is my life
experience tells me that pretty much nothing is as bad as we fear or as
good as we hope. That’s pretty much how it works, and I feel like that’s
exactly what this budget does. I don’t think it’s the end of the world
and I don’t think we’re going to devastate public education in North
Carolina forever and ever, and nor do I think that we’ve saved really
much of anybody or much of anything. It is what it is. I greatly
appreciate hearing the comments from both sides about the sub-chairs and
the process. That’s a good sign for the future of our legislature. I
think there are some several things that we did well – not great, but
well – and there are some things that I wish we could have done, I
really wish we could have done, that we did not do, but it is what it is
given the constraints that we have, and we have to work in the moment.
This is what we’ve got to work with. Representative Brandon said we need
to know what it’s going to cost, and then we work our tax policy and our
budget based on that. I suggest that that’s an illusion. What’s it going
to cost? I have yet to see anybody firmly tell me without maybe a little
grin on their face</p>

<p id="100:00">
Well here’s what it’s going to cost because the moment you agree to
that, it’s “Oh, I forgot about this”. So that’s a great idea. It’s like
zero base budgeting. I really like that idea, but I want to know who
here wants to stay all year long, 16-hour days to go through the zero
base budgeting process. So I’m going to end my brief comments with a
challenge – a challenge to every person in this House. Get out in the
schools and volunteer in the classroom. Ride with the policemen, a
uniformed patrolman at night, two o’clock in the morning. Ride in a
garbage truck. Work in a jail. Get out there. Stop pontificating and get
out there and understand. We’ve heard about how people are hurting, and
they are hurting, and the recession’s not over. I don’t care what some
department or somebody in Washington DC says. It’s not over. We’ve got
to do what we’ve got to do to understand and work with… Have a couple of
shots out there for some things to go right, and stop shaking our
fingers at people. Listen. Get involved. Do it. We can save hundreds of
millions of dollars if every one of us would just pick up a shovel and a
broom. I’m asked all the time what’s wrong with this place, what’s wrong
with you people. I say “I’ll tell you what’s wrong: Look in the mirror.”
We’ve got to do it, not talk about it. This budget… Am I really proud?
“Oh, this is a great budget.” It’s as great as it is for what we’ve got.
Would I like more? Who here wouldn’t  want more? Every one of us, “I
want to do more for my county.” [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Horn, if you’ll yield. Representative Blust, for
what purpose does…? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative Horn will
yield for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield to the
gentleman from Guilford? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I can’t help myself. I’m just
dying ??. I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Horn, I want to help
– [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blust. Did you say you would yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, I did. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman does
yield. You may ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I want to help, you I’d like for you
to explain to me how my picking up a shovel can help with this budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] How you picking up a shovel would help entertain all
of us. Representative Blust, I appreciate the question, and you know
exactly the point I’m getting at, and I appreciate the entertainment. As
I said, I expect I’m not going to change any votes, which would be one
of my goals when I stand up to talk, and the other one probably is to
entertain, and that’s part of that process. I’m just asking all of us,
the process does not end here, like has been said by Representative
Lewis, today’s Speaker Lewis, that this is not an event; it’s a process.
We’ve all got to be involved in that every day. We can do a lot better,
but I think what we’ve done is pretty darn good given the pieces of the
puzzle we’ve got. I encourage you – truly, I encourage you. Vote for
this budget, please. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. The gentleman from Durham… The gentleman from Durham,
Representative Michaux, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Top speak on this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to
debate Senate Bill 402. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, and
ladies and gentlemen of the House, I told you last night I’d be back
here this morning again, and in all deference to Representative
Daughtry, he doesn’t like to hear any history, but since you all refer
back four sessions ago forward, I’d like to refer back even before that.
Four sessions ago forward, we were in the depths of a very, very serious
recession in this country, and you criticize us now for what we did then
to help keep this state, to keep the ship right, and that’s what we did,
in spite of the fact that yes, we did raise some tax. You call us “tax
and spend”, but that money was put in there in order to help keep the
services to the people of this state moving forward. But I want to
remind you that last night I</p>

...told you that we were morphing from the 19th century to the 21st
century forgetting all about the 20th century and the progress that was
made during the 20th century when Democrats were in charge of this body
and you cannot deny the fact that the budgets that we passed, the
legislation that we passed, all of the things we've passed during that
period of time brought about the prosperity, whatever prosperity we had,
whatever notoriety or whatever we got, came about as a result of at
least 100 years of Democratic rule, if you want to call it, in this
state.  We have become one of the most recognized sates for
progessivity, for education, for anything that you want name.  We have
been rated in top five, six or ten places for anything you want to do
for bringing in new businesses, for providing new jobs and doing all of
these things. Now that takes care of what we as Democrats have done for
this state over the last 100 years. Now you want to take four years when
we hit that rough spot and blame us for every ill that now that arises
but you don't want to offer any solution in your budget to do it. What
you're telling us, I mean, give me a break folks. You put this
educational opportunity thing in the budget thinking it's going to make
some changes in education. Let me give you...and here again, we get on
all these esotery clouds and auditory flows and ureteric just gushes but
when you stop and think about what you're doing or what you're trying to
do. You can understand it doesn’t make any sense at all. Like the
educational opportunity thing that you put in the budget. Here is a
black person in Durham, North Carolina who has two children in the
family and he says “my kids are not getting the education they need in
public schools. So I want a choice. I want to send my kid to Durham
Academy. That's my choice. That's where I’m supposed to get a good
educational opportunity for my kids.” The tuition at Durham Academy is
$20,000 a year. What choice does that individual have with educational
opportunity for his kids? I'm just asking because you see, when you do
these things and everybody supposed to see these beautiful clouds out
there you just really off base. Now I’m not...I'm sort of like the great
theologian Martin Luther, who put out the the 95 theses against the holy
Roman Catholic church and he was called in to the inquisition and asked
did he stand by those 95 theses and he said, “let me think about it.” He
came back the next day and he said to them, “yes, I stand by them.” And
they ask him would he recant. And he says “give me another day to think
about it.” And he came back the next day and this is what he said. “I
neither can nor will not recant anything for it's neither right nor safe
to act against conscience. Here I stand. I can do no other.” So I’m
standing before you today to tell you that this thing that you call a
budget is not going to work for the betterment for the people of this
state. You criticized us again, for raising taxes. 1.2 billion dollars
in taxes which kept the ship of state on the right course. We said it
was temporary. You claimed that we wanted to keep it but you didn't find
out whether we wanted to keep it or not because you came in and took it
out. Your the ones that took it out. 1.2 billion dollars in there would
have gone a long ways for doing the things that we needed to do and we
still need to do. I mean, look I'm thinking the Representative
Alexander's medical marijuana bill has passed and some of us has taken
advantage of it. So...</p>

people in this state walked a true honest budget. they walked through on
his education. we have tried to make up over theyears progress energy
that the state is suing you can't deny you came in here talking about
jobs, jobs, jobs, you really created not one job and I know right now
you have collected all the money you talk about putting is it you've got

you talk about anti- three-pronged if you're talking about
is not what or how well you got agencies, you got people out there this
long text only missionaries in their agencies on trust fund in their
agencies could cover off a lot of things, like getting tedious raises. I
demonstrate employees raises an slower than you had to be about getting
a sample raised somewhere because I don't know how many more of you can
become a nun in on the less than the poverty wages you receiving, but
that's another a fun-loving, while trying to tell you is that we need to
go back reorder priorities, which is something that you always say we
wanted to pop out priority and come back. that's still fill out a budget
for a special provisions. we never try to allow it in the budget we
passed a five hundred twelve Bytes hundred and fifty to two hundred
pages, as compared to the three hundred fifty to four hundred pages you
got you now because we don't allow special provision those things that
need to be talked about that you will are you doing committee.we say we
have the best system in the country because of the committee system. the
committee system works. when you start bringing in things to put in the
budget at the last minute. two minutes before you pass the budget summit
will come up with something to put in their book by speaker that he's
not going well. any amendment: no, we get some more but the bottom line
folks is that we need to go back and rethink our priorities and try to
get these things right so that people won't be current. just I just look
at all the things that we had not think we should have done things that
have been successful about being cut out in this budget and I would
suggest you again that we go back rethink our priorities and come back
into something that is right for the people of State of North Carolina
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
. the lady from Chatham representative McManus
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
for what purpose do you rise, distinct abilities lady has afford to
speak with you. I actually want to share some words came to me a couple
of e-mails from teachers
of the first says that he says McManus, I am writing to let you know
that sadly I will be leaving with teaching in North Carolina. currently
I work in a supportive title I school with SF. I enjoy. I been in North
Carolina schools for eight years, working with high poverty and high
minority schools. it has been a rewarding experience. in addition, each
music teacher. my husband and I are ready to expand our family and we
struggling with how to make ends meet financially, this past year, I was
forced to start looking for a job in Fort Mill, South Carolina, for
there will be able to compensate me for over four thousand dollars more
for doing the same job. even after my Gaston County supplement actually
the smallest boom that has much more parent support any more resources
and I will receive the higher salary. I my family to grab it made me sad
to leave the only school where I have ever talked we are truly a family
here. if I felt that the North Carolina legislature value teachers and
thought the right things. I would've loved to have stayed and continued
my work year. North Carolina is doing a disservice to everybody involved
in educating children is unfair to teachers and a pay freeze for so many
years. it tells us that we are not considered professionals. we are not
valued, and I work is not worth the cost if we can continue to spin
around money on supplies that inflation is that we continue to be asked
to be higher and higher standards, the feeling that comes with it is one
of deceit we go. we're never going to be able to create a life for
ourselves. this is worthwhile, who wants to work in a state</p>

Valuing teachers. Not me. I decided to cross over the state line and
work in a state that more fairly compensates me for educating their
future. Please share my feelings of frustration and sadness with your
colleagues. Teaching is rewarding life changing job but I will be
leaving North Carolina schools next year. I do not feel that I could
recommend for anybody to enter this profession in North Carolina. Please
listen to the teachers that are still going to be here. Please treat
them and compensate them as professionals, as people that spend more
waking hours with the children than parents do, as people that instill
morals, values, etiquette and manners as well as academic skills to
other people’s children every day. Pay them appropriately for truly
shaping this state’s future. Thank you. I’m not going to give the name
on the. Representative McManus thank you for all the work that you do. I
know that it’s not an easy job. You must make many decisions about many
different industries all across the state. You’re expected to know about
many different topics. I’m aware that education is the one topic that is
close to your heart and that’s why I chose to write to you. Please help
me. I’m a 4th year teacher in North Carolina, I originally worked in a
corporate field for a few years upon graduating college. I do not have
my Master’s degree. I came to teaching because after a couple of years I
learnt that I’m not a cubicle kind of person. I wanted a profession that
allowed me to work with children and so far I have excelled in the
classroom and found my passion in working with middle school children.
However, with not having any higher education and with a pay freeze in
place since my first year teaching I barely make over $32000.00. My
husband works hard but also being a state employee he and I do not make
a combined income that amounts to a lot. We have one child now and
another child on the way. Our son Sam is in daycare during the week. His
daycare costs us about $140 a week or $480 a month. When our second
child is born our price will nearly double. As state employees we’re
terrified. I have no idea how we will afford childcare for our children,
a basic need. The price of daycare will take over half my entire monthly
take home pay check. How is this fair? I feel panicked every time we sit
down to work on a budget because there is not enough money to support
our small family. I’m afraid that I will have to leave a profession that
I love simply to support a family that I love even more. I hope this
general assembly can do something to help the educators in North
Carolina. I feel so desperate right now. How is it that my husband and I
are working our tails off at our professions that we care about and yet
we’re not rewarded, I’m sorry I can hear myself talking right now, and
yet we’re not rewarded for it financially. We’ve spent more time
worrying about our future child than we’ve spent being excited. I hope
that you and your fellow representatives realize the burdens that
teachers are taking on in their personal lives simply by staying in the
profession. Please do something to end the pay for jobs fairly and help
our family make ends meet. Thank you for your time and consideration. I
know you all got another one that I got about Masters because saw that
it went to everybody and it was also from somebody who’s thinking he’s
going to have to leave the state because he started his Masters a year
ago but he will complete it after the cut off time so he will not get
compensation for that. The teacher that’s leaving for South Carolina, I
did look, if she had her Masters she would make even more in South
Carolina. I think education is the most important thing we do. It’s the
reason I ran for this office. It’s the most frustrating
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman
[SPEAKER CHANGES] thing I have dealt with. No I will not yield to a
question right now. Let me finish before I do that. Then I’ll be happy
to. I am so concerned and even in this budget that gives 5 bonus days to
teachers, I don’t know how many representatives know, but teachers can’t
take those days. It gives it to state employees. Teachers are not
allowed to take a day while students are in class so it doesn’t help
teachers at all to give them 5 days because they are not allowed to take
them. Unless you let them carry these over as far as like days towards
their retirement but that’s not what we’ve done in the past. I know what</p>

legislature’s done in the past, and those were only good for the year,
that fiscal year, so teacher’s lost them, they weren’t allowed to use
them. We aren’t doing anything, anything at all for the teachers in this
state who work so hard, except blaming them when they can’t do
everything we want them to do. We have the highest graduation rate that
North Carolina has ever had in its history. We have been performing very
well. Someone in the Speaker’s Office actually looked at some numbers
and said “I don’t know how the state’s been doing as well as they have
when they’re at that level of compensation,” and I said “Well we’ve been
riding on a wave of when we were compensating, when we were working
hard,” but that wave’s getting ready to break because teachers cannot
continue to do what they’ve been doing without compensation. We’re going
to lose our best and brightest because you can go to any state that
touches North Carolina and make a better salary and be treated better,
with more respect. I think this is a sad statement about this budget.
Thank you. I’ll take a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Collins, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I’m wondering if the Representative would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would the lady from Chatham yield to an inquiry from
the gentleman from Nash? She does. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just wondering if
you’re aware of when the pay freeze for teachers started and which party
was in control at that time, and also which party was the last party to
give the teachers a pay raise. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m quite aware, and I
think we have reached a time when we could better afford to give them a
raise now than we could at the time that that freeze began. I would not
have been in favor of it then, to tell the truth, but I understood it. I
think we’ve gone far too long and I think a 1.2% increase is really
almost nothing anyway, so I think it was an election tactic and I didn’t
feel like it was to benefit our teachers or our state employees at that
time. So I hope I answered your question. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Faircloth, for what
purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Would the lady yield for a
question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Would the lady from Chatham yield to the
gentleman from Guilford? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
She does. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. I appreciate what
you’re saying. I have great regard for teachers, I have a lot of friends
who are teachers, but I also have a lot of friends, and I know you do
too, who since 2008 are engaged in private businesses and other public
jobs who also had not had an increase – in fact have had many decreases.
Is that correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct. I don’t know how
many of them though have been given higher and higher standards for
their work year after year, and that is what we do for teachers. We set
a higher and higher bar for them to meet every year while we have taken
away the money we provide for supplies, the money we provide for their
continuing education, we’ve expected them to take on part of their
healthcare insurance. If anything, it’s like they’ve had a pay cut in
that time. Now I know other people may have too and I’m really sorry
about that, but like I said, I don’t think we do anything more important
than educating our children. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Will the lady yield? She
yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you ma’am for
another question. Of those people, those friends of your and mine who
work out here in the world every day since 2008 you say have seen cuts
in their salaries or in their commissions or whatever their income’s
based on, have you seen or are you aware that they are paying a lot of
the cost of us trying to operate government? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. I
have watched my husband’s pay shrink, and you wouldn’t think that would
be the case because he’s a family practice physician, but through
managed care I have watched his reimbursements get smaller and smaller
each year and we’ve taken a salary cut. I understand that, and in my
town, in Siler City, we lost Townsends. We lost our major industry, I’ve
seen people unemployed, but I’ve gone to county meetings with farmers,
people who show up in their overalls and their John Deere hats and still
say education is the most important thing, that their kids and grandkids
have got to have a good education if they’re going to be able to do
better than their parents.</p>

grandparents did. I still think it's the most important thing we do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One final question. Will the lady yield to one final
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Of course.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you so much for your time and patience. Where is
the balance point, or how do we go about finding the balance point,
between continuing to demand more and more payment from our citizens for
taxes and so forth, fees and what have you, and the way we manage
government in deciding what salaries are. How do we find that balance
point?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I feel like this year we are putting money into other
programs: the voucher program. Right now, I don't have them in front of
me, but other things that if we had put that money into a state pay
raise, we could have compensated our teachers this year. We could have
come back and addressed vouchers in the next budget. We could have
waited. I'm just not sure the best and brightest in our education system
can wait. I believe there are things that we are doing that could have
waited.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This one's important.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative McManus would yield for three
questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would the lady from Chatham yield to the gentleman
from Cumberland?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] She yields. You may propose your inquiries.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative McManus, would
you agree with me that every other job in the world is dependent on only
one job, that is, teachers who teach them their skills in order for them
to go out into the work force?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Of course I do, you know that. You know how I feel.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And would you, secondly, like to tell the body,
what--since this has come up and hopefully will put an end to this type
of questioning--what was the party, or which party was in power, that
last gave a substantial raise to teachers and state employees?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe that would be the Democratic Party.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. And the last question is, when we compare
the world of work and the world of children, would you agree with me
that there is a wide difference in making widgets and educating a child?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is an argument I have had, even with school board
members, for many years because--if your friend who was on the school
board with me used to say...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ...if you put something in--I'm going to answer my
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Point of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please state your point, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Point of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please state your point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are we debating the budget? I stepped out a few
minutes and I came back and it sounds like we're debating something
else. Is this the budget we're debating, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Your point is well taken. The lady is responding from
an inquiry from the gentleman, and the chair would ask that she continue
to do. But the chair would again ask the members to try to focus the
debate on the bill that is before us. Representative McManus, you have
the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I was saying, yes, with widgets, if you want to make a
better one, you get better materials. You raise your standards for your
materials; you raise your standards for production. There are so many
things you can do. When you want to produce a better student, you can't
say, &quot;I want better materials. Send me better kids to begin
with.&quot; All you can do is help your teachers be better at what
they're creating, and we've taken away the professional development
money. I think those three young women that were up there yesterday, of
which my daughter was one, are incredible teachers. They are incredibly
devoted, motivated, creative young women, who are pouring their heart
into a Title I, mostly second language school and working their tails
off. I don't know what more we can ask of them or what more they can do
and we're not compensating them. And these are people who are really
smart young women. They could go into the business world and get a job
easily, even in this job market.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] They have to be thinking about that. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Question for Representative McManus.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady from Chatham yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady does understand that it's optional to yield?
She does yield. The gentleman may pose his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative McManus, were
you aware that the difference between the salaries: Fort Mill, South
Carolina, and North Carolina, first years Master's teacher is $2,100
plus side to North Carolina? Fort Mill was $2,100 less.</p>

[Speaker Changes] Thank you.
[Speaker Changes] I’m sorry, I missed the question in that.
[Speaker Changes] Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker Changes] Would the gentleman like to restate his inquiry?
[Speaker Changes] Representative McManus. I wonder if you were aware, as
you gave the example of the teacher moving to Fort Mill because of the
salary benefit. According to the data that I’m able to collect. The
salary for a first year Masters degree teacher is $38,547 in Fort Mill,
in the North Carolina $40,656.
[Speaker Changes] Actually, I have a chart with different numbers right
in front of me. I’d be happy after, when we get a moment, or to come
over there and show it to you.
[Speaker Changes] Okay, I’m looking at the chart for Fort Mill’s
salaries right here on my computer.
[Speaker Changes] Well, I will bring you my two charts. Thank you.
[Speaker Changes] Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Stevens, for what purpose does?
[Speaker Changes] I was going to see if Representative McManus would
yield to one question from me?
[Speaker Changes] Does the lady from Chatham yield to..
[Speaker Changes] I’m getting lots of “no’s” around me, so I think I’m
gonna pass. Thank you.
[Speaker Changes] She does not yield.
[Speaker Changes] The lady from Guilford, Representative Adams, for what
purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes] To speak on the budget, Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker Changes] The lady has the floor to speak on the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentleman of the
house, its been a very long debate. I think its been necessary. And I
think that I heard someone saying that the recession is not over. And I
sort of agree with that, and I think that because it is not, we have to
show some compassion for people. As I said, there are lots of things
that I could talk about in this bill, and many of them have already been
commented on. And I’m still concerned about all of them. I’m concerned
as an educator about education. And I’m concerned as a woman about women
and children and families. But I’m also concerned about the
inconsistencies that we have in this bill. We talk about how we fix
things, and I think its really all about priorities. We have given
priorities to some folks, and not to others. I think that the citizens
who I have heard from, from Guilford county and other places throughout
this state, are very concerned about the hurt on them and their families
that this budget will cause. It is a particular concern as we face high
unemployment and a troubled economy. That we will in fact lose jobs,
when we have focused, as has already been said. When we came into this
session in January we talked about jobs and more jobs and the economy.
But of concern to me, is the impact that not only some of the policy
decisions that we’ve made throughout the session, but those in this bill
that will have on women and families. I’ve always believed as long as
I’ve been here that sometimes when we make decisions we are looking at
the immediate fix of what we can do about saving the state money and we
don’t look enough at the outcomes that will result because of what we
do. Women are among the lowest paid workers. We all know that. That is
not the way it should be, but thats the way it is. And many poor women,
in particular, are heads of many of the households here in North
Carolina. And many of those are included among those unemployed people
that we talked about who will, in just a few weeks lose their benefits
and have serious problems trying to make the ends meet. Again,
compassion for people. Now in the programs that we have eliminated from
this budget. And I want to mention minority run non profits. We have had
little compassion for those individuals. We’ve cut them off without
warning. No time for transition. But yet, we allow transition for other
people. These programs, many of them, are designed to help women. Employ
a lot of women. Many of them of them serve women through the various
programs directed to advance economic growth, and to uplift low wealth
communities all across the state. Including some of the communities that
you represent...</p>

<p id="135:00">
[Speaker Change]
As it has already been stated, as we talk about education and I have a
daughter who has been teaching in Guilford County now for seventeen
year. Who is now looking for other things to do simply because she feels
that teachers have not been respected and they are continually not being
able to provide for their family’s because of the money that they
receive. Well, the majority of our teachers are women as well as teacher
assistants and our retirees and state employees for that matter. And so
we won’t even provide an opportunity for the teachers who are working to
earn me by continuing their education. So we’re not going to recognize
the years of experience of the advance degrees that a lot of these women
in these jobs work hard to earn. And I have to go back to my daughter
who worked to get her Masters so she would not be impacted in that way
because she’s had it for a couple of years but was looking forward to
working on her PHD. So, and as we talk about those teachers I just want
to again mention may support of our universities, for students who
attend them, and for the fact that we are going to find that we will not
have students coming to the State to matriculate through our
universities and colleges because we’re putting a special burden, a
tremendous burden on students from other States. When they do stay here,
they provide for our economy and they are good citizens, good workers,
and we’re not going to allow them an opportunity to come. I got to tell
you students have difficulty paying for college education. And because
the come from other States, I can tell you that they are just as much in
need as students here from North Carolina. So, I just think that we had
an opportunity to enrich our diversity and I think we’ve reduced that by
the decisions that we made in this budget. So, you know, we talk about
opportunities but I think that we have to make opportunities available
for all people, in all neighborhoods and so I got to tell you again I’m
not sure, or I’m not convinced that the opportunity scholarships are
going to do much for the children they have been designated to serve but
to merely raid public school funding, to support private interest that
parents may have. And like I said before I think if you have that
interest you should pay for it. It’s alright to have those choices.  I
just want to mention that I did work for forty years in a private
college and I understand when I stepped out yesterday, there might have
been a comment about that. But the private, the support that comes to
students at private schools from North Carolina come for scholarships.
They don’t come to pay wages for faculty members as I was paid. But
anyway, I won’t yield if that’s what your question will be. But
yesterday, we heard in terms of the opportunity scholarships, about a
gathering in Greensboro where there were thousands of people attending.
And I heard about that event. I wasn't able to attend and probably if I
was I still wouldn’t have attended but I think a lot of people probably
came because it was a concert, featuring a popular singer, Marvin Sapp.
People like music. I think music is a good thing. And I think that’s
probably what drew people to that meeting. As opposed to coming there
for the opportunity that was being present. But you know, the final
thing I want to make as it relates to women and to, and to other people
who are deprived in so many ways. About fifteen years ago.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker Change]
I think it was, I did…
[Speaker Change]
Representative Adams, if you would yield just for a moment. For what
purpose does the gentleman rise?
[Speaker Change]
Would the gentle lady yield for a question?
[Speaker Change]
I will not yield at this time.
[Speaker Change]
She does not yield at this time.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you. About fifteen years ago, I think one of the first Bills I had
in this General Assembly, had to do with and was the Displaced
Homemakers Bill that helped many North Carolinians, I thinks we’ve heard
Representative Fisher talk about that earlier, but this, this Displaced
Homemakers Program provided opportunities for people who had lost
substantial income that had been provided by heads of households. They
lost…</p>

<p id="140:00">
that income, and now they have to retool, and go back to work.  They may
need to go to school, and do some other things to make themselves more
applicable to helping in providing for their families.  And so, I think
by eliminating this item from the budget, we do a tremendous disservice
not only to women, because the majority of displaced home makers are
women, all of them are not as has been said, men benefit as well.  But
people who become victims because of divorce, or health, or death, or
other kinds of circumstances that they have, and so that to me again,
puts another burden on women.  Now, I do want to say that as we began
this session, we've had a lot of bills in my opinion, that interfered
with women's reproductive decisions. Bills that have targeted women and
their families in a very negative way.  So, it's interesting to me that
we reject federal dollars at sometimes, and we love to get them at other
times, and I'm talking about the $250,000 in the block grants from the
maternal child grants that are in the budget.  Federal dollars that will
now go to crisis pregnancy centers which are anti-choice organizations
that give medically inaccurate information to essentially block women
from considering abortion or even birth control as an option.  Now just
I believe we have to be fair, and I don't believe that
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Adams, please yield just for a moment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]If I could just say.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]For what purpose does the gentleman rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To see if the gentle lady would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]She does not yield at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Speaker, just so everyone will know, I want to
finish my comment, before I'll consider yielding.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes, Mame, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]So 21% of women of child bearing age are uninsured, yet
we provide no opportunities, opportunities again, for these women.  No
resources for organizations like Planned Parenthood, or any other
organization that provides comprehensive health care, preventative
health care services like screenings and mammograms and so forth.  And
so 1000's of women, especially young women who depend on these
organizations, sometimes as their medical provider, is the only doctor
that they'll see, will have no opportunities for health care and they
are among those 500,000 uninsured, and the number's higher than that in
North Carolina, simply because we did not want expand Medicaid.  We
didn't want those federal dollars to help those poor women, so we made
the choice no to help them at all.  I just want to add that 220,000
women in North Carolina would have benefited from the expansion.  30% to
50% of uninsured women are more likely to die from breast cancer, and
60% of uninsured women are more likely to get a diagnosis of cervical
cancer in the late stages.  Not in the early stages, because they didn't
get to a doctor, and they weren't able to get that preventative care.
So overall, uninsured women will have less access to prescription
contraceptive medications, and women in North Carolina will have worse
health outcomes than other women.  And so for those things and many
other reasons I am against this budget, because I don't believe that
focuses on the needs of all of our citizens.  And regardless of what
district, and what community you may come from, or that you may
represent, you can't just single out a few people in your communities
and say I'm speaking for my people, and I'm representing my people,
you've got to look at all of them, regardless of what their income level
is, their racial background, their medical history, all of those things.
 You represent all of those citizens.  And so because of this budget,
targets a lot of people who I represent, who have contacted me, the most
vulnerable, especially women, because it's been very disrespectful to
them and to a lot of our citizens, it's going to harm so many people,
many of those in Guilford County, who I represent, I will not vote for
this budget because I believe that our citizens</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman from Catawba, Representative Wells, for
what purpose to you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Despite the suggestions by
Representative Michaux, I have not partaken in any marijuana, medicinal
or otherwise, but I will confess that if we had allowed growler sales on
the floor, I would have been surely tempted.  We've gone on a long time,
and this is about the most depressing debate I've heard.  And I'm coming
from an area that's lost 20% of its jobs.  I'm ready to go home for an
upper.  We cannot solve this problem in a year, the problem facing the
state, but we can a step.  This is a process that we have to go though.
I would like to think that in 6 months of this general assembly and a
new governor we could have fixed all the ills of North Caroline.  It's
not going to happen.  Some of those go back much further, and out much
further than the State of North Carolina.  The only way we fix this is
to grow the pie.  We sit around for weeks debating how we split up a
shrinking pie, but that's exactly what we're dealing with, a shrinking
pie, and it's our fault.  We have a system here where we're not
attractive.,  Of the states in the Southeast, our marginal tax rates are
25% higher than the average of our competitors.  If I want to cut my
personal tax rates by a third, by over a third, I simply move from the
Catawba Valley to the Shenandoah Valley.  It's that easy.  We don't get
more money for our budget, we don't grow the economy of North Carolina
by adding on costs.  We have watched, particularly in my area, we've
watched Southeast Asia decimate our economy on one thing, price.  It's
not quality, it's not design, it's not craftsmanship.  They have
stripped out our manufacturing in our area, and across our state, and
across the Southeast on price.  We've watched retail empires grow, huge
empires on one issue, price.  We're not going to increase prices, or
hold prices at a 25% higher level and grow this economy.  It cannot
happen, and I've never heard any family have a conversation, or heard of
a family having a conversation where they say, Honey, let's go to that
store, they're 25% higher than the others, they must be a lot better,
let's shop there.  And that's exactly what's happened and it's happening
2 ways.  Now, I'll concede that North Carolina is 25% better than the
surrounding states, and I'll debate anybody in any surrounding states
about that.  But I'm a 9th generation southerner, I know the
differences, the distinctions in this area.  The folks in Michigan, and
Ohio, and New Jersey, they don't understand those differences.   They
just look at us and see that we're pricing ourselves 25% higher than all
of our competitors, with the same generally speaking, beaches and
mountains and rolling red clay hills, we're 25% higher.  That does not
work.  The only way we'll grow our economy is become competitive, and
we'll do that by cutting regulations and cutting tax rates to where
we're in line with the others, and then we can let our nicer beaches,
and our nicer mountains, and our nicer red clay hills speak for
themselves.  So what we need to be looking toward is that this budget,
whether you like everything in it or you don't, it's a positive step in
the right direction to grow this economy in North Carolina.  And it is
but one step, and we're going to need to take steps for probably 5 years
or 10 years.  We're going to need to keep moving ahead and making
ourselves competitive.  And our question is how we're going to do that.
This is a step, a tax reform is a step, regulatory reform is a step.  As
we do that, we'll be successful, and we won't have these debates about
how we split up the shrinking pie, we'll be having much more enjoyable
debate about how we share a pie</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Wake, Representative Malone, for what purpose do you
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ll tell you what, this has been a test in
patience waiting for my opportunity to speak. First of all, I’d like to
say in regards to some comments I heard regarding education, “There are
a lot of Republicans here who fought for NCAT and for teachers’
assistants in the entire budget.”
I can even share with you something that I shared in the Appropriations
for Education Committee that in 2008 Wake County, for instance, to give
you an example, had 2,800 teaching assistants. Today it’s 2,000. They
were looking at maybe losing another 400 to 500. That’s not going to be
the case now because of what we’ve done here.
I know that the Superintendent has been speaking with Governor and has
been very happy with what we’re doing and I’m happy to say that they’re
in a better place for it.
Second, I want to talk about issues with loss of jobs. Just to correct
something that Representative Brandon said, our unemployment rate is 8.9
percent, not 9.4. And I can say that when I was running in the primary
last year it was 9.7. So, it is going down. Now, whether it’s because
we’re here or whatnot, I’m not 100 percent sure but I can tell you, it
might very well be. Certainly we’ll be happy to take credit for it.
Now, budgets, as you all know, are there to manage the system of
governance and tax policies to lift all boats. I’ve heard a lot of
interesting conversation here today and that’s about as caustic as I’m
going to characterize it.
But I’ll say this. It concerns me that I hear what I hear and then I go
on the Internet and I see the Washington, DC- based Tax Foundation that
looks at growth. It looks at what kind of opportunities we’re going to
be providing the people of, in this case, North Carolina to better our
life, the quality of life.
That at our current level, our law basically says that our ranking is
sixth worst out of the 50 states and when this is done it will be  19th.
I’ve got to ask you the question, “Why did it take seven decades to do
this?” Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady from Wilson, Representative Farmer-Butterfield, for what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to say to you that
I genuinely appreciate the Chairs of the Health and Human Services
Committee and the procedure and process that they utilize to address
health and  human services, and for that I’m grateful.
I do want to say, however, that Dr. Martin Luther King said, “Injustice
anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” Land loss prevention was
cut. Community Development Initiative was cut. The Institute of Minority
Economic Development was cut. The Association of Community Development
Corporations and indeed the Indian Economic Initiative. Injustice
everywhere.
Dr. King also said a great deal about disparities and injustices in
health care. He declared, “Injustice in health is the most shocking and
the most inhumane inequality.” This budget does not expand Medicaid
which would have been the most efficient way to handle rising Medicaid
costs and extend quality health care to half-a-million residents.
Medicaid reform is great. I want to see it occur in North Carolina. I
want to be a part of that. But Medicaid reform on the backs of poor
people is just simply wrong, it is unjust.
The results of the Medicaid cuts is that patients and doctors will be
negatively impacted. This budget limits the number of doctor’s visits
from 22 to 10 per year per person. It raises co-pays and it lowers
reimbursement rates for providers. So who does it hurt? Children and
families, pregnant women, the aged, blind and disabled. What else does
the budget do in health and human services? Well…</p>

Speaker:    to 13 percent of the Federal profit level. Changing the
eligibility knocks thousands of children on the waiting list for
[peekay??] and will make it harder for them to enter school ready to
learn . The decision not to expand Medicaid, or otherwise provide
healthy change to North Carolina’s poorest populations hurts all
hospitals. But this proportionately negatively affects rural hospitals
which tend to serve poor communities. This decision will cost North
Carolina hospitals $413 million every year from the facts that I have
been able to ascertain. Providing quality health care, it doesn’t do for
many citizens ,but take rural hospitals it does not ,create jobs in
these areas it does not. North Carolina hospitals are already facing
massive payment cuts from the Affordable Cure Act; a possibly $7.8
billion over the next decade. This is already causing hospitals to
reduce services and eliminate over twelve hundred jobs and jeopardizing
upto 12000 hospital jobs. The poorest and the most vulnerable are most
affected in this unconscionable budget. These actions are being taken by
rural hospitals and urban hospitals. Some we have read about and some we
have not yet heard about but they are occurring quietly. So I ask that
you look at going forward to consider these points and ensure that our
children, and families, pregnant women,  the aged ,xx or disabled are
not affected so severely. I ask you to vote no on the budget. Thank you.
Speaker changes: Mr. Speaker, I propose the gentleman from[ Ash??]
Speaker changes: Inquiry for the previous speaker?
Speaker changes: Would the lady from Wilson yield to the gentleman?
Speaker changes: Two, allowed time for my colleagues to speak what they
want to speak, I’ll speak with you, answer your question, thank you.
Speaker changes: She does not yield, Representative Jordan.
Speaker changes: Ladies and gentlemen  the House will after additional
consultation, all members who wish to speak will be recognized to speak
in order. At that time we have agreed that Representatives Paul and
Representative [Hurley??]. will be the last two we recognized to speak
on the bill. Prior to the point that Representative Paul will be
recognized to speak, we are going to take a five-minute recess  which
time the clerk is directed to ring the bell of the House to call members
because after Representative Paul is allowed his 15 minutes of time and
Representative [Hurley??] is allowed his 10 minutes of time, the chair
stands corrected his 5 minutes of time then the question will be put.
With that for what purpose does the gentleman from union Representative
Arc rives
Speaker: Speak on the bill.
Speaker changes:   The gentleman has the floor to speak on the bill.
Speaker changes: Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Speaker changes:   I must say the argument from the other side of the
aisle seems almost schizophrenic ; it bemoans cuts, in a budget that
reduces the cost of state government, it’s been great talk about those
who are hurting and I understand that  as well, and yet there has been
talk about raises in the tax for those who are hurting and it seems
illogical in the debate to me.
Speaker changes: Representative  AAAs I assure your concern. North
Carolina is all hurting.
Speaker changes: I come from the construction industry in reports there
of unemployment had 30 percent. Many have had their income reduced to
half, if they still have a job. I have many friends who are teachers
who are struggling to make it and it hurts me because they are my
friends, and in it there are precisely that that we need to have an

and bemoaning about the cuts, as if all cuts are bad.  That's far too
simplistic of a view, and even demagoguery.  Somethings need to be cut.
For example. the school bus issue is a bipartisan effort, and I
appreciate my friends who supported that, but that's a common sense way
to simply changing the way we purchase school buses.  By doing that we
saved $185 million over 5 years, $30 million this year, $40 million next
year and by doing that we have saved money to pay for teachers and
teacher's assistants, to put school resource officers in the schools for
school safety, to put stop arm cameras on buses to save children's
lives.  Some things need to be cut in order to spend money on the
priorities that we all share.  We cut where necessary, and it's called
government efficiency.  Hard working tax payers expect, hard working tax
payers demand that we are first making sure we're spending their tax
dollars wisely, with their money, before asking for any more.  That we
need to be effective and efficient.  Ladies and gentlemen, this budget
is a common sense budget.  It's a budget that we do what every other
North Carolinian is doing, and that is living within their means.  I
urge you to vote for this budget, vote yes for a more efficient and
responsible state government.  The future looks dim, but the people of
North Carolina have elected us as leaders.  And one thing I've
understood, is that when you're a leader, you lead.  You look into that
dark future, and you say follow me, this is the path that we should go
on.  People are looking to this body to give them hope, to give them
encouragement, not to mire with them of the possibilities of a dark
future, but to say we can be responsible, we have a brighter future.
Ladies and gentlemen, that's what America does.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman from Randolph, Representative McNiell,
for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To speak on the budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you and I'll be brief.  and I don't mean to pick
on Representative Brandon, I didn't stand up to ask him a question when
he was speaking to be rude, I really did have a legitimate question.  I
was intrigued when he got up and he started explaining how he came down
here he had a certain idea of how we were going to do the budget.  And
that's that you just come down here and you decide everything that you
need and you want, and you just go out and find the money and do it.
And the more I sit here and listen, I'm less intrigued because I feel
like he's not alone, and everybody in his caucus probably pretty much
feels the same way he does, is that we just come down here and we just
decide everything we want and we just go out and find the money for it.
It's just that easy.  Maybe there's a money tree outside that I don't
know about.  Anyway, I don't know any body in this body, me included,
does our personal budget that way.   I don't think anybody in here just
decides, Well, I want a new bass boat, or I want a new car.  You know,
if I decided to do that, if I decided I wanted that, and I decided I'd
go out in my neighborhood and take some of those  things from my
neighbors, I think they'd probably have a problem with it.  I think law
enforcement would probably have a problem with it.  We can't just go out
and just take things, and that what you all seem to want to do as a
government.  we just come down here and decide this is what we want, no
problem.  We'll just go out and take it from somebody because we're the
government.</p>

And we can do that, we can just go out and take it. Well you know what?
I think this budget is a very very good budget. I think it shows that
the state of North Carolina realizes that it needs to live within its
means jut like each one of us has to live within our means. I think it's
a good budget, I think it speaks well, I think we've funded the basic
needs of this state and I encourage you to vote yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Guildford
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I had forgotten about Representative McNeil's question
but I would like to ask him a question if he wouldn't mind.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McNeil the gentleman from Randolph do
you yield to the gentleman from Guilford?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well nobody around me is shaking their heads, so maybe
if it's a quick question I'll yield, even though you didn't yield for me
but [??].
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Randolph yields to the gentleman
form Guilford, you may propose your inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I did say I would yield after and you didn't do it
after but I waited until your response was over.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My fault.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But I did understand your comments and I just wanted
to ask a question because you were talking a out we felt like that we
wanted to do whatever we wanted to do, but I just wanted it to be
clarified that I was saying an adequate what we had to do to make sure
that we ran the state at an adequate level. Teachers, things that we
need. So when you're doing your budget for your house, do you exclude
out healthcare for your children? And when you're doing the budget for
your house do you exclude out education for your children? And when
you're doing the budget for your house do you exclude out electricity
and things that you basically need to be able to function your
household? That would be if you say yes to the question, teat would be a
more accurate term of what we're talking about. We're talking about
basic needs, not wants and boats and things like that. So that's my
question to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So your question is do I exclude those things from my
personal budget, is that your question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brandon the Chair would point out that
the gentleman yielded for a short inquiry but if you would like to try
and shorten perhaps your question and maybe restate it so he can reply.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair, my basic question is that would
you cut out basic essential needs in your house like education, food,
things like that and call that an adequate budget for your household?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Brandon when I do my budget for my personal budget
I try to include everything that I think that my family needs to
survive, but I also live within my means. If I cant afford the mot
expensive insurance policy then I get a lesser insurance policy, and I
certainly don't expect my neighbors to fund my personal budget. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Queen, the gentleman from Haywood, for
what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] the gentleman has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My concern with this budget is what it does to rural
North Carolina. I represent the mountains, the area of our state, the
Appalachia, which has a higher unemployment than our state and our
nation in some of my counties. I came down here to try to create jobs
and get us back on the track of recovery. And I could speak about many
of the things that my peers and colleagues have spoken about, education
and so forth, but I'm gonna focus on on which is my rural hospitals. I
represent Haywood, the Jackson and Swain counties, and we have a
hospital system all of partners, there are Midwest Haywood, Midwest
Jackson, Midwest Swain, they are struggling. In the last biennium this
legislature cut a billion dollars out of Medicaid and my rural hospitals
lost 240 jobs. Now in the first part of this session we have denied
Medicaid expansion which would have been 400 jobs to healthcare in my
counties, those are lost. We're looking at further cuts in this budget
to rural hospitals, whether it's payment costs cutbacks from 80% to 70%,
whether it's set asides that are being talked about for rural...</p>

<p id="170:00">
My hospitals are in real trouble. And for my communities to lose their
rural hospitals has a huge impact. So I am asking you all, all of my
members here, to think about what we're dong to our rural hospitals by
not expanding Medicaid. We've done great work in this budget. I agree by
rebasing it we worked in previous weeks to try to fix it in the budget.
Lets declare it fixed and lets expand it sooner rather than later.
Because we are on life support out where I live in our rural hospitals.
And if we are to lose them those are economic engines that drive our
economies. You lose your hospital people don't want to come to your
communities. You can't grow and you're in a downward spiral. So
healthcare is about health. It's about healthcare and jobs. And it's
about the healthcare economy. All of those are very important in my area
and this budget hurts all of them. I do agree. I'll say one other point.
We need to grow. I agree. We need to grow our economies across the
state. We need to invest to grow. All of you all are talking business
talk. You don't cut in times of competitive hardship. You invest more so
that you can grow. We need to grow this economy and we need to think of
it are we growing it are we creating jobs or are we losing jobs. So I'll
be voting no against this budget and I hope you will. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Iredale representative Brawley for what purpose do
you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen I've enjoyed the
discussions. I hope I am brief. But isn't it interesting how God gave us
free will and then gave us politics and then told us to work together. I
just think he's got a real sense of humor. I support the North Carolina
constitution and paying as we go. I've also used the argument the user
should pay for certain items. And I would bring to your attention two
items in the budget. Highway trust-fund physical year thirteen fourteen
one billion one hundred and eighteen million dollars. In physical year
fourteen fifteen one billion one hundred and fifty-two million dollars.
Then we go down to budget code sixty-four two zero eight. Physical year
thirteen fourteen one hundred fifty-one million eight hundred and
seventy-nine thousand dollars. Physical year fourteen fifteen one
billion four hundred and four million dollars. Physical year thirteen
was one hundred and fifty-two million dollars. Physical year fourteen
fifteen one billion four hundred and four million dollars. For those of
you who don't know what sixty-four two oh eight is it's the budget for
toll facilities. We're putting thirty percent more emphasis on toll
facilities than we are the highway trust fund. It's coming. I will be
opposing the budget not for that reason only but because it is one very
big reason. I do appreciate what the budget workers have done. I think
it is a very good general budget but I do think there should have been
more discussion and input before it was brought to the. Thank you.

The gentleman from Bunkham representative Ramsey for what purpose do you
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen of the house. Seventy-three years ago today the USS
North Carolina came out of the shipyard in Brooklyn New York to begin
its voyage in service and defense of our nation during World War two. In
that time the world was very different. The greatest generation my
grandparents they grew up and lived in North Carolina lived in a very
different world than we live in today. Back then North Carolina...</p>

<p id="175:00">
...was a very poor state. North Carolina faced many challenges but what
that greatest generation did through their hard work, through their
thrift, through their innovation, they helped build this state and a
state that we all love and that we all enjoy and cherish today.
The budget that we're talking about today is not perfect. No budget is
and this budget is a process and my hope as this process continues this
budget will continue to improve. I want to thank the members of this
house for doing many good things for restoring funding for alcohol,
drug, and rehabilitation centers for funding pretty much all of the
funding for teacher assistants and doing the things that we need and our
communities depend on.
Certainly, we've all been hit through this recession. If you look at our
schools, from the place that I'm from, our [unclear 00:01:01] County
Schools spend 85th out of 115 LEAs in per pupil expenditures but they
rank near the top of the state in SAT scores, graduation rates, and
third grade reading proficiency.
The school district that President Obama came down in [unclear 00:01:19]
County, Morrisville City School District, they spend just under $8,000
per student but they have very high achievement. I understand not all
school districts are the same, not all demographics are the same. When
you have a small school system in certain communities you have certain
advantages that a larger school system does not and we understand
there's a great diversity. But if we look at per pupil expenditure over
about the last decade we've increased school funding in North Carolina
by about $1,000 a student. That's about $20,000 a classroom, $25,000 a
classroom.
One of the first things you find out when you start looking at school
finance and school achievement is there's not a direct correlation
between the systems that spend more money and the systems that have
higher achievement. But like anything else in life, more funding, more
opportunities do lead to better outcomes potentially.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sir? May I ask a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the lady from Chatham rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would the gentleman yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from [unclear 00:02:25] yield to the lady from
Chatham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He does yield. The lady may propose her inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you so much. Besides the per pupil expenditure, I know that
Ashville has the highest teacher supplement in the state. Is that
correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have two school districts in [unclear 00:02:45] County, Ashville City
Schools and [unclear 00:02:47] County Schools. The county schools spend
around $8,400 per student. They city of Ashville district spends about
$13,000 per student. The supplement in Ashville City Schools is a little
higher than the supplement that's offered by the county system but
there's not a tremendous variation in pay. I probably ought to defer to
representative Fischer because she was chair of the Ashville City School
Board so she would know that better than I, Representative McMannis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I know they have a local tax and they have one of the highest
supplements in the state. Correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Ashville City School District is around the third highest funded
system in the state. They serve about 5,000 students. [unclear 00:03:32]
County Schools have about 20,000 students and they're 85th out of 115
LEAs on a per pupil expenditure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But my point was the teacher pay though part. I think their teachers
receive a higher pay because of their supplement than most teachers in
the state. That was my point. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The chair apologizes. The chair apologizes to the gentleman from
[unclear 00:04:00] to the lady from Chatham and to the chamber. All
inquiries should be directed to the chair. The chair failed to address
that and apologizes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm very sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ramsey, you have the floor to debate senate bill 402.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And my point being was that there is not a
direct correlation between spending and achievement and finances do
help. But we look at what's driving our budget. Chairman Dollar talked
about over a billion dollars has been increased for Medicaid. Medicaid
after the end of this buy in will constitute about 18 percent of our
total budget. In 1990, Medicaid was 5 percent of our total budget. If we
were spending the same amount today on Medicaid that we did</p>

<p id="180:00">
?? in 1990 as a percentage of our budget. According to my simple math,
that would be about 2.6 billion dollars more money that we would have
for tax relief, for investing in our schools, for investing in our
infrastructure. It's not that we're spending less, this budget actually
does spend actually more money that is constrained. There is a tax
reform component to that, and I think that's very appropriate. From
where I'm from we compete with upstate South Carolina, East Tennessee,
oftentimes for businesses, and when our economic developers sit down in
the room and talk to us; we can sometimes match them on incentives.  We
have a great community college. We have a strong infrastructure, but
their tax rates in those other communities, even after our incentives,
we get down to their starting point where they were before they provided
any incentives.  So I think it puts us on a stronger path, there are
some things I would like to see improved.  I hope those things are
improved, but at the end of the day, for the last 15 years, we've
trailed the nation ?? we have had a higher unemployment rate, and had
slower job growth than the rest of the nation, and we've got to figure
out a way to turn this  ship around and so lets do what my grandparents
generation did, the greatest generation. And 73 years ago when the
launching of the USS Carolina. They saved freedom, they came out of a
very difficult economic environment, and they were able to give us the
lifestyle that we enjoy today.  And lets try to do that for those that
come from behind in the future. Mr. Speaker I commend this bill to the
body. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen if I could have your
attention please.  At this time there are two other members  known to
the Chair who seek recognition. The Chair, there are now three.  The
Chair will acknowledge those three.  The purpose of this announcement is
after they speak, the Chair's going to, the Chair's going to issue the
call of the House, and then take a visual survey.  If everyone is in
their seats, we will not have the five minute recess as planned.  For
what purpose does the gentleman from Transylvania representitive
Whitmire rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Rise in support of the bill.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to speak on the bill.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I encourage y'all to support the budget, and again you have
heard me; whether it be committee, or on the floor, fight for things
that I feel dear to my district, my state, my nation, my values.  With
that, you win some, you lose some, some are temporary setbacks that
you'll continue to pursue.  With that, in the end, our budget in my
opinion is fiscally responsible.  No, not everything in these times of
economic times that are trying and challenging, can necessarily be the
outcome that you wanted, but going forward I think is does point us on
the path to get our state back on to the road of prosperity, and I know
there will be plenty of debate on that, but that's my opinion.  On a
positive note, I encourage all going forward to pursue constructive
solutions, and try to leave the criticism as much as possible behind,
but look at solutions.  Instead of just analyzing problems.  And with
that, we definitely must keep an eye on our healthcare, our rural
healthcare in particular.  When it comes to education, everyone knows
where my heart's on that.  I will be pursuing finding ways to make sure
the efficacy of our special funding for education, is actually
fulfilling the definition for which it is.  And with that, I thank all
for their debate, and I ask you to support our budget. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Rockingham, Representative Jones, please state your
purpose.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman has the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mr. Speaker.  Ladies and gentlemen of the House, once again today we
have heard a lot of generalized rhetoric.  All very predictable. Most of
us could have written the script. The truth of the matter is that the
left is never spend enough, never taxed enough, never borrowed enough,
and this budget is no different.  Now just as in the last session, we
once again hear that the sky seems to be falling because our state is
moving down on a more responsible path, a more sustainable path.  That
recognizes that we have limited resources</p>

<p id="185:00">
Indeed it is a new day in North Carolina and I understand that there are
some here that are very unhappy about that. I understand that this
budget and our philosophy of governing will not sit well with those who
believe more government to build a better world, a better nation, a
better state. If bigger government and more spending were the answer
ladies and gentlemen I would suggest to you, that we would have solved
most of our problems by now. By any measure of history we live in a time
of the biggest most expensive government ever. You know there was a time
in our history, if we learn from our history, when it seemed that more
Democrats and Republicans were somewhat more like minded when it came to
sound economic policy, and this budget is built on sound economic
policy. Not relying on debt, and understanding that lower tax rates are
a good thing, that indeed can generate more jobs, more growth and more
revenue. Democrat president Kennedy and Republican president Reagan both
understood this, and successfully lowered tax rates to simulate the
economy. To our friends on the left, we’ve heard some today, take some
bows for your past successes and very well that you need to take
responsibilities for your failures as well.
Many of you criticize this budget because it is indeed not the budget
that you would have desired, it’s not the budget that you would have
passed, certainly based on past performance. We could go back over the
past decade since _me and this chamber were part of that. We could talk
about 6 huge tax increases in 8 years that catapulted our state to
having the highest tax burden in the south. We could then talk about our
state’s descent into the bottom 5 states in the country in unemployment.
We could talk about the last term when the Democrats were in the
majority and how this budget and its priorities differ from what that
budget did. It’s very clear that the last answer in good times was
higher taxes and more spending. And then the last answers in bad times
was once again higher taxes and more spending with North Carolina in the
depth of the worst economy since the Great Depression. The democrats
answer was not to control spending but rather to enact a 1.3 Billion
dollar tax increase. The results: the highest unemployment rate, the
highest rate of bankruptcies, the highest rate of foreclosures on
record. Another difference in this budget is it doesn’t add more debt,
now before this new majority took the reins, even the democratic state
treasurer warned this legislature that it had maxed out its state credit
card the left had accumulated the highest debt in state history, it left
us with the largest budget shortfall in state history. Many of you
continue to rail against the very policies that your party created, and
now that you’re the loyal opposition nowhere is this more apparent than
with education and teachers. You define their pay, you froze their pay,
your governor furloughed them and now you accuse us after this new
majority gave them their first pay raise in 4 years, gave them
additional benefits that you never would and are working to maintain and
strengthen pension and health plans that the left had virtually run into
the ground. I was sent here as was this new majority to change the way
things are done in Raleigh, it is time to get past the politics of greed
and envy. The left works hard to appeal to the majority by implying that
we can balance the budget on people making over a million dollars a
year. Well guess what, that’s less than 3 out of a 1000 households. So
theoretically in an ideal world were some people seem to think that they
live, for every 1 percent rate you want to raise their taxes you might
bring in another 10 million dollars assuming they don’t change their
habits or move somewhere else were they might keep more of their own
money. But wait Houston, we have a problem; you see it gets back to this
idea of liberty. People can change, people can move, those businesses
that are taxed as individuals and in reality make up-</p>

some of that money by creating a few less jobs or Megalomania takes
somewhere else where they can better operate and profit. our speak also
for the parents, teachers and students of this statement are tired of
being used as pawns by people pull pushing a political agenda people
they seem to think that education is all about the system. this budget
recognizes that education is about people and often about children in
particular. our site is apparent. I am very passionate about school
choice and I think it's a significant fact that the left would often
prefer to ignore that public school teachers disproportionally send
their children to private schools. they are citizens that want to
exercise their choice and to suggest that supporting choice is somehow
being against the public schools is just plain wrong and should not be
interjected into this debate, I do I take this opportunity to thank my
friends Representative Lued take for his honesty and his forthrightness
representative liturgy and I often disagree on policy, but always admire
and appreciate the fact that he seems willing to say things that
sometime others are unwilling to say and listen closely to his argument
against school choice on the basis of his concerns that some schools
will endeavour teach children from a faith-based perspective. he opposes
that on the basis of his interpretation of separation of church and
state that praised the Thomas Jefferson wrote in an eight to the Danbury
Baptists, fifteen years after the Constitution was written, in which
Jefferson expressed his concern that the state not control the church,
but I understand there are many him a lap that would oppose school
choice. for this reason. it's time to recognize that if were going to
support people and not institutions, but actual parents and their
children that one can anyone must support their God-given fundamental
right to choose the education of their choice for their children. and
yes, that includes teaching them from the perspective of their choice of
faith in God. if that is their choice. it is time for budgets to reflect
an attitude that puts government and its role in its proper place and I
believe that the majority of citizens in our state and a majority of
citizens that sent me here to serve believe that government has become
too big too expensive and too intrusive, ladies and gentlemen, America
is an ongoing experiment in liberty and freedom from its beginning,
people were divided.they were about as many people who wanted to stay
under the leadership in the protection of the King as they roar that
believe that no way the people should be the government, and that
government should be the servant and not the master
as I conclude my marks. I would say that a problem with the last
approach is that at some point you run well on other people 's money to
span the ladies and gentlemen, I would suggest that we are at that point
know some here seem ready to proclaim that the recession is ever happy
days are here again. Maggie sometimes live in a parallel universe. I
don't see that CV we live in a nation and in the statement demands
responsibility that room that demands that we do live within our means,

The gentleman may debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Chamber. I’m going to briefly
address just one specific issue. I think you all know that my
legislative interests vary widely though. I work with many of you on
many different issues through committees and so forth. But I am the
product of public schools. One of the schools that I went to as I was
growing up has been a low performing school for decades, decades. Why
has the system not helped the students in that school? We know its been
low performing for decades and guess what? It was a majority minority
school. Why has the system ignored those children? Generations of those
children, my fellow students, and not fixed the problem in that school?
And other schools like it? There’s a lot of good our schools have done.
There’s a lot of things we need to work on. Funding is one of those
issues and I'm going to briefly address it. I fought for education
dollars. I fought for small schools, for rural schools, for all schools.
Because funding is important. My children are in public schools. Where I
have a rising kindergartner and a rising second grader. So you see the
issue is very important to me. Even my friends in the NCAE know that
this issue is very important to me, even if I don’t agree with them most
of the time. It’s a very important issue we should take very seriously.
Our children are not interchangeable parts. One reason I’m a primary
sponsor on the scholarships for disabilities, different students have
different needs. They learn different ways. They need different school
environments. Whether that is the government run public school, charter
schools, home schools, private schools. Children are different. And it’s
our friends on the other side of the aisle who keep saying, “No,
everybody needs to be in one system and it must  fit all, and we’ve got
to pour as much money into it as possible.” Money is not the only thing,
it is important. But we have to to be realistic. We have limited
resources. We’re better off now to all my Freshman friends. We’re
better off now then we were when we started last session. Last session I
came in and I was told, “Guess what, y’all have a 3 1/2 billion dollar
red ink to deal with.” Three and a half billion dollars, what it started
off as? Everybody talks about 2 1/2 billion but it was started as 3 1/2
billion, that was about 15% of the entire General Fund. Guess what? I
wasn’t here before 2011. Those of you who were know where that problem
came from. I’ll let you think about that. We keep hearing about adequate
funding for schools. Last session, it was fund schools first. Important
issue, important idea. But what does it mean? No one on the other side
can tell me what is that amount. We spend as of last session, $8,436 per
diem. Well, that’s not adequate apparently because we kept hearing
problems from the other side, not adequate. Tell me what that number is
please. Since I can’t get that answer from folks, I ran a sensitivity
analysis. Is it 9,000? Is it 10,000? We want 14,000? Representative
Shaw, my friend, I’ve worked with before on issues mentioned 20,000
Durham Academy. Well, I looked at the numbers here, and if we spent
between 14,000 and 15,000 dollars per student, that would be a total of
19.8 billion to 21.2 billion dollars. Why did I pick that number? What’s
our General Fund? That would be the entire General Fund. And that’s what
I’m afraid some of our friends on the other side think is adequate
funding. Adequate funding would be your entire General Fund.</p>

offered by representative Hall and then representative Gothler. Is there
any objection to not recessing at this time. See none. The general from
Duram representative Hall is recognized to speak on Senate bill four oh
two.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Appreciate the debate by everybody in the
assembly today. And as we go through this process and I think
representative Wills was the one who said this is a process we do have
some complaints about the process not being honored. And I appreciate
that people have provided their opinions because all of our opinions are
important. We roughly get elected from the same districts. We represent
in many instances people who have the same concerns for the most part.
And I hope that because you're in the majority as republicans and as far
as democrats as well we understand we did not ask and do not expect you
to lay down for your principles. And I hope you don't expect and ask
other members of the assembly not to give you their viewpoint. Because
again you never know. You may be pleasantly surprised that by getting
additional information other than what you have only in your experience
you may get a greater appreciation. You may come up with some ideas you
did not heretofore have and you may do a better job for the future of
North Carolina which is the objective or should be of all of us. I know
that on both sides a lot of folks indulged in trying to say as
representative Collins referred to it telling other folks about what
they think and what they feel as opposed to what they've said. And it's
probably going to be enough for the record to reflect what we said. I'm
not here to change any minds in this body. I'm going to trust that
you've studied the issues. You've done the best that you can. Now I'm
not going to give up hope that you can't learn more and do better. But
I'm going to trust that at this point in time you've studied the issues.
You've done the best you can. You've made the deals you made. You've
made the promises to yourself and or to other people that you've made.
In some areas you've done your best. In other areas you had to look the
other way. Sometimes you had to swallow hard. Sometimes you stuck out
your chest because you were proud you did the right thing at the right
time for the right reason. So it's not a black or white record that
you're going to have and we know this budget in some areas is better in
some areas worse. This budget is the least of all evils for the budgets
that are out there and you've created it and have the stamp at the end
of this vote of the authority of the House of Representatives. When it
goes into conference all of us are going to ask you not to give up what
was hard fought and debated in here. Because its going to have the seal
of approval. Not my vote but from the institution which I'm very
concerned about. And at that point when whoever those members of that
congress committee are go in there don't let your fellow republicans
down and in many instances your democratic colleagues as well. Don't let
us down when you go in there after all of this debate after some of this
name calling and questioning of people's principles and beliefs and we
come out of this. Don't go into that conference committee and then sell
us out. Don't do that. I'm going to talk a little bit about and these
are my views so if anybody has a question might want to understand these
are my views. These are the views of the world that I live in, the
concerns that I have that are just as valid as any concerns anyone else
may have or may have heard. Usually four letter words are bad words in
many instances anyway. Representative Cleveland is looking at me saying
most of the ones we heard in the Marines were bad words when they were
four letters. But there's a three letter word that we bandy about in
here all the time and no it's not tax.</p>

<p id="205:00">
It's not tax. And I know that's a bad word for some folks on the other
side of the aisle as well. But you see, there's a more appealing word
that you like to use. And it's the dirty little secret in the budget, we
all know what it is: it's a fee. And so, in this budget, at the same
time we gave the $50 million plus estate tax break to those 8,500... for
those 23 families or 28 families... at the same we did that, we also
said let's raise an additional $54 million in fees in this budget.  Now,
who are those fees going to be on? Those fees are on small businesses
and other businesses. So let me get this straight now. We gave a tax
break to millionaires, 8,500 of them, we gave this tax break to estates
over $5 million being transferred to the next generation, supposedly so
we could create a better business environment in North Carolina. And so
what did we do?  I'm not saying it was dollar for dollar, I'm just
saying $50 million here, $50 million there, $50 million additional costs
for fees on small business.  Does that create a better business
environment? Is that a way to encourage small businesses to do more?
Now, it sounds to me like, as someone said, those millionaires got their
tax break, and again those small businesses end up paying that $50
million plus in additional fees. Lot of ways you can look at that. If
you're paying that additional $50 million in fees I think you look at it
as an increased cost of doing business and a reason why you won't hire
more people and expand your business.
I want to talk a little bit about the market in North Carolina because
we continue... and this is a myth, and I'm going to come to the credit
myth in a minute... Well, let me deal with the credit myth right now.
We keep talking about we going to be on a cash basis and we run our
households on a cash basis, and the State of North Carolina can't use
credit, et cetera, et cetera.  Now, we all know that's a lie.  First of
all, that everybody in here's got a piece of plastic in their... in
their pocketbook or in their wallet.  That means you're using credit.
That means you're not paying everything in cash. Even if you pay your
bills at the end of the month, you're financing it or carrying it for a
couple days.  If you're a member of a household, that means your
household uses credit. So to say it's irresponsible for the State of
North Carolina to leverage its resources and use credit where necessary
to have a better future, you're holding the state to a different
standard than you use for yourself.  And the question becomes, how do we
maintain our state's bond rating and credibility so we can effectively
leverage debt? So let's put aside that whole issue of &quot;we're going
to be on a cash basis and we're going to pay everything as we go.&quot;
I heard a comment by Representative McNeill, said we think there's a
money tree.  And no, my friend, it's not a money tree. It is a tree, but
it's a fee tree.  It's a $50 million increased fee tree. That's the tree
we're pulling on right now.  That is to say, the funds had to be found
somewhere and the decision was made to get them, and that's who's giving
them up.  It is what it is; that is the decision of the majority. But
let's be clear about it. Let's not fool ourselves.  It's not the best
budget we could put together or you could put together, or maybe it is,
but let's not fool ourselves about what it really is. Because, as
Representative Wells said, this is the first step, or one of the steps,
and we're going to have to do more steps. So let's be clear about what
we have to do.  The question of North Carolina... And the market's
great, the market tells you how you compete. So let's not continue to
pull these -- as I call them, and this, again, my words -- these bogus
surveys by these bogus think tanks, let's talk about what the market
does.  Let's let the market be the guide. Everybody that believes the
market's the greatest truth-teller we have, let's let the market be the
guide.  Who's coming to North Carolina?  When have they been coming?
Lower state and local tax burden on business, according to Council on
State Taxation...</p>

I'd ask that you vote against the budget, and for those who do I'd ask
you to take the responsibility for the people of the state of North
Carolina and for this institution to ensure at least the best things in
this budget don't get given away in a conference committee behind closed
doors. Thank you Mr... Speaker thank you members. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman from Wake Representative Dollar is recognized to speak on
Senate bill 42 a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr... Speaker
and members of the House. Never has logic been so tortured what I've
heard the last several hours, as a 3rd full day of debate, and logic
continues to be tortured in this chamber. And I find it a little bit
strange that my friends on the other side of the isle, they say
&quot;fight for the budget, fight for the budget, but we're not going to
be with you&quot;. Well, you want us to pass this budget, you think it's
the best budget of the 3 budgets that are out there then vote for it
today. You don't have to be stuck, you can be bipartisan. I voted for a
budget once. There were 6 budgets that I voted on, during the time that
I was in the minority. 1 out of those 6 didn't raise taxes, and so I
voted for that budget. I'm very thankful to say today, this is the 3rd
straight budget the republicans have produced that do not raise taxes,
and I'm proud to support it and vote for it. Because we have the
resources to fulfill the needs that we have in the state, and we have
the capability in this state, and the intelligence in this state, and
the wisdom in this state to be able to set priorities, just like every
other family does in this state, just like every business does in this
state. There's some real curiosities that I'm hearing out there. Most of
the things that I have heard in committee, most of the things, almost
everything I've heard on the floor yesterday and today, it's all small
stuff, it's all little things here little things there. Then today, a
few moments ago, we heard &quot;the great evil in the budget is there's
50 million dollars in fees&quot; A lot of those fees were fees that
people were asking for to help them with local projects that they had.
But if you want to talk about fees, I remember a year there was a budget
with 250 million dollars just in DMV fees, and you weren't worried about
that. You were standing up saying &quot;This is a wonderful thing, we
gotta have these fees.&quot; We've had plenty of years with 100, 150
million dollars in fees, come on. Let's be serious about what we're
doing. It's also curiosity to me that this budget is somehow evil.
Really, evil? The other day we finished in committee and one of the
lobbyists for NCAE, for the teachers, came up and shook my hand, thanked
me for how good the House budget was and really appreciate what we had
done. I tried to stay in here for a few minutes of the debate, but I
went out for a few minutes a while ago because the scenic people wanted
to take a picture, they appreciate what the house has done in the
budget, now they represent the state employees. So, evil? That's a very
odd thing to be saying. Here's what you're voting against, do you want
to talk about what you're voting against if you voting no today? You're
voting against 16 billion dollars over 2 years in K through 12, more
than what we have spent in the past. You are voting against full funding
for the rural center, which is supposed to be so important, and we know
that it is, to our rural legislators. You are voting against full
funding for the North Carolina Museum of The Arts, you're voting against
the North Carolina Symphony, for all those folks in here that say the
arts are so important, then vote for the budget, you're voting against
funds for transportation reform. You are voting against funding for the
justice reinvestment act, that was a bipartisan legislation and now
you're voting against the funding for it, I don't understand that. You
are voting against eugenics compensation it's supposed to be so
important. You are voting no on funding for the board of governors
strategic plan. You're voting no on compensation, we wish it was in the
first year, but it's in the second year, compensation for teachers and
state employees you're voting no. You're voting no on full funding for
Medicaid. You're voting</p>

citizens in the areas of education, in the areas of healthcare, it meets
the needs in the areas of public safety, and job development. And anyone

Thank you very much Mister Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House,
tomorrow is Flag Day and I think it's appropriate as we approach Flag
Day to remember another important occurrence to celebrate tomorrow and
that we pause to honor the birthday of the branch of the American Armed
Forces that has defended that flag longer than any other branch of the
American Armed Forces.
On June 13, 1775 months before Representative Roger West's navy built
it's first boat. And with all respect both to our Speaker pro tem
Representative Stam and our minority leader Representative Hall, months
before the United States Marine Corps was founded at some place called
Tun Tavern, I do believe that Representative Cleveland was tending bar
that day in 1775. And 172 years before fathering a bouncing baby Air
Force, Representative Whitmire, this is the service first entrusted by
the people of the United States of America to defend our nation.
A service that over 60 years ago enlisted a hard charger like Mickey
Michaux and that counts amongst the ranks of it's veterans infantrymen
like Garland Pierce and John Szoka. A service that even managed to make
a man out of John Blust. I may have slipped into a little bit of
hyperbole there. But ladies and gentlemen, please pause tomorrow to
honor the 238th birthday of the only branch of our Armed Services whose
core mission is to fight and win our nation's wars. Happy birthday
