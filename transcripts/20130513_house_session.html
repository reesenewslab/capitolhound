business court fee clarification they don't have to pay the extra
business fee to court until its referred to business court the
clarification agree assessment costs for counter claims and cross claims
and civil actions the motion fee exemption which was supposed to expire
in July of this year has been extended indefinitely on the child support
cases so the county will not have to pay their motion fees when they

counties were supposed to not be waived of their filing fees when they
set up cases the counties are not required to advance this filing fees
when they filed the cases they are required to pay that fee within 45
days and if it has not been payed for 90 days then their facility fees

Representative Steinburg, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] To speak on the bill Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman is recognized to debate on the bill as
amended.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker, Ladies and Gentleman of the
House. I rise to take a stand on this particular bill. I live in a
district heavily comprised of folks in the timber industry, and also my
district is home on Newcore steel as well. So this particular bill has
caused somewhat of a conflict for me and I would like And this is with
all due respect to my very good friends Representatives Presnell and
Catlin. A good bill, ideally, is one where both parties are going to be
helped. In this particular bill, that is not the case. If we compare
Newcore steel, which is my district, and the timber industry, as I
mentioned which is also in my district. If this bill were to pass, then
there is some thought that the timber industry, and I wouldn't disagree
with this, that the timber industry would benefit to some degree. But,
in talking with all of the folks at Newcore steel, if this bill were to
pass, it's going to hurt the steel industry here in North Carolina. Just
a couple of quick facts about Newcore. Newcore is a fortune 500 company
that has it's headquarters in Charlotte. While Newcore, their
representative in conversations with me, heavily support the timber
industry, they do have some problems with this particular piece of
legislation. Now the mill in my area employs about 450 people and the
mill has recently been expanded and 25 new positions were added. Newcore
is a very unique company, they have a no layoff policy. And what that
means is even when business is not good, they don't let their employees
go, they hang on to them. and these employees in Northeastern North
Carolina are averaging $80,0000 a year in income. Now there are few jobs
in Northeastern North Carolina that pay those kind of wages I can tell
you for sure, none that I'm aware of. Newcore has a couple of other very
unique things. One of them is, and for all of you folks that are
environmentalists, Newcore is the largest recycler in the United States,
the largest recylcer. It is the only steel company left in the United
States. We have abandoned steel to the Chinese. But Newcore, because of
a lot of the things they have been able to do, including their
commitment to use exclusively, almost exclusively 90% recycled material,
has found it's niche in the marketplace and they're doing very well. So
what we are looking at here is if this bill does not pass, the timber
industry is not going to be harmed, they perhaps may not have an
advantage that they would gain as a result of this, but they will not be
harmed. Think about that. The steel industry, if this bill passes, the
steel industry is going to be harmed significantly and the kinds of jobs
and this being a fortune 500 company again, headquartered within our
state. As much as I admire the two representatives who are sponsoring
this bill, I would have to ask you carefully consider these comments
before you cast your vote.</p>

I don't think taking one step forward and two steps backward is a good
idea when it comes to economics or employment. Good paying jobs are hard
to come by, we need to preserve those jobs, and for that reason I will
be opposing this bill this evening. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Mobley please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. As I said to you all last week,
Nucor is located within my home county and I want to repeat that I have
no qualms or dislike for lumbar because I know the lumbar industry is
just as important as the steel industry. However, I know that the steel
industry in my county employs a large number of high wage earners and I
would not like to see my constituents penalized by loss of jobs or the
company for that matter. And based on information that has been provided
to me this would be a hindrance for the steel industry.
The economy as it is is hurting in other areas and hopefully things are
gonna be on an upward swing, but I would encourage you not to support
this particular bill because of what it would do to the steel industry
with regard to leads. Again, I am not speaking against the lumbar
company because I have several of those in my district as well, and I
don't want the media or anyone else to go say I was speaking against the
lumbar company because I'm not. But I have a responsibility to speak
when it's going to cause a problem with any of my companies, and that is
why I'm speaking against this bill and ask you t do the same. Vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Elmore please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In district 94 in Wilkes county we are at about 12%
unemployment give or take and we are very excited when we see it move
just a tenth of a percentage point less. Our median income has dropped
from around $30,000 a year to $28,000 a year. Now my point with that is
my county has almost 34,000 acres of timber in it. My county is the
largest producer of hardwood saw timber in the state of North Carolina,
and because of our unemployment situation in Wilkes county  I'll tell
you one of the most successful businesses right now is the scrap metal
business because my folks are unemployed and they're looking for all the
pieces of scrap metal they can find to sell to get $50, $55, $30, and
most of that is going to Nucor. Now my point with all of this is, this
is a bill that deals with public money and this is the people's house,
and we can't stand for a policy that picks winners or losers. Because
right now my area is losing in this bill or how it currently is, and
this bill helps, and we need all the help we can get in Northwest North
Carolina when it comes to employment. I'd appreciate your support and
vote for this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samuelson please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members last week the bill's sponsor was kind enough
to delay third reading so that we could get answers to some of the
questions, and so I wanted to give you the answers that I found. I spoke
to North Carolina Forestry Association, Warehouser [SP] staff and the
bill's sponsor, and so I was gonna address on the questions as I recall
them and give you the answers. One question had to do with will this
bill make lead ineligible in North Carolina for public projects? The
answer is yes. Once this bill passes and becomes law and we just gave it
a few extra months, once it passes and becomes law you will not be
able...</p>

Lumber. Strictly, yes we will or we can and that will create more jobs.
The idea that we have to send off to Brazil or someplace else, the buyer
fluorine is absolutely ludicrous when we have perfectly good fluorine in
this state and we can use it. Imagine the bill that Representative
Presnell talked about in committee, well lot of us weren’t in committee.
But the forestry bill that use bamboo imported from Brazil. How many
jobs would we have created if we could have used North Carolina lumber?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blust, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative Brody will yield for a
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brody, what could be the difference
between a two by four from Brazil and one from North Carolina that would
render the Brazilian two by four so much more energy efficient than one
from North Carolina?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Probably, I guess if we use the North Carolina diesel
fuel to power the ship to bring it over, maybe that’s a plus. But other
than that, I’m sorry I can’t answer that question. So, in a way, just I
guess to end; let’s put in reality. October 31st comes, building will
continue; October 31st comes, we can, we as a state ?? we can strictly
request energy efficient, environmentally sound buildings but also what
we can do that leed doesn’t provide is we can insist our North Carolina
jobs. Thank you. Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hager, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Guys, you know I come, as
everybody knows from a very rural county just like Representative Elmore
does. And, I’ve got two places in my county and one of them is ?? as a
part of lumber. I met a couple of weeks ago when the subject of
Representative Presnell’s bill came up and they definitely told me they
employ about 300 people total between them. I have a chip mill where
there’s about another 100 folks. They told me that if they can sell more
lumber, they would employ more people. They thought this was the key to
sell more lumber. Now he made some assumptions here I think that I’m not
sure that we all can make. Representative Steinburg said if we don’t do
this, then we’ll lose jobs at Nucor. If we don’t do this, we will lose
jobs here and there. I think the assumptions made a) If we do this then
leed’s gonna leave. There would not gonna be Leed certified bills in
North Carolina. I don’t believe that’s true. I think we made a bigger
assumption here that if we do this then this bill just won’t get built
that we’re talking about. The ?? bill would not have got billed if we
didn’t have Leed certification. I don’t think that’s right. I think
these bills would still get billed just like Representative Brody talked
about. I think we’ll still move forward. And guess what, we’ll probably
use North Carolina lumber in them. Well, I don’t see anything coming
from this other than good things for the lumber business and those of
you from rural counties like I am, you probably have a lumber mill. You
probably know somebody that owns a lumber truck. You probably know
somebody who owns a skitter and if you’re from rural county, you
probably know what a skitter is. So, I ask you please if you want jobs
in rural counties and I tell you what my lumber folks are telling me.
They’re saying this is good for their jobs, this is good for their
bottom line. So please vote yes on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McElraft, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, it’s time to take a
stand. We’ve been writing letters, we’ve been asking the Leed
certification people for a long time to look at North Carolina lumber.
And so look at our certifiers and our sustainability. If you research
the leed, you’re talking about horse drawn; pulling wood out of some of
these areas with horse drawn shackles or whatever. Now that’s
ridiculous. We have sustainability here in our North Carolina forest and
we have grey certifiers to prove that and we need to take a stand like
the other states are doing right now. It’s time to do it. Nucor also
ships out of my port and we need those jobs there too and I’ll tell you
that we need to stand together as a state. Nucor, the concrete people
and the forestry industry and do what’s right for our entire state.
Nucor, you’ve already said has a monopoly on steel. Do you think we’re
not gonna continue to build steel buildings in this state. Of course we.</p>

The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, cutting red tape for small business is jobs.  This
is a jobs bill because it starts the process to review the twenty-three
thousand regulations that are on the books in the state of North
Carolina.  House Bill 74 establishes a three tiered process for the
periodic review of existing rules.  The Rules Review Commission is
directed to establish a schedule for this review and if an agency fails
to conduct the review by the date set in the schedule, the rule will
automatically expire.  The first step in the process is the agency to
conduct analysis of each rule as adopted at least once every ten years,
and make an initial determination concerning the rule.  The three
determinations that the agency can make is necessary with substantive
public interest, meaning that the agency has received public comment
objecting to the rule within the past two years.  The agency can
determine that the rule is necessary without substantive public
interest, meaning that the agency has not received public comment
objecting to the rule within the past two years.  Or, the agency can
identify the rule as unnecessary, meaning that the rule is obsolete,
redundant, or otherwise not needed. The second step in the process:  the
Rules Review Commission must report and determine whether public
comments have merit, and if a public comment has merit, then the rule
will go through to see whether there is statutory authority for the

legislators will have some input in it. And so, as we go through the
process of filtering out the bills that are necessary, the bills that
are maybe necessary but have some complications to it, or the bills that
are not necessary, we're going to have a chance to look back over them
as a body, and so I urge your support of the bill we've worked hard on
and I think it works. And to Representative Harrison's comment, yes,
there are a few little tweaks that we will be looking at when it goes
over to the Senate to make sure it actually functions the way it needs
to. When you're creating a new process, sometimes you have to make sure
that all the pieces are working the way you intended them to. I urge
your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Larry Hall, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just noticed on page three,
step three, the procedure for the final determination report that shall
become effective once they have consulted with the overall committee.
And this you may recognize if you read this step, you'll recognize it
from the transportation bill. And the problem I have with this is the
same problem I had with the procedure in the transportation bill. What
happens is the report comes back, the committee has a specified period
of time within which to meet. Apparently the committee chair is the only
person who can call that committee to have a meeting. If the meeting is
not held within the period of time, the report is deemed accepted and
everything goes on. So any review that you thought or intended to happen
at that third step, and that was supposed to be a critical part of the
rule making process, that review is then lost. So I'm concerned, and I
hope it will be fixed before it goes across to the Senate or someone
addresses the fact that it does not provide additional time or mechanism
for an extensive time to be given. If they do not meet within 60 days,
then it is deemed to be accepted and satisfied. So again, I hope that
someone will look at that and get that corrected. I hope that's not the
intention. I hope the intention at step three was in fact to have that
review done and not have it be automatic or happen unintentionally
because someone failed to call the committee meeting or the chair of the
committee personally liked the report and did not want anyone else to
have input on it. So I'll be voting against the bill as it appears, and
I hope whoever is going to ensure that it's correct will ensure that
step three in fact is effective.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not the
question before the House is the passage of the House committee
substitute to House Bill 74 on its second reading. All in favor vote
aye, all opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote. All members
wishing to record please do so at this time. Representative Blust. The

All opposed say no. The ayes have it. The House committee substitute to

memebers will have the amendment.... Back to House Bill 26, we
temporarily displaced it, but at the time we displaced it the amendment
was properly before us. Any member going to the dashboard wishing to
read the amendment before we take the vote on the amendment? Any member
here not able to get access to the amendment at this time? Further
discussion, further debate on the amendment? If not, the question before
the House is the passage of the amendment sent forth by Representative
Tim Moore to the House committee substitute to House Bill 26. All in

Written  by Allison's oldest son, Ben, who was a witness to this
horrible event, I will share with you the letter to Speaker Tillis from
Ben. Dear House Speaker Tillis, I'm Allison's oldest son. She was
murdered in December 2009. Even though the restraining order in place,
Corey still broke into the house and murdered my mom with my brother,
sister, and I in the house. The Allison Act could help prevent
endangered women from dangerous men at no cost to them. This could have
saved my mom's life and all the pain my family has had to go through.
Allison was a very hard working person, never liked to be wrong, but
would never back down from a challenge. Everyone knew her for her sense
of humor. She raised my brother, sister, and me in a church and preached
that nothing was more important than education and God. Thank you
Speaker Tillis, Ben. Mr Speaker I yield to Representative Deborah
Wallace who has a friendly amendment to add to this bill,
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the lady from Wade County
Representative Ross rise?

[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Deborah Ross must amend the bill on page
one line 26 by rewriting that line to read

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen this amendment simply adds
consultation with the North Carolina Coalition Against Domestic Violence
in assessing the GPS system so both the sheriff association and the
domestic violence community will be involved in looking at the system
and I commend the amendment to you
[SPEAKER CHANGES]For the discussion for the debate on the amendment , if
not, the question for the House is the amendment sent forward by
Representative Ross. All those in favor will vote Aye, All those opposed
will vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock the
machine and record the vote. 114 votes in the affirmative and none in
the negative. The amendment sent forward by Representative Ross has been
adopted. Further discussion, further debate on the bill. If not,
Representative from Meclenberg, Ms Schaffer is recognized,
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I simply like to speak on the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The lady is recognized
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative ?? has spoken to the ?? portion of the
bill. I simply wanted to say I did not have the opportunity to know
Allison but over the last few years I did have the great privilege of
knowing Allison's sister April and April's husband Josh and their
children. I've also gotten the chance to know Allison's two youngest
children who April and Josh are now raising. I just simply wanted to say
this is a great bill, it's another tool for our judges and our public
safety officials to be able to use to protect women in this kind of
situation and that really adds to a trend of some things that we've been
doing in the ?? assembly of this session and really giving these tools
to protect children. We've seen that in Carla's law and Kaylee's
Law.Then also these victims of domestic violence. I did have the
opportunity to meet Allison's mother a few weeks ago and she said to me
just thank you so much for what you're doing in trying to get this bill
passed. I know that nothing can bring Allison back but please do
whatever you can to prevent another mother from having to go through
this. I believe this is a good bill, good public policy and I urge your
support,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]For the discussion for the debate, if not the question
for the house is the passage of house bill 477 as amended on the second

[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I provided all the members
with some background information on this.  It went through full Commerce
Committee and full Finance Committee with unanimous support and uniquely
I got emails from Representative Collins and Representative Deborah Ross
about what a great bill it was.  It has the support of the Treasurer’s
Office Deemer.  I have a letter from Commissioner of Agriculture and the
Secretary of Commerce.  This is a good jobs bill.  It is a simple
clarifying change to include agriculture and forestry waste in a list of
industries that qualify for local government commission to issue tax
exempt bonds.  It does not obligate the state in anyway.  It has zero
fiscal impact.  I’m happy to answer any questions that will support  the

[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  House bill 664 provides
modifications to the regulation and construction modification of
wireless and broadband facilities.  What this bill does is removes the
patchwork of laws and regulations we have across this state, but still
maintaining the safety, land use and zoning of the local folks.  It
looks at building new wireless broadband and wireless facilities in
urban and rural areas.  This bill make it easier and a lot more cost
effective to get broadband and wireless in your area, especially the
rural areas where Representative Alexander said in Committee also the
urban areas.  So, I ask for your support for the bill.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Committee substitute for House Bill 675 a Bill to be
entitled An Act Commending Laws Pertaining to the Regulation of Pharmacy
Technicians, Pharmacy Audits, and Prescriptions of Schedule II
Substances.  General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Gentleman, from Wake County, Representative Murray
is recognized to debate the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you Mr. Chairman.  This Bill has five sections
in it.  Sections 1 and 2 deal with pharmacy technicians.  Sections 3 and
4 deal with pharmacy audits and Section 5 deals with Schedule II
medications.  I will start with Section 5, Schedule II medications are
the highest controlled substance in DEA law that includes Percocet,
Adderall, and Oxycontin.  It's the highest likelihood of abuse.
Representative Martin brought it to my attention that in North Carolina
we do not have an expiration date for the written hard-copy
prescriptions for Schedule II medications.  Whereas Schedules III's and
IV's, Valium, Hydrocodone, Vicodin, they expire six months from the date
written, and so this would add an expiration date to Schedule II
medications only.  You have to have a hard copy prescription every time
you get that prescription filled.  There are no refills for Schedule II
medications.  So this just adds an expiration date.  Going back to up to
Section 1 and 2, currently in North Carolina law, if you want to be a
pharmacy technician and work alongside a pharmacist, before you can
register with the Board of Pharmacy you have to have a job.  And so this
would allow for certified pharmacy technicians to be able to register
with the Board of Pharmacy, get trained, and then go get a job but it
adds another pathway for pharmacy technicians to be registered in our
State.  Additionally, Sections 3 and 4 deal with pharmacy audits and to
make sure that should an audit occur at a pharmacy and the insurance
company have to do a recoupment that the only portion that is an error.
I'll use an example as this is a very common error where a pharmacist
would bill for thirty pills but the prescription was written for three,
so I typed thirty and then the insurance company pays me, they figure
out the error, and they come back and take all thirty pills back when I
actually did dispense the three, and so this helps the situation to make
sure that you only get recouped what was actually dispensed in error.
Those are the five sections of the Bill.  With that, Mr. Chair, I would
like to send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Gentleman is recognized to send forward an
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Murray moves to amend the Bill on
Page 4, Line 12 by adding at the end of that line after the phrase 2013
the following sentence.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Gentleman is recognized to explain his amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  This just makes sure that the effective date of
October 1, 2013 that this law applies to pharmacy technicians registered
after that date and for audits that occur after that date. We just
wanted to make sure that this is clearly applies from this date forward
so that people can't get deemed for activities prior to the legislation
being passed.  This was recommended by staff.  As a technical
correction, I would ask that you support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Further discussion and debate on the amendment.  If
not, the question for the House is the amendment set forward by
Representative Murray.  All those in favor will vote &quot;aye&quot;.</p>

from Mecklenburg Representative Brawley rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
explain the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman is recognized. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I was chairman of the regulatory reform
subcommittee on local government and opened a bill that was to be an
omnibus bill and collected several ideas. And two of them actually I’m
bringing forward today. One is, these are only related to cities and
counties. In one there is a restriction on dues check-offs for union’s
collective bargaining units. Cities and counties are not allowed under
North Carolina law to collectively bargain. Some of them are checking
off dues. And actually they feel a little pressure to deal with their
citiz, with the citizens of theirs that are members of unions. There are
costs involved with this. And the purpose of this part of the bill is
simply to remove that as an option. So it’s our fault not the city
councils’ fault. The second one was a complaint that didn’t come from a
city but actually came from some companies. There are some local
governments that are considering instituting regulation of the carbon
footprint of corporate employees and will require companies to register,
put in plans to reduce the carbon footprint of their employees with fees
for participation and fines for none attainment. And while we recognize
the value of reducing carbon footprint I don’t believe that cities and
counties are actually charged with that authority. So they may run a
voluntary program but cannot run a compulsory one and require fines for
noncompliance. I was asked in committee if the dues check-off bill would
apply to school teachers. It would not. Boards of education are not
mentioned in this bill and they are I believe state employees. Thank you
Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from
Wake county Representative Hall rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I speak on the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of ?? this is another example of us here in Raleigh telling
local communities what they can and can’t do. This time we’re telling
both cities and counties that regardless of what people, what local
people want that they can’t pass local ordinances that our Federal
Government has already told us is okay to do. This time we’re telling
local communities that they can’t authorize or even allow payroll
deductions. And the problem with that other than us forcing our, our
will on local communities is that right to work the courts have already
said specifically does not prohibit union deductions. More specifically
the courts told us that we shouldn’t pick and choose. We already allow
deductions</p>

For charities like United Way, we've allowed deductions for teachers,
for State employees, so I would urge the members here to be consistent
in the ways we decide on what we tell local communities to do.
Specifically, if you agree that we should be telling them.   I hope
you'll vote against this Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  For what purpose is the gentleman from Cumberland
County Representative Glazier rise:
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  To debate the Bill Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you very much Mr. Speaker.  I rise in
opposition to the Bill for a variety of reasons.  The first reason was,
I think, eloquently stated by my colleague, Representative Hall.  There
may be some local communities that feel a pressure to do this and they,
of course, have to take responsibility and decide for themselves but
there may be local communities who do this or want to and now we're
telling them no, and I don't think it's our responsibility when it's not
a constitutional issue to be barring and taking over and micro managing
what counties and cities can and can't do.  They have a right to their
own decisions and the political consequences of them and they have a
right to make mistakes and to fail and to pick themselves up and try
something new or try something again.  I believe in local control
fundamentally and this Bill for no reason other than a pure policy
decision that we want takes that away from them and I don't think that's
sufficient.  But that's in a sense the minor reason for me voting
against the Bill.  The bigger reason is I think both, particularly the
labor provision, is fundamentally unconstitutional.  We went through
this exact argument when we cut off the NCAE dues last year and I stood
on heh floor and argued that there would be a lawsuit, that it violated
equal protection, due process, Bills of Attainder, and sure enough there
was a lawsuit.  The Wake County Superior Court found on multiple grounds
that it should be struck and we are doing the exact same thing here.  We
do not have the constitutional authority to say to one group that you
may have dues collected by the government but another group cannot.
Either we're gonna say nobody has that right, which may or not be
sufficient, but at least it's consistent or we don't get involved in it,
but we don't get to pick because we don't like labor unions or we don't
like NCAE, whether they can or can't do it.  The Constitution just
doesn't allow that.  This will inevitably lead to a lawsuit, it will
succeed.  We know that because it happened to us the last time we did
this exact same thing, and I don't know why we want to persist in this
path.  On top of which, this is beyond that, because this may have a
labor preemption issue under Labor Relations Act.  And so, not only do
we have the constitutional issues of equal protection and due process
and Bills of Attainder just like we did last time, we now have a
preemption issue on top of a local control issue.  For all kinds of
reasons, I think this is just a bad way to go.  We ought not be involved
in it.  We know what the result is going to be here and we ought not be
doing this, and so I'm going to be voting &quot;no&quot; and encouraging
all my colleagues to do the same.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  For what purpose is the gentleman from Durham
Representative Luebke rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  To speak on the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you Mr. Speaker and Members of the House.  I
want to speak about both parts of this Bill and let me also say this is
one of the oddest titled Bills I have ever seen.  There is nothing to do
with regulatory reform here.  This is in the first part an anti-union
Bill and have no doubt about that, it's an anti-union Bill, there's no
regulation there.  The second thing is that you're interfering with
attempts on the part of local governments to try to do something about
air pollution in their jurisdiction.  Let me say first on the labor part
of the Bill that both Representative Hall and Representative Glazier
said is exactly right.  For those of you who were here last time in the
last session you remember that this issue came up at 1:00 in the
morning.  One of our special sessions sometime between 1:00 AM and 1:30
AM we had a vote on the decision to deny NCAE dues check off.  That Bill
did not deny dues check off to the State Employees Association.  The
only reason any of us could figure out why this was the case is because
NCAE had vigorously opposed the policies of the Republican Majority and
NCAE had been more neutral.  So was retribution being taken against the
NCAE.  As Representative Glazier correctly said he predicted a lawsuit,
there was a lawsuit and the State is enjoined from enforcing the
retribution against NCAE.  We have a similar situation here in which the
question could be asked.</p>

<p id="130:00">
?? Representative Brawley, but I won’t in the interest of time, what’s
the difference...why is it that we can have a dues check off in effect
or payment check off for the United Way and United Way typically will
accept a monthly check off, you can pay your $120 at $10 a month which
is the effect which is similar to a labor union dues check off and we’re
not prohibiting union...excuse me, United Way check off. We are
prohibiting fire...it’s really firefighters and police officers. In
many, many of our cities you have firefighters and police officers who
have organizations to operate on their behalf, so in voting for this
bill , you’re voting against your local firefighters and local police
officers. Please be aware of that.
On the second part of the bill, I simply do not understand where my
colleague, Representative Brawley, is coming in saying that local
government should not do something that tries to reduce pollution, air
pollution. The fact of the matter is that it should all right for the
city of Durham and in our case, I want to just say that the city of
Durham has exactly such a policy, we have a policy that requires large
employers to do certain things that will reduce their air pollution,
basically the ozone emissions from their automobiles. We require large
employers to reduce the amount of commuter miles traveled by their
workforce. Why do we want to do this? Because we don’t want a zillion
single trips by employees and so the purpose of the local ordinance is
to require use of vans, carpooling, etc. by the employer that the
employer must organize. Why will we, as a General Assembly, go out after
the city of Durham for that kind of plan. You’re going after the city of
Durham because it’s trying to reduce air pollution, the ozone footprint.
And generally the question, why are we keeping local governments from
doing what they want to do to reduce air pollution. It makes no sense to
me, except that, once again, this majority is trying to meddle in the
affairs of local government. It’s a bad bill. Members, please vote no.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Rockingham County, Representative Jones, for what
purpose do you wish to be recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if the bill’s sponsor, Representative Brawley, would yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Will the gentleman from Mecklenburg yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Brawley. I wanted to ask you, why…what would
you say is the difference between this particular bill and the bill that
has been discussed from the last session regarding the NCA e-dues check
off.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I thank the gentleman for his question. I believe the previous example
that the opposition gentleman have quoted, we eliminated dues check off
for one and only one group and continued to do check off for other
groups. This does not pick a particular group, but says that since
counties and cities cannot collectively bargain with any unions, all
unions would be barred from dues check off.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would the gentleman yield for another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley, why not non-profits? That was mentioned as well.
Why would you not include them in the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative, non-profits can receive funds from both cities and
counties legally under North Carolina law, while collective bargaining
units are...or cities and counties are barred from collective bargaining
under North Carolina law, so there’s a difference in the legal standing
in the two groups in relation to cities and counties.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would the gentleman yield for one more question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Will the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Brawley. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Representative Brawley, why would you say that local governments should
not just be able to do whatever in this area that would be popular with
their voters?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The difficulty is that governments will sometimes do things that are
very popular, but for which they do not have legal authority, and we
frequently hear the argument, well this is popular with the voters and
they re-elect us when we do this, why can’t we do it? The idea that many
people say that the genius of the American system is majority rule, and
that is not, in fact...</p>

These were counties who were requiring 100% registration, everybody has
to sign up so they will know who you are, in case you do something wrong
they can find you. And in some cases even to the point of having to
publish seven by twenty-four contact information by placing a sign
inside the front door of all of your rental units. In many cases there
is a fee required to register which is designed to do full cost recovery
so that the program is completely paid for by landlords. There has been
no duty by police to notify landlords of problems with their property,
and in fact you may not know you have trouble until you suddenly
discover you've been on double-secret probation and you've hit the bad
list, and the bad list could be different numbers, so we had reduced it
to 4% in the bill. We also added duties to the police, that they must
notify landlords who are registered, that they must be willing to
testify and cooperate in evictions, and that landlords who cooperate
actively with police would be held harmless. Now there were several
issues raised both in committee and with subsequent discussions with
members of the league, and Mr. Speaker at this time I would like to send
forth an amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment the clerk will
read
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative W. Brawley moves to amend the bill on page one lines 29
through 34 by rewriting those lines to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker what the amendment does is on the inspections within
blighted areas it recognizes that while for small towns one square mile
is sufficient, for larger cities and larger areas it's not, so we have
put in 5%, and this does not have to be a contiguous 5%, a total of 5%
of the land area of your city or county can be designated as blighted
and subject to extra inspections. We retain the 4% being the required,
the bad list for the rental registration but put in two other qualifiers
that would allow landlords to come within the plan. One is any unit that
has three incidents within a rolling thirty-day period, or seven
incidents within a twelve-month rolling period, and we particularly like
the first one because if someone bad moves in and starts to act up you
don't have to wait a long time or wait until they get to be in the top
4%, after three times the police are out they're added and you can start
working on them. We also added an appeal process for landlords that feel
they've been unfairly targeted, and just as kind of a personal note,
some of my insights from this came from an accidental experience as a
landlord of a troubled property early in my career as a broker I was
asked to just sit at a place because they had fired the manager, it was
an extended-stay hotel, the client of our firm had bought it with the
intent to convert it into elder condos, there were three buildings, one
they had emptied. I came out, and by the end of the first week I
discovered that what we had bought was a hot pad of crime, and the way I
discovered this was I thought, why don't we put in drug testing for the
employees, and at the end of my first week I only had two employees
left, and none of my security people, so I approached the police about
hiring off-duty and one of the officers said, &quot;You do know you're
in the top three for calls for service in Freedom Division, don't
you?&quot; Now the Freedom Division included Wilkinson Boulevard which
had the no-prostitution zone, it had Freedom Drive, it had Bradford
which was the hotbed of the shooting galleries and when I went out at
night I discovered that after we closed the office the portico in front
of it became a stroll where ladies of the late afternoon whose amateur
status was definitely in doubt would stand out from under the weather
while people would come in and make whatever arrangements. I hired
off-duty police and said, &quot;I don't want you to just kinda keep an
eye on things, I want you to enforce every law in the city of
Charlotte.&quot; Over the course of four months we were able to reduce
the crime rate in the Freedom Division, or at least in that block by
67%. The property I managed went from fifty-eight calls for service down
to less than one. We shut down two prostitution rings, two drug rings, a
gun-smuggling ring, one group that was attempting to manufacture
methamphetamines and got a federal case in human trafficking. The thing
that I would say is, one I was scared to death, two I was paying big
money to have</p>

police officers some of whom were SWAT officers with machine guns were
protecting me. And one day we went through the door with a SWAT team
with 20 people and hauled 9 guys out 15 bags of crack cocaine a bale of
marijuana. And I never seen so many people in helmets outside of Fort
Bragg in my life. I had cooperation with the police but I was paying for
it. Landlords who aren't paying for it need to have cooperation. For all
our desire to clean up our cities guys like me aren't really the people
you want confronting folks that sell guns, folks that cook meth. The
police need to be involved that's the main thing we want. The landlords
are often victims themselves. Some gangs have a phrase they use which
often delivered in Spanish but sometimes in English. It goes simply this
Silver or Lead? You take our money and let us do what we want or we will
give you the lead of bullets. And see if your successor is more willing
to support what they want to do. The purpose of this bill is to bring
the police and the landlords closely aligned to do something that we
need to do. It's something I seen in my city and I think unfortunately
it's true in too many. We are sometimes willing to accept levels of
crime in some neighborhoods that we would never accept in our own. This
bill is an attempt to get everybody involved to the solution of the
problem and I ask for your support thank you Mr. Speaker.[SPEAKER

briefly I appreciate that representative Brawley is responding to the
concerns, many concerns over the expressed by both me and by people from
Durham city council and Durham city staff that came to the house
government commitee meeting and I appreciate very much that he's working
on this however, The change is to the size of the problem that can be
looked at essentially  in your amendment Brawley goes to 5% as you and I
discussed for Durham, Durham has an area of 12% that is working on right
now they did the calculation per Representative Brawley's request I
understand you and the city had a good meeting on this. 5% is just to
low but 5% us better than zero percent and well what we have in the
current bill  is one square mile 5% to me doesn't go far enough but it
is better than the way the bill is now so I'm support the amendment and
wish to encourage you to do so as well. Thank you.</p>

proud of it, but we have a lot of slum housing and are a lot of poverty
and Garmin a lot of people who need housing no matter what standards it
meets the housing needs and as a result of that after seeing, hearing a
lot of complaints from people and different parts of the city who are
dissatisfied is whether landlords are willing to do to fix up the
property. our city Council work to come up with a very carefully crafted
bill ordinance that would allow the city to go into areas of the city
where there were consistent violations of this of that ordinance in
terms of health and safety and make inspections and tell you that in the
areas that the city went for the inspection program. more than two
thirds of the housing units that were examined at violations of code

Goods. I have a number of those neighborhoods in my history and so I
speak from a - not a theoretical but a very practical standpoint. I
received a call from a lady not too long ago who was complaining about
properties around here and complaining about the type of activity that's
going on in those properties. Now it turns out that having landlords to
register so that the police can find them is something that is helpful
in order to get these properties cleaned up. And that's not a
philosophical position, that's a practical position. When you go to tax
roles to try to find some of these folk, that's like trying to peer
behind blue smoke and mirrors, and especially when a lot of these owners
live in other counties, other states, sometimes in other countries.
And when you've got an alleged drug cartel operating next door, you
don't have the time to try to figure out where somebody is in Honduras
in order to get something done. And another thing is area, this bill
talks about 5% , well maybe that's a lot in some of your cities and
counties but 5% of Mecklenburg county or 5% of Charlotte would leave
most of the area undefended and would leave the ability of the police to
do something on a practical stand point pretty much undercut. And for
these reasons and the fact that my city government opposes it, it is not
just the political side of the city government but the police side of
the city government opposes it, that I cannot in good conscience vote
for this measure , and I urge you to join me in voting against it.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker and members, this too is a bipartisan bill
and we kind of come to this from different perspectives but whether it’s
an individual or a business perspective, we all want and expect the same
results and this is expecting to be compensated for the product that we
provide and we expect for this solution to come speedy and that’s not
happening right now. Many of us in here, for whatever reason might have
some rental properties, maybe 2 or 3 and then there are others that do
this for a business and as I said, you know, we expect for the process
to work when there are issues dealing with tenants. We had several
meetings, just a little bit of background; I met with many folk, many
stakeholders as it relates to coming together to have a balanced bill.
Just to let you know, a part of the coalition that came together was
judges, the apartment association, crisis assistance ministry, legally
there was an attorney that does eviction filings, the local sheriff, his
department, North Carolina justice center, the magistrates and the clerk
??. And we all met trying to come together on a bill that would be
balanced for all involved. And this bill is all about reducing the time
for eviction. And I’ll go through it if you would like but basically,
it’s pretty straightforward. It just reduces some of the time periods
and as I said, it was a bill that was pretty much a consensus bill and I
would ask for your support. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Friends, purpose of this
amendment is to bring smaller counties, small claims courts magistrates
into compliance with the law. Right now, the bill as written provides
for a 5 day period for any kind of continuance and elements kind of
where I am from, several smaller counties across the state, small claims
only meet once a week. That means a 7 day period so they would not be in
compliance with the 5 day period. Wanna thank Representative Earle for
working with me on this. She’s been very cooperative, very helpful and a
pleasure to work with you and I encourage your support for this
amendment which simply takes a period from 5 days to 7 days to allow our
smaller counties to be in compliance with this law. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Faircloth, please state your purpose.

He is also concerned about this.  This is troubling.  The sherrifs are
against it.  It's going to cause problems.  Is going to cost to their
counties money.  You gonna take money out of the operating accounts of

Pages, it is 9:00.  Where a couple of minutes over.  I was allowing

You're now released.  Representative Floyd, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, on Friday I was in conversation all morning with our
sherriff.  Similar to what Mr. Faircloth mentioned.  And as I was
talking with the county sheriff attorney, he mentioned something to me
that took place some years back about a similar type bill when landlords
would use these kinds of individuals to evict low-income individuals out
of their property.  But that concern rides with the sherriff that he may
have to come back and cleanup an unfortunate situation.  Those of you
who can remember the red light, when lawyers fought the issue, that the
red light camera itself was not an authorized law enforcement officer,
so therefore the red light camera could not issue a ticket.  This is
similar to what we're saying here, that un-uniformed person is going to
perform a uniformed task, with no training.  This may create a chaos
when you go to a low income person, and a person standing there saying
that I'm here to evict you.  And then that low-income person might
utilize one of his unique objects that he have in the house, and here
come the sheriff, would have to clean up that matter.  I think that the
ammendment, this is a good bill, but it would help to clarify the
situation.  Not only that, but the county already served the warrants
within a reasonable period of time.  Our county stands to lose hundreds
of thousands of dollars if this amendment is passed.  And you have a 21
year old person, not licensed, but is going to a property at whatever
time it is and tell that person that he has a summit from the landlord
to evict that person.  He may or may not be in uniform, but if he is not
in uniform and not been trained, then the sheriff will probably have to
come and provide him some assistance.  So, I ask you to support the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The chair assumes all lights that are on are on to debate the amendment.
 Representative Bill Brawley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  The ammendment addresses a piece of the bill in
which a landlord can have a private process server deliver the summons
for the small claims court.  It's aimed at the largest counties, because
they are the ones that have the greatest problem.  I mentioned earlier
that I had a short career managing property, and before my investor left
for Florida for lower tax rates and no death tax, I did occasionally
have to do evictions.  And one of the problems with doing an eviction is
when you pay the sheriff to serve the summons, if he doesn't serve it,
you show up in court, you can't prosecute the eviction.  If they have
served it, but served it by posting, and not actually gotten in touch
with the individual, you may get possession of the property, but you
cannot recover the past due rent.  This portion of representative
Earle's bill, of which I'm a cosponsor, allows those largest counties
where the problem of the sheriff's department's inability to serve a
complaint allows plaintiff landlords the opportunity to pay for private
process servers to serve the complaint only.  We're not going to have
private individuals doing the actual evictions, which is entering the
order for possession and escorting people off the property.  This is
merely to make sure that when you show up for court,</p>

out of the 55 had bad addresses on them. Information indicates that
where there are delays in summary ejectments, it is because of hearing
scheduling delays or delays before the papers get to the Sheriff's
Office. But Sheriffs are serving the papers in a timely manner. You're
picking on the wrong people. I urge you to support this amendment.

[speaker change]
I guess I need to respond to some of what's been said, also. I'm trying
to figure out how to say it, but some of the numbers that Representative
Faircloth just quoted are misrepresented. Those are not the same figures
that I'm getting, and I'm not going to go into quoting all of those
figures. And I did learn how to count well enough to know what might
happen to this amendment. But what I do want to say is that the 7 day
period that these summons are supposed to be served is not the time that
they are being served in. Many times, the clerk of court reschedules or
will schedule it out far in advance just so the Sheriffs will have an
opportunity to serve it. But I assure you, the numbers that I have are
more, far more. And if there was not a problem I would not stand up here
before you and express to you that there is a problem. And there is a
problem in all of these 5 counties with the way these summons are being
delivered. And I just want to appeal to you one more time not to support
this amendment. But, should you, just check with your clerk of court and
see where the problem is. And it is certainly not with the courts. Thank

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm going to support this amendment, but there
is certainly some confusion here about what I'm hearing from the
realtors, those who have rental property, and what I'm hearing from the
Sheriffs. And I think one way to solve this is to object to third on the
bill, and to offer an amendment that would state that if these are not
served within 7 days, then the Sheriff's Department are not paid their
forty dollars. And I'm going to offer that amendment tomorrow. And then
maybe these will be properly served, and someone will take the proper
authority over getting those served. Or, someone will get their money
back.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Fellow representatives.  House bill 850 changes
general statute 98113-22 to provide that prior to a search of a person,
an officer may when they're searching a person, vehicle or a home, ask
that person if they have a hypodermic needle or other sharp object.  If
that person so discloses that they have a sharp object, then that person
would not be prosecuted for that crime.  This is a law enforcement
safety bill, designed to reduce the number of officers they get needle
sticks, and exposed to a communicable disease.  It is supported by the
North Carolina sheriff's association.  70% of officers say that the
threat of being stuck by needle is of a great concern to them.  It
passed judiciary A with a favorable report.  I commend the bill to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brandon, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  I'm the odd man out on this bill, and I'm not
sure whether I'm gonna vote for it or vote against it, but I do want to
bring up the point that I made in judiciary about this bill.  First of
all, we have a culture in this country and in this state of treating
criminals differently.  And this bill does that in terms of if you are a
heroin addict, and if you do heroin, we're going to treat you
differently than we treat other people that have drugs and might have
paraphernalia.  So, basically what this bill says is that if you shoot
heroin up, if you use a needle, we're going to give you an out. But if
you just do pot, and you have a bowl in your car, then you still get the
charge.  And to me, I think I have a problem with that.  It's the same
thing we did with crack cocaine.  We have one law for crack, we have one
law for cocaine.  There's no difference in it.  And so I would like for
us to look and consider the fact that if we're going to make laws like
this that we make it consistent.  That drug addiction is drug addiction.
 Paraphernalia is paraphernalia.  And not one group of people should
have an out and another group of people should not.  The second thing I
would like to add about this bill is that it where does it stop if we're
going to do that?</p>

there's lots of things that sheriffs and law enforcement come
encountered with that could hurt them. Are we going to saw a law that,
hey, if you disclose the fact that you have a firearm in your car it
might hurt me?  So if you disclose that you're not going to be charged
with possession of a firearm. And the list can go on and on and on.  But
my bigger point to this is that, I have a problem with the fact that
we're having a two tier system with the way we deal with drug addicts,
and if you're a drug addict of this kind you get this out.  If you're a
drug addict of this kind you do not get the same privilege.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Representative McNeill, please state your purpose.
[NEW SPEAKER]
To ask Representative Brandon a question.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Representative Brandon, does the gentleman yield?
[NEW SPEAKER]
Absolutely.
[NEW SPEAKER]
The gentleman yields.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Mr. Brandon, have you ever searched a heroine addict?
[NEW SPEAKER]
I have not. I have not searched a heroine addict and I also have not
ever pulled over anybody with a firearm in their car either.  I
understand the point and I understand the safety point. My point is is
that we continue to make a two tier system. Those who do this type of
drug get this treatment, those who do that type of drug get that
treatment. And I have a problem.  I do understand what you're saying.  I
understand that the sheriffs, they have a tough job. We understand that.
 And I want to make sure that we pass laws, and things like that, to
make sure that they're safe. But if the unintended consequence is that
you have a group of addicts, or a group people who break the law get one
treatment, and people who break the law get another treatment, that is
not what our Justice Department is for. That's not what our justice
system is for.  You can name lots of things that a sheriff or police
will encounter that might hurt them. It's their job.  That's what
happens. So, my point is that, we just have to be careful in making sure
that we don't create two tier systems for this criminal and then we have
another one for that criminal.

I'm right, and I think I am.  The sole purpose of this bill is to

distinctions. It's not to give benefits to a particular class of
defendants.  It is to protect the officers, is that not correct?

absolutely no objection to it that we had an election law unhappy answer

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
madam speaker in generally adaptability is a clean up bill better
transparency, better,easier to understand reporting, but it occurred to
me that our state board of elections office and more time investigating
the important stuff and recording the important stuff it what it wasn't
inundated with paperwork. I think it don't matter, and also it could be
a trap for the unwary. the person doing it independent expenditure may
be mom-and-pop or a daughter and son, or whatever you do in a small
expenditure. they can possibly affect the election. so all this
amendment does not clearly with all three of the prime primary sponsor
Virgin Lewis Lincoln Roth it just raises the threshold little bit to a
three hundred dollars a municipal races keeps that the thousand dollars
in other races because as you know the thousand dollars. this didn't
affect the election and ill keep a lot some of the paper work out of the
portable action and live give them more time to accomplish the
rumination time of the adoption of the amendment and support the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
thank you ladies and gentlemen on on that I'm not that object to the
amendment, though I was told it was only could be to raise up to five
hundred on so we just right now people start reporting it. one hundred
and so keep that in mind when you vote on the amendment further
discussion thread. it made on the amendment,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
if not a question of whether houses the passage of the amendment set
forth are represented Stamford has to be substituted out of managing all
favour by not all)of our popular
heart-lung machine or the one hundred twelve admitted affirmative into
in the negative. the amendment passes were now back on the bill further
discussion for the debate on the bill rubs a ruggedly sacred purpose to
ask the bill sponsor question Representative Ross is the lady of ideal
palladium eight-man
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
if you could do it correctly on this, but the greatness over the
weekend, and this is no language on page one goes through and identifies
who these independent expenditure people or entities are and of course
want to three and for that page are pretty self-explanatory, but I'm a
really concerned about number five and eighty can explain this to me
because it asks for the names and addresses of all entities that donated
to to that particular entity and my question would be is is the NRA or
maybe a labour union or something like that considered an entity that
would make the and independent contribution, and if that is so what they
would does Steve have to find out every single person who donated to
those groups will answer to that question is yes, but when they donate
when anybody donates more than fifty dollars start campaign, even if
it's a fat contribution that all had to be reported. so this is a
hundred dollars so I don't see how that is anyone onerous for
independent expenditure committees than it is for all his candidates.
what we have to report and we have to report on all that information for
anybody who donate fifty dollars or more. so they actually get off a lot
easier because it's a hundred dollars, although please was bigger than
you are you are you okay so basically the area that I got married.
besides the Rane and independent expenditure ad for for myself. for
example, they would have to then report to the board of elections every
single dona tor that donated to the NRA would that be correct. now that
would not be correct, it would be people who donate over a certain
threshold limit, which is double the threshold limit for anybody who
donates to our camp</p>

Though it's not anybody who donates it's people who donate over a
certain amount.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Further discussion, further debate.  Representative
Brody, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Okay, just for one clarification.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I'm sorry, ask a further question please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Ross does this lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Okay, just for clarification.  Now a coordinated
expense is one where you would donate to the candidate or you would
donate in coordination with the candidate.  An independent expenditure
is something that the candidate knows nothing about or has no doing
about the donation.  So, therefore, same question, would somebody who
would be let's say a labor union would want to run an ad for you would
they then have to in turn report every single member of thatt labor
union who is part of that entity.  Because the Bill says you're part of
it and donated to it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  If a  person donated more than 100 dollars, that
would have to be reported.  In the same way that if a person donates
more than 50 dollars to our campaign, it would have to be reported.  It
gives the public information about who is disseminating information in
elections, and in a large degree it gives more of a shield to these
independent groups than it does to us, but this Bill requires more
frequent reporting so that people can know during the course of the
election cycle.  And this won't benefit one party or the other because
both sides do it.  It's about the public knowing who is paying for the
information that's being disseminated.  Again, it was supported by both
sides of the aisle and it's particularly supported by the State Board of
Elections just because they get all of the complaints about these ads
and these things and they want to be able to track down who did it and
whether or not they are violating the law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Cleveland please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  To speak on the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  The gentleman is recognized to debate the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I'm having a problem here.  If I understand the
debate correctly, anyone that donates money to an organization, over 100
dollars, and that organization runs an independent ad in a campaign,
then that organization is going to have to provide all the names of
anyone that donated.  I just... it sounds good, transparency but what do
we have? We have some organization that runs an ad in a campaign, it has
7 million donors, maybe three-and-a-half million of those donated 100
dollars or more and they're going to be required to provide that
information to the Board of Elections.  I honestly do not see where
that's going to benefit transparency one bit outside of having another
big data base that someone's going to have to take care of.  If we know
the organization that ran the ad, I think that would be sufficient.  I
really have problems with this portion of the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Stam please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Speak the second time on the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  The gentleman is recognized to debate the Bill a

[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you.  It's the first time but I'll treat it
like the second time.  I do support the Bill.  This is not a new
concept.  These contributions are to further that independent
expenditure.  This is not talking about the general dues that somebody
might have paid toward an organization that does an independent
expenditure, but I'd encourage you to vote for it.  The Election Law
Committee passed it unanimously, if I recall correctly, and of course,
our Election Law Leader, David Lewis wrote it, so I think you can trust
that.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as
amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Someone said that the bill came out of the election
committee ?? and I don’t think so but I did really support the bill. The
reason for that is how much do we, in this chamber think the board of
election can undertake. We have a similar bill and they’re concerning
the metropolitan plan or organization that they are to report in and I
do not believe that the board of election has an enough ?? to handle all
additional duties that have been given to them and doing election cycle,
you know, that’s a lot of energy and a lot of time. I didn’t support the
bill at that particular point of time and I’m tossing right now should I
vote for it ??. The board of election cannot continue to take on
additional staff and additional responsibility without some money coming
from somewhere. So, I’m at a loss right now, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Ross, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak a second time on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill a second

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen, I just wanna make it clear that
the board of elections very much want this bill. They get a lot of
complaints about independent expenditures, they get a lot of complaints
where people don’t know what is going on. Again, they get these
complaints from both sides and they get inquiries from the public
because they wanna know what’s going on with these campaign ads. So it
is something that the board of elections is very much in favor of and
the new head of the board of elections spoke in the committee in favor
of the bill. I commend it to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I ask ?? house that we be allowed to get

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection, so ordered and ladies and
gentlemen, we may not complete the calendar. We would at least like to
get rid or dispose of the bills that were on the original calendar and

Brody, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just for the record, I’m gonna oppose the bill and
that number 5 is just clean frightening. You’ve gotta read it. The names
and addresses of all entities that donated to further ?? expenditure.
That’s everybody, everybody who’s ever donated to the entity. The other
thing is I wanted to point out that if you read the bill, 7 times in
this bill they list a new report or an additional report down here. So,
what this is creating is just more reporting and besides what I’ve been
talking about in the beginning, can you imagine the size of those lists
that are gonna come in to the board of elections. So, I’m asking you to
oppose this bill. Thank you.

Bill does absolutely nothing. But it actually does one thing important.
You may recall about a month ago, Representative Davis and I did a bill
regarding the property rights of what were called illegitimate children.
And I said I did not like that term because no child is illegitimate. I
asked the staff to find 28 places, every place in the general statutes,
where they were referred to as
illegitimate children and change it. And that's what this bill does, 28
times. So if you would like to get that term and the term bastardy out
of the general statute, vote yes on the bill and save the explanation of
the other 27 sections.

trucks, D.O.T. had recommended putting a trailer on the back of it but
when you put a 60 foot pole, it's too long to go around the corners as
swiftly as it needs to go. So, we decided to try modifying the weight
limit that they could go over and the only, I have a PCS from the

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Committee Substitute for House Bill 626, a bill to be entitled an act,
to promptly notify local law enforcement agencies of certain information
by vehicles that have been towed, the General Assembly of North Carolina
enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Members of the House, currently in statute when
your vehicle is towed, if your vehicle is registered in North Carolina,
the towing company has up to 24 hours to notify you of the fact that
they've towed the car and where it is being stored.  If it's registered
outside the state, they have 72 hours to do so.  This bill would require
the tower of the vehicle to notify local law enforcement having
jurisdiction over the area where the vehicle is towed, of a description
of the vehicle, the place from which it was towed, the place where the
vehicle will be stored, and the contact information from the person who
actually towed the vehicle so the owner of the vehicle can retrieve it.
This is in response to--typically what happens when someone discovers
that their vehicle is towed--they typically call 911 and the emergency
operator does not have any information as to where to direct the person
to have help.  In this instance, they'll be able to direct them to the
information officer in the law enforcement agency having jurisdiction
and they'll be able to get their hands on the information that they
need.  I'll answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollar, please state your purpose.

Thank you, Representative Moffitt.  As we have discussed previously, I
think everyone agrees that predatory towing is something that is a
concern that people don't want to see.  However, the bill may have
implications for other towers in the normal course of their business,
and I think you would confirm that you're gonna [sic] continue to work
with the towing association and others to address some of the concerns
that have been expressed to this point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's correct, and I also will be working with law enforcement to
really put together a better process for this to happen.

exempt certain primitive structures from the building code.  The General
Assembly of North Carolina enacts.

Representative McGrady, please state your purpose.

To explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This bill is one that would exempt certain primitive camps and primitive
farm buildings from the current building code.  You may have read about
this situation where a summer camp up in Representative Jordan's
district was closed down.  It was actually meant to be a 1830's example
of how people lived and obviously they didn't have cement nor a range of
other things including complying with the building code.  It came out of
committee, I believe, unanimously; and I would ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jordan, please state your purpose.

The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, colleagues.  I would definitely recommend that you support
this.  This is the Mountain Man, Eustice Conway; and other primitive
camps of that sort.  There are a number of them around the state.  My
family and I, and Representative McGrady went to visit and there's a lot
of important teaching and learning going on, but the county of Watauga
has decided to shut it down because they don't meet the residential
building codes.  That's what we need to help in this situation.  I'd
urge your support of this.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you ladies and gentlemen, speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the
house. This bill is a very simple bill. It allows this town of Bellmont,
that Representative Bumgardner and I actually share. It gives them the
opportunity to raise, to lease a section next to or adjacent to a
railroad, to use as a walking path that would pretty much connect the
Bellmont Ave to downtown Bellmont. They can't disturb the rail line
because it is still, although it is an active rail line, there is no
service currently on it. It's been kinda stopped for service just at the
line a little bit. But it does provide access, and the only way for them
to do that would be through going into a lease with the state of North
Carolina. I appreciate your support.

please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Speaker, are we doing announcements?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Not yet.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Ladies and gentlemen of the House, the Chair is happy
to report that the bills that we did add to the calendar to this evening
were not met with a lot of controversy. The Chair will commit to you
that any bills that get added like that between now and crossover
deadline will only be taken up if there's not objection. And I'll think
you'll see in this particular case it was fairly mixed and all of them
were non-controversial. But that will be one way but by processing
another 10 bills tonight, it just lessens the load and makes it less
likely that we'll have to be here very, very late on the next two or
three days. For purposes for planning tomorrow, the committee
announcements that are out, I think some are established for 8:30 in the
morning, the committees are going to meet. However, when we adjourn
tonight, we're going to adjourn to reconvene at 9:30 a.m. Now
procedurally, some member could object to the fact that meetings are,
that committee meetings are occurring. We will come in at a skeleton
session simply so that we can begin to read in committee reports. So we
will convene at 9:30 but it will be a skeleton session and we will
recess and come back at 2:00 p.m. So committees will essentially meet
all morning long. However, we will be in recess so that we will be able
to read in committee reports and have the calendar ready by the time we
come to session at 2:00 p.m. It's in the intent of the Chair to meet
until somewhere between 5:00 and 5:15 and provide a two hour break. And
the purpose of that break will be one, so that you can take a break, but
two, so that other committee meetings and other things may have to
occur. So that will go from probably about 5:15 until about 7:00, 5:00
to 7:00, plus or minus 15 minutes. And the Chair anticipates it will
likely be the calendar for the next three days. It's very possible on
Thursday, however, that the bulk of that day will be in session
disposing of the crossover sensitive calendar items. No bills will be
taken up for the remainder of this week that are not crossover
sensitive. So if you've got Senate members asking why a bill is not
being heard, it's because by definition, it's not crossover sensitive.
Notices and announcements. Representative Warren, please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] For an announcement, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized for an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you. The House Committee on Government will meet
tomorrow afternoon at 1:00 p.m. in Room...</p>

Senate Bill 287, which was originally referred back to the Committee on
Rules needs to be placed back on the calendar for tomorrow. Reason being
there's a House Bill that's somewhat of a companion bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Without objection, so ordered.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] And now for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Speaker, move that subject re-referral bills and
resolutions, the House do now adjourn to reconvene on Tuesday, May the
14th, at 9:30 a.m.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Moore moves, seconded by Representative
Foushee and subject to the receipt of committee reports, the House do
now adjourn to reconvene on Tuesday, May 14th at 9:30 a.m. The motion
also includes referral bills and resolutions. All those in favor say
aye, all opposed say no. The ayes have it, the House stands adjourned.
