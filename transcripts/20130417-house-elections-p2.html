Alright members we are - the House Committee on Elections will come back
to order. When we recessed we were going to take up Amendment H589ATC24.
I believe that's the number set forth by the lady from Wake
Representative Ross. Representative Ross you are recognized, ma'am, to
explain your amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much Mr.
Chairman. I'm going to call this the Tim Moore memorial amendment
because [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm not planning on dying anytime soon! I may
just sound like it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This is an amendment that allows
people to use their voter registration card or HAVA documents to present
that when they go to vote in person and does not require a voter ID
although if somebody prefers to use their drivers license they can but
this would allow the HAVA documents or their voter registration card and
I believe that this would be consistent with the both Federal law and
with most of the photo ID states that allow other documents that prove
your address when you go to vote and I move the adoption of the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Bill sponsors desire to comment on the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Yes I would ask
members to oppose the amendment. This, if the intention of this body is
to require a photo in order to verify the individual vote this is not
the way to go so I'd ask members to oppose it and I'd be glad to ask any
questions about the amendment but I would ask members to oppose it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion further debate on the amendment?
Seeing not submitting the favor of the adoption of the amendment set
forth by the lady from Wake please signify by saying aye. All those
opposed no. In the opinion of the chair the no's have it. The no's do
have it and the amendment fails. And I believe we had one other
amendment from Representative Ross. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Mr. Chairman,
I believe it's AST21 version 2. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Here we go. The lady's
recognized to explain her amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very
much Mr. Chairman. In the bill in order to get a free ID if you don't
have an ID it says that you have to already be registered to vote but
there might be people who don't have a photo ID who are not yet
registered to vote and we're making them go to the DMV anyway and it
just seems like they should be able to register to vote at the DMV like
people do for motor voter when they're getting their free ID and not
deny them an opportunity to have the customer service of the DMV and be
able to do that one-stop shopping. Of course the registration would have
to happen 25 days before the election in order for them to vote in the
next election but it seems to me kind of silly that they would have to
already be registered to vote in order to get the ID if they don't
already have a photo ID let them do both things in one place and I move
the adoption of the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You wish to comment on
bill or do you have a question of the amendment's sponsor? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Question of the Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Please state your
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Would you tell us again the number - we're
not sure we've got the right one. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Warren has my copy. It's 21. The one that Representative Warren has in
his hand is it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The issue that I see with this
legislation is if someone is in the DMV and registering to get a
driver's license or a non operator card and they have the ability to
pay, what we don't want to address is a situation where we're just
trying to give people a free card even if they have the ability to pay
and that's kind of an interesting situation. It seems to me that this
might be a way for every driver's license in the state of North Carolina
to become free and that seems to be not your intent but I think the
practical effect of that is that anyone that goes to the DMV to get any
card will</p>

<p id="05:00">
Free card and I think that’s, that’s a fiscal issue that I think, that
the way I read this amendment, I think it’s going to be problematic.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr., Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] State your purpose please
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To inquiry of staff
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please state your inquiry
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would just like to, I did not. I asked for this to
apply to getting, for getting the ID if you don’t have the driver’s
license or you’re going in to get your free ID because you can’t. You
don’t have one, and you can’t pay for one. I don’t think this opens it
up to having people get free driver’s licenses.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe the way it is drafted Representative Ross,
it’s an applicant who appears at DMV that is asked to register to vote
and they say “yes, I want to register to vote”. If they then do not have
any type of the photo identification necessary for voting they could
obtain the special identification card. If they signed that yes they
were registering to vote, and that they do not have any other photo
identification acceptable for voting. Then they could receive it for
free.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady have an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I guess the question to staff is could they then
try to get a free driver’s license doing it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah you can.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] None of this is about a driver’s license, it’s only
about the special identification card.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You may state, an inquiry to make?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well yeah, so given that staff has clarified that, I’m
hoping that that is acceptable and if there is any other inquiry about
it I can always have them look at it and I could offer this tomorrow in
finance. Since I’m going to have that golden opportunity yet again. To
deal with the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady want to simply withdraw the amendment at
this time and do it tomorrow?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Give it some time ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure, I’ll withdraw it at this time and let them look
at it and hopefully we’ll be able to get this taken care of in finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The amendment is withdrawn but I see Representative
Michaux is ready to come out of his chair over there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well not really, I’ve already seen too much already,
maybe. But I’ve got a question about, I just heard something here again.
Erica I think you’ve explained that you can go to DMV. Now I’m not
talking about getting a driver’s license, and, and, and, right, and you
can get a free photo ID without just go in and ask for it and then just
go and vote afterwards. Is that what I’m hearing?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s what ?? amendment would do
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff want to take that question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I, I don’t think so sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Think so, I didn’t think so. Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Right now there is a special identification card
that’s issued for someone who does not desire to have a driver’s
license. That card is available to anyone that can meet the requirements
to prove who you are with proof of identity and proof of age. And
currently it is available for no charge to anyone who is blind, 70 years
old, homeless, or has had their driver’s license canceled because of, as
a result of physical or mental disability or disease. This amendment
would be saying that if you likewise did not already have a special
identification card you would not be charged a fee to obtain one if you
were registering to vote at the DMV.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And, and had those?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And had what you needed to prove who you were.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And, were willing to sign a declaration under a Class
I penalty of, Class I felony penalty. That you were registering to vote
and you did not have any other photo identification acceptable to vote
under the provisions requiring photo identification for voting in
person.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Go ahead you can state your
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah I’m, I’m still confused Erica because you set up
some, some, some guidelines for getting an identification card if you
were blind. If you were, free, without a charge, but is, is, is there
still a charge for anybody who wants to go in there and get a photo ID
and register. Is there a charge for them in there at all? Just, just a
person who doesn’t fall under that paradigm that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr., Mr. Chair if I might, I believe the situation you
are describing is the situation Representative Ross is attempting to
address with this amendment. That that individual would not be charged a
fee if that amendment passed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I ask a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The way I understand it is, that if you go to get a
non-voter ID, a non-operator card which is this kind of card</p>

… has been formed that the sponsors are ok with this amendment. Is that
correct Representative Warren?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate to the amendment? Representative
Blust, you’re recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a question. Will this change the fiscal note, or the total cost
of this bill? Because I have a concern that what will happen is, if we
raise the cost of the bill then the cost of the bill will later be used
as an argument against the bill, so I’m reluctant to support something
that may increase the cost of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blust, I don’t believe it will have any impact at all
because of the perfecting changes that the Representative was generous
enough to comply with. This simply allows the BOE to allocate the funds
as they see fit, so it’s the same amount of money, it’s just where they
decide to spend it. That’s all. Again, we have no problem with this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The chair has reviewed this too Representative Blust. It does appear to
be permissive. Further discussion, further debate on the amendment?
Seeing none, all those in favor of the amendment please signify by
saying Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All those opposed please signify by saying no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In the opinion of the chair the aye’s appear to have it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Division.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Division has been called by the gentleman from Durham. Those in favor of
the amendment please raise your hand. Ok thank you. Those opposed please
raise your hands. A vote of 20 in the affirmative, 8 in the negative,
the amendment is adopted. We’re now going to take up, I only show two
amendments still pending, and those are both from Representative Floyd.
Is anybody aware of any other amendments that you sent forth and you’ve
been waiting to be called? Alright. Representative Floyd, why don’t we
go to your other amendment, which is AST 22, which starts amending the
bill on page 2, lines 47 to 48. The gentleman from Cumberland is
recognized to explain his amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, this is section 20 I believe of the bill. It allows a person
that goes to the poll to take a photo ID, sign an affidavit, cast his
vote or her vote without coming back and providing the necessary photo
ID. It will also help when it comes to doing the provisional ballots. It
will save the board of elections time in order to do that. Understanding
this section 20 that we are talking about doing some form of digital
voting, but if you will take into consideration what transpired
yesterday or the day before yesterday, those individuals used a cell
phone, and took pictures of that the federal government is using to help
end their investigation. Just a camera on a laptop can provide a
reasonable photo of an individual and can indicate that he is ready to
vote but he does not have the necessary proper identification. And he or
she will sign an affidavit to that fact. If not then they are guilty of
a felony. I don’t think a reasonable minded person will come and sit and
take a picture and sign an affidavit to indicate that he is not who he
says he is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Will the bill sponsors desire comment on the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Mr. Chair thank you. Members I’m going to ask you to vote against
this amendment. We have provisions in the bill that requires BOE to
study going digital and creating a statewide digital database and this
is going to necessitate having a systematic and orderly procedure to do
that. It is problematic to say the least to expect during an election
period, weather its early voting or its election day, to have poll
workers taking photographs of voters and then…</p>

Trying to coordinate all that information back to a central location be
it the county BOE or to a state board, but, so I ask you to please vote
this down. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on the
amendment. Seeing none, so many as favor the adoption of the amendment
put forth by Representative Floyd, please signify by saying aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Those opposed signify by saying
no. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER CHANGES] In the opinion of the chair,
the nos have it. The nos do have it and the amendment fails and I
believe, Representative Floyd, at first the amendment 17 was withdrawn
but the gentleman has submitted a new amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes
and staff has. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And copies are being made right now, so
what we'll do is once the copies are here we'll pick back up on that
note. So other than that last amendment, it looks like we're ready for
debate on the bill and what we'll do is take the amendment after it
comes back in for consideration. The chair assumes that at some point
there is going to be a motion for a favorable report with the amendments
so based upon that we'll now allow debate on the bill. Further
discussion, further debate from members of the committee on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I want to ask a question when we have the opportunity.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That would be the time right now, and if you do have
an inquiry to state, to whom the inquiry is directed whether it's the
bill sponsors or staff. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Bill sponsor. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] All right, the lady may state her inquiry. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, for the tribes, the Indian tribes, is that going to be both state
and federally recognized tribes? The way the bill's been amended,
they're both out, and part of that was because of the question between
the two and so we're doing some more research on it but at this point
they will stay out unless we come to some resolution on that. If you
have an opinion feel free to talk to me later because we're getting
rapidly educated on the nuances. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, ma'am. Please
state your inquiry or debate. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? in this right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, yes. To debate the bill, but more importantly I'd
like to be able to make a statement for the record. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very kindly, Mr.
Chair. I would like to address this committee from a very personal
perspective and I do respect the fact that this bill has been worked on
very diligently and that the persons who have presented it have done a
stellar job, but I simply want to say that probably some 50 years ago I
accompanied my mother and her father to a voting place that we were
basically not allowed or were not considered to be allowed to go to. My,
and as I recall as a young child my mother, we had discussions at home
on Saturday mornings about public affairs and I realized then that
politics had a great deal to do with many of the things that affected
our lives and the debates were so heated from time to time because my
mother was of one party affiliation and my grandfather who was her dad
was of another party affiliation. He was born in 1889 of course and had
never been able to vote, so what had happened, she had been tutoring him
on sections of the United States Constitution because he was not
literate. He did not have an opportunity to go to school but he did in
fact educate his children so my mother drilled ?? and she had
remembered, she had committed to memory the Constitution, but to make a
very long story short, we went any number of times back to that same
place in Forsyth County where we were not allowed to go and each time
dressed in the finest clothes and tried to register so that we could
vote because as I said, my granddad was an Abraham Lincoln republican
and he never changed that, but my mother was what they called a yellow
dog democrat and so that picture</p>

is so vivid in my mind because I don't remember exactly how many trips
we made. This was in the early 1950's, I believe.  Um--until he was able
to recite and--and--say everything that was in that preamble as well as
several of the articles of the United States Constitution.  My mother
was a very brilliant woman, so she probably knew it all.  But the
reality of that memory still resonates with me.  And, as I see the work
that's--and actually I--at age 18 I had to register to vote, and I think
I voted almost every time since then--even when I think one time I was
out of the country and I did so.  So, the--the time that we're spending
and what we're doing here for something that I consider to be so much a
very--a privilege and a right that really does seem to say to everybody
that--you know--we're going to really, wring your wrists and do
everything we can to really really make you want to do this thing called
voting--it just bogs my mind.  And it makes it very difficult for me to
understand even why we are doing this, even though I recognize that many
of you say that there is so much fraud.  We're saying to the American
people that we don't trust what's been happening--and of course to the
people of North Carolina--we don't trust what's happening and we're
going to fix this thing and make you stand in lines and do all these
things that are so unnecessary. And every time I think about that, I
think about the pride that my folks had simply when they were able to,
after about twenty trials, go to a place and finally be able to cast a
vote.  And even then, my granddad had to make an X when he did it
because, of course, he was not literate.  And, I simply--I simply have
the picture of those times in my mind.  And therefore, there is just
nothing, even in spite of all the work and all of the due diligence that
can happen that will make me support something that lends itself to
making it so difficult for an American citizen to go and cast a vote,
simply because they are that--a citizen of the state of North Carolina.
Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, before we continue debate on the bill--I know there are several
who want to speak--we have the amendment before us from Representative
Floyd which is our final amendment to consider.  It's H-589 ATC30, the
gentleman from Cumberland is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair. May I get the staff to give  some assistance in explaining
??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you would like.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You would --?? The Committee will be at ease just a moment. Have copies
of the amendment been distributed? You're asking if staff would like to
offer an explanation of the amendment? ?? if you'd like to do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As redrafted the amendment would add one new category on page 3, after
the four categories that are currently listed in the bill, and that
category would be for voter identification cards issued by the State
Board of Elections or by  county board of elections, notwithstanding
that they did not contain photographs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman desire further comment on his amendment or ready to--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ready--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.  The bill's sponsors desire comment on the amendment.

Yes, Mr. Chairman, thank you.  Members, I'm going to encourage you to
vote no on this amendment.  It clearly is working around the photo ID
and it's clearly not what I was expecting to get back, but I encourage
ya'll [sic] to vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right.  Further discussion; further debate on the amendment? Seeing
none, as many as favor the adoption from the--for the amendment offered
by the gentleman from Cumberland please signify by saying aye.  Those
opposed, no.  In  the opinion of the Chair the no's have it.  The no's
do have it, and the amendment fails.  We're now back in debate on the
bill.  I believe Representative Speciale--did the gentleman wish to
debate the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized.</p>

I think there is a necessity for this bill, and it's not designed to
keep American citizens from voting. But it is designed to make sure that
you are an American citizen, and that you are eligible to vote, and that
you are who you say you are. I've sat through these meetings. I've sat
through the hearings. I've sat through the hours and hours and hours of
this stuff, and I've listened to, to all the comments that indicate that
somehow we are trying to oppress people. We are trying to suppress their
votes. Somehow that this has something to do with race or minorities,
and I'm here to tell you that this has absolutely nothing to do with any
of that. And here to remind you that it was my party, it was my party
that gave, that initially in the 1800s passed the amendments giving the
right to vote, passed all the equal rights stuff, I'm, I am so tired of
hearing this, and I feel it's necessary to say this. The Republican
Party has been the party of freedom. And we have sat here in these
hearings and these meetings and listen to this over and over and over
again, this rhetoric. We are not trying to suppress anybody. We are not
trying to oppress anybody. It has nothing to do with race. It has to do
with who you say you are, and when I walk somewhere and I say my name is
Mike Speciale, I can prove I am who I am. It's very simple. It, we're
not, it's got nothing to do with the elderly. It's got nothing to do
with race. Let's be adult about this people, and let's discuss this in
an adult manner and stop trying to debase the issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate? Representative Harrison is
recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chair. I very much appreciate the sponsors of the bill.
Scaling back on some of the more burdensome aspects of the original
voter ID bill but [??] I feel like this is unnecessary, and it's a
solution in search of a problem. We know that the voter fraud cases in
North Carolina are quite limited. I think I've read, and it's been in
the Observer, there's been one case prosecuted out of 20 million votes.
And we have, while the Department of Motor Vehicles has scaled back the
anticipated number of affected voters from something like 600,000 to
300,000, I still submit to you that that's 300,000 too many. I think
we're imposing a cost on our taxpayers that is not necessary, creating
this new bureaucracy in the cost of implementing this program, which was
not insignificant. I also have been very concerned in listening to the
testimony of those who came up and spoke at the public hearings about
the impact on those who are low income, homeless, severely poor. I think
those will be the most negatively impacted, and I think it's unfortunate
that we are imposing these burdens on voters, and I'm going to be voting
against the bill, and I urge you to as well, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fisher is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. I will piggyback onto what my colleague
Representative Harrison had to say by saying that I do appreciate the
work of the sponsors. This is a big piece of legislation, one that is
very, I think, very complicated for the average voter to look at and try
to fathom. But I, I can't support it, and the reason I can't support it
is any number of reasons, but one that you just heard so, so very well
spoken by the other Representative telling the story of her mother and
her grandfather, Representative Terry, and it's a shame that we all did
not live in those times and could come back and speak to that experience
because it's obvious to me that people don't remember what happened. I
don't remember because I wasn't there, but I've read my history books
and I know what happened, and we're getting ready to do that again.
We're going backwards. We're getting ready to repeat that ugly time in
our history, and we should not want to go back there. I think if you
look at anything at all. Look at the long lines that this is going to
cause at voting places. We're going to have so many more restrictions to
what people have been able to do. It's going to cause lots of burden</p>

Lots of long lines. Lots of disenfranchisement, I'm afraid, and I cannot
vote for this bill, and Mister Chairman, I would like to call for the
eyes and nose please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is the call sustained? The call is not sustained. Representative Avila
is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. While I am very moved by Representative
Terry's picture that she painted, there are a number of pictures that
have been painted in the years since that time, and because of the
circumstances surrounding the picture that she painted for us, we have
moved forward. And we have moved forward by giant strides.
Unfortunately, continuing to hold onto those photographs as if it was
yesterday and nothing has changed is making it extremely difficult for
us to really move forward and make progress in a lot of areas. The
changes in our country, I used to go to my polling place and everybody
knew me. And probably, a lot of you in this room that's been the case.
Now however, with early voting and the polling place halfway across the
county, I could walk into a half a dozen of them and nobody would know
who I am. And I honestly can't guarantee you that I could walk into my
polling place today and that everybody at that table would know who I
am. We have people in this country who are not citizens, so to say that
we have no fraud when we're saying we want photos that we can look at,
and we don't look at those photos, my question has always been how do we
know? Unless we do a survey, and say okay, we're gonna do a survey here,
and everyone who comes to vote at this election we're gonna look at
their photograph and see how many of them are committing fraud. We don't
know. The kind of fraud we find is the kind where people try to vote
more than once. And there have been instances where people have walked
into the polling place and somebody knew they'd moved away, but that's
very rare. The privilege we have to vote is so precious. We have
identity fraud that is rampant in this country. Your finances can be
screwed up for years to come because somebody's got your name and your
social security number. So what makes you think because they've got your
name and your address that they can't rob you of one of the most
precious things you have in this country, and that's your right to
choose the people who govern you. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Floyd is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chair. As I look and sit through a number of election
meeting, and I look at my service to this great state, some of my
colleagues gave some, some gave all so we can sit here and enjoy this
freedom that we are debating today. When I sit and look at some of our
prestigious universities and those students won't be able to use their
ID to vote, when I look at Duke, and I look at Eon, Meridith, Shaw, ??,
Bennet, I look at all these ?? that will not participate in the process,
but yet still they provide a strong economic ?? to this state. And when
we present a bill and always see this great nation, when we begin to
debate, we will always say, how can we negotiate with our persons across
the pond or the sea or the ocean whichever. How can we debate, how can
we come to a workable mean? When I look at the 9.9 million North
Carolinians, and the 4.6 million North Carolinians that cast a ballot,
the 300,000 that may not have some form of photo idea. When I look at
what's trans, if we had said we want to improve the voting, the way we
vote in North Carolina, but when we say voter fraud, when I look at
institutions that allow individuals to ?? their access, they allow them
a margin left and right because they know that they are human and they
are not going to be 100% in their ability to count money all the time.
They allow a margin of differences. Sometime, if we, and which this will
do, they increase, and the polls</p>

Was still a little bit later.  Our lines will increase, and voter will
be frustrated because of the lines. Sometime, when voters vote, sometime
they vote out their frustration. They vote out their frustration, and
when we look at what we consist of here in North Carolina, 1.9 million
Republican, 2.5 million Democrats and 1.4 Independents, we have to look
at what are we doing to these individuals? Are we going to frustrate
these voters as they go to the poll because we sit here and then not
take all of this into consideration. The time for us to look at this and
to voter out some reasonable means is gone. And many person in North
Carolina, not so much about the photo ID and a picture, it's the way in
which this process was carried out. But yet still, we have an
opportunity to correct this. And I just hope and trust that some kind of
way that hardline politics is not the way that we are to do business.
And I just say that as I look at this bill, and I appreciate the
sponsors doing some corrections in the bill, but when I look at the
number of amendments, and I look at the, and look at the statement that
was given as it relates to the amendments, and I begin to wonder. Was it
necessary for us to sit through three and a half hours, or two and a
half hours of debate? But mister chair, I want to thank you for the way
in which you conducted the process, but it's a little frustrating when I
see sponsors of a bill that so imbedded, they don't want to accept any
change. We are here to represent our constituents and share information
about bills that we think that will soften the blows to our
constituents. But when we sit through this and amendments are not going
to be heard, or not going to be accepted, or not going to be received,
but thank God for the process, and I thank you so much. I looked at the
bill. I saw the changes and I was very pleased and I was looking and
looking and see how could I support this? And I was looking at a way
that I could, but after I saw what took place today, it has saddened me
to no end. And thank you mister chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ?? is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chair, and I'll try to be brief. I know it's, it's
getting late. But I've talked more today then I've talked the entire
session, I believe. Been very involved with this for years at the polls,
so there's a couple of things I'd like to get on the record as we're all
getting on the record today. We've been sitting here in ?? like this
since at least 2011 that I'm aware of, working on this bill, and it's
been, it's been worked over and over and colleagues have been through
all the court cases and all the other documentation they can dredge up,
tons of it, and put together a bill, frankly is not as strong a bill I
think as we had last session which would already be law were it not for
one individual. And I'd just like to say a couple things about, about
our existing situation. It has nothing to do with 1950. I do have a
story that when I went to register to vote, I became aware of what was
going on in the 50s and 60s a little bit as a young person. I went to
register to vote in the early 60s, I couldn't vote when I was 21 years
old. So I missed three years and at least one presidential election not
being able to vote when I was 21. And I walked in and wanted to register
Republican, and once they got over the shock, they let me know very
quickly that if I didn't vote for five years my name would be removed
from the roll. I think that's a good provision. I even thought about
putting a bill in like that this year but I knew this bill was coming,
that would make some improvements to our 1,200 pages of general statue
163. Most of our folks don't seem to know a lot of what's in it, even
the ones that have to carry it out. Various folks out there working
hard, but it's very hard to understand. And I, we've listened for three
years now, to facts, or statements without facts, about long lines and
all the dire things that are gonna happen when we pass a bill like this.
To me, compared to last session, this bill is watered down. But it does
address some issues that needed to be addressed, particularly absentee
ballots, and I'm gonna support the bill again and hope it passes</p>

<p id="50:00">
By a large margin and I know that it will pass about the same breakdown
as we had last session. It became very partisan and that's just the way
it is and folks that wanted to offer amendments were allowed to offer
amendments and if you look, technically and amendment, I didn't think,
could be an exact opposite of a bill and be ruled in order, but our
chairman just let those be ruled in order, so everyone's bent over
backwards to try to do a bill that will be fair to everybody without
totally wiping out the concept that you are who you say you are when you
go vote. So that's my statement for the record. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Stone is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm taking a second opportunity and I
know that folks think they have bent over backwards to debate this bill,
but let me simply state that this exercise today has been great. I've
enjoyed it immensely simply because I'm one of those who believes in the
Constitution, not only of North Carolina, but the Constitution of the
United States, and the Constitution of the United States guarantees me
equal protection under the law, and what we have done today has run
rampant over that particular section, Article 14, Amendment 14, the last
sentence in there about equal protection is where it's found, that the
laws have to be applied equally, and what you've done today. Let me tell
you what you've done. You've set up three classes of voters. You've set
up voters with ID, you've set up voters who don't have ID but may be
able to get ID, and then you have a class of voters that can get ID
under certain circumstances. There is no equality in the administration
of this law that you're putting out here now. I mean, it's just obvious.
If I go down there and they say that I don't have the voter ID that's
necessary, I can vote a provisional ballot and then when I vote that
provisional ballot and then two days or three days later I can come back
and show that photo ID then I'm allowed to vote, but if I go down there
and I fill out that provisional ballot and I don't come back then my
vote doesn't count even though there may be some attestation in there
which you've put in there. I mean there are at least 4 or 5 different
ways that equal protection under the law has been violated in my book
and it's going to be expensive to this state to try to prove that. But
let me look at something else. Representative Speciale, I agree. I agree
with you. The republicans in the 1800's did a good job, but somewhere
along the line you fell down. When you thought that we had gone too far
you just walked off and left us on the ground to pick ourselves up by
our own bootstraps. That's what you did. And what happened was we got
into a problem with the democratic party who put the Jim Crow laws back
in, but then you never helped us straighten out those Jim Crow laws that
we were put back. No, sir, you didn't. It took democrats who got a
change of heart to come back and do it, so, hey, both parties are to
blame for whatever happens, but I just want and like I tried to tell you
this morning, there are folks who stood out there, what problems have we
had? What problems have we had with voting in this country? A country
that is based on liberty and freedom. None. We haven't had any problems
in North Carolina, but yet what you're doing is you put road blocks in
the way of people who want to exercise that right, that right that is
guaranteed by both the North Carolina Constitution and the United States
Constitution. Not the privilege, it is not a privilege, it is a right to
vote, and under our US Constitution you cannot abridge that right to
vote. So here again, yes, as I said before, I was a part of that group
that fought hard, long, got spat on, got cussed at, got done everything
that could be done, got shot at, everything to get the right to vote for
a group of people who did not have the privilege to do it, and so, yes,
I'm going to always fight anything that in my estimation or in anybody
else's estimation says that we are going to put a stop to your coming to
the polls in the numbers that you're coming to the polls in. We're going
to put a stop to allowing you to vote without showing who you are or
what you are.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jones is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman and I'll be brief. I'd like to agree with
something that Representative Iler brought before us and that is that we
have had some healthy and vigorous debate here and we've had it over the
period now of 3 years. This general assembly passed the voter ID bill in
the last session that was vetoed by the governor and, at that time, we
didn't have the votes to override that veto. During the current session,
we have been here for many, many hours debating this issue. The rhetoric
has been fascinating, once again. But in the midst of the rhetoric there
has been facts and I appreciate the opportunity that we had to hear from
Secretary of State's Office of Georgia and Indiana that I think the
facts that they had to present really spoke to much of the rhetoric and
the concerns that we have heard. We continue to hear that there's
hundreds of thousands of votes in North Carolina that are going to need
an ID at the cost of millions of dollars to the state and I have a
difficult time seeing how that lines up with the actual facts of what
happened in Georgia. Wherever, the past 7 years, they've only issued
between 29 and 30 thousand IDs and I believe the Secretary of State told
us that the entire cost of the state, including novelty education, was
somewhere approximately $1.6 million. You know, sometimes the facts tend
to get lost in the rhetoric, some people say if they say the same thing
over and over enough times that, I guess, people will begin to believe
it. You know, the statewide polls seem to be pretty obvious that the
people of North Carolina are favoring this by at least 3 to 1 and in an
environment where 55% in today's political environment is often called a
landslide, the bottom line is, Mr. Chairman, I came here to represent
the people that elected me and sent me here. I think that's why they
call us representatives, we're here to represent the people and I
understand there are people here that feel like they're representing
their constituencies in opposing this bill but I can assure you that the
people that I represent are for this bill and I believe statewide, as I
said, that people are probably for it at least 3 to 1. I know the
opponents will say: &quot;well the majority's not always right&quot;,
and that's true. But I do put a lot of faith in our citizens and I
believe that these other states that have passed voter ID legislation
had it right. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to live in a society and a
nation and a state that respects the dignity and the importance of
voting and I believe that's what this legislation intends to do and so,
Mr. Chairman, at the appropriate time, I will be pleased to make a
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have two speakers left. I believe Representative Floyd (??) has
debated a second time. Representative Ford has not. Representative Ford,
do you recognize to debate the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My question is similar to what Representative Jones mentioned.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was going to let Representative Ford debate. Did you gentleman have an
inquiry to state?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I had an inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We'll take the inquiry. To whom is the inquiry directed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At the appropriate time, Mr. Chairman, could a question be called?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The chair is going to simply allow... we've got two members who wish to
speak, Representative Ford and Blust, and of course if others want to,
I'm going to let everybody have their say before we take a vote, whether
that's 10 minutes or 5 hours. I hope it's 10 minutes as opposed to the 5
hours for the record. Did the gentleman have a question to submit to
staff on the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I was calling in to raise an inquiry of the chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. So, I'm ready to go too but I want to give everybody a
chance. Representative Ford is recognized to debate the bill.

I don't understand that.  And if there's no voter fraud then why would
anyone have a problem with a photo ID?  And the key word from earlier
was prosecuted.  I know of many voter frauds in my own home county, but
prosecuted?  Yeah, the number is very small.  That's part of the
problem.  A couple of years back I have a business and have a P.O. box
in Kannapolis.  I had it for 25 years.  The U.S. Postal Service shut
down the satellite post office, told us we all had to go to the main
post office. I spent four weeks proving who I was in a town I grew up in
and that I had a legitimate business, of a business that had been there
since before I was born.  It was amazing to me what I had to go through,
a photo ID and everything, to get a P.O. Box in a town I grew up in. In
this building I have to use this photo ID to get in and out of the
parking deck. I have to use a photo ID to check into the hotel I come to
every week. I served on the County DSS Board in ?? County for over 7
years.  I saw a lot of people that needed help and I was glad that they
got that help, those that are in need. But they had to use a photo ID to
get that help. I definitely support this.  I agree with Representative
Iler, I think it has been watered down a little bit from before but I
still support this and I hope it passes.  Thank you sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative ?? is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Did I understand you to say
that I have to keep my remarks under 5 hours?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If you can.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well thank you Mr. Speaker and Members.  I've sat here
and I've listened to speakers that came here and the many public
hearings and the long hours and I've heard the Committee members debate
and we heard this two years ago.  We've been trying to do this for many
years.  I heard one of the speakers say we were just doing this because
of the last Presidential election and I can remember trying to move this
in the Senate back in the 90's so it isn't something that's just come to
fruition lately but I am disappointed some in the rhetoric and sometimes
I'll sit here and it'll kind of make me angry.  Sometimes I'll sit here
and it'll kind of make me sad and some of the commentators I felt the
same way because I'm starting to think that facts no longer matter at
all.  I mean I still hear it said that this is a problem or a solution
in search of a problem.  I heard several people at this microphone talk
about things they had seen in elections and talk about their frustration
as citizens that when they brought it to the attention of election
officials things were shrugged off. And I have since these public
hearings reevaluated, I thought it was more a potential problem than it
is with all the false registrations that are on the books. It's proven
that someone could vote those names knowing not so much I don't believe
so much they're going to vote for me. I think some people  know of a lot
of names that are on the voter rolls that there isn't such a person
there that they can vote and I think that that is happening now that
I've talked to a lot of the people who came and spoke here and I wonder
about the vehemence, the rhetoric, oh you're throwing up roadblocks and
hurdles and most of the stories of opponents of this bill the bill
doesn't affect their situation. The bill just does not keep students at
private universities from voting.  It says your private university ID
isn't the photo ID you can use. But it doesn't keep them from voting and
I'm disappointed when people in this committee try to make such kind of
arguments. Because some people out there are going to hear that and
they're going to believe the worst and I worry about how much is trying
to be stoked up and resentment that's there beneath the surface anyways
being stoked up by this.  This bill does not make it difficult to vote.
I was telling somebody, I wonder how foolish I would look if I tried to
argue that Chairman Moore tried to suppress or throw up roadblocks in my
participation in this Committee because I had to walk clear over to this
building from the other building. I mean there's some things you've got

this is just a common sense step that’s easy, very easy, no matter what
you say in the terms of rhetoric, it is very under this bill to exercise
your right to vote. Not one person is being deprived of their right to
vote. Not one. In fact, one of our speakers said that in court battles
in other states, because they’re always taken to court, that in
deposition during discovery, not one person has ever been identified as
having had their vote suppressed because of photo ID to vote. Not one
person, when asked that, to prove that there is not one shred of
evidence, and to keep on using this rhetoric when not only do we have
thought processes, we have on the ground real world situations in which
the predictions of dire results from this kind of law have not taken
place. That’s what disappoints me. Even when you can prove in the real
world by empirical evidence that your predictions don’t come true, you
stick with me. That scare me a little bit for debate on all kinds of
issues going forward. Georgia heard these same type arguments, with the
same type law and it did not happen. Participation by minorities went
up, so it does not suppress votes and I’m not going to wear your tags
and I’m not going to cower in my seat and sink a little bit lower as the
rhetoric gets thrown around in here and the accusations get thrown. I am
proud to support this bill. It is a very common sense approach to what
can be, and I believe is, a huge problem. It will restore some
confidence in our elections. The public supports it. The public shows,
because of their experience, that showing a photo ID for all kinds of
things is not some gigantic hurdle. There is no real reason, I don’t
believe, no valid reason, that’s justifiable under reality to not
support this common sense solution to a real problem that’s out there
that we had witnesses come and tell us about. So I hope you will support
it and I hope that the tone and the rhetoric will diminish a little bit
as this moves forward and we go to the floor. And if not, I’m sure not
going to back down because someone calls me a name or ascribes to me
false motives. I hope others won’t either and I hope you’ll support this
bill.

Representative McNeill is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don’t think we can measure any person’s room,
and person in this room’s patriotism by whether they’re for this bill or
against it. I think every person in this room is a very patriotic person
and I think they deserve respect for being here and trying to look after
the people that they represent. We’re a legislative body. That’s what we
do every day. We pass laws. We debate bills. I don’t agree with every
law that we’ve had to deal with so far. Some, I thinks good legislation,
some I don’t and I’m sure each and every person in this room feels the
same way. It’s what we do. We debate those laws. Whether we agree that
there’s voter fraud occurred in the past, whether it will happen in the
next election is important, but what this bill does is doesn’t deal with
the past. It deals with what happens going forward, and that’s what we
should deal with. What happens going forward. This bill is a simple
attempt to prevent fraud. We pass laws everyday to prevent something.
Whether we agreed that fraud ever existed or not, it doesn’t matter as
far as I’m concerned. This is a good bill, it simply deals with trying
to prevent fraud, because if any one person goes to the ballot box and
cast a fraudulent vote, it disenfranchises me. It cancels my vote and
that’s not fair. This is a good bill...</p>

I support it.  Representative Graham has recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker changes] Thank you very much Mr. Chair.  I was thinking, have
been thinking, as we work through this process, and thought about the
fact that I've just come as a Freshman to this body and coming from
County Government we count the numbers.  Basically throughout the state
of North Carolina you find most of your boards somewhere between 5, 7
and 9 numbers, and basically when we're going to take some action to
make something happen, you just count.  And you know if you're 4-3 or
5-2 or what-have-you, that's the way it's going to be, and action is
taken. The gentleman who spoke before me, Mr. McNeill, Representative
McNeill stated that we are a legislative body, and we are. And as a
body, we can make decisions.  Individually we can't.  And we know what
the count is, you know what the numbers are and I think it was
Representative Starnes, who said a couple of weeks ago how the election
has taken place and where the power was and where the leadership is in
this particular organization.  So we know how the vote is going to come
down.  Why don't we go on, take the vote, and let's start the healing
process.[Speaker changes] Representative Mobley is recognized to debate
the bill. [Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker.  I just have a
question of the Bill's sponsor, if I may? [Speaker Changes] You may
state your inquiry, and one of the bill's sponsors, Representatives
Warren, Murry, any of the three, Representative Mobley has a question
for Pam, you may state your inquiry.[Speaker Changes] Thank you sir.
I've listened to us debate the student ID registration and voting and
picture ID.  One thing that I don't know was answered, that I have an
interest in is finding out if the voter ID could possibly be a voter
registration card.  That's a state issue ID.  However, they may not have
the picture state issue ID.  Collectively, if they had the school
identification, this is a private institutions, in addition to a voter
registration card that they received from the board of election, would
they be acceptable, the two together? [Speaker Changes] No,
Representative, they would not be under the provisions of the bill.
This would be a photo ID, in and of itself, not a combination to try to
make one. [Speaker Changes] Thank you. [Speaker Changes] Further
discussion, further debate, Representative Floyd, did you wish to debate
a second time on the bills? [Speaker Changes] I would like to speak a
second time. [Speaker Changes] The gentleman is recognized. [Speaker
Changes] Mr. Chair, during my young years, I spent a number of years in
Civil Rights, and one thing that we always look at when we do an
investigation is determine what is and what is not.  And the question we
ask is what, if it's sexual harassment, we use the question &quot;What a
reasonable minded person would assume is?&quot; and that is what this
bill right here is, What a reasonable minded person would assume.  Does
it have an adverse effect on a particular group or particular
organization.  Some would say that it is and some would say that it is
not, so in closing, I leave you with the word what a reasonable minded
person would assume. [Speaker Changes] Further discussion, further
debate, Representative Cunningham is recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you.  A couple items that I would like to
address. Representatives Samuelson and Warren, according to the
testimony that was given by the Board of Elections, we have lots of
issues that are already going on with the Board of Election, roles that
are not accurate, just additional things that promptly need to be
cleaned up.  One question that I brought up is I would like to have a
vote of verification of my vote.  Since we are moving forward with voter
ID and technology is advancing day by day because if you get a computer,
in six months it is old.  So with the technology advancing forward, have
we determined that the investment is going to be made to clean up the
Board of Election prior to us instituting voter ID and are we
considering a vote of verification.  He told us that the vote was
private and confidential...</p>
