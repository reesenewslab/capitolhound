The House will come to order. Members will take their seats. Visitors
will retire from the chamber. The Sergeant-at-Arms will close the doors.
Members and visitors will please silence all electronic devices. The
prayer will be offered by Representative Avila. Members and visitors in
the gallery will please stand and remain standing for the Pledge of
Allegiance. Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let us pray. Dear heavenly father, creator and sustainer of life, we
come before you today humbled by your love and mercy for us. Each day
you grant us countless blessings that we take for granted. Help us to,
at least one time in our busy day, stop to honor and thank you. Today,
we come before your presence asking for guidance as we complete this
session. Our patience is growing thin and our tempers are growing short.
In the midst of all the frustration, we ask that you refresh us, give us
a calm spirit and a willing heart, with discernment and wisdom in making
decisions that affect the lives of so many people in North Carolina. As
the great physician, we ask for your healing hand to be placed on
members of our assembly who are facing serious health conditions. Grant
them your comfort and strength during these trying times. We step
forward with boldness to ask that miracles be worked in their bodies.
Today, as every day, we raise up our military men and women who
willingly protect the freedoms that surround us all. Place a hedge of
protection around each one as they serve around the world and at home.
Be with their families who also sacrifice so much. Relieve their
anxieties and give them comfort when they’re separated from their loved
ones. This I pray, in the name of my lord and savior, Jesus Christ.
Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to

Could I open the floor for a question, Mr. Speaker?

For some of our members who are not here today, did you have any idea

calling, and many of them are not here, so we wanted to be able to give
them some clear direction, if you don’t mind, Mr. Speaker.

rest of the week looks like, but we will have session at four o’clock
