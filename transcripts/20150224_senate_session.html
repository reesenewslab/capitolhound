will go to their seats. Members and guests in the gallery please silence
all electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer is Senator Seth
Ingram, all members and guests in the gallery will please stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
With all hearts and minds on one accord, shall we pray. Creator of the
universe, God of us all. We humbly bow in your presence. We thank you
master for travelling grace and mercy as we arrive to our perspective
destination today. God as we advocate, as we legislate, as we
deliberate. We ask that you will open our hearts to love. That you will
open our minds with understanding. That you will guide our feet on the
path of justice and that you will open up our hands for service. As we
fellowship with one another God, we ask that you keep us ever mindful
that there are workers without jobs, there are the hungry without food,
there are the homeless without shelter, and there is a world without
peace. Then God endow us with the dudimose power that we might make the
right decisions, and build capacity so that these things might not be
so. These and all other blessings we ask in your name, no higher name on
earth. Let all the believers say amen.
