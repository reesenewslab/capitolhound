  in the budget office, so the state is fortunate to have them as a
resource, in all matters relating to the state&#39;s budget.
What I&#39;m going to do is give a quick overview of the priorities in
the budget and then talk about each one in just a little bit more
detail.  So, the most important thing we think about in this budget is
that it&#39;s a disciplined budget, it&#39;s a conservative budget, it
does not raise taxes.  North Carolina&#39;s got a AAA bond rating from
all three ratings agencies.  There&#39;s only ten states in the country
for whom that is true, and we have stronger credit metrics.  We have
better debt service ratios than the average of those ten states.  So
it&#39;s not an exaggeration to say that we&#39;re in the top five
states, the top 10% in terms of the overall health of our balance sheet,
and we&#39;d like to keep it that way.  This budget grows more slowly
than inflation and population and obviously it&#39;s a balanced budget,
consistent not only with the Constitutions, but with sound and
conservative budgeting principles.
As you all know, most of the general fund is already obligated by
statute, we spend more than $3 billion a year on the retirement system
and the health plan for state employees.  Of the new spending in this
budget, about 76% goes in three areas, it goes to Medicaid, the
increases in Medicaid, it goes to funding enrollment in the K-12 system
and the UNC system, and it goes to the pay raise for K-12 teachers,
getting them all to a minimum of $35,000 a year.  76% of all new
availability.  Medicaid, we spend about $3.8 billion, 18% in Year 1,
greater than 18% of our total budget in Year 2.
We&#39;ll try to reduce spending where we can, if you&#39;re not going
to increase taxes then you&#39;ll have to balance the budget managing
spending is your only took, we sought efficiencies where possible.  As
you know, our revenue estimates are a consensus, revenue estimate
generated by our office in conjunction with the Fiscal Research
Division.  There&#39;s a lot of talk obvi8ously about the revenue
picture and our projection, the consensus projection is still just a
projection.  We&#39;ll know significantly more as we move into March and
April and get the results from the individual tax return filing season.
If we have more revenue than is currently projected, obviously we can
revisit some of our priorities.
One thing that I know everybody here knows, but I think is useful to
just repeat is that this is not our money, and this is something that
everybody in the administration, starting with the Governor, takes very
seriously and that we think about everyday in the Budget Office.  So,
we&#39;ll collect almost $44 billion in taxes from hardworking North
Carolina taxpayers over the next two years, and we have an obligation to
use that tax money as efficiently and as accountably and as effectively
as possible, and to spend it where it matters most.  And if we can&#39;t
spend it efficiently and effectively we should give it back.
There&#39;s been some criticism of the budget for making tough choices,
in the Governor&#39;s words, and in my mind, the day that the government
officials have enough tax revenue to do everything they might ever want
to do is the day that taxes are too high.  Hard working North Carolina
taxpayers have to made tough choices about their budgets everyday, every
small business has to do that, and we believe the government should have
to do that as well.
In terms of spending money where it matters most, 56% of our budget goes
to education, 70% of that is the K-12 system, 25% of our budget going to
the Department of Health and Human Services, two-thirds of that is
Medicaid.  Another 11% going to Justice and Public Safety, that&#39;s
DPS and the court system, and every law enforcement and corrections
function.  And so when you take those three priorities, that&#39;s about
92% of our budget.  You take debt service out of that and everything
else we do in government accounts for about 4% of our total budget,
obviously excluding the Highway Fund and Highway Trust Fund spending.
Fulfilling the pledge made in the last session to get all teachers to a
minimum of $35,000, that spends about half a billion dollars in new
funding, combined with the enrollment increases and some other increases
in K-12 education in the budget.  Combined with the $305 million that
was spent in the last session on teacher&#39;s salaries, over a billion
dollars spent on K-12 teacher&#39;s salaries

  Is between the last budget and this proposed budget.  We&#39;re also
proposing increases in correction officers&#39; salaries, that costs $60
million, a little bit less when it&#39;s fully phased in.  We&#39;re
proposing phasing that in in three years, beginning in Year 2.  The
corrections officers have not had an adjustment in their pay schedule
since the mid 1980s, there&#39;s no reflection in the salary schedule of
the danger of the prison in which they work, and so we believe an
adjustment to the salary schedule for corrections officers is overdue.
The step increase for the Highway Patrol, a reminder that we fund
longevity for 40,000 state employees, and we&#39;re proposing an $82
million Salary Exception Fund, which we&#39;re calling the Salary
Exception Fund, in contrast to a Salary Adjustment Fund, because we
believe that the best way to spend limited dollars for salaries is to
target them, rather than propose across the board raises, to target
based on how difficult a position is to fill, how effective an employee
is, the kind of leadership that a particular employee represents, and
some of those positions include engineering, accounting and information
technology, among others.
Not in this budget, but something the Governor has talked quite a bit
about and that you will see proposed from the administration shortly is
bond financing, both for transportation infrastructure, and for general
government infrastructure.  These are targeted long-term investments,
they&#39;re vital to the continued competitiveness of a rapidly growing
state.  We&#39;ll be paying for assents over 20 years that will last for
50 years.  It&#39;s obviously a historically favorable time to issue
debt from an interest rate perspective, and the size of bonds that
we&#39;re proposing has been sized with the Debt Affordability Study in
mind, and will not do any thing, in any way, whatsoever come close to
jeopardizing our credit ratings.
The budget also fulfills our commitment to help the disadvantaged, to
help those who can&#39;t help themselves  18% of our population is
supported by Medicaid, there are investments in this budget proposed for
mental health, and for pre-K, and for other social services like
Adoption and Foster Care.
Just to go into a little more detail on each of those items.  This is
the growth picture, the budget does grow more  slowly than population
and inflation.  Population plus inflation is the blue bar, the proposed
appropriations are the mustard colored bar there, and we are continuing
to enhance our reserve, strengthen our reserves.  We allocating an
additional $47 million to the Rainy Day Fund in this budget.  The total
reserves in excess of $650 million.
I mentioned the revenue picture, the consensus forecast is for a
shortfall between what was projected and what we now expect, of 1.3%,
that&#39;s about $270 million.  That&#39;s actually less than the
average annual forecast error going back to 1987, the average
error&#39;s been, annual error&#39;s been about 2.5%.  This would
represent a forecast error of 1.3%, and obviously is still just a
forecast as I say.
One key point from this page that I think often gets lost in the debate
about revenues is that revenues are still growing very strongly, so the
difference between what was budgeted and what we now expect is in the
context of strong revenue growth.  The anticipated growth in this
budget, Base Growth in the first year of 3.9%, in the second year of
4.1%.  And then just a little more detail on revenues, a number of these
tax credits are scheduled to expire at some point during the biennium,
mostly in the second year which is why you see larger costs on this
table in Year 2.  The credits are in effect in Year 1, but those are not
new costs where you reflect existing law in the budget unless we&#39;re
proposing a renewal of particular credits.  We are proposing a renewed
and modified Historic Preservation Tax Credit that costs about $18
million over the biennium.
The Renewable Energy Credit is scheduled to expire next year.
That&#39;s a very expensive credit the way it&#39;s currently designed,
and our proposal is to renew it just for non-solar project.  Solar
projects account for about 90% of the cost of that credit, and
that&#39;s projected in the out-years to start costing as much as, the
range is

  Five to five million dollars a year. so a very expensive credit if you
knew it for solar much less expensive if you see if you knew it  for non
solar. we believe it&#39;s the non solar areas that I could still use
support in the incubation period , the solar industry is much more
matured. R &amp; D credit, a key competitive credit that most of
competitor states have a similar credit. you see that there renewing the
credit for purchasing data sonar machinery and equipment purchases.
There has been a lot of talk about the aviation fuel credit and then a
small credit for parts and fuel in the motor sports industry, obviously
a critical industry in North Carolina , one of which we have
significantly competitive advantage. so these renewals Mr Juror are all
reflected in our proposed budget.
I mentioned the significant commitment to K3- 12  funding  which that
gives you a sense of growth and appropriations and recommended
appropriations looking at the biennium. There has been a  significant
improvement in chartered school enrolment. we just thought this was an
interesting data and that&#39;s projected to continue over the next two
years. It&#39;s not quite as easy to project as it is to project a
traditional school enrolment. but the forecast from, there has been very
strong growth already as you see the forecast  the green bars is from
the department of public instructions is for continued strong growth
that&#39;s reflected in our enrolment numbers for k3-12. Other
highlights from the K3-12 BUDGET, I mentioned the teacher pay increased
$35000 minimum. and then moving the funding movement along the salary
schedule for all teachers that cost about $ 223 million over the
biennium. all these numbers are biennial numbers. Funding fully funding
the projected enrolment growth from the DPI 1400 new teachers , $307
million funding teaching assistance. $128 million over the biennium
almost 2000 teaching assistants. and then our proposal to award highly
effective teachers continuing the work that was begun in the last budget
with creating the endowment to recognize and reward highly effective
teachers proposing $15 million over the bi to continue that phase in.
$17 million for class room material that includes instructional
supplies, text books, IT equipments and IT resources including the home
based program that includes significant local discretion on that
relative mix of spending. And then continuing to fund Pre K which serves
less than 27000 4 year olds across the state
On higher education. A couple of things here. There are some targeted
increases for U &amp; C system and the community college system. There
is also a reduction proposed in two areas of the U &amp; C system and I
will talk more about that later. $16 million over the bi , $8 million
each year proposed for the medical school in Greenville ADCU. Fully
funding  projected enrolment growth about a $130 million in state
division for the veterans over $11 million and allowing the community
colleges to count the summer enrolment inner enrolment the formula which
is a significant increase in funding for the community colleges. As you
know they are funded on a different basis than the universities and
K3-12. they are funded on actual enrolment rather than projected
enrolment. And funding community college technology both their
operations technology as well their technology and equipment to teach
science technology, engineering and Math which obviously  are critical
in need. The upper right there, limiting the subsidy on private fund
raising. We are proposing that no school in the U &amp; C system would
be allowed to spend  more than a $1 million of tax payers money in
funding their private fund raising efforts per campus. That saves about
$18 million a year. It affects 12 campuses. There is also a proposed net
real reduction of about 1.1% in the U &amp; C budget , 1 % of the
general fund appropriation , less than 0.1% of their total funding, come
back to this in a minute. North Carolina spends a greater percentage of
its tax revenues on higher education than any other state. And we
believe as most people do , the University of North Carolina has been
critical to our success and prosperity literally since colonial times.
it&#39;s going to be vital for our continued competitiveness going
forward. And that&#39;s reflected in.

  <p id="20:00">
  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Commitment that North Carolina&#39;s taxpayers have
made to the system, and that they will continue to make to the system
under this budget. We believe that the 1% in general fund appropriations
can be identified through efficiencies through shared services in IT,
and back off as functions without in any way impacting academic quality
or the classroom experience. This chart shows general fund expenditures
per student against the ten most populous states, and we also threw in
South Carolina and Virginia. This is a blended number that includes the
community colleges. The community colleges are funded at about $2000 per
student. UNC&#39;s funded at about $14,000 per student, and you see the
per student average there significantly higher than the national
average, and higher than any of, any of the other peers. Just moving
back to what we&#39;ll propose on the Governor&#39;s Innovation to Jobs
suite of proposals. The idea here is that we have a tremendous resource
as I said in our, our universities. Our research universities are among
the best in the country. They are highly productive in terms of their,
their research. Where we have not done as good a job as maybe some other
places is in turning that research into high-paying jobs. And so the,
the Innovation to Jobs Initiative is designed to, to try to address that
through a series of, a series of approaches, some of which are outlined
here, of intermultiplier fund. Our proposal is not to use general fund
dollars for this, but rather to use the escheats fund. This would be
invested alongside private sector dollars. This is not the government
picking winners and losers. This is acting as a multiplier for private
sector investments into early stage, high growth companies. $5 million
for the NC RISE program, which is a network for entrepreneurs and
investors, and 7.5 million on selecting and helping to develop
technologies developed in the universities and that are promising
targets for commercialization. In terms of the transportation funding,
obviously most of this not in the, in the general fund, $4.8 billion.
Some of the highlights, $135 million in critical infrastructure, $51
million in road maintenance, $36 million in capital improvements, $10
million to ease congestion, particularly in rural and small urban areas.
Our NC GEAR initiative, which most of you are aware of. This was
something that was passed by the General Assembly shortly after the, the
governor took office, is a, an effort to identify areas where government
can be made more efficient, more accountable, save money. And
importantly, this program runs out of the budget office, and we call it
a program deliberately. It&#39;s not, it&#39;s not a one time project.
If this is a report that sits on a shelf, then we haven&#39;t done our
jobs properly. Our hope, and our aim is to institutionalize the effort
of continuing to identify ways in which government can run more
efficiently, and with better customer service. In the initial report,
we&#39;ve identified about 60 recommendations. They save $14 million in
year one of the biennium, a little bit less than $60 million in year
two. They save over $600 million over ten years on a present value
basis, not on a, on nominal basis. And as I say, we intend to keep the
effort moving. Some of the proposals, and as I say there are 60 of them,
but some of the highlights include the proposal to combine the, the
natural resources function of the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources with Cultural Resources. The vital records function, which
requires significant upgrading and modernization, doing a better job
collecting debts owed to the state, rationalizing state-owned vehicles,
getting much more proactive and, and assertive in managing workers&#39;
comp claims, which were a significant cost to the state, and encouraging
local school districts to leverage their, their buying power to, to save
money. Happy when I&#39;m done with this, to take any more questions
about NC GEAR obviously, or anything else. We&#39;ve tried to, in this
budget, bolster our reputation, of which we&#39;re proud, as the
nation&#39;s most military

  <p id="25:00">
  Very friendly state, a key part of that is the creation of a new
Department of Military and Veteran&#39;s Affairs, which is designed to
consolidate our existing efforts which are scattered across a whole
series of agencies to provide better coordination, better customer
service to active duty military and to veterans to do a better
coordinated job in an effort to protect our bases and protect our
military mission.  This builds on the executive order that the Governor
issued at the beginning of his term, funding for in-state tuition for
veterans, $11.3 million.  I would note that every comparison state that
we looked at has a Department of Military Affairs, Veteran&#39;s Affairs
and most states do not, that we looked at, provide an additional
appropriation for in-state tuition for veterans.  We are proposing that
here, $11.3 million, so that&#39;s a boost to the UNC System that most
states are not providing that we&#39;ve seen.  Encouraging the
development of additional veterans treatment courts which have been
successful so far, and a small amount of money to support a pilot
program to train veterans to help fight internet crimes against
children, a promising pilot program that takes veterans, specifically
Special Forces veterans and gives them important job training.
In the DPS budget, I mentioned Correction Officers salaries phase in
over three years, beginning in Year 2.  $21 million in Year 2.  The step
increase for the Highway Patrol, $3.7 million, %5 step increase, that
affects about 700 of the 1,700 State Troopers.  Getting ALE and the SBI
and the Highway Patrol back on a vehicle replacement schedules,
there&#39;s been a significant backlog in vehicle replacement for each
of them, which is becoming a safety issue and increases our maintenance
costs.  And $2 million to improve operations and reduce the backlog in
the Crime Lab.
Also on the Court System, $16 million in two years for the Court System
to address some of the costs that they&#39;ve identified.  Small amount
of additional funding for Business Courts and $9 million for indigent
defense, the Public Defenders, which clears their backlogging, gets them
back on a more stable footing.  As you know, their backlog has been
building for some time.
Significant focus on mental health in this budget, mental health
obviously is both a public safety and public health issue.  On the
public safety side, $24 million in new facilities for prisons,
behavioral health treatment units at eight prison facilities, and
opening another 72 beds that already exist but have not been staffed at
the facility at Central Prison.  And on the public health side, $82
million, about half going to community mental health services, and the
other half going to state mental health services, including one-time
funding to open the new hospital in Broughton, at Broughton Hospital in
Morgantown.
Other funding in the DHHS bucket, more than $10.8 billion in DHHS
funding.  There&#39;s been a lot of attention to the Medical Examiner
for improving their services and replacing their equipment with a
proposal of $5.3 million in increased funding.  I mentioned Adoption and
Foster Care, a proposal on an increase of $15 million there.  The NC
Fast and NC Track Systems, which are information technology platforms
for patients and for providers which help manage care and deliver
services more effectively, they&#39;re continuing the roll out of those
two platforms.
And then on Medicaid.  The Medicaid re-bases, these are the boxes in the
bottom here, the proposed Medicaid re-base is $287 million in Year 1,
$461 million in Year 2, and then in the lower right, there you see
we&#39;re also proposing a Risk Reserve of $175 million for Medicaid
over two years to reflect the risk of overruns in the Medicaid budget
and tried to ensure that we&#39;re protected against that.  In the
middle, Medicaid reforms, Supporting the Healthy and C-Plan, and the ACO
delivery model, there&#39;s a small amount of funding to continue to
design that reform plan.  It just shows the breakdown of DHHS state
funding, it said 86% of it goes to Medicaid and to mental health.
I&#39;m now going to, very quickly, just, I&#39;m not going through each
one of these slides in detail, I&#39;m just going to, very quickly

  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Blame for each section. What we did in the part of the
presentation that I just went through was try to organize things in a
more thematic way, in the way that we think the general public and most
people think about our spending priorities. But obviously not the way
that, that the government is organized internally either in the General
Assembly or in fiscal research or in the budget office. We&#39;re
obviously organized in the traditional categories and so, in that
context we provided these slides as a way of showing what the, the
appropriation picture is in, in each of the categories. I&#39;m not
going to go through the bullet points in the bottom, you have them in
the handouts. I&#39;m happy to answer questions about any of them, but I
think most of the highlights on each of these slides I&#39;ve, I&#39;ve
covered already. What you see for public education is a 2.9% increase in
year one, 3% increase in, in year two not counting the incremental
enrollment increase, which would take you to 4.3%. In the UNC system I
mentioned the 1% cut in the general fund appropriation, less than 0.1%
of UNC&#39;s overall spending. That&#39;s a 0.5% general fund net
reduction in year two. For the community colleges, 1.3% net reduction in
year one, 0.8% in year two, but it&#39;s important to look at that in a
context of what I said earlier about the enrollment formula and allowing
the community colleges to count summer enrollment, which is worth about
$16 million per year to them in year two and continues to make a
meaningful difference to the community colleges going forward, and
we&#39;ve obviously been in close dialogue with the community colleges
about that. One other thing about the community colleges is we do have a
proposal to increase tuition by about, by $4 per credit hour, it goes
from $72 to $76 per credit hour. That&#39;s still one of the lowest in
the southeast, and one of the lowest in the nation. I think we&#39;re
44th or 45th in the nation in community college tuition after this
increase. DHHS a significant increase represented largely by the
Medicaid rebates that I discussed, 5.56% in year one, almost 10% in year
two. Importantly-I think people know this-but the year two increase is
not year over year, it&#39;s over the current fiscal year. So each
number-the 5.5 and the 10%-are independent. They don&#39;t build on each
other. For NER, you see a significant net reduction here but that&#39;s
largely driven by the movement of the natural resources functions from
the Department of Environment and Natural Resources over to the
Department of Cultural Resources, and you&#39;ll see a corresponding
increase in general government. So, that&#39;s not a net real reduction
in the services provided. It&#39;s just shifting them from, from NER
over to, to general government. Public safety a slight increase in year
one, about 0.9%, and then a larger increase, 3.9% in year two, and
that&#39;s the effect of the correction officer salary increase kicking
in in year two, that $20 million. This is what I mentioned the, the
increase-significant increase in general government represented largely
by the movement into cultural resources of the natural resources
function inside of DENR. The establishment of the Department of
Information Technology, which we&#39;ve talked a lot about, saves money
through consolidation. We are proposing $2.7 million each year for the
Military Affairs Commission recommendations. There is some other detail
in here on the Innovation to Jobs Initiative. There&#39;s funding in
here for the Housing Finance Agency. Most of that year one funding is
proposed to come from the recent settlement that was reached with
Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s over the mis-classification of certain
mortgage-backed securities. That&#39;s about $19 million in availability
that&#39;s not a, that&#39;s not prospective money, that
settlement&#39;s already been reached and agreed and Housing Finance
Agency funding is, is scalable. They can spend less or more in a given
year depending on how much, how much funding they have. Transportation a
slight increase in year one, slightly greater increase in year two,
2.9%, and then capital improvements just quickly, 5% each year for

sure they could continue to demonstrate harm with this funding, but
I&#39;m not sure I feel comfortable commenting on what they will decide
to do with their legal action.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, follow up.  What I&#39;m looking for, you can
respectfully understand you say in the way of a legal action, but can
you or staff speak to monies owed to the troopers for not fulfilling the
contractual obligations that the state has to the troopers?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think we&#39;re gonna have to follow up with you on
that, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, Representative Hurley?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair.  My question is on page 10,
slide 20.  It looks like $42.5 million is going for an innovation, for
the jobs innovation and you said it was coming from this SG Fund?  Is
that a loan, and will it still leave $200 million in there?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So, it&#39;s not a loan, but the idea is that, so only
the $30 million is proposed to come from the SG Fund.  The $5 million
and the $7.5 million, those are proposed appropriations.  So it&#39;s
just the $30 million for investment, and the reason we think that&#39;s
appropriate is, it is intended to be an investment, and if it&#39;s done
properly that money is returned with a gain.  And obviously there&#39;s
no guarantee of that, but the idea is that this money will be invested
along side private investors who have significant skin in the game and
who themselves are incentivized according to the returns they generate
for their investors.  So, we&#39;re not replacing our judgement for that
of the market, we&#39;re simply trying to amplify the impact of early
stage investment in the state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;m gonna follow up.  Does that still leave $200
million?  I know the Treasurer was very concerned about leaving at least
$200 million in that fund because it&#39;s not our money.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think it ends up leaving at least $200 million in
the fund, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blackwell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman, if there&#39;s time, I&#39;ve
got two questions, one relates to what you were just discussing about
investing in education.  I think you made the comment that this
wasn&#39;t the case of the government picking winners and losers.  If
the government is not going to decide who gets these funds, who will?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So, our, this is on the Venture Multiplier Fund that
we have up here, and the Innovation to Jobs Program was the work of a
private and public sector task force that was a group of investors, a
group of representatives from the universities and a number of people
from the administration coming together to try to identify reasons why
we haven&#39;t had the same kind of culture of private equity venture
capital investment in the state, the same success commercializing
innovation technology that comes out of the universities.  So, if you
look at a place like Silicon Valley or the tech corridor around Boston,
we have what they have in terms of excellent, world-class research
universities.  What we don&#39;t have is the same amount of capital, or
the same tradition of investors identifying promising technologies in
the universities and figuring out ways to commercialize them.  So
that&#39;s the context in which the Innovation to Jobs initiative was
launched.  The idea behind the Venture Multiplier Fund is that we would
set up with a group of private equity firms, North Carolina based
private equity firms who were already established and already had a
strong track record, an investment approval process in which they would
be making investment decisions for their capital, capital that they
raised from their investors and from which they have to achieve
significant returns.  And that we would invest along side that through
some kind of formula, where we would, and that&#39;s still to be
determined, but where we would match, say, for every two dollars they
put in, we would put in an additional dollar.  So, that&#39;s what I
mean by not substituting our judgement for that of the private sector,
we would require that these investments pass that private sector test
from the third party investors who are incentivized to achieve strong
returns.

  Broad bucket, so I think it really depends on the particular department
and what they&#39;ve been seeing on their efforts to attract and retain
and motivate personnel.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And thank you, Mr. Chairman, and the other question
has to do with the Standard and Poor&#39;s settlement.  While I&#39;m
almost giddy at the prospect of General Government having an infusion of
money into our little tiny pot of money in our budget, I have a feeling
it&#39;s going to get chipped away at over time from other places.  But,
what I&#39;d like to know is, you talked about a phasing in of that
money or a, that it wouldn&#39;t come to us all at once, if I understood
you correctly, that we would only get small amounts of it, or is it
coming to us all at once, or?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It&#39;s coming to us all at once.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh, I think I heard something about some sort of
measured infusion there.  I don&#39;t know, maybe I just misheard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, even if it did, I think that would not frustrate
the intent of what we&#39;ve proposed, since we&#39;re allocating much
of it in our proposal to the Housing Finance Agency which couldn&#39;t
put it all at once, anyway.  But, that&#39;s not my understanding of how
it comes in, it&#39;s a lump sum settlement of $21 million of which $2
million is a fine, so that creates another $19 million in availability.
We though the Housing Finance Agency was an appropriate proposal for
much of that funding given that the settlement was related to the
misselling of mortgage backed securities during the financial crisis.
The Housing Finance Agency, we believe, is a highly effective agency,
leverages federal funds, creates jobs, puts people in homes.  And what I
did say is it&#39;s scalable in the sense that you&#39;re not, what we
don&#39;t want to do is create a recurring obligation with non-recurring
funds, so these are non-recurring funds.  The Housing Finance Agency
obviously would like to be funded at a particular level every year but
it&#39;s not like most programs where if you don&#39;t fund it at the
same level every year the program fundamentally changes.  HFA just
builds more or fewer houses depending on how much money they have, so
that&#39;s what I was getting at.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have a question that a little bit follows onto
Representative Fisher&#39;s question, and this is about the transfer of
agencies to the Department of Cultural Resources.  I&#39;m assuming in
that batch transfer is the Grassroots Sciences Museum, would that be
correct, and then I have a follow up?  Are they in that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don&#39;t think so, no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay.  I was just concerned though about that,
that&#39;s good.  The second question I though is, I worry that when we
make this transfer, that there&#39;s some kind of commitment to
adequately funding the General Government area, because as
Representative Fisher says, at least in the almost ten years that
I&#39;ve been here, that part of the budget continues to get the short
end of the stick, and I have historical sites, significant historical
sites in my district that are all languishing.  In fact, most of the
one&#39;s I&#39;m familiar with are languishing and I worry that then
they get in the Gen-Gov area, resources lessen and they all leveled into
a languishing category, and is there any response to that, or has that
concern been raised or though about?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, it&#39;s a good question.  Our proposal is
driven by the fact that we care about the sites, both the natural
resources sites and the cultural resources sites, not that we don&#39;t
care about them.  We&#39;re trying to put them in the best environment
to succe3ed.  And one thing we found was that within DNER, you&#39;ve
got two very different missions, two people doing fairly, two sets of
people doing fairly different things.  What the Natural Resources people
and DNER are doing is very similar to what the Cultural Resources people
are doing in terms of their management of their third party friends
groups, for example.  Cultural Resources is actually, in some ways,
better than DNER is, or at least has had more success in some some
areas.  So, if you look at the friends groups for the parks, for
example, they have not done very much to build up their friends group
for the parks.  Their 100th anniversary is coming up and we think
there&#39;s an opportunity for them to really develop their private
sector fund raising efforts which Cultural Resources is very good at.
Cultural Resources obviously understands how to protect very valuable,
irreplaceable state assets

  Which includes not only the assets they manage now and the ones
they&#39;ll be taking over from Natural Resources.  We&#39;re bringing
the expertise, the particular expertise over from Natural Resources, and
we do think that they, as they start to review how they charge for some
of these resources is, they do some comparison work with what similar
attractions charge in neighboring states, that there will be an
opportunity for them to generate more revenue on their own, as well as
to develop, as I say, their private fundraising efforts.  But this in
not primarily designed to save a bunch of money, it&#39;s designed to
make the management of these sites more efficient.
From my office window, I can look at the History Museum and the Natural
Sciences Museum.  They&#39;re right next door to each other, I see
school kids going in and out everyday, but they&#39;re managed by two
different government departments, and to us that didn&#39;t make sense.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I wanted a few questions,
because I haven&#39;t seen part of this, about the retirement system and
what was the additional site contribution this year to the retirement
system.  And if you could follow up on that, how does that move us
towards being a fully funded system, and what&#39;s the impact expected
on future liabilities?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That&#39;s a good question, Senator, there&#39;s
actually not a, there&#39;s not an appropriation for the retirement
system in this budget, so what the retirement system, I&#39;m trying to
find the relevant page in the budget itself to refer to for you.  But,
what the retirement system does, this is page 5 of the budget for those
of you who have it, what the retirement system does is comes up with a
regular actuarial calculation of how much funding is required, similar
to what you see for the heath plan.  And the actuarial calculation for
the retirement system, and now that I&#39;ve brought you to the page, I
realize it&#39;s not in this summary version.  You do see it for the
health plan there, and the reason, down at the bottom Salaries and
Benefits, and the reason you don&#39;t see it for the retirement plan is
there&#39;s not a new appropriation  for it in the proposal.
Their actuarial calculations are done by third party actuaries, as
they&#39;re required to do, health plan does the same thing, and their
calculation was that there was $45 million in excess funding for the
retirement plan for the next year or so.  The short answer is, I&#39;m
sorry to be confusing about this, but the short answer is there&#39;s no
net new funding required, based on their actuarial calculations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So, that would indicate that we&#39;ve reached a fully
funded retirement system, the obligations and inputs, if we return the
seven and a half expected by the Treasury Department?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For this year, but it&#39;s a moving target.  They
have to do their actuarial calculations every year, and those change
based on demographic considerations, based on the design of the plan.
The health plan actuarial calculations, they change twice in the process
of putting the budget together, so it&#39;s a moving target.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Over here.  First, I want to thank you for a really
excellent presentation.  You&#39;ve arrived relatively recently and
you&#39;re well steed to the details and I appreciate that.  Two
questions, you talked about this $82 million that is going to be
established for salaries for exceptional employees.  Of course, we know
over in a number of vacancies in state government they&#39;ve had these
contracts, which have been non-competitive contracts where we&#39;ve
been paying people the equivalent of $475 an hour, and in some cases up
to the equivalent of $800,000 a year for specialized services
they&#39;ve been providing.  How do you see this particular fund working
and functioning, because it&#39;s across all of the state governmental
agencies, whereas you have unique positions within many of these
agencies where we really need to get people in there with the correct
skill sets, so that we don&#39;t enter into these contracts with outside
firms paying excessive rates for basically skill sets that we could hire
year-round employees to perform.  So, how do you see this functioning
and operating, and how, would an agency be able to actually access those
funds to fill those unique positions within their respective agencies?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It&#39;s a very good question, because I do think they
are related.  A big part of what was seen it the, in our view, excessive
use of these personal services

  <p id="60:00">
  contracts. And when we talk to agencies about it, they say that part of
the reason is that the difficulty in attracting and retaining some of
this specialized talent. Our view on the personal services contracts,
for what it&#39;s worth, is that they should be rare, but they--it&#39;s
difficult to eliminate them entirely because there are some specialized
services where it doesn&#39;t make sense to have somebody on staff, full
time. A full-time FTE in state government is a very expensive long-run
proposition. And when it comes to interpreters, for example, or
real-estate appraisers, there&#39;s often specialized knowledge required
that is best accessed through a personal services contract. But we share
the objective of reducing significantly the abuse of those contracts,
and making the use of them very rare. And I think giving targeted money
to the agencies to spend on some of these high-demand positions is one
way to do that. In terms of the method by which they would access the
funding, the Office of State Human Resources has gone through an effort
to revamp our performance-management system. They&#39;re redoing all job
classifications, consolidating the grading and the banding, and that
process is identifying a lot of these difficult-to-fill positions,
difficult-to-retain positions. They have much better data, not only
about turnover by job classification and about comparable private-sector
salaries, but also about individual job performance. And so we think
that gives us the tools to allocate this money where it can be used most
effectively.
SPEAKER CHANGES
One quick follow-up, Mr. Chair, if I could.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Follow up.
SPEAKER CHANGES
One thing which I notice was missing from the budget, and we discussed
it briefly on a prior occasion, but that&#39;s money specifically
targeted toward the, what&#39;s been identified as the failing schools
in this state. I mean, we&#39;ve got 30% that have been rated at a D or
an F level, where they serve student populations that really deserve
quality education. Many of them are low-wealth students, but they&#39;re
also students that deserve the quality of education that our state
constitution compels us to provide. And it seems to me that there should
be funds specifically targeted toward not just incentive pay for
teachers to go into those schools, but programmatic changes that can
really help them perform effectively in serving those student
populations. If you could help address that, if you could.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Sure. I&#39;ll tell you a couple of things. First of all, we believe
that there&#39;s a significant commitment made to K through 12 education
generally in this budget. I mentioned the 2.9% increase in year one, and
obviously half a billion dollars being spent in new availability on the
K through 12 schools. So we think that reflects a meaningful commitment
to improve the schools and help the schools succeed. I think another
theme that we&#39;ve had in trying to pull together this budget is
trying to get away from one-size-fits-all policies, whether that&#39;s
one size fits every LEA, or one size fits every teacher. And so the
salary, the endowment for highly effective teachers, $15
million--we&#39;ve asked the LEAs for ideas, for proposals on how that
money could be spent most effectively. So each LEA, depending on the
issues that it faces, can make proposals for how it should be spent. And
our view is that people sitting in offices in Raleigh are not going to
have the best idea of how to spend that money in the LEAs. And so that
addresses some of the individual needs on a per-LEA basis that I think
you&#39;re referring to. The other part of that is the $70 million in
instructional supplies. So those have previously been allocated by
fairly rigid formulas that are prescriptive with respect to what kind of
supplies that are being funded for LEA. And what we&#39;ve tried to do
is consolidate that, so different LEAs can make different decisions
about what mix of supplies and technology and instructional materials
are appropriate for their particular school district. And so I think
that theme of greater individual choice for the LEAs, hopefully combined
with increased funding, hopefully helps address the issue that you
mentioned.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you for those comments. I would just hope that as this budget

  Of resources targeted for those failing schools. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Pendleton. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir, welcome
on board. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I have two
questions, Mr. Chairman, I’d like to ask. One of them, has this
administration given any thought in this budget to allowing correctional
officers to be put under the law enforcement officers retirement. These
people are locked inside of prisons all day long with the dregs of our
society and the mental abuse they suffer is unreal. I just wonder has
that been addressed? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I have not heard any discussion
about that. It’s obviously something we’re happy to discuss. I do think
that everybody recognizes the challenge that the corrections officers
work under, which is why we’re proposing a new salary schedule that when
phased in, fully phased in will represent close to $60 million a year
for funding for correctional officer salaries. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow
up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And was any
thought given to trying to correct the low salaries that professors and
instructors have in our community colleges. We’re right down at the
bottom of the 50 states and was any thought given to that? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] That was something that was discussed and something that we
talked about with the community colleges and I think the new enrollment
formula is going to, allowing them to count the summer enrollment is
something that they’ve wanted for a long time. It’s as I mentioned $16
million for them in year two and I think as that kicks in that just
creates more funding for the community college system generally and
obviously one of those needs is for professor pay in some cases. So we
do not have a specific proposal on that in this budget, but we think
we’re putting the community colleges on a better long-term financial
footing to address whatever needs they have including professor
salaries. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Michaux. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Roberts I have a couple of questions. One,
you’ve talked about targeted pay increases for our state employees.
Who’s gonna make that determination about who’s gonna get those raises
and what are you gonna do about the other employees who have dedicated
their work lives to the state and have done a good job. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] So in terms of who determines, I think we have better tools to
determine that maybe than we used to through the new performance
management system and through better data from the Office of State Human
Resources about competitive salaries for high demand positions. In terms
of the other employees, we’re in an era of limited availability and so
we have to spend the money where it makes the most difference and our
view is that its highest and best use is to be spent in a targeted way
rather than across the board without any reference to performance,
without any reference to how hard a job is to staff and retain somebody
in. I would also say that it’s not as though there’s not significant
money going to state employees in this budget, so if you look at the big
picture what the state budget is is Medicaid and personnel costs
generally, and we spend, as I mentioned, $3 billion on the health plan
and on the retirement plan. We’re funding 40,000 employees’ longevity
pay which is something that most people in the private sector haven’t
heard of and so there’s a significant commitment to state employees
generally in this budget overall. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, but the longevity has always been there for state
employees anyway so there’s nothing, basically nothing new. Let me ask
you about the teachers’ payroll if you will. Have you eliminated the cap
that teachers can make as a result of the last move made on teachers’
salaries. We’ve got a cap of about $50-60 thousand right now. Have you
removed that cap and how have you done it? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No, the
same salary schedule remains in place. We’re funding movement on the
salary schedule which hasn’t always been done and we’re holding harmless
the teachers at the top end of the range so that nobody’s making less
than they were the previous year under this salary schedule. We haven’t
changed the salary schedule. It still remains in place so there’s a top
end in that schedule. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator

  Is done, and that calculation is done according to projections on the
number of inter-rollees, the mix of benefits, demographic calculations
about projecting who&#39;s going to retire, when.  And we just take the
calculations from the actuaries and put them in our budget, we don&#39;t
do an independent evaluation of whether we think their calculations are
correct.  In my view, it would be inappropriate to do so, they&#39;re
the experts in calculating their costs, and we take their costs and
reflect them in what we propose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?  Yes, so are you selling us that the driver
is really for the retirees, it&#39;s not the present employees?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, there&#39;s a whole series of drivers of costs
in the health, I mean, maybe I misunderstood your question.  The number
comes from the actuaries, what drives the number is a whole series of
factors, it includes the cost of health care which has obviously been
growing and is somewhat unpredictable, it includes the number of
enrollees in total, it includes the mix of employees between those who
are active employees and those who are retired, it includes the
utilization of services, it includes the mix of services that are
available, it includes things that the health plan is trying to do to
try and incentivize behavior through things like smoking cessation
programs and wellness programs and things like that.  So, the actuaries
are charged with factoring all that in to try to come up with a nominal
cost.  They then have to discount back to a present value to try to make
sure that the3 plan is fully funded.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Whitmire?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair, and a great brief, just a
question, I may have missed it, but we have a very small but highly
respected division within our government, the Division of Emergency
Management.  In my other line of work within the Northcom Homeland
Defense Command circles and the FEMA circles, it&#39;s considered the
best in the nation.  They are experiencing a considerable amount of
turnover, upwards of 50% most recently, because their salaries, often
times, they&#39;re picked off by local governments when you have someone
who&#39;s a subject matter expert, and certainly the private sector.
One, did I miss anything that you have visibility on that, and two, I
just want to bring it up as something we want to look at.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I&#39;m glad you brought it up because I think
it&#39;s a good example of the phenomenon that we were just talking
about, where it&#39;s very hard to attract and retain people with
specialized skills, and we&#39;ve heard the same anecdotes that as soon
as public safety officers are trained it&#39;s very hard to retain them.
 We&#39;ve address that specifically through the Highway Patrol through
the step increase, but there&#39;s obviously other safety experts in
Emergency Management and throughout the Department of Public Safety and
in other areas, and to me that points up the need for this pot of
funding that can be used in a targeted way to make sure we don&#39;t
lose people who we have trained and add valuable skills.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Lee, I&#39;ve got a question.  In the two year budget,
it looks like another $750 million on the re-base for Medicaid.
That&#39;s after about, close to $2 billion in the past four, five years
in growth of Medicaid.  Is there any kind of reform that you&#39;ve
proposed to control some of those costs?  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s
any question about this being the driver of the budget and going from a
little less than $2 billion to now, almost $5 billion in costs about
over five or six years, that&#39;s not sustainable.  Just, your
thoughts?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, thank you.  It&#39;s obviously the
biggest driver of the budget and the least predictable one.  I&#39;d say
two things, one is the projections from the Department of Health and
Human Services, that&#39;s something that because it&#39;s so important
and has been so variable in the past.  I&#39;m sorry, because it&#39;s
been so variable and has been so expensive in the past, they&#39;ve
devoted a huge amount of resource to try to make that forecast more
accurate.  They have a new forecast model, as you know,  I think that
model is robust as best as we can tell, but it&#39;s also new, and any
new model, particularly with something as complicated and with as many
variables as Medicaid is still, the jury&#39;s still out with respect to
that model.  But, we believe that DHHS has done they best they can to
forecast costs accurately.  There&#39;s obviously not a great history of
them being able to do so, which is why despite everyone&#39;s belief in
the Administration that the forecasts are getting more accurate,
we&#39;ve propose this $175 million Risk Reserve which is obviously
quite significant.  It&#39;s over 1% of claims in Year 1, it&#39;s over
3% of claims in Year 2, but I think

  <p id="80:00">
  To your broader question, the fact that it continues to consume an every
growing percentage of our budget, it does point out the need for reform,
which is why the Governor has advanced his proposal for the Accountable
Care Organization delivery model, and why we&#39;re funded, I think,
$2.2 million over the biennium to try to design that plan and put it in
place.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Okay, Representative Dollar?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Just to follow up on Senator Brown&#39;s question.
It&#39;s my understanding that 90% of the amount of the re-base is due
to more lives being covered, more lives being served for a whole variety
of reasons, including some federal actions and other things that we have
no control over.  Isn&#39;t the fact that their anticipating over
100,000 more individuals this upcoming year being covered by Medicaid,
an additional over 100,000 more in the second year of the biennium?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]So I agree with everything you said.  Enrollment is by
far the biggest driver of Medicaid costs and there&#39;s a whole series
of reasons for that, you have population growth, you have an increase in
the eligibility criteria, so federal law has changed poverty level to
138% of the poverty level.  In effect, that creates additional eligible
enrollees.  All of the talk of Medicaid reform creates greater awareness
of the Medicaid program itself, which has driven enrollment across the
country, and so that is the biggest driver, obviously.  Health care
costs and utilization of those healthcare services are the other big
drivers in the Medicaid program.   I had not heard the 100,000 people
number, but whatever they are projecting is reflected in our rebates.
We don&#39;t have a separate projection in the Budget Office, separate
from  what&#39;s been generated by the department.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Faircloth?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Albetra, here.  Director
Roberts, welcome, and thanks for your presentation.  You mentioned
several times, the private sector compared with the public sector, and I
know we have, particularly I&#39;m speaking to the court system.  We
have some problems with a very antiquated computer system, we still have
many people looking at green screens, and it&#39;s hard for me to
imagine a public sector, successful multimillion dollar company out
there who&#39;s still doing that.  Can you give me some feeling how you
contrast those two, and how do we catch up and stay current in that
system?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Well, we agree, there&#39;s obviously been significant
deferred IT investment in the courts.  What they requested was $10
million, $16 million in recurring and we&#39;ve proposed $10 million
recurring, beginning in Year 2, $6 million in Year 1.  That gets them
part of the way towards addressing the costs that they have.
Fundamentally, overhauling their IT system, which is probably what&#39;s
required is a fairly expensive proposition and very difficult to do in
the context of a single year appropriation which is partly why it
hasn&#39;t been done up until now.  And to us, that set of facts,
something that needs to be done but is very difficult to swallow in a
single year, general fund appropriation, is a perfect candidate for
proceeds of the bond issue that we&#39;re proposing, where the
infrastructure is desperately needed, difficult to fund in a single
year, that lasts for a long time.  So, in addition to the new funding,
the $16 million that we&#39;ve proposed for the courts, we believe that
part of their needs can be addressed through the proceeds of the bond
issue, and we&#39;ve discussed that with ASO.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Okay, last question is Representative Turner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chair.  Mr. Roberts, thank you for being
here today, we appreciate it and your stamina.  I wanted to revisit the
idea of capping the university development expenditures at $1 million.
For many of these universities, that&#39;s a significant reduction,
correct?  And having served as a member of the Foundation Board of
UNC-Asheville as well as an Assistant Vice-Chancellor in their
Development Office, I know the importance of the hard work that these
offices

  ...do and it seems that with this cap we are tying their hands right at
a time when they are facing growing budget pressures. So, my question to
you is: was an analysis done in collaboration with those campuses that
will be affected? And how this limitation would impact their ability to
generate private dollars in support of their missions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It&#39;s a good question and the first part of the answer is that
everything that we proposed in this budget we discussed with UNC general
administration. One of my predecessors, as you know, is the chief
operating officer for the UNC general administration and, therefore, we
have a very good dialog there and we try, generally, to discuss with all
of the affected agencies as we&#39;re developing our budget proposals
items that affect them. We have not gone and discussed with each
individual campus. Probably not practical to do that, although I have
had informal conversations with representatives of various campuses
across the state about this and other items in our budget proposal. With
respect to the specific impact. So, there&#39;s no question that if
you&#39;re spending as, for example, NC State is -- about seven million
dollars in state money on your private fundraising efforts -- that
you&#39;ll see a significant reduction, about 5.8 million dollars,
although NC State raised about a hundred and thirty million dollars. And
so our view is that, of that significant funding, the larger the impact
on the university, the larger the amount of money that they&#39;re
raising and that they can fund that fundraising effort from the funds
that they raise just like every other private sector institution does,
just like every other private college does, just like every church does,
just like every other social service organization does, most of whom
would probably be delighted to have a million dollars in government
money to go raise money from their alumni and other supporters.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up? Okay. Chairs? Any questions? Lee, thanks so much for being
here. Great job. With that, we&#39;re adjourned.
