the people of the season May Allah comes from us and we see is today
all, the fact that from the especially what happened was on through
several problems and staffing and execution the property revaluation
Mecklenburg County in 2011 is severely out of compliance with state law
and women's central fairness for the people and this legislation was
designed to overcome constitutional problems that could result if you
attempted to treat one class of taxpayers specially marked special by
creating an opportunity for counties to redo their property tax
revaluations there are several conditions that have to be met for this
authorization become the enemy was basically allow them to hire outside
staff to go back and reset to where they would then have a dumb things

has the potential to apply to 75 counties in North Carolina, but it only
applies to one, that's Mecklinburg. We have a fiscal analysis memorandum
which shows all zeroes on the impact on the state. And what would happen
is with properly staffed revaluation done in accordance with the
machinery act, would correct property revaluations. Those that have been
over assessed would receive refunds for the excess paid with interest at
5% per annum. Those that had been undervalued and will have additional
tax liability would be billed for that, it would go back to 2011 but
since they did not do that, they will not be charged interest but
essentially would get a interest free loan. It would also allow them to
reset the values. But just some of the problems that Mecklinburg county
discovered, they had 8 professional staff to revalue the largest county
in the state, it turned out Pender county also had a professional staff,
but Pender county was doing a 4 year evaluation, Mecklinburg was doing
an 8 year. Their base table of value had turned out to be flawed in that
they had not actually viewed any of the properties in the county for 17
years. So, normally you would do a windshield check with the property
card on every property, and this hadn't been done, so the obvious
ridiculous revaluations were not caught. There were problems with the
way appeals were noticed, with the way appeals were handled and
processed, and quite candidly if everybody that was trying to appeal to
Raleigh had to come to Raleigh to get their valuations straightened, we
would fill up the property review commission for the next 5 years with
appeals from Mecklinburg county only. This is I think our third dip in
committee, and at this point it goes to the floor. There's no known
opposition, at least known to us. We'd be willing to accept any
question.

Rep. Starnes, you asked to speak? Excuse me, Rep. Stone. Pardon me Rep.
Starnes.

Good morning. I'm always glad to help. It happens early in the morning.
I'd at the proper time like to make a motion favorable please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Rep. Jones?
Rep. Stone, it's the proper time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning Mr. Chair. I'd like to make a motion favorable for House
bill 200.

At this time, we will have House bill 484, permitting of wind energy
facilities.  We have a PCS, Rep. Holley moves to have the PCS before us
for discussion. All in favor say &quot;aye&quot;?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed? Motion carried.
Rep. Bell, please present your bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you members of the committee. I've looked around the room and many
of you had seen this bill at least once or twice, House bill 484, on
permitting wind energy facilities would establish a permitting process
for the citing and operation of wind energy facilities in the state of
North Carolina. This problem became clear in 2012 when out of state
developers sought FAA approval to build a large scale wind energy
facility called the Pantego project in Beaufort County. Which included
5500 foot wind turbines located directly in Seymour Johnson Air Force
Base's low level primary training route, essentially the dairy county
bombing range. I have a quick map I'll show you, if you look the yellow
is a low level flying route, the blue would be proposed wind farm
encroachment, and as of right now the state does not have an effective
permitting process which would protect our military bases, our low level
flying routes from these facilities. House bill 484 provides a
preliminary scoping and permitting process for deener, deener's Division
of Energy, Mineral, and Land Resources would work with North Carolina
Military bases to determine where the wind energy development would
conflict with military training routes and operations, and then permit
the development of wind energy facilities that would not adversely
impact our military training operations. Just so you know, the military
is roughly about a $26 billion economic impact here in the state of
North Carolina, and we have defense related contracts in 80 of our 100
counties. So it's a major issue representing the second largest economic
impact in our state only next to agriculture. On the legislation before
you, in the PCS as a result from all parties, it develops a permitting
process to protect our military and environmental concerns as comfort to

Energy investors and assures that the state has the final say so in the
decision process. Also in front of you, you will see two hand outs. On
one, is from the Governor's Military Affairs Director, John Nicholson,
on behalf of the North Carolina Commander's Council in support of this
bill. The other, you will see a number of elected officials, county
commissioners, city councils, chamber of commerce, and businesses that
are in favor of establishing a permitting process to protect the
interests especially in Eastern North Carolina. This bill has passed the
environmental committee and public utility with favorable reports. We
are in finance today because of the one time permitting fee of 3,500
dollars, which at this time, no parties involved have expressed any
concern to me and we ask a favorable report. Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Chairman: Thank you. Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Hager: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think this is the
third time I've heard the bill and I think we know it very well, so I
move for a favorable in the PCS and an unfavorable to the original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Chairman: Third's a charm. Any further questions from
the committee? Representative Tine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Tine: I want to thank the bill sponsor for all the work
in making some changes to make sure this is a predictable process for
the companies that are looking to put projects into Eastern North
Carolina. And both of the projects that you've talked about are in my
district, so I just want to make sure that the Department of Defense has
a sighting clearing house that seeks to make sure that these projects
are not going to be a problem with their flight patterns. And my
question is, that's part of the process, what are the additional pieces
when you go through the state?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Actually, the Department cannot say yea or nay to a
permitting process, to the process at all. What we've found out during
this process, and for those of you who don't know, this has actually
been a year long process. What we've found is that the Department of
Defense can only say yes or no if there is a risk to homeland security.
So just having a wind farm in the area, for example, Seymour Johnson,
just having a wind farm in the area may not be a risk to homeland
security but it could be detrimental to the training routes of Seymour
Johnson, which may cause us to lose Seymour Johnson. What we've
established as a permitting process with Deaner which would actually go
through a step by step process which would ensure that all the military
concerns are put out, all the environmental concerns are put out, so
that way everybody can coexist together without interfering and without
us losing our basis and counties not losing the wind industry in their
area.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Chairman: Thank you. Representative Stone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Stone: Good morning. Thank you. For the
bill sponsor I have a question on the 3,500 dollar fees. Could you
elaborate a little more of what the fees all incur? Is that a detailed
study, or just a standard fee for department?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Chairman: Representative Bell. [inaudible] Would the
representative from Dinger please approach the mic. State your name for
the record. The bill sponsor states that you can explain the detail of
that question about the purpose of the fee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Brad Ives, I am
the Assistant Secretary for National Resources. With response to your
question Mr. Representative, the fee covers our cost of notifications to
the military. We have a public hearing requirement, so the costs
associated with a public hearing, and also staff time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Follow up, how does that correlate with the local
fees if you had a local municipality or government that had fees as
well?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: It would be like any other construction process. If
there are local fees, those fees would be separate, but not every county
would have construction fees other than permitting or related fees.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you. Any further questions from the committee?
If not, you've heard the motion for Representative Hager, all in favor
say aye. All opposed. Motion carried. Thank you, Representative Bell.
Committee members we will now hear the PCS for House Bill 708.
Representative Moffitt, Representative Warren moves to have the PCS
forced for discussion purposes. All in favor, say aye. Motion carried.
Representative Moffitt.
[inaudible]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Good morning, members. Before I
do discuss this particular bill with you, I have a technical amendment
that I need to bring forward. Essentially on line 36, section 5 states
that this act is effective when the bill becomes law. This is actually a
resolution, so we're changing the word act.</p>

you. With that Mr. Chair I would ask that the members support the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further questions? Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Move we accept the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You heard the motion from Representative Collins to
adopt the amendment for house bill resolution 708, any further
questions? If not all in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed? Motion carries, thank you. Representative
Moffett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A question on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. Members as you probably noticed
the past couple of years I've taken an interest in water and sewer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Passing interest.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But this  particular bill is related to public
enterprises and the way public enterprises are managed by our cities and
our counties. One of the things that I was trying to get to with the
filing of the original bill was treating the public enterprises as truly
a separate entity financially from the cities and counties that oversee
them and protect the integrity of the rate payer dollars that flow into
these enterprises so that those enterprise dollars can go toward
supporting the infrastructure whether its repair and maintenance.
A lot of times the extension of these systems are already factored into
the rate when those things are necessary, but one of the things that
I've discovered is that a number of public enterprises are funding their
CIPs buy floating revenue bonds, are at the same time diverting rate
payer dollars from the public enterprise into the city or county to
subsidize the operating costs in the cities and counties. And I feel
that that - I question the appropriateness of that. So in filing the
first bill 708 the sponsors and I wanted to get a sense of what the
feedback would be from the public enterprise entities that are managed
by cities and counties. And some interesting stories came forward.
There's a public enterprise in the state that currently diverts $9
million dollars a year away from the enterprise to the city that
oversees it.
Well the problem that you have with this type of subsidy is the fact
that these enterprises are multi-jurisdictional. They serve people
outside of these cities and outside of these counties so what you
basically have is rate payers through the cost of their water or their
sewer or in some cases electricity are subsidizing the operations of a
municipality or a county that is charged with oversight responsibilities
for this public enterprise.So other stories have been brought to the
surface based on the original filing and we've decided that we need to
turn this particular bill into an LRC study and that's what the PCS does
and I'll be prepared to answer any questions Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, at the appropriate time Mr. Chair I'd like to
make a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair, to the bill's sponsor.
Representative Moffett would this include the eastern municipalities
distribution systems also?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It would.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Representative Moffett just I
think you said you it but I apologize for not catching it. The reason to
turn it into a study as opposed to running it as a bill at this point
is?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To keep it alive.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Ross.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I might need to follow up with a question. That's an
interesting answer from representative Ross and I'd be interested in
your opinion sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you representative Luebke, quite honestly i want
to be thoughtful in everything that I craft in this body while I have
the honor or serving here, and the information that I have gained since
the original bill filing really demonstrates that this is a much more
broader, more in depth issue that's going to take some time to
investigate and decide what's the best path forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Well, I thought the original
bill was a good deal and my guess is after a years worth of study you
will hear of people who are for it and against it and it will probably
come back in about the same form that it is, but we'll - but my question
was, under the statutes or the way this is written, what would be the
penalty for a...?</p>

Municipality if they did convert to money.  I mean it’s sort of silent
on that.  These towns, they make their own budgets, and they can shift
the money around.  I think in the study you ought to consider that there
should be some penalty, if there is a way to penalize a self-regulating
entity.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ll make a note of that.  Thank you Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, first of all, to answer Representative Starnes’ question.  There’s
a wonderful bill passed judiciary ?? taxpayer standing bill, and we
could expand it to rate payers.  My question.  In your opinion, should a
city or county that operates an enterprise fund be able to reimburse
itself for prior investments made, like thirty years earlier, or are
these costs to be reimbursed only current costs?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess it really depends on what’s involved in the original costs.
Were taxpayer dollars involved or was it strictly funded by enterprise
funds?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh I don’t know.  Take Apex for example, I think we started our electric
system in the 1920s.  I don’t think Apex does any transfers.  I don’t
think.  But suppose somebody wanted to do it, does your bill contemplate
that they could go back and have an actual true up at some point, or is
it not?  Just be thinking about that when you have your study, I think
that’s a significant question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Noted.  Thank you Representative Starns.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further questions from the committee?  Representative Stone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, good morning and I tell ya just briefly I think this is a great
bill and I look forward to helping you any way I can.  I give you a
favorable report for House Bill 708.  Roll.  PCS roll into ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Stone.  Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Comment on the bill.  I would like to thank Representative Moffitt for
bringing it to a committee substitute.  First reading the bill sounded
good, but as you dig into the details of it, it covers a lot of things
in our areas, back in our districts, that you aren’t going to hear a lot
about when you get back home.  That’s going to be an interesting study.
Thank you for taking it to the study committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Brawley.  Any further questions or comments
from the committee?  If not, you’ve heard the motion from Representative
Stone, all in favor say aye, all opposed, motion carried.  Thank you
Representative Moffitt.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At this time we will hear the PCS for House Bill 234.  Representative
Mills.  At this time, Representative Davis moves to have the proposed
committee substitute for House Bill 234 before us for discussion.  All
in favor say aye, all opposed, motion carried.  Representative Mills.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair, ladies and gentlemen of the committee.  The bill
that you have before you today, for those who were in the previous
committees on this bill, the reason why we have a PCS before us is that,
while we were thinking it, we were actually doing a technical correction
to a past piece of legislation last session, we actually realized there
needs to be some further cleaning to the actual session law so
therefore, we did some further cleaning, and this is why you have the
PCS before you.  And what it’s aiming to do is clarify the Pender County
ABC laws, and as you see there, from lines 13 to lines 16, that we
actually have to do some modifications.  And just to give you a little
bit of history, is that my Pender sister, Representative Carolyn
Justice, last session, modified these ABC laws in order to close down a
required store that was losing money, year after year, and decade after
decade, and upon doing that, there were some issues, and staff can speak
to this if you won’t have any questions, between different session laws,
in regard to the distribution of profits to law enforcement.  We’re
actually, from the understanding of the ABC Board in Pender County,
we’re actually going back to what it used to say, before last session’s
bill.  If there’s any further questions, I’ll be happy to answer that
through the direction of the Chair.

trying to find the staff person that deals with this. Thank you sir. I'm
sorry, I'm not sure how many other counties have distribution on the
required 5 percent. This has been in effect since 1973. Quick follow up,
follow up. Would this necessarily go to the sheriffs office. Because its
a county action. Its going to go somewhere else I believe this does go
to the sheriffs office. ABC boards can have there own law enforcement,
or they can contract out i believe in pander county it goes to the
