<p id="05:00">
Representative: …however they see fit, and when they see fit, meaning,
if you want to do a quarter now and come back to do a quarter, you got
that as much flexibility as we know how to give under this provision.
Twenty five counties with only a percent remaining under the half
percent cap, they may levy the quarter percent increments for transit,
education or general use. Once again, everyone is subject ot the 2.5%
cap. If I can, Mr. Chair, I believe Trina Mayer may want to add a little
clarifying or more information at this time.
Speaker: Would you like to provide some additional insight or would you…
? Okay.
Trina: No, as Senator Gunn mentioned, there is a chart hat sets out all
the options and he explained them very well. So, I am happy to answer
any questions.
Speaker: Okay, Senator Gunn, is that as much as we would like to
discuss? We talked about this bill a few times. Senator Blue, do you
have a question?
Representative: I do.
Speaker: Okay.
Representative: Senator Gunn, again, in looking at this, it seems that
the only county that will be, again, I don’t know the situation in
McClemburgh – they have a half percent sales tax for the transport
authority, but the only other county that is in the midst of trying to
deal with growth in an area that has well over 1.5 million people, and
has reached an agreement with two adjoining counties, that is, Orange
and Durham, if they do as those two counties have done, for research for
the transport authority, they have to go in at 1.5%: that is the deal,
the contract that they are into. So, in effect, you are telling the
state’s largest school district that if they comply with the deal that
made with the other counties that if you assess yourself a sales tax in
order to build a public transport system, then you are precluded from
doing anything to help public education because the choice in Wade
County is not to take a quarter of a percent for regional transit
authority, and a quarter for schools, and a quarter percent to do
general stuff. If, indeed, they comply with the agreement that was made
when this tax was enabled they have to go in at 1.5%. so, my question to
you is if it is the intent to put Wade county and the sheriff of Wade
County alone?
Speaker: You can respond to that if you like.
Representative: Thank you Senator Blue. Let’s just make sure again that
we are giving options to Wade, and it will certainly be there choice
that if they want to levy the 1.5% for transit as part of their
agreement, but that they will also have, today, the same options that
the other counties have that are currently at 2%. So they do have that
flexibility and can make that choice. I think another response to that
goes back again to that we want to level the playing field. We want to
look at where we are going to go moving forward. This 2.5% cap is going
to be in place and provide some universal appeal to the whole are, but
it will also, as we move forward in the next couple of years, as I have
stated again, we know that this is a great thing that Wade and some
other counties are prospering. Their sales tax, I hope and think is
correct to assume, will continue to grow. We do know that some of the
rural poor counties are actually, because of necessity, are actually
coming to some of the larger counties and buying and purchasing to help
increase their sales pace. We are committed to making sure that we are
fair to everybody. The rural counties are very, very glad that Wade is
growing and prospering, and I think that as we broaden this sales tax
base,</p>

<p id="10:00">
...over the next couple years; it would be my hope at that point in time
that all counties will prosper, both large and small.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I've got Senator Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The changes you've all made in the bill will
certainly result in higher sales tax around the state; you're making it
easier for 94 counties to levy sales tax, and so if those folks want to
raise their taxes and you all are making it easy for sales tax to go up,
power to you for raising sales taxes. But what I find problematic is the
same point that Senator Blue just made, which is, you are targeting 4
counties in particular in this; there are 4 counties that are urban
counties that were recognized as having transportation needs different
than your typical small county or rural county. And they are Orange,
Durham, Wake, Forsyth, Guilford and Mecklenburg. Those are the 6 under
the transit. Well, Orange and Durham already exercised their
quarter-cent optional authority AND their half-cent transit authority.
Senator Rucho said yesterday that this authority's been out there and
they should have known to use it---which, with all due respect, Senator
Rucho, is preposterous because there was no sunset on it; there was no
notice that any county HAD to exercise it and if they didn't use it,
they lose it. And you are now taking away from Wake, from Mecklenburg,
from Forsyth, and from Guilford authority that those citizens currently
have. Those citizens HAVE the authority through their county commission
to put something on a referendum and then---
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there a question coming up here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't know, I'm on a roll. Really. They have the authority to vote for
themselves whether to have a referendum and decide what is appropriate
for their transportation needs, and you are targeting them and depriving
them of that authority they have under current law. Here's my question:
you talk about a level playing field. It doesn't EXIST. We're already
pregnant, there are 2 counties that have 2 and 3-quarter cent, they are
Durham and Orange. They are the ones that are in the transportation
authority along with Wake. So you are now creating an UN-level playing
field between and among those counties. Why on the one hand are you
making it easier for sales tax to go up elsewhere; you're tying the
hands of Wake County?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
First of all, I'd like to address something misspoken on part of this;
these counties have a 2-and-a-half percent ability now, let's just be
very, very clear with that. We're not raising taxes on anybody. They can
use a one-quarter cent for transit---as useless as it may be in many of
these counties, it is still there and it can be applied; and they've got
the quarter-cent for general use; and the 25, of course, that have
already done the 2-and-a quarter, they still have the option of another
quarter. This is already there for them, so this is certainly no raising
of taxes by any stretch of the imagination. Senator Stein, I will still
have to go back to my comment before that this is leveling the playing
field. It is offering these counties, the larger counties, options to
the extent that they are available based on their current tax structure
and what they have done recently; and it will, as we move forward, give
us a little certainty at the 2-and-a-half cap as we move forward with
expanding our tax base in the years to come, to what I would hope would
put all the counties in a situation where they have a better, stable
revenue source; and one that they can grow as we prosper as a state, and
our economy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, did you have a question? A motion? Why don't we
entertain that motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. I move unfavorable to the original bill,
favorable to the proposed Committee substitute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the Committee, you have a motion before you for a favorable
report on House Bill 1224, PCS; and unfavorable to the original bill.
Any additional questions or comments? Seeing then, all in favor please
say &quot;aye.&quot;

[Speaker Changes] Oppose No, The ayes have it. Thank you Senator Gunn
for a great job you will be handling that in the floor Am I correct?. I
do have to say Thank you to the staff This is about the 1300th iteration
of the this very simple bill. Thank you. Absolutely. Alight, if you
thought this was fun Rep Howard , Please come forward with house bill 27
. I let you please explain this to every on and tell us how great it is
and we will go forward.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr Chairman I really believe that everybody
is going to be excited and like this bill. Many many years ago when I
was going to the treasury office, there was a conversation with former
member Bill McGade, I said, what happened to the?
[Speaker Changes]Rep Howard, I don’t mean to stop you. But I do need to
take a motion from Senator Brown that accept House bill 27 PCS for
discussion. All in favor say Aye. Oppose No. Ayes have it. Please
proceed. I am sorry
[Speaker Changes] That’s Ok. We had a conversation on what happens to
savings bond when they were lost or never redeemed. And so in recent
months, our treasury has determined that they have the opportunity of
taking ownership of the matured savings bond that are currently lying in
the Treasury office and we can bring them in to North Carolina’s office.
 Hope that folks could claim their bonds. But  for those folks who do
not claim the bond, then we would take ownership and redeem those funds
and the money would go to out sheet funds. I have asked all the
questions that I can think of asking and I truly believe it Its  a
win-win situation for North Carolina. We will be one of the I believe
the second state to proceed with this progress. In the summary, there is
the explanation of the actions that are required for us to be a part of
it. I believe there is no downside. Mr Chairman I would be glad to
answer questions.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Tillman
[Speaker Changes] I have one question and then a motion. How much money
we can anticipate  that  this bill that will be left over add to the
[??] out there their clients
[Speaker Changes] Well w don’t  Truly know. But I will tell you the
matured valu of the unclaimed U.S Saving bonds including [??] is $16.5
billion
[Speaker Changes] That as with a b
[Speaker Changes] B, Big B and with North Carolina being the 10th
largest state patriotic  state with the entire basis  that we have here.
I believe that  we will get more than our fair share.
[Speaker Changes] I have a motion  Mr. Chairman
[Speaker Changes] Yes sir,  Senator Tilman
[Speaker Changes] I moved on this wonderful bill  motion for favorable
report and the rest of the bill the fire wall resistance to the PCS.
[Speaker Changes] Members of the committee.  We HAVE A MOTION FrOM
Senator Tillman we have a favorable report for house bill 27 PCs
unfavorable to the original bill. Any additional question or comments.
Senator Hise.
[Speaker Changes] Just to clarify the figures that are quoted in the
summary. We this is actually listed in the background as the amount
being $16.5 million.
[Speaker Changes]It’s billion
[Speaker Changes]So that was an error in there. OK
[Speaker Changes] Ok. Senator Jackson
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank you Rep Howard for
binging this. Could you sort of explain me how the treasury office would
try and notify the folks , just briefly that owns the bonds
Speaker Changes: Yes sir, right now today I believe there is half a
million dollar at the treasury office currently and that stands from
closed out bank boxes just abandoned properties So one of the 1st things
that has to happen is that we have to declare that from the rows and
addresses</p>

A court action, where we take ownership. There’s two types of, two
categories of bonds. Bonds in our possession and then absent bonds. So
there’s two types of the bonds and we would take ownership and we’re
very fortunate that the state of Kansas has already done all of the
groundwork for us and custody is, we are taking custody of the bonds.
And then of course as in every other case, the treasurer’s office would
hold these bonds for a number of, timeframe, I believe it’s 365 days
that the bonds would be held. And then there would be a roster, as soon
as that roster is determined, and be published at each clerk of court’s
office in all 100 counties. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank you for that explanation,
Representative Howard, but how is the owners of these bonds prior to
they being I guess confiscated by the state, going to be notified that
they’re fixing to lose their bond? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, they actually
aren’t fixing to lose the bond. At any time in the future, reasonable
time in the future and I would think that would be a long, long period
of time, like any other claim that is made, folks can discover. I think
there would probably be a flurry of activity when this is published. And
as the newspapers and the TVs will begin to talk about it, folks will
begin to think about, in that book, that the kids savings bonds. But
after that flurry of activity, if the bonds are located in the future,
that’s why we are setting up a separate trust account inside of the ??
fund, to keep the money secured. So at any point in time that someone
claims their bond, that the resources would be there to pay for them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. That was the answer I was looking for, so
thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, so
basically Representative Howard, just to be clear, there is a separate
fund within the ?? fund so that when these bonds are put in there, there
is a safe location for them and they’ll be available for distribution if
asked for. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Senator
Hartsell. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Representative
Howard, I’m a little bit puzzled. And that is, normally property ?? to
the state in the other fund simply because somebody’s been holding that
money or that bond or whatever, and then remits it to the state for the
fund. Because those folks who’ve been holding it don’t know who,
nobody’s claimed it. Is this process designed to initiate a court action
by the state of North Carolina against the United States Treasury?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s the first step. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And if so,
sounded like a good idea in one sense, but how do you know what to sue
the Treasury for? That’s what I’m wondering about. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s going to take a lot of legwork and a lot of diligence from the
treasurer’s office. There’s apparently reams of microfilm that’s in the
U.S. Treasurer’s office. But in talking to the treasurer’s office, they
have certified that they have the time, the resources and the energy to
go after the North Carolina residency addresses. And it’s going to take
a while to get those, but I think it will certainly be well worth it. To
that end, the state of North Carolina could actually see between 300 and
500 million dollars added to the ?? fund. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hartsell. [SPEAKER CHANGES] But it
seems to me that in going through all this, you go through it for the
purpose of identifying someone who was or is related to the state of
North Carolina, resident or otherwise. And if you’re doing that, aren’t
you actually doing the work to begin with, that would result in those ??
funds, ultimately going back</p>

...to the folks who owned the money, as Senator Jackson is talking
about. And I’m just trying to figure out is this, I don’t know, it
sounds great, but if you’re doing all the work to find out who they are,
well maybe that’s just a service that we’re doing for our residents or
heirs, but I’m just trying to understanding it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand and there’s two ways to look at it, of course, if the money
comes back to the residents of the state of North Carolina, hopefully
they’re going to spend it here in the state of North Carolina which
would increase spending and help with our tax base, but we believe that
it’s going be well worth the effort to identify these people. If you
remember, the United States began issuing these savings bonds after the
first World War. That was before Andrew Brock was ever thought of, or
his parents were probably thought of, but you have two series of bonds.
You have the E bonds and the I bonds. The oldest bonds are the ones that
continue to accumulate entries for a much longer period of time. The
ones that most folks in North Carolina purchased was the $16.75 that
will material to $25 and that was the end of the road. It is done at
$25. These are...there’s millions of them laying out there that people
have forgotten that they had, they were destroyed in house fires and
things like that. I know I’m not answering your question to the point
that you want me to get, but after looking at this, talking to the
treasurers office and even talking to the folks in Kansas, that was the
first state that has moved forward to do this, I sincerely believe it’s
in our best interest to try to retrieve this, otherwise the money stays
with US Treasure and we gain nothing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. Thank you. This one, the tall one. It sort of follows up on what
Senator Jackson’s question was. Once we find out about all of the bonds
and all of the people, are we  planning to proactively inform the folks
who own the bonds now that if you don’t redeem them by a certain date,
you’re going to lose them to the state of North Carolina?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s not really the way that it would work, Senator Rabin. We would
take custody, take claim of the bonds. Then the state of North Carolina
would convert the mature bonds to cash. The cash would go into the
escheats fund, into a separate trust account where it will remain for a
long period of time. If it at any time that these folks were located, or
if they just opted to look at a list that would be provided at the
clerks of court office, it may be their great grandmother or their great
aunt, a distant relative, but if they could claim ownership, then they
would be eligible to secure the cash for the bond.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m probably a little bit slow because it’s so late in the day. The
question is, will we proactively contact the people who own the money or
do we just leave it up to them to sort of go to discovery? If we’re
going to go to discovery, I think its wrong.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that you would have to consider the depth of the process. If you
have an address for someone at Route 3 in Mocksville, North Carolina
and that bond is 25 years old and there’s not even a Route 3 in
Mocksville anymore, it’s now all housing addresses, particular street
addresses, I think that list would show that name and that last address.
But it would not be productive  or, I don’t think it would be even
feasible to try to send out letters and things. It will be a public
record of the last ownership of the bond.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up comment more than anything. I happen to have some of those
kind of bonds. Before you take my money, I’d like to know you’re going
to do it.</p>
