We call the environment comity to order, I wanna thank every body for
being here today. We have tree pages with us today. Please raise your
hand or stand up when I call your name. Mathew Jones from Rowan county
representative Ford is his sponsor Williams Jones from Rowan county
representative Ford must be brothers. We have Naomi Sinclair from
Catawba county representative Wall,s. We like to thank our Sergent at
arms today Bill Bass,  Berry More and Charles Devon. Thank you guys for
being here today. First order of business today will be house bill 505
representative Waddell and we have a comity substitute for that.
representative stars moves it ?? all in favor say aye, opposed no. the
ayes have it. And its property before us. Representative Waddel explain
your bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you Mr. chairman. I apologies to the comity again to the comity.
Last week we didn't have a PCS correct but we do have a PCS in here
today. I know most of you were here last week when I tried to explain.
This program, is really an ongoing program one that we been very well
please with and Columbus, Brunswick, Jones and Pender counties. I go
trough with, what I explain to the comity last week, is an attempt to
codified a existing program with the department of soil and water
conservation.  The program was started as a pilot in 1997. to state the
feasibility, of having of having a division of soil an water do the
annual inspection, of all concentrate animal feeding operations, or
KAFOs. In an area to be determine by the division of soil and water
conservation in conjunction with North Carolina DWQ. DWQ is till a
regulatory person in this. The recently assigned two counties ??
expanding Jones and Brunswick counties. The department of soil and water
conservation is also always provided best technical expertise as the
best management practices. Which include conservation measure and
nutrient management along with lagoon design. They are also responsibly
for design of nutrient management plants or animal waste plants. The
thinking was and still should be that since department, division of soil
and water conservation did the observation review in preparation for the
annual inspection. That they would be in a better position to make
suggestion for change or  improvements to the ongoing swine operations.
If North Carolina DWQ does the annual inspection, the former would have
to go to division of soil and water conservation for help or be
knowledgeable on their own for making the required adjustments or
mitigations for the violation. This bill in no way shape or way.
Replaces the regulatory reform of the North Carolina DWQ. Violation are
found on the farm there are forwarded to the DWQ and put in a program
called basing information management systems for record keeping and
enforcement action. This bill simply allows soil and water to observe
the operation, determine the farmer is in compliance. With the
probations of senate bill 1217. If not in addition to the noting the
deficiency in the report , it can provide assistance immediately own way
to mitigate the deficiency. And Mr. chairman, with that I would like to
ask for a favorable report, certainly and be here to stand for
questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Dixon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you Mr. chair, question for the staff that I discussed with them
previously.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Go ahead and ask the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Staff is it, do I have the correct understanding that the current
counties under this additional inspection, are the counties that will
remain the counties with the additional inspection.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yes sir, if you look at section three of the proposed sub comity
substitute. It directs the department of  environment, natural resources
and the division of soil and water in the department of agriculture to
continue in transitioning the inspection program in practices that are
currently in place. As they existed prior to the expiration of the
inspection program which part of what this bill does. At the end of
that, it says including the counties in which the alternative inspection
program is conducted. They should continue doing every thing the way
they're currently doing it. Including doing it in the four counties that
they been doing it in</p>

<p id="005:00">
[Speaker changes.] ...follow up...this question may be for the bill's
sponsor or for staff. Can you tell me if there's a coordinated effort
between soil and water and DWQ to coordinate those inspections so that
they're approximately six months apart?
[Speaker changes.] Can I answer the question?
[Speaker changes.] Sure...go ahead.
[Speaker changes.] Presently, we're only doin' one inspection and, in
the place of DWQ doin' the inspections, soil and water's doin' the
inspection.
[Speaker changes.] So there's only one inspection per year.
[Speaker changes.] Follow up?
[Speaker changes.] Mister Chair, I don't think that's correct. I believe
that there are indeed two inspections. One by Diener/DWQ and that the
soil and water is a supplemental or an additional inspection is my
understanding.
[Speaker changes.] JF????? Could you weigh in on that?
[Speaker changes.] The other department is here and they can correct me
if I am wrong. I believe under the general inspection program, which
this bill is an exception to, there is an inspection once a year by the
Division of Water Quality in Diener??????  And an inspection...I think
they may call it technical review...from the Division of Soil and Water,
which is now the Department of Agriculture.  What this program, that's
been in existence, has done is to allow the inspection in addition to
the technical review to be done all by the Division of Soil and Water.
But my understanding is even under the general program, that some is
done by DWQ and some done by soil and water. That they..it is a very
coordinated program..they have lots of communication and if there are
problems from one side or the other, they'll communicate with each
other.
[Speaker changes.] Does that answer your question?
[Speaker changes.] One brief follow up.
[Speaker changes.] Follow up.
[Speaker changes.] It is my understanding that once a year, these
facilities in these counties, are inspected by DWQ. In addition to that,
there's a technical inspection by Soil and Water, making it two
inspections in these particular counties on an annual basis. Are you
saying that my understanding is correct or incorrect.
[Speaker changes.] I think that is incorrect. I think for these four
counties, both the inspection and the technical review are done by the
Division of Soil and Water...and I see those from soil and water back
there.  They can let us know if that's correct or not.
[Speaker changes.] Could someone from soil and water address that.
State your name and position...
[Speaker changes.] Yes, sir.  My name is Pat Harris, I'm the Director
with the Division of Soil and Water Conservation. Prior to the
elimination of the routine operation review program, that is correct.
DWQ and Soil and Water both conducted a annual routine inspection in
each one of the counties. In the pilot counties, the four counties that
we're talking about, the Division of Soil and Water does the routine
inspection and the Division of Water Quality does not. If there is a
problem noted, then they bring in the Division of Water Quality, who
continues the regulatory portion of that. DWQ has oversight. They can
come in at any time and there is a coordinated effort because these
staffs are still housed within the Diener???? Regional Offices so both
groups are talking to each other as they work through these inspection.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Iler.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chairman. I apologize for being
late, I fully support my colleague Representative Waddell in this bill.
I actually co-sponsored this with Dewey Hill????? Representative Dewey
Hill last session and I think it failed to make crossover but I'm fully
supportive, I'm not a farmer. I don't understand the details but I
certainly want to support our farming community and Representative
Waddell. Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Hager.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chairman. My question's been
answered.
[Speaker changes.] Any other questions from committee. Rep...any other
questions? You're recognized.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chair. Make a motion to, if it's
appropriate.
[Speaker changes.] It's appropriate.
[Speaker changes.] To what...this is PCS of the original bill right?
[Speaker changes.] Yes sir.
[Speaker changes.] To make a favorable report, thank you.
[Speaker changes.] To the proposed committee substitute for House Bill
505. (Inaudible.) Ok, you've heard the motion, all in favor say aye.
(Ayes.) Opposed no. The ayes have it. The bill will be so recorded.

&quot;If anybody is waiting for house bill 938, the bill sponsors have
asked for that bill to be removed from the calendar today so we will not
hear about HB 938.
Next bill is house bill 471, represented by [??? name]
[Background noise]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr.Chair. [Microphone noise]
Ladies and gentlemen, this bill 471, simply includes two counties for my
district in the list of counties that are allowed to treat leases of
land up to 20 years as a least to allow renewable companies to come into
our district. We have a very rural district, a lot of land, not a lot of
jobs, so when you have folks in that industry coming in and bringing in
some economic development, I'm trying to do everything I can to
facilitate that. This simply includes Vans [?} and Warren [?] county in
the list of counties that are already allowed to this. My economic
developer from Warren county came and gave a presentation to the
commerce division about this one project that we have going on in Warren
county where we have put solar panels on the roof of our high schools
that allows 30% of the electricity consumed from the solar panels to be
consumed in a high school. We want to expand that. We have a lot of land
and interest in being a solar form into the county and this would allow
them to do that and I just ask for your supper.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Where did we hear this bill at? Was it in this meaning.
[Speaker Changes]
It was a very similar bill for a county in finance about one or two
weeks ago.
[Speaker Changes]
Can you explain the difference between that bill and this bill?
[Speaker Changes]
The difference in that bill and this bill is t that bill applied
specifically to Gravo [?} county. It allowed Gravo county to be along
with these other counties which is also in my district. And then thsi
bills to allow counties to take advantage of this particular statue.
[Speaker Changes]
The problem I think we had in finance with this bill was the part that
the lease could be done without noficiation of use of the attendeded
lease. I know this bill was pulled from finance at the time, we didn't
take a vote on that particular reason we couldn't just find what the
problem was [name] brought to our attention last time. I think that's
still the case with this bill. I
have a problem with putting a county or city municipality giving a leae
for 20 years to a company without noticing its constituents that it's
gonna happen. Mr. Chairman, I think this is the same issue we had last
time.
[Speaker Changes]
I was going to bring up something of the same except that I still
support it. I was the one who ran it when county was added. I understand
their question about the lease. I think representative Wilkens was going
to try and get that language handled if you need to consult with him. My
understanding was, based on other people in the room, is that while the
government entity might not do the lease, it would come out  in all the
other portions of the process. It was not like anybody wouldn't be
noticed. But yea, that is what I was going to bring up.
[Speaker Changes]
Mr. Charmain, like [name], I support this bill and I hope that everyone
will notice by good partisan alliance. I did have question for the staff
and it's this: just procedurally, and I think I know the answer but I'm
going to ask, if we were going to put in a Hager amendment that made it
explicit, its a requirement, that would effect every other city county
that's in this legistlation? Is that correct?
[Speaker Changes]
That's how I would read it to the other counties and the muncipalities
that would be effected by that ammendment.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you very much.
[Speaker Changes] I too support your bill. It makes a lot of sense and
you're just adding counties to authorize legislation for the counties
and municipalities. I guess what I'm trying [END].</p>

Understand is, why is this public notice issue all of the sudden
arising? Is this been a problem in other, do you have any idea in other
counties? This is all a sudden coming up because we’ve been operating
this way with all these other counties and cities and the issue hasn’t
come up before. Do you have any idea?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re correct, Representative Harrison. We are not,
this bill does not change the notice requirement. This bill does not do
anything about the notice requirement, that is already in the law. I
mean, you see the only portions that are changing under the statute are
the underlying portions which are the portions that recognize Vance and
Warren Counties. I mean, whatever problem there is with the notice
requirement, that’s something that can be addressed with a separate
bill. I mean we’re not changing, Representative Hager, Representative
Starnes, we’re not changing any notice requirements. I can tell you that
the council and the commissioners and the constituents in my district
are fully aware of what’s going on. They are excited about it they want
to bring some investment to our community. This is not something where
we’re trying to slip it under the rug in the dark or trying to do
something that folks don’t know about. If, I mean, the notice is already
in the law, we’re not changing that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m not taking the other questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Ladies and gentlemen of the
committee, the questions were raised on line 19 where it’s talking about
the public notice. Nobody is opposed to the projects that are going on
here what is happened was you had a poorly written piece of legislation
that was written originally and I think started out with Catawba County
and then maybe Mecklenburg, and then it’s been added on to. The notice
provision is that the private entity who is doing the project is
required to give a notice but the government entity, whose tax dollars
are being affected, by this are freed from giving the notice. And, in my
opinion, both entities, or at least the government entity, should have
been required to provide a public notice because that one has the tax
dollars involved and it’s a lease, nobody’s opposed to this. But my
question to staff is, is there not a way to draft a public notice
amendment for projects going forward and grandfathering those that are
already done?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Jeff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think we could do that. We’d have to look at it. You
know, you all would have to consider the differential treatment of the
existing local governments versus new ones. The other thing I’d point
out is the no notice requirement, and I’m just looking at this for the
first time, it appears to only apply when the terms of the lease or
rental are one year or less so it’s not all leases under this, it just
appears to be for very short term leases. If that helps anyone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I, Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This allows leases for greater than one year to be
entered into without notice?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] When you look on line 26 for a term up to 20 years
without treating it as a lease or a sale without giving notice so it
does affect ... I'm not opposed to it, if the counties want to do this,
but it is a public entity, there is tax dollars involved and I think the
municipalities or the counties have fiduciary responsibility to the
taxpayer to provide a notice. It shouldn’t be  just up to the private
entity whose entering into the lease agreement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Go ahead and comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. Now I can understand that,
Representative Starnes. I can certainly understand that. Are we then
going to go in and change the section B of this particular law that says
even leases for less than a year, leases that are for less than a year,
are exempt from the notice statute? So if someone wants to lease some
property for three months, are we going to have to put the ten-day
notice in the newspaper, allow for the public hearing, any time that the
city government wants to lease a property? I would contend to either
that would be inefficient and not necessarily effective in terms of
drawing in some investment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This says 20 years. You’re saying for the 20 year
lease...</p>

Hold that motion just for a second. Do we have any other questions for
the Committee?  Representative Catlin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, I ?? for sentence number 1, 160a-272 to address other
appliances of renewable energy, did ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff, can you answer that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr. Chairman and Representative Catlin. Section 160a-272 deals with
lease or rental property and not just specific to renewable energy
facilities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But then Centennial Campus I think they do nine nine-year lease, I’m
sorry.  Thank you.  Centennial Camus I think they do nine 9-year leases.
 I’ve got an area in my district where we’re trying to lease airport
property which is part of a foreign trade zone. Are we stuck in that 10
year category?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m sorry, would you please repeat your question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My county has some property that’s at the airport that we’re looking to
lease.  And ?? advised it’s a foreign-trade zone and if they got a 10
year limit then we’ve got a problem there too.  I’m asking a dumb
question going all the way back to the basic law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The sections, the subsections we’re looking at here the subsection C,
those are specific to renewable resource facilities. A and B are just
general, local government leased or rental property. Nothing’s being
changed there so I think that notice is required for those types of
leases if it’s for longer than a year.  But the subsections were talking
about, the subsection c are specific to renewable resource facilities
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not a question but just to make a comment.  It’s a basic policy question
so the committee has to decide what they want to do and I think that no
one is opposed to your county having a renewable energy project just
like no one was opposed to these other counties. But they started down
the road that these renewable  projects were new and this was?? Years
ago and I was here. And they were very controversial and one in Catawba
County was a doing a methane gas project there to an old closed down
landfill and they didn’t want to necessarily have to publish a notice in
the newspaper that’s what the County Commissioners were trying to get
around to start with.  But as renewable energy projects become more and
more prevalent, unless we make the change now then we’re basically
exempting governments from providing the notice to the public that
they’re entering into these leases.  This is the only exception the
governments have is for these renewable energy projects.  We’ve gone the
road a short distance.  I think you’re going to see a proliferation of
these projects in the future and now is just the time to fix it.  It
doesn’t do anything except make the local governments put  a notice,
whether ti’s in the newspaper or a website, that’ll be determined  in
the future.  That they’re entering into these long-term leases.  And I
don’t’ think it’s unreasonable and certainly not trying to do damage to
your bill I’m trying to correct a public [policy question that’s in my
mind.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I comment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You may comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand, Representative Starnes. I can appreciate that.  One thing
that may lay your concerns if you look at Section C. In bold the first
one, two, three words on there.  This is only effective until June 30,
2015.  So in two years, this goes away.  These governments, the
businesses, they’re not going to be able to get these long-term leases
without going through the traditional notice requirements. This is only
effective for the next 2 years. And I want to thank Representative
Alexander.  When you have these projects and you’re considering these
projects and they are competitive, there’s proprietary information out,
if you let too much of this stuff get out the deal is going to be ??,
you can understand that Representative Starnes.  We’re trying to
facilitate it, we’re not trying to keep anything in the dark but we
don’t want anything to get out that might mess up the project, might
release some.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sensitive proprietary information
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dixon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. ?? just a comment. I just can't
understand why we don't give notice on something that's going to be for
20 years. Notice is absolutely imperative and I couldn't support
anything that would not give notice to the public.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right Mr. Chairman, I don't know if I'm looking,
is there a PCS on this bill or is it just a bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's just a bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If you look at Line 31, of course we've got two c's on
this to start with. We've got a, b, c, and c. I don't know about the
second c and this might be a question for staff. It says effective June
30th 2015. Of course Line 24 says effective until June 30th 2015. So am
I to take that Line 31 to mean it's effective June 30th 2015 and
thereafter?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Jennifer, can you answer that.?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, Representative Hager. You're
reading that correctly. The section is set out twice because of the way
the various municipalities and counties were added over the course of
various session laws. The reason why it is set out twice because in June
2015, a few municipalities fall out based on the way the session law was
drafted a few years ago.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Go ahead Representative Hager
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So therefore if we approve this bill giving notice of
intended lease would be affective after the 2015 and from now on the
second c. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I understand your question correctly Representative
Hager the requirement to not provide notice for these leases would
extend to 2015.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We're going to hold this bill up for just a little
while an amendment's being drafted. Representative Baskerville, if you
want to hold up, we'll see what we can get down here. Next bill is going
to be house bill 480. Representative Millis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair, and ladies and gentlemen of the
committee. Hopefully I can make it to the finish line with this one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Hold on Representative Millis. I believe we have a PCS
for this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do we have a motion to have it before it? So move, all
in favor say aye. ??? no, the ayes have it. The bill is before us. Rep
Millis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. The bill you have before you, and
that the staff is passing out, the PCS, the short title is environmental
permitting reform, but to be specific, this is focused on the reform of
storm water permitting in this state. In short, in regard to receiving a
storm water permit, for the permitee, there is practically three pillars
that they're addressing whenever they're trying to achieve a permit in
this state, whether they know it or not. And the three pillars are: what
statute says, what the rules say, and also what the policy is of the
regulatory agency. What this bill is aimed to address is evolving
regulatory policy in order to shore it up, therefore we have regulatory
certainty of what is required to comply with these storm water
regulations involving statutes, rules, as well as policies for
individuals who are trying to receive a storm water permit and the way
that Ive addressed this is using some phrases that are familiar to the
department. That is, minimum design criteria, which is addressed in
section 1. And then section 2 addresses a term that is also familiar to
the department, and that is called fast track permitting. The reason why
we use these terms is that in the early 90s, administratively ??
established ADC, am Amendment Design Criteria for the fast track process
for sanitary sewer permitting, for gravity sewers and for pump stations.
They did this administratively. What I'm looking to do with your support
is to do this legislatively to urge them to establish a working group to
draft a minimum design criteria and also take that same technical
working group, or one of the same nature, and also</p>

<p id="035:00">
…Establish a fast track permitting process at the same time. So I’ll
briefly make a few comments and then if ya’ll want to get into the weeds
about it then I’ll be more than happy to get into the weeds and that is
in regards to a minimum design criteria. What exists now for storm water
policy is what is called a BMP Manual, a Best Managed Practices Manual.
In regards to the technical working group, what is mostly likely going
to happen is that they will take from that platform of the BMP Manual
and establish and set it more in stone under the per rule of the ENC
making process, so it’s not evolving that way whether your permitting
any regional office or any reviewer that you have consistency in not an
evolving nature that is required to comply with the environmental
regulations in this state. So, again, regulatory certainty is one tier
and then regulatory efficiency is the other tier that is being addressed
with the fast track permitting process. The way it exists now is that if
you try to get a storm water permit what you’re doing is that you’re
getting approval from the department that your plan meets the intent of
our regulation. In regards to the way this is approached with fast track
permitting,  just as the same way that’s it been done for Century Sewer
is that there’s a little more assurance that you’re actually certifying
and taking liability that what has been built complies with the
regulation. I think that is a very important measure, so we’re upholding
the protection of our environment in this state as well as providing
regulatory certainty and efficiency at the same time and I definitely
ask for your support of this measure. Sorry I have to hunch over here
and speak to you guys but I want to make sure you can hear me and I
think we may have a little bit of a mic issue here that we have to
address in the future.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any questions for the committee? Representative
Harrison.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister Speaker and Representative Millis I
appreciate you adding this second…actually clarifying this section too
about developing amendment to sign criteria. I guess I’m just wondering,
because it says relevant faculty form UNC and representative of
environmental consultants, and I sort of think that environmental
consultants being different than environmental advocates and I wasn’t
sure if the relevant faculty from UNC should be more specific like water
quality experts, biologists, or something. Is there some way to clarify
that and there are some pretty decent professors from Duke too I just
wonder if you want to maybe just be less specific UNC and maybe more
specific about what kind of…call it university expertise to include
maybe. Would that makes sense or…when you came up with this I just
wondered maybe…would that…maybe should offer an amendment or…would be
amendable to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Millis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Harrison.  I’ll be happy to
work with you as well as with you and me and the department on what we
would need to do to address the makeup of the technical working group. I
would ask that this is going to a regulatory reform and that is
something that we can work on with a PCS with that and the reason I want
to have the department involved is that all it has done in the past
administratively , I want to make sure this technical working group that
is something that has actually technical experts at the table and it
doesn’t get political in nature and that is really been my heart of
being…of protecting the  way this language has been about the technical
working group is that we as bureaucrats really don’t need to be making
technical decisions of how these rules and these statutes are being
achieved and I’d like to keep it that way. In regards to the UNC system,
again or actually the UNC, I actually spoke to staff about this, it
includes all those universities within the system. The way it’s
currently drafted, it wouldn’t specifically include Duke University but
we could look at aspects of that about really those to the table those
who to be able to assist the department as well as to assist established
ENC on that, so I would be happy to work with you as long as we can
coordinate with the department about it and I would ask for it be done
in an PCS for regulatory reform if you don’t mind.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samerson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister Chairman, I just have some questions.
And I like the fast track part and this is more you might be educating
me on part of this, you made the comment that if we put these in rules
that then you don’t have to worry about people changing their minds on
the BMPs all the item , which I understand. What happens, though, if
some techniques come out that are actually are better and cheaper and
all of that? Would they then have to go thought the rules process to get
those added to the minimum design criteria?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Millis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for that question. We definitely don’t want
to stifle innovation in regards to the fast track process by any means
and also with a minimum design criteria again really the heart of this
is this is really…</p>

<p id="040:00">
The minimum design criteria to comply with the regulation. But in
regards to a normal tract process, you would also have those, that
ability to innovate and to get it approved by the department. I can
definitely defer to the department to actually speak to that. But again
that was the reason why this bill was drafted in this way, is to leave a
normal tract therefore there may have be some aspects as moving forward.
And also too, even though the amendment is on criteria, it’s really
focused not be as evolving is that it would still be able to be looked
at in regard to recommendations by the department to the NC with hey
this is something we need to look at doing and that way it can be done
through a process that is held accountable by appointed and elected
officials, versus you having decisions that are being made sporadically
and evolving that really just creates a nature of tremendous
uncertainty. For example in regard to this state, because of what
they’ve done administratively through Sanitary, Sewer and Pump Station
permitting is that you can know for certain of what your costs may be to
comply with the regulations in regard to that, but you have no idea in
order to establish a pro forma and a budget about what it costs to
comply with ?? regulations in this state because you just don’t know how
the reviewer is going to handle you or the regional office. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. One follow up question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Living in an increasingly dense urban environment,
would the minimum design criteria have in it provisions for whether it’s
a more rural area or a more urban area, and that sort of thing? Or is it
more uniform across, because what might work in your county might be
devastating in my district where there’s very little open space?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Millis. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If someone
with the Department would like to speak to that? I can definitely get
them to answer that question. But I would say in short, what is already
existing from a BMP manual standpoint is what we’re looking at to alter
the evolving process. And also in terms of storm water quality aspects,
you know it’s one of those things where what you want on the back end of
your device is to be clean, regardless if it’s in Hendrick County or
Mecklenburg County. In terms of a quantity standpoint, that is a
different aspect that’s more or less outside the purview of the Division
of Water Quality. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I’m asking because we
have a lot of flooding issues that happen as it continues to develop.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, that’s the quantity aspect. Statewide as we’re
looking at the quality aspect. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mitch, give us your
name and position number, for the record. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I forgot the
position number. Mitch Gillespie, assistant secretary of DENR. Trying to
address three things that I’ve heard from the Representative. One, we
feel like, first of all we’d like to thak the Representative for working
with the Department on this bill. The original version of the bill did
have a sedimentation and erosion control aspect ?? and we felt like we
were not going to be able to do that and be consistent statewide. So the
Representative graciously worked with us to, and we made our case and so
that was removed here. However we do feel like the storm water can be
implemented in the BMP manuals statewide and be consistent and have
enough flexibility in there. So we support the bill. The other issue
that you brought up, talking about being able to allow new technologies
as they become available to be used in these BMP manuals, we do have a
process in place that would allow that to be looked at and in
relationship to that I will be bringing before the General Assembly next
year I hope an environmental enhancement program where these kind of
alternative things that as we see that are being developed, currently
DENR does not have the flexibility to allow a lot of these alternative
methods to be done. We have to follow the statutes from General Assembly
but I’m going to be asking for changes next year that will allow us more
flexibility to where we can actually enhance the environment and do
alternatives on things, along with public notice and things like this so
everybody be informed. I hope that answers and addresses your concerns.
And we’ll have some more things for you next year. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson, did that answer your question? Representative
Iler’s next. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I’m a little
concerned down here where we say the commission shall consult with all
these people. Now I was glad to hear that the UNC system didn’t exempt
any of our fine Eastern universities like ECU and ECW. Also on a serious
note, a very serious note, I see how many people are supposed to be</p>

…the table. And some seem to be private entities including one was
mentioned is possibly a private university be added. All these
consultants and all. I’m amazed this is a process I’m not aware of. Is
this something where we pay consulting fees and is this an
appropriations issue when we say they shall consult with all of these
different experts?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is my understanding that these working groups are not paid out of the
state coffers by any means, but I would like for staff and the
department to confirm. That was my understanding of exactly how the
working groups have been done in the past administratively, as well as
when we have these working groups even to draft statues and move it
forward with the rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to clarify Representative Millis. So what you are saying that the
energy experts, environmental consultants and engineers usually work on
these groups unpaid. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dixon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair and members of the committee.   In the past there
has been uncertainty by design and I think this begins to improve that.
And I would like to be recognized for a motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ok. Just hold that motion for just a little bit. Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chairman. I wanted to first ask of everyone. Is the definition of fast
track such that it really still has safeguards in it? I mean I get
worried fast track can mean kinda speedy and we’re pasteurized like
pasteurized milk. Pasteurized. And I’m concerned by that and a quick
question for staff. Does fast track still include some considerations,
just moves it faster based on the apparent level of concerns about
environmental impact. Is that fair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think the way fast track is used here is more as just as a descriptor.
I don’t think it really has much legal meaning. You could almost take
the words out of fast track and the language would still make sense. You
could say the commission shall adopt rules to establish a permitting
process that allows for. And then all the safeguards are built in, in
what follows that fast track I think is more of a descriptor, a name for
what you call the process. But it doesn’t really have any technical or
legal meaning beyond that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hastings.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? question Representative Millis. I wanted to touch on the tort law
aspect of this, and the administrative law. On the back page, section 4.
When you were talking about liability, the rule making process a little
bit before that, the administrative law piece. In your own mind, as far
as your legislative intent, were you thinking of criminal liability or
civil liability when this word liability was put in here for the
qualified professional.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead Representative Millis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A friendly response for that would be exactly the latter. In regard to
make sure that what has been designed as well as what has been
constructed and the certification that the design professional would
actually assume that the development or the structure has been built
according to the minimum design criteria that we want the working group
to look at aspects of certain liability to ensure that that is the case.
I believe that that is strictly a civil liability. I can get staff to
actually comment on that because we want to mirror what has been
established for sanitary sewer in regard to gravity. Sewer as well as
pump stations that you are certifying the design and then you are
certifying that what is built is actually been done per the minimum
design criteria.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cunningham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was interested in knowing what the best practices models being used
and what the technology constantly changing, how often are the best
practices looked at. That would determine on the outcomes of how
successful and your rates of how things work with the environment. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep Millis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe I’ll be addressing your concern with this response. If not, ??
I’m wrong. I’m a little young, but in terms of work and as a
professional engineer something I’ve done over the last eight or so
years. The way the BMP manual alters designs in terms of innovation has
been setup, actually, Mr. Gillespie actually spoke this, is that
innovation is a lot of times, it takes forever for it to be approved as
what would be called a BMP. As an individual that was a fresh…</p>

<p id="050:00">
At ENC state, I have yet to see some of the designs actually be
approved. That’s been over the course of over ten years. I think that
Mitch Gillespie actually spoke to the aspect that it takes almost
forever for these innovations to be approved as a BMP. Going to minimum
design criteria will not hinder that and we look forward to future
legislation to work with the department actually hope we can get
innovation from an environmental and a cost aspect back on the table.

No, that’s the problem.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For now, Representative McGrady’s PCS. But my technical change we’ll
send forth in just a minute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, that’s fine. Thank you for the collegiality, Representative Moore.
This bill came about, as I told you at the last meeting, following our
committee meeting with Secretary Skvarla. As you remember, he spoke to
us about wanting to protect the environment, but also see if there were
ways to do things more efficiently. The bill is an attempt to do just
that. It addresses the concept of notice and it addresses not all
notices given by the department in all sorts of context, but the
intention was to sort of run a pilot project. Basically provide for a
narrow range of things that are currently given notice via publication
in newspapers and have those notices  be provided in two different ways.
One, on the website of the department, but also by direct electronic
emails so if somebody wants to get notices of this type, they’ll
automatically get them. They don’t have to wait around and see, hope to
get them via catching it in a newsletter. At the last meeting I
indicated we had three or four different programs within DENR, not all
of DENR were in here and I asked if there were any desire to narrow any
of those, drop one, add something, and I actually didn’t hear back from
anyone regarding that. I would note that there are no changes in the
scope of notification so what’s in the notice that’s being provided,
there’s no changes there at all. It is a pure electronic notice bill. It
only applies to a small portion of DENR notices, it doesn’t apply to
other state governments, and, again, the intention is to run a pilot
here. You’ll notice at the end of the bill it provides for a reporting
back to the ENC...</p>

They do not have the kind of access, the kind of penetration, and the
kind of comfort level with the electronic world, and I for one, do not
want to move to a posture of notice where we are... by the way we do
things excluding their access. There are also places in North Carolina
where, because of topography, because of penetration that it's very
difficult to get access to things. You know, it's one thing if your
access to the internet is by dial up, and it's something else if your
access to the internet is by a high-speed connection. If you have a
high-speed connection you are more likely to peruse the various websites
to find out things and if you have to wait a half an hour for a page to
refresh, it's highly unlikely that you're going to do it. You know,

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I went to a town hall meeting in Orange County
last week, and was really surprised to have several people mention to me
the lack of internet access, lack of consistent internet access, I think
partly. The northern part of the county is very rural. The providers,
the vendors haven't  provided access to high-speed or convenient hook
ups for the internet and I was also very surprised to her that many
people said that they didn't have a computer. So, in my county at least
we still have people who- and one of the people said- and we didn't
bring this issue up, but she said specifically that she wanted notices
to be continued in the newspaper because that was how she got her
information. So, I think that it's a surprise that we didn't have better
coverage in Orange County.  Our schools are going to be moving to
digital, and we've got to have internet access, we've got to make that
happen. It's not true right now, so, I can't vote for this bill right
now in its current form.

Thank you Mr. Chairman. Let me just say, I've looked a lot about this in
terms of the digital divide, and with all respect to the gentleman from
the department, 99% is absurd unless he is saying that 99% of the state
that- where there's a line that's running through. The digital divide in
terms of variables is first of all, age. Every one of us knows that. I'm
here, I'm just seconding Representative Alexander's point. I mean, if
you're over 75, what's the probability that you check your email in the
morning? We all know that that's laughable. People over 75 don not
likely have an internet connection, and if they do, they certainly
aren't looking at websites and email. So, that's number one. Number two
is income, another variable that's clear in any research that's done in
internet access- is that the more money you have, the more likely it is
that you have a computer and that you will be able to afford internet
access from some provider. So, with this bill as it is, you are
excluding older people from it; You are excluding lower income people
from it, and I can't for the life of me understand why we'd want to do
that! Our state's very diverse in terms of income levels, it terms of
age. It just doesn't make sense to me. If the</p>

I think even the pilot, we all know why pilots are done. Pilots are done
so that you can move it on to a full fledged statewide bill, affecting
all aspects of ??. And I just absolutely can’t support this. Its just to
me, I just can’t believe we are being so insensitive, and I know I’m
going on. But I can’t be so insensitive to the elderly and the poor and
the lower income folks of this state with this bill. Thank you.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Harrison.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I have a couple of questions of
either the bill sponsor or Mr. Robins. And if he said this, I think he
said this last week. The anticipated cost savings for this specific
pilot project, and the expenditures by the department on newspaper
publications in general, if this were to be implemented sort of
department wide and not just the pilot project.
[Speaker Changes] Mr. Robins, could you answer that and state your name?
[Speaker Changes] Mr. Chairmen, Neil Robins with ??. I do not have a
statistic of a figure on how much wholesale electronic notice would save
the department. This is a very narrow subset that we’re dealing with and
we anticipate that this would save the department and the state about 80
thousand dollars with this bill. I don’t have a percentage of the amount
of notice. I don’t have an easy extrapolation of that number.
[Speaker Changes] Follow up.
[Speaker Changes] Well, thank you. I didn’t mean to put you on the spot,
I just thought you might have a handle on what ya'll spent on newspaper
publications. But, the other question, that you mentioned that this
would cover whales, termination shell fish leases consent orders, and I
guess you also distinguished the public hearing versus a public
comments. And I’m sure there is a distinction between public comments
and public hearings because that looks like that covers a lot more
areas, the air and motor resources, oil pollution and air pollution
control. I guess if you could just be more specific about exactly whats
going to be covered by this electronic notice change please, thanks.
[Speaker Changes] Mr. Robins.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Chair. I’d be happy to go through each
section if the committee would like me to do so. Its listed in the bill
summary that was passed out at the last meeting.
[Speaker Changes] Follow up. I guess the reason I asked is because that
seems like a lot more extensive than just shell fish leases. I mean I
guess I was just trying to get a handle on the volume of notices that
might be impacted by this. Because section 4 looks pretty comprehensive
but maybe because its a different category it doesn’t cover as much as
the other areas?
[Speaker Changes] Representative McGrady, could you answer that?
[Speaker Changes] Mr. Chairmen and Representative Harrison. We discussed
it last week and I so frankly was expecting that some people may wanna
come back and narrow this. I’m still open to narrowing it. I’m trying to
get out of committee today and would engage in a conversation with you
if you think that one or more of these areas are too broad. But I’m
trying to get a test of something here. And the proposal that is in the
bill is actually narrower then what the department originally proposed
with me. I thought it was a little broad and so I wanted to narrow it so
that we had a good test, but I’m willing to engage in the conversation,
but I would like to move the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Iler.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Chairmen. And I haven’t digested the
latest piece of yes yet but the section that I’ve been looking at is now
moved to page 3, section 5 in holding public hearings. And I guess it
goes back to what Representative Harrison may have been saying. The
general public hearings and we’re going to notify people by electronic
mail transmission to a list of interested parties in electronic on the
departments website. The demographic where I live is a little higher
then the average age. And we’re not served by a daily newspaper. I was
struct by the 42 daily newspapers. Our 2 newspapers are both weekly and
have plenty of public notices from municipalities and other entities in
those newspapers.</p>

<p id="070:00">
And 8,000 just in the area around Southport, 8,000 people get the
newspaper Just in that corner of the county.  And I doubt if 200 of them
visit ?? in any given week or month but or on the interested party list
I guess if you’re a developer you’d definitely be.  But average citizen
that might be impacted by some of these regulations that are dealing
with the costal area particularly. I’d be very concerned when something
comes out about changing in the storm water of the DOT regulator or a
DENR regulation we get a lot of interest.  Btu I’d be concerned that
hardly anybody would know about a public notice that was not published
in that local newspaper.  And then again we have another weekend
newspaper and so ?? 42 and the 2 million people that are impacted by
them .  Tome that’s not a good statistic for the entire state. And then
the other thing is we’re talking about a test.  And I haven’t digested
this yet but is there a way that we’re going to measure the results of a
test?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dixon?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That was a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead. Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is the criterion that we’re going to measure results of the test before
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No criterion in the bill itself. Again, if Neil could respond to how the
Department intends to analyze what we’re seeing here.   But I know what
we’re trying to do is we’re trying to analyze how many people are
responding based on the notice we’re currently giving and how many
people are responding based on the broader notice I think we’ll be
giving here. Obviously were comparing a little bit apples and oranges
because during one period of time you may have one set of permits moving
through and another time another set of permits. But that’s the sort of
thing I was expecting we would look at. Mr. .Robins?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Robins?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think Representative McGrady is correct.
What we’re looking to do with this is to move beyond survey data which
is truly the apples and orange comparison. To a more apples to apples
comparison of what kind of comment and what kind of participation did we
have in this process before this was implemented and after so we can
determine if we get more participation ro less
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does that answer your question Mr. ??. Representative Dixon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the Committee.  My understanding
perspective is that we’re here, that we need to identify the bigger
issue. And the issue is how do governments give notice.  That’s what
we’re actually talking about and that’s what we’re leading up to. And if
we’re going to dot hat, the narrow example that we’re talking about
doing here is going tog et the job done.  To me if we’re going to do a
test it would need to be broader if you’re going to get anything out of
it. And so my feelings and the way that I’m going to vote on this is
based on that there’s a bigger issue, there’s a bigger discussion that
we’re going to have to come to grips with as we look at the possibility
of transitioning to a different form of notice.  In my particular area,
the notices that are given in the newspaper are vital and they’re
important and at this point I’m not willing to do anything that will
diminish that opportunity for our citizens to be able to get the proper
kind of notices that they need and so if we’re looking at eventually
saving money, if any of my colleagues would like some examples of how we
could really save some money in government than I invite you to come to
see me on an issue that’s a lot different and a lot different to this
it’ll be talking about a whole lot more money . At this time I’m going
to oppose this proposed bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Catlin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If there’s going to be, this PC that was handed out we’re not talking
about this one yet are we?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No it’s not before us.

Is it going to be introduced? Then I will wait and let Representative
Moore introduce it.

<p id="075:00">
ask the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative McGrady, when they run the pilot
program, have they decided what county they're going to run it in, and
are there alternative methods of notification while they're doing the
test pilot?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I will as again, Mr. Robins to talk to that.  I think
we're talking about, I mean people are understanding that all of these
notices are published in all those little town papers all over the
place, and that's not true.  And maybe Mr. Robins can explain and
respond to the member's question if that's okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Robins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chair.  Can I ask the representative to
repeat the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Cunningham, can you repeat the question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chair.  What county will you do the test
pilot program in, and will it be an alternative notification in place
while the pilot testing is going on?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]That's not what the bill does.  It does not target a
county specific.  They way we proposed the provisions included in this
bill, were to discuss with our division, what notices had the least
target impact, and what they felt were the least effective in terms of
providing notice and also had a small impact on participation.  So,
they're not targeted at counties and this would be a change to actually
see.  It's a control variable.  If you implemented a newspaper notice at
the same time you implemented an electronic, you wouldn't have the
single variable to test.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Follow up.  The reason I am asking the question that
way is because your have rural counties, and you have metropolitan
areas.  And so the notices are going to be received differently.  That's
why I was seeing if you was going to target one area, so you can measure
the people response during the pilot test, so I didn't know if you were
looking at those variables or what.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Robins?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes Mr. Chair, I'll be happy to respond to that.  We
want to work with the committee and the bill sponsors to make this bill
and effected pilot program, and we are open to the discussions about how
the members are most comfortable about implementing a program, as I said
before, to give us a shot to see how this works.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Hamilton.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chairman.  My question may be more
targeted towards staff, unless Representative McGrady can answer it.
The context that I think about notification in is mostly related to
planning and zoning issues that are site specific.  In the community
where I live, the district I represent, every time there's a public
hearing on a zoning issue, the property is posted with a sign, and all
of the adjacent property owners are sent a letter about the public
hearing.  Are any of these notifications that we're talking about, put
into electronic, do any of them come with letters that go out to
adjacent property owners or signage along those lines as well?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]This bill has no applications, if I may, Mr. Chairman.
This bill has no applications to those types of specific class
notifications.  This is where you're just putting out broadly to the
general public, so no.  If there's a requirement that notice be given to
adjoining land owners?  It doesn't have any application.  That notice
will be provided per the narrower statute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Any other sessions from the committee?  If not, I want
to step down, and Representative McElraft is going to take over for a
minute here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Hello, any further questions?  Representative Moore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Actually, if I may be recognized to send forth an
amendment in the form of a PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]You are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Madam Chair.  I had a copy of a PCS
distributed to the members of the body, and obviously before vote, I
would ask to be recognized to debate the PCS before the committee would
vote to be before us.  I think the vote would have to be whether it
would be before us or not, so if I may be recognized to debate my
motion.</p>

<p id="080:00">
We have to put the PCS before you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, you’re making that motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m making that motion, but I think before...the effect of my motion
would be a substitute, I think before voting, in all fairness to the
bill sponsor, I probably should explain it and let the committee decide
whether to vote whether to accept or not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’re the Rules Chairman, I think you should be able to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me say as a caveat, I am making this amendment not as the Rules
Chairman, but as a humble Representative from Cleveland County.
Representative Luebke wanted me to call it the Luebke-Moore amendment,
but I resisted temptation at this point. Madam Chair, what this…and by
way of explanation, what this amendment would certainly do is it would
take the language that Representative McGrady is already using for the
department, I believe the PCS has been drafted to where it’s identical
to what my good friend from Henderson is already explaining. What I have
sought to do is to add in language which does, I will acknowledge,
significantly expand the scope of the gentleman’s bill. What it does is
it goes into the issue which, actually, we’ve all been kind of chipping
around, really, if you look at the debate this morning, which is this
whole issue of legal notices. What this bill does, it takes language
that makes modifications to the public notice requirement all across
government, not just for DENR, but makes this a very wide, expanding
bill. I will tell you that this is language that was proposed by, or
that is supported by the Press Association and is also language that
mirrors a bill authored by Representative Malone that is presently
resting comfortably in another committee. What this amendment would do,
what this substitute PCS would do, should the committee adopt it, is
that it would require...it would maintain the publications in
newspapers, but it makes some changes. One is that is puts a cap on the
amount that can be charged so that that would, in fact, reduce the cost.
And it also requires publications on the internet also. It’s, if you a
will, a belt and suspenders way of approaching it. That is the thing I
will not assume for moment that the bill’s sponsor considers this a
friendly amendment. I know it is not a friendly amendment and I
have...but I did contact him this morning telling him I was sending
forth and would ask the committee to consider the adoption of my
proposed PCS and I would stand ready to answer any question, Madam
Chair, if members have any.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would the bill’s sponsor like to respond?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, I would. Thank you, Madam Chair. The ploy that Representative
Moore has put forward here I would give an A for creativity and
cleverness. If you...it’s hard for you to do this quickly, but if you
look at my section 1, that’s his section 5. My section 3 is his section
6. My section 4A is his section 7A. My section 4B is his section 7B. He
has taken my bill and actually expanded it and he’s expanded it into an
issue that’s sitting over in another committee that deals with counties
and and municipalities, so what he’s managing to do if he gets his
substitute here, is he’s managing to expand my bill, so those of you
like Representative Luebke and Representative Insko who don’t like my
bill, should even not like this bill even more because it’s expanding
it. What he’s also then trying to do is substitute this in place of the
bills that are sitting in another committee, including one that just
came over from the Senate. I would tell you, the North Carolina Press
Association will love this bill because it blocks the other electronic
notice legislation that we’re not even talking about today. It almost
tells you that what my bill is doing here isn’t that much because the
Press Association, in fact, has incorporated all of my bill into this
thing. I, again, I’ve always been dazzled by Representative Moore’s
work, I particularly am today. I regret having held this bill over
because I was being a nice guy last week when I had the votes. I will...</p>

Learn from that? (laughter) I ask you to vote against this substitute
because it’s really, this is watermelon and kumquats here. They both
have seeds, but that’s about the extent of the commonality here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further question from the committee? (laughter) Rep. Starnes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I want to understand. Your original bill to allow (??) to do the
notification electronically is incorporated in this new PCS?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Largely, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Basically, it still allows them to do what you intended to do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Pretty much all of it, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They strike one section. You can compare, 4 of the 5 sections are there.
They kind of notice provision. I think even Rep. Moore would concede
it’s largely my language.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess Rep. (??) my dilemma comes from the fact that I think my name is
on Rep. Malone’s bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will say I expect that Rep. Malone’s bill will be debated in that
other friendly committee sometime in the near future. I full expect that
the Malone bill will be offered as a substitute appropriately to the
bills that it relates to. This is an effort to go another way to get to
the same result that they would like.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Luebke?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madame Chair. I know Rep. Moore tried to put my name on this
amendment, but now Rep. (??) is saying be careful. What Rep. Moore wants
to do to you. Seriously, as you’ve heard, I’m very much not in favor of
your bill because of the digital divide issues. You’re against Rep.
Moore’s amendment. Part of what you said a moment ago, is that if I’m
against your bill I really ought to be against his amendment. Can you
explain that to me just briefly for me please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The reason why is his bill incorporates almost all of my bill. Section 1
of my bill, Section 5 of his. Section 3 of my bill, Section 6 of his.
Section 4-A is…you go down, the things you were complaining about are in
this bill. In fact, you’ve now expanded it in a way that defends against
this other legislation out there to counties and municipalities. I don’t
think you want to go there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Quickly. You’ve persuaded me. I oppose the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Hager is next please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Question to the amendment sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Moore I know you were against my H-298. But since you’ve done this
can I put H-298 in this also? (laughter)
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Why not?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Iler.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madame Chair. May I inquire of the chair? We’ve had a motion originally
for the Senate PCS. Now we’re on our third PCS. What are we voting on?
The PCS presented by Rep. Moore?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The substitute PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The one presented by Rep. Moore?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Moore. That’s the one we’re discussing right now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand. When we get to…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 298. Just teasing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madame Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Moore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was simply trying to turn his Volkswagen into a Porsche with this
amendment. If I could just respond briefly. I will not argue with the
gentleman from Hendersonville. It is a…what this bill does, is it does
maintain essentially the notice requirements of the newspaper. It does
expand the debate beyond what this bill was about. What I did do was I
incorporated what this bill does with respect to this limited exception
for (??). Kind of the analogy I would draw, is back when I’m not up here
doing this, I’m just a small country lawyer back in King’s Mountain. We
handle a lot of these family law cases. We got to mediation. You’re in
there for several hours and whenever everybody leaves everybody’s mad.
That usually means you probably reached a fair settlement when both
sides are equally unhappy. Maybe that’s what my PCS does. Both sides are
equally unhappy and maybe that’s a fair compromise. About all.

Rep. Catlin.

[Speaker Changes] I mean the first part says that the newspaper notice
is still required and then the last sections say for ?? it’s not. Am I
reading that correctly?
[Speaker Changes] That’s correct. It carves out the exception the
gentlemen wanted, but it maintains the publication. It’s a passive
aggressive way to deal with the other legislation that is out there.
Kind of pending at this point.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Hager was next.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you. For a serious question to the bill sponsor
this time, I mean amendment sponsor, PCS sponsor whatever you wanna call
it. Represntative Moore, you talked about everybody walks away not
happy. This might be a negotiated issue. But did you not initially say
this is mostly what the press association wants?
[Speaker Changes] The first section certainly is. I know the press
association at least was not happy with Representative McGrady’s bill.
And a Representative last week spoke against it. But you’ll notice I
incorporated his bill, the PCS. But I also added in the language that
the press association, through Representative Malone’s bill has wanted.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Dixon was next.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Madam Chair, and I appreciate the matter in
which we’ve discussed a very serious issue this morning. And I think its
refreshing to have these kind of discussions. I don’t want to detract
our attention from the fact that we are discussing an extremely
important issue but its probably bigger than the discussion that we’re
talking about here, and I’ll refer back to my original statement. We’re
in essence talking about how in the future we’re going to have
government’s notice very important things. With what is in front of us
now, I prefer Representative Moore’s situation. And if it come to a
vote, I will vote for Representative Moore’s propoposal.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Starnes.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you. And I agree with Representative Dixon.
We’ve got the issue of notice, but we’ve really got it mixed up here
with different issues which are both serious issues that need to be
addressed, and we need to figure out a way where everybody can come out
a winner on this. But Representative Malone’s bill was in another
committee and I understand its in your J committee is this was separated
out, could you offer Representative Malone an assurance that his bill
would have a fair hearing and a vote in an expeditious manner?
[Speaker Changes] My expectation is the electronic notice bills will
come up in my committee at some point. My further expectation would be
in that Representative Malone’s bill will be offered as a substitute to
one of the bills that would be brought forward. And that is one of the
ways that it will be likely considered in my committee, but I’m just
anticipating that. All of the electronic notice bills that I anticipate
at some point would end up over there. This one was very narrow I
thought. If this bill were being discussed with all the language in the
front, you’d have the county commissioners association, the the legal
municipality, and a whole range of other people that would never have
anticipated needing to come to an environment to talk about ?? notice.
Thats why it is sitting over in a different committee. And again i would
urge those of you who don’t like my bill need to vote against the
substitute too, to be consistent I believe.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Harrison.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Madam Chair. Just for clarification, I
apologize for my confusion. Representative Moore’s PCS, has your bill a
carve out for ?? with no newspaper publication requirements? Is that
right, and then it has the other piece of it that has to deal with the
press associations bill?
[Speaker Changes] Substantially. I think its fair to say. Its not
exactly, but its got four of those five provisions that are in there,
yes.
[Speaker Changes] And as a follow up. My preference is yours, that that
bill be debated separately in a committee that is more appropriately
suited where there is a the public notice out there for those impacted
by the bill to be available at the committee for the hearing. So I would
not be in favor of this proposed committee substitute offered by
Representative Moore. And if its appropriate, I’d like to add that I’d
like to amend your bill to take out a couple sections, and I think I
could vote for it, and I don’t know when its appropriate to bring that
up.</p>

1st Speaker : Right now we are still on the motion any further comments
or questions on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]. thank you I have been mostly listening today but I
have done a lot of research  because this is an important issue for my
district. Pew Research did some work on this who has a capability to
look at this online notices and then basically 20 percent are not using
it  even tough the internet maybe available down their stream. The
reason they are not using it is some are not interested, i think those
are the senior citizens they spend their whole life without it. many
can't afford it because an iPad, computer is expensive and it cost you
something every moth to pay for the internet access and some don't think
they can learn it   some people are afraid of it and there are actually
citizens who don't believe that the internet is the right way to live
your life and they have some moral problems with it, so looking at my
county census and taking the people under 18 out that left about 33,000
people if the Pew research numbers were consistent in my county, and if
you take the cost of an iPad and years worth of internet connectivity
you can argue about what that numbers is it might be $1500 for the first
year it might be $500 for the first but it is $1500 this is going to be
$50 million burden on my citizens and if it is $500 it is going to be
$16 million burden on my citizens so i think it is important that we
have this discussion because we are in a new technology world but i
don''t know if we want to rush trough it so i respect everybody who is
pursuing this i think they brought up some very good arguments but i am
going to vote no on everything today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]. OK. Any further questions i think we are ready to
vote on representative Morris motion for the new Pcs 755. All in favor
vote aye. All opposed vote no. The nos have it. the motion fails. OK now
we are back on the our original Pcs any further representative Harrison.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]. I think i can state it i spoke to the Bill sponsor
and to the department i think the section that gave me the most concern
that i think i agree with  many of my colleagues concerned about the
digital divide and number of constituents we have who don't have access
to internet and they will be getting this information form the newspaper
but i would like to take out the sections 4a and 4c. 4a has to do with
pollution discharges to surface waters. and 4c deals with public commons
and public hearings on issues ranging from air and water resources or
pollution has their substances control and air pollution control because
i think those are pretty broad and far reaching the others  are quite
narrow and i am not sure what kind of experiment you end up with but  I
think I would vote for the bill if we could take out those 2 sections.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]. Looking at the department that exactly what i
requested at a last meeting so we are quite amenable to that and we you
make that in a form of a motion i would urge support for representative
Harrison's motion. ??? Representative Lukey
[SPEAKER CHANGES]. i just don't like the idea not having staff to tell
us which lines of the bill are coming out and so i can follow line by
line
[SPEAKER CHANGES].  If we can get that done.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]. I appreciate the sentiment but i to know the lines
please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]. I think it is also important we need to make sure we
are on the right Pcs ??
I think Representative Harrison was referencing the sections that weer
on the Pcs representative more offered. What you need to be looking at
now is how 755 this will be under 2nd line of the bill number CSTA-8d5
i'm sorry it is the other one CSTA8d4 so that's what you need to be
looking at now that you are acting on so you want an amendment we need
to know which sections this Pcs you want to amend it out.
﻿[SPEAKER CHANGES]. Madam Chair if i can just follow up. I thought i was
looking at the the right version Section 4a dealing with water pollution
that starts on line 6 on page 3.

And it runs to page 4 line 13. And then item, section 4C which is on
page 5 and runs from line 5 to line 46. I think I’m on the right version
there. Is that clear? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. And what, what we’ll have
as an amendment just, because it’s the quickest way to do it. It would

Representative Samuelson? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Madam Chair I was gonna
speak against the amendment. While I appreciate the intent I am one of
those counties that would need to talk with my county before I could
support this substantive change. It’s also why I thought it ought to be
done in the government committee. And there needs to be in all these
counties and cities needs to know how it’s going to impact what their
currently doing. Because this has been established policy for a number
of years. So I would urge your to defeat the amendment. But I would
encourage the sponsor of the bill to get with these county people and
talk some [UNKNOWN] before you get to government. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chair</p>

Representative Samuelson, I think they’re all...your situation and
others are grandmother and grandfather, so it doesn’t affect you it’s
just going…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s all perspective. Everything is grandfathered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They’re all grandmothered. Can they show me how that’s happening.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff can answer that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to clarify, any leases executed on or after the effective date,
including for the counties and municipalities that were in the provision
before the bill before you, any new leases in all those counties and
municipalities will have to give notice.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All the old projects are grandfathered, but from here on out if they
want to do a new project, the just put a notice in the paper or on the
internet, whichever applies to their county.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Respond?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just remembered that it was bit of an issue when this came up before,
but I don’t remember all the details why so it’s one of the counties, if
you representative one the counties are cities that are in here and your
people, for all you know, may be in the middle of doing this right now
and so, given that I’m going to vote against it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
