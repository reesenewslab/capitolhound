silence all electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer is the
Reverend Peter Milner, Senate Chaplain. Members and guests in the
gallery please stand. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Lord, you’re the same yesterday,
today and forever and yet how do we even come before you right now and
pray in such a strange place. While you completely forgive us, we often
completely judge those to our left and right. You tell us not to keep
score and, Lord, I know I often fail at this. Help our hearts from
becoming cold, judgmental and calculating. Father, I’m grateful that on
this day there’s nothing I can do or think or say that keeps you from
pouring out your grace upon me. You are a forgiving God. Despite our
failings, despite ourselves you cling to that cross for us. Have mercy
on us, Lord, forgive us and help us depend on your grace in all of our
relationships here in the North Carolina Senate. It’s in Jesus’ name we
pray. Amen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Amen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Pate is

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Smith-Ingram, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To send forth a senatorial statement at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you can send forth your senatorial statement now.  Sen.
Smith-Ingram, would you like to speak to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As well, you have the floor, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  It is indeed my honor to submit this
senatorial statement on this evening.  In 1891, by an act of Congressman
Justin Smith Morrill, the land grant institutions were set forth across
the United States of America so that we could lead the innovation in
agriculture and technology.
With that grant, some 30 years later, came the act of the North Carolina
General Assembly (and you have the statement before you).  As you refer
to your statement, I’d like for my colleagues who are graduates of North
Carolina Agriculture and Technical State University, if you will stand
with me, as well as any staff members, my legislative assistant is a
graduate as well of this fine institution.
It is truly a jewel that lies in the districts of Sen. Robinson as well
as Sen. Wade.
North Carolina A and T was founded on March 9, 1891 by the act of the
North Carolina General Assembly to ratify Congress’ second Morrill act.
In this act, great institutions like North Carolina A&amp;T were
established.  To share with you a few accolades of the university, will
be that it is the no. 1 producer in the United States of America of all
African-American engineers at the bachelors level as well as the masters
and the doctoral level.  It is also a leading university in producing
African-Americans certified public accountants.
If you will go to the fourth paragraph, we hold such love for our alumni
members.  We boast such great cadre of them, to name a few would be
Chief Justice of the NC Supreme Court, past Justice Henry Frye,
Congresswoman Alma Adams, Congressman Edolphus Towns, former NASA
astronaut Ronald McNair, who was also my hero.  The A&amp;T Four, who
launched America’s sit-in movement, Terrence Jenkins, an actor, Golden
State Warriors vice president Alvin Attles, and several state
senators...Sen. Wendell Ford, Sen. Ben Clarke, Sen. Joyce Waddell, Sen.
Gladys Robinson and I would not leave out yours truly.
NC A&amp;T is a place where dreamers become achievers, from astronauts
to presidents, where superlatives are a norm and mediocrity is not a
part of reality, where we have over 100 years of existence and a century
of excellence.
Now, therefore, the alumni of this world class university, not only can
rightly say Aggie Pride, but also Aggies Do.  Because of the
university’s unwavering commitment to higher education and social
activism, making it deserving of recognition on this it’s 124th
anniversary, astronaut Ron McNair was my hero.  I wanted to be an
astronaut, but I could never get over my fear of heights, so I became an
aeronautical engineer and worked for the Boeing company some 8-9 years
plus.
I believe that what we do here is so important.  It’s the enactment of
this general assembly that set the pace for this fine unwavering.  I
commend the general assembly for what we do and I trust that we will
move forward to lead innovation.  Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, senator.  Any other notices or announcements?  Any further
business come before the senate.  Not, the chair recognizes Sen. Pate
promotion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  I move that the senate do now adjourn,
subject to the standard stipulation set forth in Senate Rule 24.1,
appointment of conferees and messages from the house to reconvene on
Tuesday, March 10, 2015 at 2PM.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The motions of Senate do now adjourn subject to the stipulation stated
by Sen. Pate to reconvene Tuesday, March 10 at 2PM, seconded by Sen.
Smith-Ingram.  All in favor say aye.
