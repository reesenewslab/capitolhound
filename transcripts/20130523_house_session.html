[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Calendar, House Bill 169, the Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Committee Substitute for House Resolution 169, a
House resolution expressing gratitude to the members of the military for
their service, and honoring the memory of those killed in the line of
duty, the House resolves: Whereas Memorial day was first observed as
Decoration Day on May 30th, 1868 as an occasion to decorate the graves
of Civil War soldiers, and whereas after World War I, Decoration Day was
expanded to honor service members killed in all of our nation's wars,
and after World War II, Decoration Day became known as Memorial Day, and
whereas in 1971, Congress established Memorial Day as a federal holiday
to be observed on the last Monday of May, and whereas as we observe
Memorial Day in 2013, it is important to remember and reflect upon the
contributions and sacrifices the men and women of our Armed Forces have
made in upholding the principles which are the foundation of our
democracy and liberty while in service to our nation. And whereas it is
fitting to honor and commend the North Carolinians, as well as men and
women who served in the military units based in North Carolina, who were
killed in the line of duty, and thus paid the ultimate sacrifice to
preserve the freedom which we enjoy. Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the House of Representatives; Section 1: The House of Representatives
expresses it's profound gratitude and appreciation to all the men and
women of the United States Armed Forces for their selfless service.
Section 2:  The House of Representatives wishes to honor the memory of
all of the members of the military from North Carolina who lost their
lives while serving during Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring
Freedom, and Operation New Dawn since May 25, 2012, as follows: Army
Specialist Trevor B. Atkins, Spring Lake, North Carolina; Army Staff
Sergeant Rayvon Battle, Jr., Rocky Mount; Navy Master at Arms 2nd Class

House of Representatives extends the deepest sympathy . . .</p>

<p id="10:00">
to the families of the service members named above who have made the
ultimate sacrifice to help secure the freedom of the United States of
America. The people of the state of North Carolina owe a debt to these
brave service members and solemnly pledge that they shall never be
forgotten. Section 5, this resolution is effective upon adoption.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blust is recognized to debate the
resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, members of the
House and distinguished gallery guests. In June of 1963 in COBO Hall in
Detroit in an earlier version of what later became known as the speech
‘I Have a Dream’, Martin Luther King told the crowd “There are some
things so dear, some things so precious, some things so eternally true
that they are worth dying for.” At the height of the Cuban missile
crisis, President John F. Kennedy addressed the nation and concluded by
saying “The cost of freedom is high, but Americans have always paid the
cost, but one path we will never choose is one of surrender or
submission. We seek not the victory of might but the vindication of
right, not peace at the expense of freedom, but both peace and freedom
here in this hemisphere and we hope around the world. God willing, that
hope will be achieved.” We come today with this resolution to attempt,
in the way we can attempt, to honor those who achieved the goal of peace
and freedom, those who went and put their lives on the line and
willingly went into the valley of the shadow of death to secure the
freedom which unfortunately we all too often neglect to cherish enough
to honor these people’s memories, and this is no small thing that we
ought to do; it’s a big thing. Jesus himself said “Greater love hath no
man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends,” and they
laid down their lives so that we can enjoy all the things that we enjoy.
We should never forget this because we know that it’s the soldier, not
the newspaper editor, that’s giving us freedom of the press. It’s the
soldier, not the network news anchor, that gave us freedom of speech.
It’s the soldier, not the pastor, priest or rabbi, who’s giving us
freedom of religion. It’s the soldier, not the protester, who is giving
us the right to peaceably assemble, and it’s the soldier who saluted the
flag, who serves beneath the flag and whose blood-soaked coffin is
draped by the flag who makes it possible for the protester to burn the
flag, and it’s the soldiers, be they army, air force, navy or marine,
who throughout our history, from sea to shining sea, from every mountain
top have let freedom reign. So how can we really repay the debt we owe
to them? Lincoln told us at Gettysburg that really, mere words are
inadequate. Lincoln said “It’s for us the living, rather, to be
dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have
thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to
the great task remaining before us, that from these honored dead we take
increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full
measure of devotion, that we here highly resolve that these dead shall
not have dies in vain, but that this nation under God shall have a new
birth of freedom.” The cause for which they gave the last full measure
of devotion was that of protecting and defending freedom. That cause
will always be an unfinished work. In a republic there will always be a
great task remaining before us because Ronal Reagan told us that freedom
is always only one generation away from extinction. We didn’t pass it
onto our children in the bloodstream. The only way they can inherit the
freedom we have know is if we fight for it, protect it</p>

<p id="15:00">
Defend it and hand it to them with the well taught lessons of how they
and there lifetime must do the same. And if you and i do not do that
then you and i may well spend our sunset years telling our children or
our children's children what it was like to be free once in america. And
in this time of great national angst about the future of America what we
must do to honor those who have fallen is clear, we must do what it
takes to give this nation a new birth of freedom. And i think the answer
can be found as to what we must do in a little insert i got in a
fundraising appeal from the Wounded Warrior Project. It has 7 attributes
listed that almost universally those who go and volunteer and defend
America possess. and its duty honor, courage, commitment, integrity,
country service. And we all know from there deeds that they possess
these characteristics and i think its incumbent upon those of us who
have the high honor and distinct privilege of serving in the offices of
the institutions that these soldiers go and defend, and die to save, to
start to use these attributes as a code that we absolutely go by at all
times. And i think that part of the reason those in the political realm
are not held in the esteem that those that go and serve us are held, is
because the public compares us and they see us lacking but we can start
today to change it, it matters how we conduct the business of the people
that went to put there lives on the line to give us this chance ya know.
it is a great honor and privilege to serve someone like Sean Brazos,
named in this resolution. He went to the high school i went to so he
walked the same halls, went and took classes in the same classrooms,
studied in the same library, played on the same athletics fields i did.
Yet he is gone, and i get to live a life here free in America, now that
to me confers an enormous responsibility and obligation to do it in a
way that honors Sean Brazos and all of those who came before us. So i
think if we start today to do this, i think there would be a new birth
of freedom as Lincoln referenced in the Gettysburg address. And that way
we would truly honor those who in the words Lincoln, have laid such a
costly sacrifice upon the altar of Freedom.
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Representative Floyd please state your purpose
(SPEAKER CHANGES)To debate the bill
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Mr speaker as i stand before you here today in this
chamber, recalling my young years when i was stationed in Paris, France.
Walking down ?? and one person walked up to me and showed me a newspaper
with the protest that was taking place in the south. And they asked a
question of me, &quot;Why are you in this uniform.&quot; I didn't
respond, i did not respond to that person because i was proud to wear
the uniform of the United States Army. Well 5 years later one of my
classmates that always goes to funerals, always called me to tell me
when one of my classmates gave all to this great nation. Gave all, for
this great nation. As i said before so i could stand here in this
chamber and debate between the 119 and stand very proudly because they
gave all what this great nation, and this great state, and im proud as
the speaker before me talked about the Gettysburg Address. The world
will long remember what we have said here, but it can never forget, the
sacrifice in the men and woman have gave for this great nation. We in
Cumberland county, our representative of the tenth largest military
installation in the world. We are going to pay tribute to those
individuals.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and members of the house. I would like to share in
the spirit of Representative Blust admission to us today a personal
experience I had in the privilege of honoring a fallen soldier. Several
years ago in our community, the Vietnam Wall came to our community as
part of our Veteran's Day celebration. The people in our community
decided that each of the 58,000 as I remember it names would be read
during that period of time. During the course of the even I signed up to
be one of the readers. And went and did that. As I recall it took about
20 minutes to read the particular assignment that you had. When I
concluded my assignment, as I was walking past the desk, they indicated
that the next reader had run into difficulty and would not be able to be
there. I volunteered to read a 2nd time which they accepted. I read the
2nd page. At the conclusion of that I went and turned the sheet in or
the pages in and they indicated that the next reader would be about 15
minutes late. I volunteered to read a third time. As I began that third
page the 5th name on that 3rd page was Allen Rhodes Bonney. My first
cousin. In his hometown. The probability of that experience goes beyond
my words of expression. And I'm honored to use the name of Allan, Rhodes
Bonney in this chamber today. I commend the result ion to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Horne is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. War is a terrible thing. But it's not the most
terrible thing. The most terrible thing is to be without hope. Can you
imagine? Without hope. Thousands, millions of Americans, don the uniform
in order to give hope to us, here, our neighbors, our family, our
friends, and those around the world. There is, I guess I can't go
forward without at least inserting one quotation about never in the
course of human events has so much been so much by so many to so few. We
are honored to have some of those few with us today. We have been
honored to have some of those few serving in this house, our next door
neighbor, the guy down the street-

<p id="25:00">
...maybe we'll start dad or uncle. Some of us, I'm sure, remember
taxicab maybe or a staff car pulling up down the street. Seeing some
officers get out and head up to a doorway. Here in the street you know
what the message was they delivered. We are so blessed to be here today.
We stand on the shoulders of giants. Real giants, real people. Common
folk who did uncommon things in terrible places sometimes, and under
really terrible conditions.
Can't help but read you just a few lines from a poem, comments if you
will, that came to mind instantly when I sat down here this afternoon.
&quot;Do not stand at my grave and weep. I am not there. I do not sleep.
I am the 1,000 winds that blow. I am the diamond glints in snow. I am
the sunlight on ripened grain. I am the gentle autumn rain. As you awake
this morning touch, I am the swift uplinging rush, of quiet birds
encircling flight. Do not stand at my grave and cry. I am not there. I
did not die.&quot;
The people that we honor this Memorial Day, this Memorial Weekend, did
not die. They left us with a challenge, an opportunity and an honor that
we shall carry forward. Thank you. On behalf of my family and the people
here, thank you, very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Hall, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and members of the House. It's
certainly an honor to be here and to be in the presence of great
warriors for our country who have, some have given all, all have given
some and we have some here today and certainly I'm honored to be in
their presence as they look over us and try to see the fruition of the
sacrifices they made and certainly we have a responsibility. I talk
about it almost every time I get an opportunity because we do have a
great responsibility. No matter how much they risk, no matter how much
they achieve, it's only through us living out the promise that they
create that there were acts, really become valuable.
They work for us. We have a unique form of government where civilians
determine what policy our military carry out. And we have an undeniable
duty to fulfill our end of the bargain to them. I have thought about
many times the sacrifices members of my family have made, members of our
community.  As I think one of the most interesting moments I had in my
career as an infantry officer in the Marine Corps., we were on an
operation in Norway and it was the first time since World War II that
American forces had been in Norway in this particular valley. We did an
aerial assault off of helicopters. And it was a great operation. And the
embassies and everyone had to notify the countryside so that everyone
would be safe and not get in the way of the operation. And we had a
division going in. I was privileged to be on the advance unit, some of
the first helicopters to hit the ground in Norway since World War II.
And of course, as Marines do, we were camouflaged to the hilt. You
couldn't tell black from white. All you could see was green from our
helmets to our boots, all you could see was green. Might have been
different shades of green, different camouflaged patterns. But all you
could see was green. And so very interesting, when we landed, and the
birds took off and we secured the LZ's and started to move to strategic
locations. And of course, this was a big deal so you had to let the
civilian populous be involved. But little kids began to run up to us...</p>

And grab our faces. They were intrigued by the fact that all of us were
green Americans. They grabbed our faces to see, was it real? Were we
real? How could we all be green Americans? There were no black, there
were no white, we were all green Americans. And so, as you think about
our responsibilities, being the leading country in the world. When you
think about our military who go out and ambassadors for us, folks see
them as Americans, and I hope we'll pursue policies so they're treated
with respect as Americans and looked upon as being green. Not looked
upon as one color or another, but just green marines. I commend a
resolution to you.
Representative Faircloth please state your purpose.
To debate the bill.
The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
The resolution.
I am reminded by Representative Blust's comments and the others that
have spoken, about an experience that always comes to my my mind on
Memorial Day, that says a lot about our, how our troops are viewed
overseas, or have been viewed overseas over the years. We hear a lot of
Americans who say, &quot;Those folks over there don't understand what we
did for them. I wanna tell you about a little experience that always
comes to mind. 1989 my wife and I finally saved up enough coins to take
a trip over to Europe. My family gave two soldier, two Army Air Corps
soldiers to World War Two and their resting place is in [San a bow?],
France. And I had seen pictures of the graves and been told stories
about them as I grew up, and I just wanted to see what it looked like
over there. And I have to say I went over there with mixed emotions
because I'd heard so much about, &quot;They don't respect what our
country gave to Europe and to Asia and to other places in these
wars.&quot; We landed and rented a car. We drove across country to [San
a Bow?], France and located the entrance to the cemetery. And this was
in December, it was cold. Europe is cold in December. And we pulled up
and parked, walked up to the entrance. Nice modern-looking entrance,
very well kept. The big doors opened, doors something like these doors
on our chamber here. And I went inside and there was a gentleman who
came walking up and introduced himself, he was a retired British Army
Sergeant. And he was employed by our country to run that cemetery. And
he said, &quot;Whom are you here to visit?&quot; And I said, &quot;We're
here to visit the [ Peretty?] brothers.&quot; And he said, &quot;Follow
me, I know exactly where they are.&quot; We walked to another set of big
doors, and those doors opened. December, cold, almost freezing weather,
and the greenest grass you could ever see, as far as you could see. It
looked like spring in North Carolina, it was so green. I couldn't
believe it. And sticking out of that grass as far as you could see,
white crosses as far as you could see. And he said, &quot;Follow me over
to a section [hill?],&quot; or whatever it was. And we walked with him
over there. He said, &quot;We have 17 pairs of brothers buried in this
section.&quot; And we walked down the little walkway and he said,
&quot;The [Peretty?] brothers rest here.&quot; There were flowers on
those two graves. There were flowers on some of the others, but there
were flowers on those two graves. And I couldn't imagine what that was.
I asked him if they had a program, if they happened to know someone was
coming, if they put flowers on. He said, &quot;We didn't know you were
coming.&quot; He said, &quot;But I can tell you what happens. There is a
family in this town that, ever since World War Two, when those two
soldiers were buried here, they have come on every holiday that is a
military holiday in America, they have come and put flowers on these two
graves. And somehow they found out that you two were coming, and they
came today and put them there.</p>

And, so when we got back home I couldn’t get over that, and so I started
asking some questions of some of my relatives and they said, “Oh yeah,
that’s the family over in France, and they’re now in their fourth
generation of doing this.” The ones who started in World War II, putting
in there after World War II, have died away but that family has
continued this tradition just for those two soldier and others do, many
more. Every holiday, they remember, and they put a flower on there. I

[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sometimes one feels the need to steal the words of
others, and this is an old ballad. “His forty dollars on the drum for
those who’ll volunteer to come, enlist, and fight the foe today. Over
the hills and far away.” Veterans are people that wrote a check, payable
to the United States of America. “When duty calls me I must go to stand
and face another foe but part of me will always stay, over the hills and
far away.” The value of that check is for any amount up to and including
the life of the writer. “If I should fall, to rise no more, as many
comrades did before, and ask the fifes and drums to play, over the hills
and far away.” The names we have listed here today and the others in
that long line are the people to whom that check was presented and who
honored it with all that they had. I commend the resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. If not the
question before the House is the adoption of the House committee
substitute to House Bill 169. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote
no. The Clerk will open the vote. The Clerk will allot the machine
record the vote. 111 having voted in the affirmative, none in the
negative. The House committee substitute to House Resolution 169 has
been adopted and ordered printed. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, if
all members will be seated except for members who have served in our
armed forces, please stand, and the members in the gallery, any member
in the gallery who’s actually served in the military please stand.
Members, let’s show them all our gratitude. Representative Mobley,
please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Inquiry of the Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady may state her inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would like to know if all of the comments made today
could be spread over the journal.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So ordered. Members if you have prepared comments if
you will submit them to the Clerk. If you do not, we’ll have them
transcribed from the audio record.</p>

Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon, everybody.  Senate Bill 189 is
simply the companion piece to HB 230, which we passed in February, 118
to nothing.  It amends the law defining home schools. I’ll give you a
real quick rundown. I don’t want to take away from today.  It’s been a
moving a few minutes here.  Senate Bill 189: It gives parents more tools
to choose from when educating their children in core subjects. It offers
them online course such as SA Pathways; allows a friend, neighbor, or
family member to teach a subject in a core subject area; allows
important instruction offered to home-schooled students with learning
disabilities by trained professionals; and allows home school parents to
take advantage of future education when they are developed.  The parents
always are in control of the curriculum.  That’s something I wanted to
say.  I simply ask that we commend the bill and we concur with the
Senate.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Adams, please state your purpose.

changes to this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There are no changes.  It’s the exact same bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’re welcome.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

can we have you all come to the front of the chamber, please? To those
of ??, please step down.  Pages, I want to thank you for your service to
the House this week.  We’ve had a fairly light week as things go.  We
had a few debates along the way. I hope you were able to learn something
in the committee work, moving through the chamber.  I hope you had a
good time.  I hope you had a chance to meet a few people and make
friends. I hope you will bring your experience back to your family
members, your brothers and sisters and friends, and encourage them to
come and serve with us.  I think we’re getting pretty close to some end
of school years here. I know a lot of you are sad about that, but I hope
you’ll make the best of your free time in the summer.  We thank you very
much for serving this week.  Members, let’s show our appreciation.
Again, thank you.  You may now return to your stations. Ladies and
gentlemen, we have caucus to recognize.  The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Agriculture and rule caucus. March 2013, the caucus adopted bylaws and
voted on chairs and co-chairs as follows.  Chairs: Representative J.H.
Langdon and Senator Brent Jackson. Vice Chair:  Senator Norman Sanderson
and Representative Jimmy Dixon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Noted. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, just for planning purposes,
after the weekend and next week, we will have a no-vote skeleton session

feel free to do so. I will not be one of them.  We will have no votes.</p>

Doing that because by Constitution we have to meet at least one time and
therefore we will not have a skeleton session on Monday. I’m also told
that at this time we really only have a handful of bills that we need to
take up on Tuesday, and so the Chair’s decided we will also have a
skeleton session on Tuesday. Now, that’s good news and bad news. The
good news is you won’t be distracted by walking into the Chamber on
Tuesday. The bad news is there is a lot of committee work including
committee announcements for Finance and Appropriations. So, if you’re
not on Finance or Appropriations, you’ve got a pass. To my knowledge,
I’m the only one who’s not on Finance or Appropriations. So, we do
encourage you to try and get in and participate in the committee
meetings, but there will be no session that you need to prepare for or
even appear for on Tuesday. Then, we’ll probably be back to a regular
calendar, a limited calendar. Again, I have deferred to Representative
Dollar. If there is a committee meeting set for Appropriations sometime
after this session time is set then you can count on the fact that that
session will be limited so that we can carry on the prompt execution of
those meetings. In other words, we will not go over substantially next
week, indifference to the Appropriations Committee Chairs.
Representative William Brawley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For an announcement, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is an announcement. The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Since we’ll all be here for Finance and
Appropriations, the House committee on transportation will meet at noon
on Tuesday.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have something here I wanted to- I’d like to ask
that the members of the North Carolina General Assembly basketball team
would please stand, if they can. And I would also like to ask if our
cheerleaders would stand. I would like to also note that the Speaker of
the House is standing, and he is a member of the basketball team as
well. And ladies and gentlemen, I just wanted to announce that the
trophy for the Carolina’s Basketball Championship is back in North
Carolina where it belongs as of last night. I want to thank everybody
that participated. I want to thank our team that we just mentioned
including our four Senators and our honorable Governor. They
participated as well if you were there. I want to thank all of our fans
that came out and supported us. It was, I think a good time was had by
all. I do want to once again thank the folks at North Carolina State
University and Reynolds Coliseum. They were absolutely wonderful and
really hosted a tremendous event for us. I want to thank our friends and
competitors that came up from South Carolina and made the trip, and we
had good fellowship with them, before and after the game and during as
well. I also wanted to mention many of you participated with the food
bank, and I want to thank everybody that did that. I am told from the
leader from the food bank that we raised enough food and donation last
night to provide for more than two thousand meals for people in our
state. And I think that was a good cause. And finally, Mr. Speaker, I’m
not going to mention all of our players, but I do want to especially
thank our team captain, Representative Holloway. I can tell you he did
so much work behind the scenes. If it had not been for Representative
Holloway, this thing would not have happened so thank you to him, and
we’re happy to have the trophy back in North Carolina. And let’s plan to
keep it here for a while. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, one thing I would observe having been at the
game, the cheerleaders did a great job. The members did a great job. It
was interesting, too, that in the first half, everybody was up and
running and cheering, and in the second half, there were a few people
kind of not running and cheering quite so much. Towards about the end of
the second half, I actually saw players playing from the bench and
cheerleaders cheering from the bench, but it was a great time.
Representative Faircloth, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To make an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to announce that the JBS Appropriations
sub-committee will meet at ??</p>

30 on Tuesday the 28th. We also will meet again Tuesday afternoon and
just watch your email and we'll notify you what time that will be. Will
be in our regular room. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further notices and
announcements. Representative Jordan, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Point of personal privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized for a point of personal privilege. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Memorial day is a federal holiday that
occurs every year on the final Monday of May.
It's a day to remember the men and women who died while serving the
United Stats Armed Forces. Formerly known as Decoration Day, it
originated after the American civil war, to commemorate the union of
confederate soldiers who died then. By the 20th century, Memorial Day
had been extended to honor all Americans who have died while in the
military service. And it typically marks the start of summer vacation
season while Labor Day marks its end. This weekend I'll be attending
Memorial Day celebrations in my district, and I hope you will in yours
as well. Although this year it falls on May 27th, very often, Memorial
Day falls on May 26th. May 26th is an auspicious date. In 1538, the city
of Geneva expelled John Calvin and his followers. In 1805, Napoleon
Bonaparte assumed the title of king of Italy. In 1864, Montana was
organized as US territory.
In 1868, a hundred years from a certain date, the impeachment trial of
US president Andrew Johnson ends with Johnson having been found not
guilty by one vote. In 1896, Nicholas the second became Czar of Russia.
In 1940, in World War II, the battle of Dunkirk occurred, and the allied
forces began a massive evacuation from Dunkirk France. 1972, the United
States and the Soviet Union signed the anti-ballistic missile treaty.
And in 1962, the honorable representative from Rockingham county, Dr.
Burt Jons, my seatmate behind me, was born. Representative Jons and I
seem to share many things in common. Except he's older. His last name,
Being J-O-N, and mine being J-O-R, we're often seated next to each other
in committee.
Our voting records are very similar. In fact last session, there were
identical until late in the long session. I don't recall what he voted
wrong on, but I'm sure it was an honest mistake. We're primary sponsors
together on many bills, and on even more you'll find us as co-sponsors
together. We both have one son, and one daughter. It seems that we find
similarities every week. So I just want to ask Chamber, to recognize his
birthday, which will be Sunday, May 26th. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jons is recognized for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Now it's my turn. You know,
often times when you have a birthday coming up, it's kind of a time that
you reflect back in, and you reflect back on times of your early
childhood, if you will. So I want to take you back for a few moments, if
you will, back to the late 1960s. A time of my early childhood. You know
it was a time that the world was changing. Technology was advancing.
America put a man on the moon, one small step for man, one giant leap
for mankind. You think about the world with sports, things were
changing. The American Football League came of age. The Jets made good
on Joe Nemechek's promise to win the Superbowl. The miracle Mets won the
world series and for a young Tarhill fan such as myself, there was a
young coach named Dean Smith that took his Tarhills to the third
straight NCAA final four, only to see UCLA win the title once again as
they did for many years.
Now representative Jordan has already told you about things that have
happened on May 26th over the years. But I just want to tell you of a
few things that you may not be aware of that happened, perhaps, with a
little extra zest, if you will, in the lives of some of our members here
during that time in the late '60s. For instance, you may not be aware
that young Pat Hirley won her school systems contest for best cursive
writing. Now while most of the other third graders were learning to play
checkers, young Tom Tillis was playing chess. And the youngest student
ever to win the county wide chess championship in his school system.
My friend Jaime Bowls got his driver's license about that time driving
his Hirsch flawlessly. A passenger in the back of the Hirsch never
complained once. Two of our own gave member...</p>

Speeches at their graduations that your high school, Alexander recited
Lincoln's famous Gettysburg Address at his graduation. Skip Stam recited
the Magna Carter at his. Young Pricey Harrison attended the Sierra club
camp for the first time. She met teenager Chuck McGrady who was serving
on staff. Beginning a journey that would later lead him to start his own
camp. And our own Deborah Ross, graduated as valedictorian of her
kindergarten class, for her reward her family honored her request to
take the family summer vacation to Woodstock. And on May 26th as I was
celebrating my sixth birthday and [??] was just a few miles down the
road, my friend Jonathan Jordon was born. I'm proud to share my birthday
with him and count him as my friend. if you would please join me in
wishing Representative Jonathan Jordon happy birthday.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Michaux please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The house will come to order, then gentleman is
recognized for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I will not be as loquacious as the two gentlemen who
appeared before me, but I would ask that you find the square root of 48,
divided by the Q root of 35, add it to 364, divide it by 5, subtract
from that 83, and on May the 27th you will know my seat mates age.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Shepard please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For a matter of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for a point of personal
privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think I've already been outdone by representative
Jordon here and representative Burr [??] but anyway, I did want to say
my seatmate was born in tar heel red and will be tar heel blue until the
day he is dead, but he's not dead yet so there's no reason for
representative Bowes [SP] or Alexander to rush right over. However he is
another year older so with that being said, happy birthday from your
seatmate [??].
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further notices and announcements.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam is recognized from representative
Moore's desk.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker I move that the house do now adjourn to
reconvene on Friday May 24th at 9:00 A.M.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore moves, seconded by
representatives Jones, Jordon and Adams that the house will now adjourn
to reconvene on Friday May 24th at 9:00 A.M. All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
