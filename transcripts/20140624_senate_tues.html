Association, North Carolina Bar association and the North Carolina
Academy of Trial Lawyers, and whereas Martin Luther Nesbitt Jr. served

Assembly where he represented the citizens of Buncombe County for 31
years, and whereas Martin Luther Nesbitt Jr. was appointed to fill the

<p id="010:00">
five terms in the senate from 2004 to 2014. Whereas, as a state
representative, Martin Luther Nesbitt Jr. served as co-chair of the
Appropriations Committee under House Speaker, Dan Blue and the Joint
Select State Health Insurance Committees and was a member of several
other committees including, courts, gestures, constitutional amendments
and referendum, finance, judiciary two, science and technology, and the
Joint Legislative Commissions on government operations. Whereas Senator
Martin Luther Nesbitt Jr. served as both senate majority and minority
leader was chair of the Judiciary One Committee and the Select Committee
on economic recovery, and vice chair of the Senate Appropriations
Committee on health and human services and mental health and youth
services. And a member of several other senate committees including,
appropriations, base budget, commerce, education, higher education,
finance, health care, and rules and operations of the senate. Whereas,
Senator Nesbitt was described by Senator Dan Blue as a giant figure
having a sense of mountain popularism that ran through him, and he
sensed that his major charge was to look out for the average, every day
person. As a leader, he came to work every day with the same values,
stick up for the little guy, fight to give every North Carolinian a
meaningful education, quality health care and a chance for good jobs and
never back down from a fight. Whereas, Representative Susan Fisher
remembers speaking with Senator Nesbitt. She and I both spoke of the
honor of holding the seat once held by the first woman elected to the
North Carolina legislature, Lilliam Exum Clement. For me it was also an
honor to have been appointed to the seat held by Martin Nesbitt, a man
from the mountains who worked every day to improve the lives of his
people. Whereas, during his ten years in the general senate, Senator
Nesbitt became the body's expert in the area of health and human
services, especially Medicaid. Whereas, Senator Nesbitt was instrumental
in reforming the state's mental health care system and providing health
care for those in need and children's programs like the Children's
Health Insurance Program, CHIP. Whereas, concern for his beloved Western
North Carolina, Senator Nesbitt sponsored the Clean Smokestacks Act,
promoted rich law legislation, worked to secure funding for the North
Carolina Arbitrary ?? and helped to start Advantage West, which has
promoted economic development in Western North Carolina for over  20
years. Whereas, some of Senator Nesbitt's other accomplishments include,
helping to create the Western North Carolina Agricultural Center,
upgrading facilities at public schools, and providing access to quality
universities and community college. Whereas, Senator Nesbitt was an
advocate for the Mountain Area Health Education Center, MAHEC, and a
leader on health issues across the state as demonstrated by his work
with the MAHEC Nurse Practitioner Certificate Program, and through his
support of the creation of the Center for Healthy Aging. Whereas,
Senator Nesbitt was a supporter of the Eastern Band of the Cherokee
Indians who deemed him a friend and an ally and dedicated servant of
North Carolina. Whereas, Senator Nesbitt also served in many capacities
on a number of boards and commissions including, as a member of the
North Carolina Child Health Tax Force and North Carolina Center for
Nursing Advisory Council, as chair of the Holocaust Education Program
and as director of the Buncombe County Unit of the American Cancer
Society Remediation Center and the Western North Carolina Chapter of the
Alzheimer's Association. Whereas, Senator Nesbitt enjoyed his work at
the North Carolina General Assembly, but he also enjoyed what North
Carolina gave him: NASCAR. He was an avid race fan. He saw an
opportunity to bridge his love for NASCAR with his senatorial work by
organizing the General Assembly Pit Crew Challenge. It's only fitting
that he will have a race in his honor, the Senator Martin Nesbitt
Memorial Race at Newport Motor Speedway on June 21st, 2014. Senator
Nesbitt has been a supporter of the speedway</p>

...a part of Southeast Super Truck Series where he supported his son,
Mark's racing efforts, and then his grand-daughter, Taylor, racing
career. Newport Motor Speedway has dubbed him our racing representative.
And whereas Senator Nesbitt was a member of the St. Louis Episcopal
Church and whereas Senator Nesbitt was a devout family man and fair but
tough statesman, who served the State of North Carolina with
extraordinary dedication and tenacity, and whereas Senator Nesbitt died
on March the 6th, 2014, at the age of 67. But the day before he died,
returned to Asheville to a hero's welcome. Riding in an ambulance
escorted by sheriff deputies as well wishers lined the road waving Get
Well Soon signs and American flags. Whereas Senator Nesbitt leaves, to
cherish his memory, his wife of 35 years, Deane Nesbitt, a son Martin
Nesbitt, a stepson Chad Nesbitt, a sister Mary Ann Dotson-Silvey, and
two grandchildren.
Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Senate, the House of
Representatives concurring, Section 1, the General Assembly honors the
memory of Martin Luther Nesbitt, Jr. and expresses the appreciation of
this state and its citizens for the services he rendered.
Section 2, the General Assembly extends its deepest sympathy to the
family of Martin Luther Nesbitt, Jr. for the loss of a beloved family
member.
Section 3, the Secretary of State shall transmit a certified copy of
this resolution to the family of Martin Luther Nesbitt, Jr.
Section 4, this resolution is effective upon ratification.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Blue is recognized to speak to the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President and my colleagues in the
Senate. It's appropriate that we pause today, I think, to remember and
celebrate the life of Martin Nesbitt. A dear friend who we all knew
well. As I said at Martin's funeral and the more I reflect on it now,
the more I realize that he better than any individual I've known over my
lifetime, embodied that directive in the Old Testament, Book of Habakkuk
where the Lord told the Prophet rate the vision and make it plain so
that a runner can curry the correct message.
And as I reflect on it I don't think any of us can remember or know of
anyone who had a clearer vision of what we can be in North Carolina, who
articulated it so clearly and who carried it so forcefully. You've heard
a lot read in the resolution and it really does describe a man who
dedicated more than half of his life to this General Assembly and the
people of North Carolina. And you can get to the heart of what people
really feel about someone by the way they describe him and remember him.
Immediately following Martin's death, I read the news coverage from
around the state of various papers. Those in western North Carolina, as
well as eastern North Carolina. They gave incredible tributes to Martin
along the lines of what has been read in the resolution. And those
stories that were told across the state generally show Martin or
illustrate him as a forward thinking leader, a determined champion for
the little guy. And somebody who was a valued friend to people all
across this state.
Now, the interesting thing, Senator Allran and I, along with about 20,
25 other people got elected to the General Assembly, to the House, in
1980. Martin Nesbitt was elected in 1980 and in that class of 1980 there
ended up being four speakers, all of the Democratic speakers over the
last quarter of a century came from that class. A lieutenant governor, a
labor commissioner and an appellate judge. And even among those people,
Martin Nesbitt was like a redwood Sequoia among saplings. And he
instantly stood out when he got here and started providing leadership
for a quarter of a century or more for this state.
As we talk about Martin's accomplishments against that backdrop they
seem even more remarkable. He thought that we could be a national leader
in education and went about trying to show the...</p>

<p id="020:00">
...we could, in fact, do that. He thought that we could improve the
quality of life for all of the people in this state and he went about
doing that. And he though that we could improve the quality of life for
a lot of people who couldn't do it on their own. That's why he became
such a great champion of mental health and mental illness and dedicated
a substantial portion of his career, not only in the House but here in
the Senate, and making sure that we did what we should do by this
vulnerable group in or population.
You know, you heard all of the great things he did but one thing that
stands out. He figured early on, even before some of you fellows, that
the Commerce Department wasn't working for western North Carolina. And
started supporting this group, Advantage West, which became a model on
which we developed the sense of economic development, a theory of
economic development on a local level. And suggested that a centralized
approach by the Commerce Department with one shoe fits all mentality
simply would never deliver the jobs to the places in the state that need
it the most. That it would be those who are already have that would keep
getting more if we kept going business as usual.
And those who know Advantage West, certainly Senator Apodaca and Senator
Davis and now Senator Van Duyn and the others who come from that part of
the state, know the tremendous value that it played in converting that
region's economy and moving to other kinds of economic development
models.
But the other thing that I point out about Martin is that he seemed to
have combined honest, is his feeling about education, his feeling about
what he owed to the people of this state. His parents were both public
educators and so that became part of his DNA and he spent his career,
pretty much, advocating for education. Whether it was his efforts to
increase teacher pay and state employees pay because he thought that
they should be more appreciated. Whether it was his effort as we, for
the last time, increased the pay of state legislators in 1994. And he
sort of felt that there ought to be some connection between one's
ability to work hard and give service to his people and what people
thought about them.
I believe that Martin knew that, also, that government could help
people. That it wasn't always in the way, it wasn't always impeding
progress. But aimed in the right direction it could help people overcome
some of the impediments that they may have had, whether they had been
put upon or whether they had the misfortune to have been in the wrong
place or born in the wrong way.
I had the pleasure of working with Martin for 30 plus years and in that
time I saw first hand his determination to do right by his constituents
from western North Carolina, but also his constituents across this
entire state. The state has changed since Senator Allran, Senator
Nesbitt and I came to the legislature in 1980. It's grown a lot. The
challenges are somewhat different, but it is still the place where
Martin Nesbitt's voice rings out that we can do more for our economy. We
can do something to transition us better from an economy of the past,
whether it was dependent on tobacco or textiles, or furniture or
manufacturing. And do the things that make this economy one that's for
the future.
And I say that Martin had a grand vision, not as if he was the only one
alone who developed it. As we moved over our progress over the years,
Martin alone with other leaders in this state over the last three
decades, realized that if we were going to make the vision plain and
articulate it, that you had to come to work every day with the same
values. You did have to stick up for the little guy because at the end
of the day he's the one who will make the state the greatest it can be.
You did have to advocate for education for everybody, not just those who
may be privileged, know how to study and to get by early, but for every
single individual in this state.
And Martin, as I talked to some of the people who served with us early,
really did love to fight anybody who didn't have those values. And he
would stick up for those things. And speak out until the wee hours of
the morning. We have been the beneficiary of Martin's great record,
because he often reminded us how things got the way they were and how we
ought to think about how they are and how they were before we decide to
willy-nilly change them. I believe that Martin Nesbitt was...</p>

Separated from this pack of those of us who came in 1980. Because he was
loyal also, to his people and to his friends. There was never anything
bad that I know of associated with Martin, certainly no scandal. Martin
had outrageous ambitions for the people of the state. He never had
personal outrageous ambitions. In fact, he gave his time freely for it,
nearly 35 years, at a great sacrifice to benefit the people of this
state. And, lastly, I talk about Martin as a friend. You know, you heard
it revered that he liked spending time with his family. And he did. I
didn't drive from Ashville to Raleigh every Sunday night or Monday
morning. It used to be every Sunday night, as we started on Monday for
thirty plus years, eight hours on the road each week. Coming down here
for study committees and all of that. And so it adheres to be
challenging on one's ability to spend quality time with his family, but
Martin mastered that. And the time with his son Mark, who grew up around
us and his granddaughter and his wife, who's valuable time. And he made
sure that he did that and that's that kind of loyalty that made Martin
the strong man that he was. And one that we can all count as a friend.
We found an expression that Martin always shared with us, was that, you
know, you can't heat things up too quickly but if people aren't doing
what they ought to do, if you put a blow torch to their backside, sooner
or later they'll start moving and you can get them down the road, where
you'll need to get them. You know, as well as I do,  that Martin knew
how to put a blow torch on many folk when he though they weren't going
in the direction we'd ought to go. So, Mr. President, I command this
resolution to you. I'm proud to be one of the sponsors of it and I'm
proud to have called Martin Nesbitt a friend and as importantly, a great
servant and a great citizen of North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you senator Blue. Are there any further discussion or debate?
Senator Stein, for the purpose of your aye's.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak in favor of the resolution honoring Martin Nesbitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, you have the floor to speak to the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. It's with affection and sorrow that I rise.
Affection for Martin Nesbitt,
in the unique, one of a kind person that he was and sorrow for having
this tribute come years before it should have. Martin, of course, was a
man of the mountains. The land, the altitude, the climate, but most
importantly the people of Bunken County, shaped who he was and how he
saw the world. There wasn't a pretentious bone in Martin's body. He
treated everyone with respect for the simple reason that he respected
everyone. Since he's passed I've had the privilege to have a number of
people, be they staff folks, lobbyists, other members. Come up to me and
share their sentiments, even members of the press and many of them did
so with tears in their eyes. We all got to see the tribute that was paid
to him that was referenced in the resolution, about all the volunteer
firemen from the time they hit I-77 west, going up the mountain, coming
out of the different exits and standing there with their ladders up in
the air with American flags. As Martin rode up, that last time, in the
ambulance, it was an unbelievable expression of affection and respect.
Martin was a unique representative. He absolutely loved legislating.
Think about what Dan just said. Thirty years coming down the mountain
four hours and back. What an incredible testament to his passion for
what we do here and the importance of that work on people's lives. We're
all by definition politicians. Issues come up. A lot of them are tough
issues. Our visions sometimes get clouded by the pull and tug of
different interests and the competing ideas. Martin, better than almost
anyone I knew had the ability to see through that issue with the clarity
and that clarity came because he lived through a lens. Well, he asked
himself, how is this going to effect working folks? Is this going to
make their lives better? Is this going to make their lives harder? And
he would be suspicious. Would it strengthen some big bureaucracy and
that bureaucracy to Martin could be large corporations but it could be
big governments, state government. He wanted to look out for the little
guy and he and I, on more than one instance banged heads. Didn't always
come out in public when we did it.    Well, I was one to do something
and he would push back and say, But how's this going to effect</p>

... a small businessperson. That’s what his touchstone was. He cared
about the work we do. In committee he would ask penetrating questions.
He’d want there to be a deliberative process. He was never comfortable,
whether it was under Democrats or Republicans, when bills sped through
committee. He wanted us to chew over, because as Dan said, the law in
the way it is for a reason, and it’s not always immediately apparent to
us, but he always knew that we do better when we ask ourselves the
question “Why is it the way it is?” He would talk to any and everyone
about his thoughts, often at length. He’d stand up on Senate floor and
speak. Sometimes you might recall he’d do it for a pretty long while,
but he’d do it with language, imagery and passion that resonated. My
wife Anna time and time again would just tell me when she’d hear some
snippet on the radio in the morning, “I love it when Martin Nesbitt
stands up there and speaks. He’s speaking in a way that I understand and
I share his values.” Martin loved this institution of the General
Assembly, both the House and the Senate. He understood that these
chambers are bigger than any one of us individually, and he understood
that we all play different roles – different role with if you’re on an
appropriations chair in the House or you’re Speaker Blue, for whom he
had the most profound respect, or as majority leader in the Senate, or
as minority leader in the Senate, and he would talk to us. When we had
that transition in 2010, it was uncomfortable for a lot of members,
particularly people who had been here for a little while and were used
to being in the majority, and he’d say “Guys, you’re not in the majority
anymore. You don’t have the votes to win. You have to understand what
your role is and continue to do the best you can for the people, but it
isn’t going to be the way it used to be. You have to find a new way to
have an impact that’s going to make people’s lives better.” No matter
what his role was, Martine put his heart and soul into doing work with
integrity. He very much enjoyed the comradery of his colleagues, both
Democratic and Republican. He used to love to sit and smile at Ellie
when Ellie would stand up and say whatever it was she was saying that
day. He genuinely enjoyed working with you, Senator Apodaca,
particularly when ya’ll were on the same side of whatever particular
mountain dispute that the rest of us didn’t understand. But even when
they weren’t, after the debate was over, Nesbitt would immediately walk
over and talk to Tom and shake his hand because for him, the policy
wasn’t personal. He understood Tom saw the world differently than he
did, and it was his role to stand up for his worldview, but at the end
of the day he always had a handshake for his colleagues. Martin
cherished his family. Nothing, I mean nothing made him happier than when
he got in his car to start driving up I40 to head home. He wanted to be
with Deane and he wanted to crew Mark’s races. Those races were always
job one. It didn’t matter what political gathering was going on, and I
got called to pinch hit at a number of them. If there was a race for
either Mark or Taylor, he was going to be at that race and I was going
to have to be wherever he wasn’t. That’s where Martin’s priorities were
because he lived his life by the right priorities in all the important
areas on his life, and for this reason, I wholeheartedly commend this
resolution that honors Martin, a man of the mountains, a one of a kind
legislature, a friend and a family man. Martin, we miss you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Stein. Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do
you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak to the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca has the floor to speak to the resolution. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. Members, it’s always difficult to
follow Dan or Josh, but when you have to follow them both, it’s very
difficult. Martin used to do the best job of that, by the way. He could
surmise what you two had said and bring it to terms us mountainfolk
could understand because we sometimes, as Josh said, speak a different
language. I’m reminded, before I married my grandfather was talking to
me and he said “I’ll tell you something, son. You may think I’m crazy
but you need to pay attention.” I said “What is it?” He said “You need
to marry somebody you enjoy arguing with because in order to last,
you’re going to have to walk away from an argument and still love the
person you argued with,” and he says “That may not seem like advice to
you now, but you’ll…</p>

learn as you get older it's good advice. Well, I think that surmises
mine and Martins relationship. We could argue but at the end of the day
I still enjoyed his company. And as we sat around here and Brunstetter
would be back here, there were two times we knew when we were gonna
catch it. The first time was when we heard for the life of me. And then
boom boom boom. We'd get laid into, and then he would wrap it up with
that's just mean spirited so if we knew we hit any one of those phrases
we had done something wrong in Martins eyes and we were being corrected
for it. But as we went on and Martin would want to keep talking about
something afterwards which sometimes he did, he didn't finish on the
floor, he wanted to finish later. I found the secret weapon and that was
to ask about his granddaughter and he would change like that. We'd talk
racing and Martin I have to be honest with you she past you in his eyes
I'm sorry. But that's ok. He loved to talk about racing especially with
his granddaughter. But he turned that last lap and went across the
finish line and they raised that checkered flag. He's up there telling
us to wrap it up enough's been said he don't want to hear anymore. But
we miss him in this chamber I think everybody will admit to that, we
miss him everyday. So, I know he's up in heaven, leading some meeting
about something that may need to be changed and putting his opinion out
there and he and the all mighty will probably have some interesting
discussions. I think Martin will get a say but I do recommend this
resolution to you. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Senator Apodaca. Senator
Allran what ??? [SPEAKER CHANGE] Speak on the resolution [SPEAKER
CHANGE] Senator Allran has the floor to speak to the resolution [SPEAKER
CHANGE] Thank you Mr. President. As Senator Blue has mentioned the three
of us served from the 1980's session on. So I served with Martin all 31
years he was in the legislature and I remember so well serving in the
house at that time. Sitting on the very back of the chamber as
Republicans did when there weren't very many of us at all over there.
The new representative coming in from Asheville who was replacing his
mother who had passed away and I thought that was a really interesting
thing and I was fascinated by the thought of that and I've followed him
every since, his career and I have to say it was really distressing to
and shocking to find out that he was fatally sick and that he would pass
away in such a short period of time it was quite a shock and quite
awful. But I always liked talking to Martin at different occasions when
I would be able to do that for example at lunch or whatever. Because he
was so independent. And he really he certainly was not a republican
obviously. But he was not exactly a democrat either. He was a populist
and he always made his own way and saw things his own way. Nobody ever
told him how to do anything. Whatever he wanted to do is exactly what he
did. He had a great institutional memory. He had a really good sense of
humor. Even as opposition leader he was never bitter and he never had a
mean spirit. I jotted down a few of his character traits that I not only
appreciated and liked but that I admired and that I do admire. His
independent spirit, his populist principles, his honesty, his integrity,
his intelligence, his oratorical skills, and I think more than anything
else probably his courage to be his own man. He was just unique. Like
the other speakers have said and like I know all of us feel all together
I know corporately and individually we certainly do miss Martin Nesbitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Senator Allran. Senator Van Duyn for the
purpose of ?? [SPEAKER CHANGE] To speak to the resolution. [SPEAKER
CHANGE] Senator Van Duyn you have the floor to speak to the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Martin Nesbitt was my senator. I met with him a number
of times about issues that I felt passionately about and he always
listened carefully and with respect and he always returned my phone
calls. Surprisingly, he didn't always agree with me though but I never
doubted that he</p>

Senator 1: I had the best interest of these people and is not (??) hard…
Just recently I attended a drug court graduation and there was a woman
there who spoke very passionately about a program (women at ??) that
turned her life around. It made me smile because I remember how
passionate he fought for that program.
Thanks to senator Apodaca we have a more permanent memorial to his
memory. I know he’d be very proud to know that our new stand school will
be named in his honor.
Each time I enter the senate chamber, I remember senator Nesbitt and his
love for his people and these mountains and I‘m inspired to try to live
up to his example.
It is my privilege to invite you all to the reception when we recess
this afternoon. It will be held in the 110 court immediately following
this, and we will be honoring his family. Thank you very much.
B: Thank you, senator. Senator Robinson what purpose is your aye?
Senator Robinson: To speak to the resolution
B: Senator Robinson has the floor to speak to the resolution
S. Robinson: Thank you Mr. Cheer(?). Ladies and gentlemen, I had
strangely enough said with senator Apodaca and senator Rucho the other
day (??) the three of us were just talking the usual junk, but the
common piece was how much we miss Martin. And I truly miss Martin. One
of the pleasures of coming in to the general assembly was that when I
first decided that I’d like to serve in this wonderful body is when
Martin came to meet with me. Of course Katy Doors is my predecessor and
I have a lot of respect for her. But there was nothing like the rich
that Martin is behead. He made everybody feel important. He came with
knowledge; he came with information; he came to share. But he also came
to encourage. And I think that all of you would say that regardless of
the party; regardless of the gender, the race the religion, the
anything, Martin always made everybody feel they were somebody. It
didn’t matter about status or anything. And that’s the way he embraced
all of us, I’m sure, who are here today and he got to know you. I said
at a recent memorial “Martin was a gentle giant.” I’m really short. And
he was really tall, so you can imagine looking up. But with all of the
status; all of the knowledge; all of the years of understanding the
legislature; having been in the position of power and not so much power
later: it never changed him. He is still (??) everybody feels that what
you thought was just as important. May not appear that much knowledge
but what you thought was important.
And he never used his knowledge or his power to make anybody feel little
or to blow you away. And that’s what humility is about for Martin.
Martin was humble. He cared about people; he cared about the little
people; he cared about the people up there. And that how we remember him
say “My folks…(??)” or “my folks up there.”
And we knew where that was going when he was talking about it. But it
gave you a sense of the people he served. And then this people would
come to rally, whether they were teachers or unemployed, or about
(hill??) or middle hill. He still made everybody feel important. And
their concerns were his concerns. What I think about, often times, we
move around and we say, and I said to Dan, (Soucek) Dan: “we sure miss
Martin, don’t we?” And certainly Dan is a great person. I’ve been
knowing him a long time too.  And that Martin is been in a special trace
whether you as a Republican, or me as a Democrat, or you as a man, and
me as a woman, or regardless of African-Americans, Caucasian,
native-Americans, Hispanics, who ever it is, if you talk to people
across the stay as they talk to you, they’ll ever reflect that if they
ever met Martin or heard what he said on the floor..</p>

watched the television or whatever, they felt the caring that he had and
the love he had for North Carolina. Martin genuinely loved North
Carolina and always wanted it to be the very best place that offered the
best quality of life for everybody. So, I am so grateful to you, Dan and
Josh and Tom, for presenting this resolution, for having it here, and to
his family, for sharing him with us. All of us you don't know, and I met
some of you at the funeral. But, we're so grateful for you sharing
Martin with us so that we could understand what we should aspire to be.
So, I commend the resolution to you.
Speaker Changes: Thank you, Senator. Senator Graham, for what purpose do
you arise?
Speaker Changes: To speak to the resolution.
Speaker Changes: Senator Graham, you have the floor to speak to the
resolution.
Speaker Changes: Thank you. When I was first elected to the state senate
in 2004, Senator Blue was very instrumental in helping me get here, and
one of the first individuals--I don't know if he remembers this--he told
me I needed to talk to was a guy by the name of Martin Nesbitt. I called
Martin to say, &quot;I'm from Charlotte, and I'm coming to Raleigh, and
I was told that I needed to talk to you.&quot; He said, in his own way,
&quot;Well, you know what, I'm going to be that way tomorrow.&quot; I
said, &quot;Why don't you stop by the house?&quot; He did. On his way
back, we spent two hours on my deck, and he gave me a lesson on the
general assembly. I defeated an incumbent, by the way, Fathom Odom, and
he said, &quot;You're in trouble.&quot; [laughs] He kind of laid out the
line for me in my caucus as well as what's happening in the general
assembly. I think Gladys was right in a way that it was Politics 101,
everything you needed to know about the general assembly, but you were
afraid to ask. Martin made it very clear, very precise, and very point,
in terms of, &quot;This is what you need to know and this is what you
need to do.&quot; That relationship...He was a House member, and I'm a
senator. When he came to this side, it really made an impact on me just
watching him in terms of being an honest broker. I think you're right.
He was a Democrat, no doubt about it. But, he was an honest broker in
terms of trying to do what was right on behalf of the citizens of this
state. He was really more interested in the policy than the politics. He
just wanted to make sure that every individual across this state,
democrat, republican, black, white, rich, poor, young, old had a better
tomorrow. That their tomorrow was better than their today. His spirit
still resides in this chamber. I spoke with Martin. It's about February,
early February, and he called and said, &quot;How's thing going on the
trail?&quot; We spoke about thirty minutes on the phone and, he
encouraged me. He gave me some advice and sent me on my way. Thirty days
later, I got the news. He is gone from our presence, but he is not gone
from our spirit. He is here. As I leave and depart the Senate, I do so
in his memory and his honor. He was an honest broker and if we, as men
and women, of this senate and if we would kind of follow in his
footsteps and be more concerned about the policy than the politics,
North Carolina will be a great place to live as it is today. I commend
the resolution to you.
Speaker Changes: Thank you, Senator Graham. Any further discussion or
debate? Senator Davis, for what purpose do you arise?
Speaker Changes: To speak on the resolution.
Speaker Changes: Senator Davis has the floor to speak on the resolution.
Speaker Changes: Mr. President, members, and the family, Martin was a
true friend to us all. It went well beyond just the general assembly.
But, I too, remember when I first came, and we were experiencing an
issue with mental health and we didn't necessarily see eye to eye, but</p>

<p id="050:00">
he reached out to help me, and we actually found common ground and we
moved forward and pushed through the issue. And that was the person I
actually came to know, a person who's extremely helpful and listening to
the comments one thing that I would really emphasize is his ability to
not only hear you but to truly listen to what you were saying and hear
what you were saying, whether it was for the good or for the bad, he
would share his true thoughts. Now I can tell you, I truly believe that
we became friends and where I think I discovered we were friends, I
would call him and check in with him on certain things, and I had to
call a few times on the weekend and I called and he said &quot;Well, I'm
at the racetrack&quot;, so I felt especially that he took the call at
the racetrack. But not only did he fight for the little person, but he
looked for those fights. And there were so many exciting exchanges in
this chamber but one that a colleague and I were reflecting on yesterday
was we had a bill, some may remember, dealing with a moped and the
insurance. And you would think it was a simple bill, but they went round
and round and round on that bill, and at the end of the day his thought
was, &quot;You're kicking down the man who's down on his luck!&quot; And
that [??], Senator Apodaca. But he stood truly behind what he believed
in and the importance of that story is he fought there on that issue
with the same intensity, you'd thought it was the budget bill or
something else. He didn't back down, he didn't shy away. And one other
personal experience I would like to share is this reflection. I remember
one time we were heading to an activity and someone came literally and
walked up to us and asked us for a couple dollars, and right away Martin
pulls out his wallet right there, and opens it up and pulls out a
twenty, and I'm like &quot;Wow, so often we truly walk by.&quot;  But he
truly didn't walk by, and I'm reminded of the proverb: &quot;The one who
is gracious to the poor also lends to the Lord.&quot; And he allows us
to remember that as he lived as an example. I would say to our friend
yes, we miss him, I say to his family it's obvious he remains in our
thoughts and our prayers, and I just thank God that he stopped so that
we could have the opportunity to know him as we have and thank God that
the state of North Carolina was able to have a person in Martin Nesbitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Davis.
Any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, Sen. Berger, what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. To speak briefly on the resolution-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Berger you have the floor to speak to the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, I've like you listened to the comments and it's brought back a
lot of memories and I've tried to think through what was it about Martin
Nesbitt that really brings forward these kinds of memories. I think part
of it is probably longevity, folks that have been around for a long time
have memories that probably tend toward the more favorable things and
you sort of forget the tough times. Part of it is there's a lot of truth
to what folks had said about Martin. He was someone who was special,
there's no question about that. But I thought of one thing that he'd
said to me on several occasions that I think, at least for me, kind of
illustrates some of things people are saying. There are some things that
Republicans generally are for, some things they're against, some things
Democrats are generally for, some things Democrats are generally
against. And it wasn't unusual for Martin to have a conversation, at
least with me, and start out with &quot;Now you can't be for this,&quot;
because he sort of understood where we came from, or the kinds of things
that we did. He understood kind of the world view of the person who was
across from

And, that's a talent that is part of his personality that I think has
helped people in this chamber, who have very different worldviews, to
have fond memories oh Martin Nesbitt.  I'm reminded of one other thing
that I think is interesting.  The first time I heard that Martin
Nesbitt, liberal democrat, was an active participant in stock car
racing...now, maybe there's something wrong with me, but that just
didn't seem to fit.  I had a client, still a client, who also was
involved in stock car racing and he came to see me one day about a
particular issue and he said &quot;I know somebody and I work with him
on the stock car circuit.  We race against each other.&quot;  It was a
series where they apparently they went all over the country just about.
He talked about going to Florida and other places.  He talked about what
a great guy this person was and how they got along.  Now this client of
mine is not someone, no offense to the Democrats, who would go to a
Democratic Party meeting or anything of that nature.  But he truly
enjoyed Martin Nesbitt's company and Martin had a way of understanding
people, a way of working with other people so that, even if you had a
different worldview, your time with him was time that you felt was well
spent.  So I, like everyone else, commend this resolution to you.  I
think that, as Senator Allran and others have said, Martin's left us way
too soon but this resolution is something that is well-deserved.  I
commend it to you. [Speaker changes.]  Thank you, Senator Berger.  Do we
have any further discussion or debate.  Hearing none. Question before
the Senate is the passage of Senate Joint Resolution 882.  On its second

district, Senator Debbie Clary told me there was the first person I
needed to meet in Rutherford County and talked to. There was one person
that knew the entire county and was loved by the entire county, and that
was Robynn Spence. Robynn actually began her career in working in the
clerk’s office in Mecklenburg County. She came back to Rutherford
County. She worked in the clerk’s office there. She worked for the
sheriff’s office, the Department of Social Services, and one of the most
beloved members of the community that one could imagine. It was an honor
to work with Robynn, to campaign with Robynn, to be part of that. She
was elected Clerk of Court there in 2008. Earlier this year in February,
Robynn filed for reelection for Clerk of Court on Monday. Robynn passed
away on Sunday from complications of the flu. We will greatly miss this
incredible woman who served her community so graciously and with such
honor, and I would like to ask you all today as members of her family
are here and the Lieutenant Governor. I will recognize them just a
minute to stand with me honoring her and her family and what they mean
to western North Carolina. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Hise. Upon the motion of  Senator
Hise of Mitchell County, the Chair’s happy to extend courtesies of the
gallery to the family and the friends of Robynn Lowe Spence, Savannah
Spence, her daughter, Robby and Diane Lowe, the parents, Kim and Avery
Hodge, friends, and Senator Debby Clary as well from Rutherford County.
If you’re all with us, please stand and be recognized. Thank you for
being with us today.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So ordered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Abadaka you're still recognized to speak to the bill when you're
ready.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister President members. I'm going to hit the high notes of
this bill. I think all of us have studied it. um consid- quite a bit, I
think it is a change that is going have North Carolina leading the
country. As I've said before when it comes to getting rid of coal ash
and I think this bill does it in a way that's innovative in a way that
will be copied by others throughout this country. So, going down to high
points this bill will close all coal ash pawns in North Carolina by
within fifteen years. The first four to be removed will be Dan river
Asheville river bend in Sutton. The remaining sights will be classified
and now this is very important and I'm sure we will hear a lot about
this as we go thew this bill. Remaining sights will be classified as
high medium or low risk the clas- the classification must happen by
August of next year. Closure deadlines high risk rated pawns must be
closed no later than December first 2019, an immediate risk must be
closed no later than December first 2024, and low risk must be closed by
December first um 2029. This bill stops the disposal of wet coal ash it
requires utilities to convert their plants to dry ash handling. All
utility plants must faze out the generation of wet ash by the end of
2019. This bill sets standards for safe disposal of existing and future
ash, high risk in immediate pawns must be placed in a lined landfill or
put towards a beneficial use. High in- high and intermediate risk pawns
may not be caped and placed. Where they are, remember, cannot be caped
and kept where they are. Low risk utility may consider using capping and
place at low risk pawns if denner and the new um coal ash commission
approv-</p>

...the method. If capping is used the utility will be required to follow
landfill capping regulations as to closure and that also includes 30
years of water quality monitoring around that site. Future ash that is
generated will either be put to beneficial use or stored in a lined
facility. Coal Ash Commission will review risk classifications, as well
as the closure plans that are proposed by the utility. This commission
consists of nine people with diverse backgrounds including areas of
science, public health, waste management and conservation.
Additional regulatory positions. This bill creates, along with a
budgeting process, 40 new positions. Twenty-five will be in DNR and four
at the commission, five at the commission. That was a change. These
positions and the Coal Ash Commission's operating expense will be funded
by the utilities with the coal ash ponds and cannot, repeat, cannot be
passed on to consumers. This encourages smart solutions.
Folks, the bottom line is we've talked about this. We do not have enough
space in North Carolina to dispose of all the coal ash that has been
produced. So it is imperative that we come up with alternatives that can
help us dispose of this ash.
Senator Ford sent forth a very good amendment dealing with that and we
still have to build on it. And when we leave this room I want everybody
to remember that it's incumbent upon us to come up with other ways to
dispose of this. And for our future and cost and everything, we need
beneficial use of coal ash.
Structure fill. The bill strengthens the regulations on the use of coal
ash as a structure fill. Structure fill is a great way to use large
amounts of ash, but in the past, liners have not been required. From
this point on, large structure fill projects will be permitted and must
use a landfill grade liner and leaching system, as well as conduct long
term ground water monitoring. A one year moratorium exists on all
structure fill projects that are not using the liner already. So I think
they're only one of two in this state that are currently using the
liner.
Again, we want to talk about commercial use of ash and get the ash
converted so that, as what many of us have spoken to, some of the
concrete, asphalt people want to use this ash in their products. But it
is deficient in some of the qualities it needs to have for them to be
able to use it. We want to encourage that to be done.
This bill protects water quality. We're going to monitor these water
supplies for 30 years after this is in place to make sure we've
corrected the problem. You know, no unintended consequences.
This bill also strengthens our dam inspection laws and makes that
mandatory going forward with more frequent inspections and creation of
an emergency action plan to deal with something or a breach of the dam
so we don't encounter what we did at Dan River.
We have worked long and hard to develop this plan and I want to thank
staff for the work they have put forward and I recommend this bill to
you and I'll be happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do we have any discussion or debate? Senator Hartsell,
for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, I need to send forward an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hartsell, you can send forward your amendment.
The Clerk will read.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President, members of the Senate. I

of it since that time, and what you see before you is our best effort at
trying to encourage beneficial reuse in State projects along highways
and both vertical and horizontal structures. It is designed to direct
both the Dept. of Administration and DOT to develop technical
specifications for use, they can look at long term beneficial use of the
coal ash, and furthermore to look at any [??] costs associated
particularly with roads. Because  know that this can actually be
beneficial. I would be glad to try to answer any questions, I understand
that we've talked this over with any number of folks to come up with
something to further encourage the utilization of this- was actually a
fill commodity, that can be much more beneficially used in doing these
things as opposed to simply putting it into landfills. I commend it to
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are we having a discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Tucker, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to ask Sen. Hartsell a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Hartsell, so do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Hartsell, so I heard you use the word &quot;encourage&quot; twice,
is it better to &quot;require&quot; than to &quot;encourage&quot;, and
what were your thoughts on that sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, actually it does both. I think it's much more useful to require,
since we don't know the necessary impacts over all, we are directing
these two entities to develop the specifications for their use within
about six months, and they'll be reported back and then we can proceed,
because then we'll know what the quantities are, what the qualities are,
what it can be used for best, and that sort of things. But they are
directed to do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Apodaca for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the ammendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Apodaca has the floor to speak to the ammendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, members, I would like to thank Sen. Hartsell for bringing
this forward. He has worked diligently on this, as has staff to get to
fit into the bill and I recommend it to everyone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Hunt, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Sen. Hartsell a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Hartsell, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Hartsell, I understand as a concrete manufacturer in North Carolina
that imports large amounts of coal ash from other states, can you tell
us briefly why we can't use North Carolina's coal ash for concrete
manufacture?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We do not have enough at the present time to be able to use. The quality
of it is not sufficient. Hopefully, and in fact we do use about 3% of
the highways are currently used, are actually paved with concrete and
used the ash. But in order to get the quantities necessary, they have to
go out of state. Hopefully what we will do by addressing this in this
way, we will encourage the reproduction of the ash that we already have,
so that it's much more beneficial in these other beneficial reuse
situations. That's what this ammendment is designed to assist in.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Blue for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To make an announcement. I've sent forth to the clerk a rule 29 excuse
from voting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Also, Sen. Rabon is back in the chamber. Is there any further discussion
or debate?
Sen. Van Duyn, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Sen. Hartsell a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Hartsell, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Hartsell, my understanding is that one of the reasons that our coal
ash is not suitable for recycling into concrete is because of the
scrubbers we use causes ammonia to be infused with our coal ash. Would
your bill impact the air quality in North Carolina?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This ammendment should have absolutely no impact on air quality.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate?
Sen. Tarte, for what purpse do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the ammendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Tarte has the floor to speak to the ammendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a point of  clarification, perhaps we could verify this from our
geologists and so forth,  but I understand the reason we have difficulty
moving the coal ash is because of the carbon content and the scrubbing
processes that Duke Energy will be employing will enable us to reduce
the carbon level, which will increase our ability to add almost 300,000
metric tons

Ladies and gentlemen, there are a number of good things in this bill,
and I commend Senator Berger and Senator Apodaca for their work on it
along with our staff. There’s one critical question that I’d like to
speak on today in this legislation. That is who gets the bill. That is
the bill for cleanup of these coal ash [NO AUDIO 1:10 – 1:21] Ladies and
gentlemen, I would suggest to you that the responsibility for that lies
with the corporation and its shareholders. Duke has an obligation to
clean up these coal ash ponds all across the state. We’ve known that
coal ash, for a number of years, was a technology that was dying. Duke
had committed to close its plants on schedule, but yet the coal ash
ponds remained. Some of them were a flawed design. Let’s talk about the
Eden plant for just a minute. This is what sparked this bill, and so
much of our conversation over the last four months was the failure at
the Eden plant because it was a flawed design. When the pond was
expanded in the late ‘60s, the pond was expanded over a storm water
pipe, and we now learn that the pipe, even though Duke’s initial mission
was that it was a concrete pipe, we now learn that Duke in fact knew
that it had been a corrugated metal pipe and was a flawed design as far
back as the ‘60s, and it is Duke’s obligation to pay these and to share
that cost with its shareholders. I would also argue that we as the
General Assembly have an obligation as well to the rate holders of North
Carolina, to the people of North Carolina. You’ll hear it argued that
well, we should just let the process play out of allowing this to go to
the Rate Commission, that this is an out of the ordinary proposition,
this proposal, to have the rate payers pay, but I would suggest to you
that this is an out of the ordinary situation with a coal ash spill of
this size, the third largest in the country, and at the coal ash ponds
that we have. There’s precedent for having rate payers pay. We’re seeing
that in South Carolina. We’ve heard South Carolina over the past year
held up as an example in many ways, but two of the utilities in South
Carolina have agreed to pay for their ponds as well. Ladies and
gentlemen, we have an obligation as the General Assembly, as the policy,
lawmaking body of this state, to step up to this situation and to
protect the rights of the rate holders, of the customers of Duke Energy.
We have an obligation to the working families, to the small businesses
and to the senior citizens living on a fixed income who will face rate
increases with the cleanup of these ponds. With that Mr. President, I’d
like to send forward an amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, you can
send forward your amendment. The Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Woodard moves to amend the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Woodard is recognized to explain the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies
and gentlemen, this amends the legislation before you and lays out a
plan under which an electric public utility shall not recover from its
retail customers any of the costs associated with the cleanup of these
coal ash ponds, and I would commend this to you for some of the reason
that I outlined, but also to talk a little bit about the financing of
this. Duke has a number of different options available to it with the
financing. You’ve probably heard from some of Duke’s folks about the
cost of this to them as a corporation, but keep in mind…</p>

… that Duke has seen very strong profits, record profits, in 2013 – 2.7
billion dollar profit. In 2012, 1.8 billion dollar profit. They received
rate increases in 2013, and there are a number of options available to
Duke in paying for the cleanup of these ponds. A number of outside
analysts have looked – who were familiar with the electric industry –
have looked at Duke’s financial situation. They have cash reserves
available from operation flows in their corporation, adjustments to
their capital expenditure program. Duke has a capital expenditure
program that’s going to total somewhere between 16 and 20 billion
dollars budgeted through 2018. Their environmental capital expenditure
program is already budgeted at 5 to 6 billion dollars over the next 10
years. We’ve heard a lot of figures from Duke officials here, in the
media, and I’m sure in conversations with you about the cost. They’ve
begun planning for this and they have options for that. As one analyst
wrote in a well-respected publication on the energy industry, “In my
opinion, the associated cost will not have any significant impact on the
company’s long-term performance,” and he continues to rate Duke as a
viable company and as an important stock. Duke also has a plan to sell
some of its underperforming assets, particularly in the Midwest. All of
these will give Duke the flexibility it needs to absorb the cost of
removing these coal ash ponds, however we decide that’s going to be, and
to not pass the charge onto rate holders. Ladies and gentlemen, I
commend this amendment to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any discussion
or debate? Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. President, speak to the amendment please. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca has the floor to speak to the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. Members, Senator Woodard did a
wonderful job explaining the financial ramifications to Duke which could
happen if total cleanup came forth. I daresay, and I hope I don’t offend
any of my lawyer buddies in here, but probably only one or two people in
this room could understand exactly what he was talking about, getting
into the financial aspects of it. Senator Woodard himself, Senator Hise
probably understood, but they speak a language many of us don’t
understand, and that’s exactly why I don’t think we need this amendment.
I think that is what the Utilities Commission is charged with – to make
those decisions, to take all evidence, take all the financial
ramifications and make an informed decision on how this should be paid
for. Now let me clarify one thing.  It does say in this bill any spills
whatsoever, whether it be Dan River or God forbid another one going
forward, must be paid for directly by the utility. It cannot be passed
on to the consumer. In addition, this bill has a moratorium on it to
deal with questions of cleanup in going forward so we can make some
informed decisions as we go forth, so part of this is already covered;
the other part should be covered by the Utilities Commission which we’ve
already set up, which operates to my knowledge very well in this state.
I haven’t heard that many complaints about it. So with that being said,
I’d like to send forth a substitute amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you can send forward your substitute amendment. Clerk will
read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca moved to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca is recognized to explain the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President, members. This
amendment does two things. Number one, it deals with the prioritization
factors that DENR and the commission must look at when ranking sites. If
you’ll look at page 16 of the bill, it requires DENR to factor in any
hazard or a threat to public health, safety, surface water in
prioritizing impoundments. Must not just be an imminent hazard or
threat. DENR previously had a factor in imminent hazard…</p>

amendment also extends the post-closure care period of large structural
field projects from 20 years to 30 years. I recommend this amendment to
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any discussion or debate? Senator Stein, for what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein has the floor to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We all know what's happening here. You have before you
an opportunity to be clear to your voters, to the people of North
Carolina, to the rate payers, who was going to have to bear the cost.
Senator Apodaca started to explain why he thought the language in your
bill was better than Senator Woodard's amendment and I was actually
pretty impressed as an argument. I don't know those are the right
argument, but it was an argument.
So I thought he was going to give us the opportunity to actually vote on
that. But he hasn't. He's put forward the substitute amendment, which is
a couple, teeny little changes in a 40-page bill that don't amount to
much of anything. We all know it doesn't amount to much of anything. If
you vote for this amendment you are voting for the rate payers to have
to bear the cost of this coal ash clean up. Just understand that's the
consequence of this vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator
Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, to speak a second time on this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, this will be your first time since
the first time was introducing the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Thank you. I told you I wasn't good at math. I
appreciate it, Mr. President. Senator Stein says that I'm trying to
block something. Well, this was brought by Sierra Club in order to
strengthen our bill. And I don't think it's any small amendment that we
extend the monitoring of ground water around a large post-closure
structural field project from 20 to 30 years. So, goodness, I hope you
do support this amendment because it gives us some more protection.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do see if Senator Apodaca will yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, so you just made a compelling case in favor of
that amendment. One which I think we're all prepared to evaluate on its
own independent merits. My question to you is, will you remove it here
and then offer it as a stand alone amendment so that we, the members of
this chamber, have the opportunity to vote both for your idea and
Senator Woodward's idea?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Woodward, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Woodard has the floor to speak to the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I need a cold drink because Senator Apodaca's running
amendments for the Sierra Club so it's a red letter or maybe a green
letter day here in the Senate. You convinced me this is a great
amendment, Senator Apodaca. Why not remove it and let us vote on it on
its own merit? And let's go back to my original amendment. That would be
the proper thing to do here if you're so wed to this in supporting the
Sierra Club.
So I would urge you to vote this down. Let's bring it back as a real
amendment and not a substitute amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hunt, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ask Senator Apodaca a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, Senator Stein said that Duke Power is
going to get to make these rate increases if they want to. My
understanding, was the utility commission have something to do with
this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Senator Hunt. You're exactly right. This must,
any rate request by Duke must go before the utilities commission as it
does today. So it's, you know, I just don't think we have the expertise
in this body to be making those decisions. That's not why we were put
here. That is why the utilities commission was started and funded by us
to continue on. So, Senator Hunt, thanks for that question. I think the
utilities commission is where this needs to go.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask Senator Apodaca a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, when did coal ash get changed to a
different category? We're now regulating it as what? Solid waste?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK, and when did that take place? In this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, in this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And before then?

no regulations on it.

Is there any further discussion or debate on ammendment three?
Hearing none, the question before the Senate is the adoption of
ammendment three. All in favor vote &quot;aye&quot;, opposed to vote
&quot;no&quot;, five seconds to be allowed for the voting, clerk will
record the vote.
Thirty three having voted in the affirmitive and thirteen in the
negative, ammendment three is adopted. The bill as ammended is back
before the body, is there any further discussion or debate?
Senator for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Send forward an ammendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Stein you can send forward your ammendment. Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Stein moves to ammend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Stein is recognized to explain the ammendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, this is a fairly
straightforward ammendment does two things: There are fourteen coal ash
sites with thirty three ponds. You all have chosen for reasons I don't
fully understand, four ponds which are considered high risk or high
concern, I forget the technical term in the bill, and then there are ten
other sites which are subject to evaluation by commission that you all
are creating, a politically appointed commission, and there are three
categories that commisision can put the other ten in: you can put it in
high risk, medium risk, and low risk. And there's absolutely no
certainty that this commission won't just dump all the rest of them in
low risk. Low risk, as you all know, allows for just a cap and place.
Does nothing for the underneath.
Coal ash gets into the water two ways: It either gets into the surface
water through a dam break, like what we had up at Ann River, gets into a
river, or it goes through the ground into our drinking water. Subsurface
water. The ammendment will substantially increase the amount of
protections for that subsurface water pollution. And it only deals with
those that are categorized as low risk [??]ments. What it does is it
doesn't require those to be lined with leachates. It keeps the same
structure you all have put in the bill, if it's low risk you just cap it
and monitor it. But what it does is it answers the question, &quot;What
happens if there are exceedances of the toxins captured by the
monitoring?&quot; If the monitoring shows that it's getting into that
subsurface water, what are we going to do? And what it says is when that
happens, at that point on these low risk you carve it out just as if it
were medium risk, you put it over here on the side, you line it, put it
back. So it does not require every low risk one to have lining, but if
it is polluting the subsurface drinking water you have to line the
bottom.
The second thing it does is it corrects an error- or not an error, it
wasn't conscious, but I think it was a mistake, last year in the Red
Reform bill, House bill 74, you all changed the law as to where the
boundary lies. Under current law, the boundary is 500 feet from the
property line. And if the exceedances happen between 500 feet and the
property line, that's when this provision I just mentioned would be
triggered. They'd have to dig it up, and put some lining in it, and put
it back, and cap it. You all last year took the compliance boundary from
500 feet all the way just to the edge of the property. So we won't even
know about it until it starts polluting the neighbors' subsurface
waters. And in fact, you made it so that if the utility buys the next
property, then they can pollute to the next property line, to the end of
that one! So that's what the two things this ammendment does is when
there exceedances

...it requires a lining and two, it restores the law back to where it
was where the exceedances are measured 500 feet from the property line,
not the property line itself. This is a straightforward amendment. It
will only do more to protect our drinking water. I ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca has the floor to speak to the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, some of this amendment's very good. It
really is. Some of it's misstated, but that's neither here nor there. I
would like to ask you if you would withdraw this amendment and get
together with us and we'll happily take the good parts of this amendment
and see if we can't put it in tomorrow if you'd be willing to do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, do you yield for the question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield for the question. Having voted with the
prevailing side on the prior substitute amendment, would you take that
amendment off, we'll bring it back to the floor so we can consider that
separately?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No.
[laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I will withdraw my amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein withdraws his amendment. The bill, as
amended, is back before the body. Is there any further discussion or
debate? Senator Foushee, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Foushee, you can send forward your amendment.
The Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Foushee moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Foushee is recognized to explain the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Members, as Senator Stein
just said, this bill allows for de-watering and capping in place of some
ponds which simply means that polluted coal ash waste water is drained
into the neighboring river or lake for all but four impoundments. You
may recall a few months ago an incident occurred at the Cape Fear Power
Station in Chatham County where millions of gallons of waste water were
pumped into a tributary that empties into the Cape Fear River. This
location has among it the highest number of dams which pose significant
risks. This incident has caused great concern in my district because the
Cape Fear River is a drinking water source for nearly 800,000 North
Carolinians. Nothing in this bill gives us the assurance that another
such incident can not or will not occur should this bill pass in its
current form.
It does not define the classifications of high, intermediate, or low
risks, only that they be established. Thus, the definition to
distinguish these rankings is not present in the bill. My concern, as is
the concern of many North Carolinians, is that we protect our drinking
water resourse. Therefore, based on this serious incident that occurred
earlier this year and the potential of similar incidents to occur, this
amendment would add the Cape Fear Power Station to the list of
impoundments that are guaranteed to be cleaned up. I ask for your
support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca has the floor to speak to the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, I absolutely agree with you. This should be
cleared up. I think every pond in North Carolina should be cleaned up
and cleared. We have set up a bill that deals with that. We set up an
independent commission to deal with these ponds. To make the tough
decisions that need to be made in order of how and when to clean them
up. We can't just keep pulling them in. I think every one of us feel our
project should be cleaned up immediately. But we can't. We just can't
clean every one of them up immediately. It's just not possible.
So we must be prudent. We must be pragmatic in our approach and go after
the ones that have to be cleaned or are the most dangerous first. And I
have complete faith and confidence in this new commission and DNR to put
these together and get the ones that need to be cleaned up, cleaned up.
So I'm going to ask you not to support this amendment or any more that
come trying to add other facilities to the top line. Because we've got
about as much as we can do right now and this still will make us, when
this bill passes, the toughest...</p>

… the country in dealing with coal ash ponds, so I ask you to vote
against this amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Rucho, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Senator Apodaca would yield to a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The way you have designed your bill, if as each of these programs, these
projects are triaged through, the commission has the responsibility
along with DENR to decide if something moves up or down the ladder based
on priorities, and if something gets to be let’s say a higher priority,
that will be adjusted accordingly. Am I correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if
Senator Apodaca will yield for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Apodaca, do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You
just said that the ones in the bill were the ones that were determined
to be most dangerous, most at danger – the four. I would like to
understand what the criteria was because by all objective criteria, I
think Senator Foushee has identified one of if not the most at risk.
Cape Fear has 521 thousand people who drink water from beneath the
intake ponds and it has five dams – substantially more than most any
other, so on what criteria is Cape Fear not one of the top four?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well Senator Stein, number one, I feel like the most
dangerous pond in the one at Lake Julian in Asheville, and if I lived
where Senator Foushee did I might feel differently, but that sits up
three to four hundred feet above the French Broad River, and if that was
to give way, it would come down, but if you’ll recall, when we received
the Governor’s bill, these were the ones identified in that bill. Her
facility may very well move to the top of the list when the commission
evaluates it, but we’ve got to let it run its course, and I can see
arguments everywhere but I was so hoping, and I guess I was just
dreaming, that we wouldn’t politicize this, that we could go down and
set up and independent commission that would really take care of the
people in North Carolina, but if we’re going to get into the petty
bickering back and forth, the “mine’s better than yours” or “yours is
dangerous”, then we’re going to be here all night and not accomplish
much, so it very well may be, but I say let’s let out DENR and Coal Ash
Commission make that decision, and it may move to the top of the list.
We’re not pushing it to the bottom of the list. So I ask you to defeat
the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up question. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, could you yield for a follow-up? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can you explain, other than the fact that the
Governor had these in his bill, what distinguishes these four from ten
that are not designated? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No, you would have to call
the Governor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or
debate? Senator Tucker, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ask Senator Apodaca a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, do
you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca,
I’m just trying to follow the debate here. The good parts of Senator
Stein’s amendment that you said that you would consider between now and
tomorrow, all these sites will be monitored for drinking water. If in
fact what Senator Foushee says about the Cape Fear and those criteria
mentioned by Senator Stein, and the fact that we’re going to be
monitoring closely and could move this up, if we include some of the
good parts of Senator Stein’s bill, could in fact the Cape Feat move up
through the commission and be even to the point of maybe replacing one
of the four that are outlined as a starting point from the Governor?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Senator Tucker, even without Senator Stein’s
amendment that can happen, and very well may if it is, but let’s also
remember, we’re also putting tighter restrictions on the monitoring of
drinking water as it is, and we’ve moved it earlier in our first
amendment from 20 years to 30 years, so all sites will be monitored for
at least 30 years to make sure we’re not having that move over. Thank
you for that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. Mr., speak to the…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tucker has the floor to speak to the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No sir, I’ll speak to the bill at that
time. Thank you, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator. Is there any
further discussion or debate on Amendment 5? Hearing none, the question
before the Senate is the adoption of Amendment 5. All in favor will vote

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much Mr. President. Senator Apodaca
thank you so much for the excellent work that you and Senator Berger
have done to bring forth this bill. It goes along way towards addressing
an issue, that Aye think that none of us realized even a few months ago
was an, many of us didn't realize anyways, it was a serious issue
affecting, our state. It's affecting so many of us and our water supply.
Aye don't want you to have to repeat what you just said Senator Apodaca,
but over the last few days the folks along the ?? County area that Aye
serve and represent. And, I'm downstream from that where the water
supply comes from the ??, and the PD, and Anson County, and Richmond
County, and Stanly County all of which Aye serve, including ?? County as
well, have reached out to me with their concerns. Residents who live
near this buck plant at where Three Colash Pines are on the Adkin River
have expressed concerns. Some of you may have seen the news reports.
There's even a document that circulated around here, Aye, haven't even
had the chance to read all of it, but shares personal stories, that
citizens have that concerns they have. Chromium levels that are far in
excess of acceptable standards for ground water. These are folks that
aren't finger pointers. Many of whom worked for Duke Energy. They are
good people, they didn't call me to point the finger and to  be critical
of anybody. They just want their water to be safe so that they can bathe
in it, they can drink it, their children can plan it, and they can enjoy
clean water supply just like all of us. Chromium levels high, lead
levels six times the standard, iron, boron levels all in proximity to
the buck plant in Rowan County. Many health concerns that of been
expressed by citizens, they didn't know what might be causing these
health concerns. Aye, certainly understand and agree that we need to
take a look at everyone of the sites, but I can't not, at least offerer
this amendment, which would include the buck plant on behalf of the
citizens that Aye serve and represent in my senate district. So, I'm
asking that be, that plant be included as well. Some of our concerns ??
deficiency. Thank you so much and Aye offered this annulment and urge
you to accept it thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brock

about something as far as how we have things listed. He said he would
hold off on the amendment but he said he had  to run it. This is my
district, these are my people. I’m looking at the areas of what has
caused, everybody is looking at what might've caused the cancer, or
something, and people want answers. When this ?? problem first happened
at Dan River, you know some of us have been working on this for a daily
basis, and are getting the information to come back time and time again.
Everyday working on it, talking to people in the area, talking about
what it meant to my district. This is the oldest calash ponds actually
we have three ponds in the state. It’s been there for a long time. We’ve
looked at the water quality that's come into the plant, what's gone out.</p>

If you look at the Yadkin River, the water, of what type of water
quality we have that comes in, through the test of DENR over the years,
the water that flows out of the Buck Plant is actually cleaner than the
water that’s come in. With all the ground well monitoring stations that
we’ve had and no significant problems, we’re trying to find out what are
the main issues. And we’re trying to do this in an orderly way to where
we have the least impact possible. Because if we rush into it, we may
cause more problems with the coal ash that we have than if we did it in
a uniform way. If we look at hindsight 20/20, maybe we shouldn’t have a
list of any of the coal plants at all. That’s what the coal ash
commission will do. They’ll take each and every plant and rank them. And
it might be that that Buck plant is the most contaminated. If that’s the
case, guess what, it’s going to the top of the list. It will be taken
care of first. Regardless of the four, the ranking in the four doesn’t
really matter. It’s kind of like preseason, who’s ranked number one in
the country. It does not matter until the end of the season, end of the
test, end of the commission of when they’re going to take the
information and data and see who needs to be cleaned up first. We’ve
been looking at this for a long, long time, about the movement from coal
to natural gas, to other forms of energy. And who’s going to pay for it
and everything else. Senator Woodard if that’s the case, then we’ll
support a renewable energy portfolio. Because that subsidizes
inefficient technology. You want to talk about a mandate to the tax
payers and to the rate payers, that’s it. But that’s what this
commission will do. The commission will take the information and rank
these sites accordingly. Everybody wants to be in the front of the line.
But how terrible would it be that if we had certain ones that got in the
front of the line and they’re low level. They’re at the bottom. And
those that have more dangerous sites have to wait, and wait, and wait,
just because you jumped up in front of the line. I can’t ask for the, to
table the amendment, but Senator McLaurin, I wish you’d waited. We were
working on it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or

purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the bill. [SPEAKER

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you want to speak to the amendment or the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m good, Mr. President, thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

as amended? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jackson, for what purpose do you
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Jackson, you have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Four plants
were singled out to receive the highest level of care. The reason these
amendments are coming is that we don’t know how those four plants were
chosen, other than that they were in the Governor’s original plan. And
if that’s the answer, what kind of Representative would I be if I
accepted that as gospel? What kind of Representative for my district
would I be, if I went back to them and said we are not in the front of
the line, because the Governor wanted these four people in the front of
the line, and accept that as a good answer. That’s not a good answer.
But that’s the only one we’ve been given. That’s why these amendments
are coming. Because it seems arbitrary and that’s when people get a
little anxious. Not when they’re not in the front of the line, but when
they don’t know why. When four other people have been chosen to be in
the front, and there’s no good reason. Then everyone in the back of the

...?? and understandably curious. Part of my district is Uptown
Charlotte. Uptown Charlotte is 30 minutes south of the largest coal ash
pond in the state, Marshall Steam Plant. Eighty acres of a pond, 2.2
trillion gallons of coal ash hanging over the heads of Lincoln County,
Davidson, Huntersville, Gastonia, Belmont, Cornelius, Mooresville and
Charlotte.
One of the essential functions of good government is to ensure that we
can all drink the water. It's worth going the extra mile here when we're
talking about drinking water for a million people. If we don't know why
four have been singled out, well here's a reason to single out Marshall
Steam Plant. If it goes, you've got contaminated drinking water for one
million people. There is a nice clear reason that everyone can
understand.
That's why at this point, Mr. President, I send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator,you can send forward your amendment. The Clerk

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman has the floor to speak to the

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jackson, I suppose we ought to stay here and
let you make the list. We've got a list and the list absolutely means
nothing until the commission puts you on it, off of it, first, second,
third or fifth. If we all decide who's in first, and we're not going to
do that. That's foolish, because you would have one different from
everybody else and they'd all have their hometown on it. Let the bill
go...we've played this game of back and forth. You know an amendment is
going the same place the rest of them have gone. And if it makes you
feel good, I'll put one in to put the Haw River on there.
What we're doing, folks, is nitpicking a bill to death that means
nothing. The commission is going to decide where the priorities are and
the water is going to be measured and tested for 30 years. I doubt if
we'll be here in 30 years, but we've got safeguards in place, we've got
a list that came from the Governor. Is it a perfect list? I don't know
and it doesn't make any difference.
Folks, this list will be defined when the commission acts based on
research and not what you want or not what Senator Woodard wants, or
Senator Stein wants, but what they think it is and they will use all
kind of input, all kind of experts and science which you don't have and
neither do I.
I hope we'll do the same thing with this one we've done to the rest of

important piece of legislation. As a resident of Asheville I am
particularly grateful to be included with that list of four plants that
are going to be addressed as soon as possible. My voters are taken care
of. I really don't see how this is a political issue.
Senator Apodaca also stated that we need to let DNR do its job. Well,
DNR is trying to do its job. On June 13th, they issued a letter that
cited deficiencies with three coal ash dams at the Cliffside Steam
Station. In that letter, they categorized one of those dams as high
hazard. The letter said...</p>

If in the event of a dam failure, significant environmental damage to

water. In March ?? collected water samples from pipes at Cliffside, like
they did with Ashville. Both the soils tested positive for valium, a
toxic metal associated with the coal burning process. The inactive ash
basin at Cliffside tested above the national recommendation. Clearly,
Cliffside needs to be added to the list. I don't know how many ponds
should be on that list, but the ponds that are dangerous need to be
included. And that's why I ask you to support this amendment.
Speaker Changes: Do we have any discussion or debate? Hearing none.
Question before the senate is the adoption of Amendment 8. All in favor
will vote aye, opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for
the voting. The clerk will record the vote. Meredith? Thirteen having
voted in the affirmative and thirty-two in the negative. Amendment 8
fails. The bill as amended is back before the body. Is there any further
discussion or debate on the bill? Meredith? Senator Meredith?
Aye.[laughter]Senator Meredith? No.[laughter]
Speaker Change: Thirteen, thirty-three.
Speaker Change: Final count, thirteen, thirty-three. Any further
discussion or debate on the bill as amended? Senator Woodard for what
purpose do you arise?
Speaker Change: Speak to the bill, Mr. President.
Speaker Change: Senator Woodard has the floor to speak to the bill a
second time.
Speaker Change: Thank you, Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen, on the
coal ash started spilling into the Dan River on Sunday, February the
2nd, and of course my district is downriver from the Dan River when it
turns from Danville. Coal ash was coming down the river on Monday, and I
began to call into Caswell  County to find out how folks were doing. And
over these last four months I've had a lot of conversations with folks
there, including a number this past weekend that I spent up in the
Middleton area where the Dan River crosses. And I thought a lot about
this and heard a lot about this over these four months. Again, I want to
thank Senator Berger because this coal ash bill started almost,
literally, in his backyard. Sir Apodaca who's told you his feelings
about this. I have two more coal ash plants in my district including the
second largest pond in the state, and I care a lot about it. And I
appreciate the work they've put in this bill along with our staff. I
appreciate the work that we've had with agencies. Denner was
particularly helpful to me. I want to thank Duke Energy for being
gracious and giving me a tour on the Saturday following the spill. I'd
like to thank the various environmental and business groups who've also
worked with us on this. This bill is not a perfect bill. Our amendments
today were intended, not to annoy you all, to get you worked up, but
really to fight for safer water, to work for a quicker clean up and to
resolve all this at no cost to the rate payers. We were not successful
in obtaining those goals today,so we turn to a bill that is not perfect
but it is, as Secretary Skvarla told us in the environment committee a
couple of weeks ago, it is a step in the right direction. So, again,
today I'm not going to let the perfect stand in the way of the good. I
will be supporting the bill and I urged my colleagues to do the same.
Thank you.
Speaker Changes: Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator
Goolsby for what purpose do you arise?
Speaker Changes: To see if Senator Apodaca would yield to a couple of
questions.
Speaker Changes: Senator Apodaca, do you yield?
Speaker Changes: I do.
Speaker Changes: Senator, did you squirm back a little bit in time? Is
it a fact, sir, that all the original ash basins in North Carolina were
constructed when the general assemblies under democrat control from 1923
until about 1983?
Speaker Changes: I know when they started. I can't, honestly, tell you
who was in control. I believe.</p>

That would be true, but Senator Blue and Senator Allran’s only ones that
have been around here that long that could really attest to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, do you
yield for a follow-up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, when the Democrat-lead General Assembly enacted a moratorium on
landfill permitting back in 2006, do you recall sir that coal ash
impoundments were exempted from that legislation at that time? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator, I do remember that being an exemption. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes sir. And also, when the Democrat-lead… Follow-up? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, do you yield for another follow-up? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I do but… go ahead, Senator. Go ahead. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a
couple more. When the Democrat-lead General Assembly tightened the
state’s solid waste statutes for landfills in 2007, do you recall sir
that coal ash received another exemption from the enhanced landfill
requirements set forth in the law at that time which continue to allow
coal ash to be placed in unlined landfills? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I honestly
don’t remember. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Might that be the case, sir? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] It might, councilor. Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir, the
legislation that we put forward, is it groundbreaking? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator… [SPEAKER CHANGES] Last follow-up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Last
follow-up, sure. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, the legislation that we put
forward, would you consider it groundbreaking for the safety of the
people of this state to help deal with an issue that has been at risk
for a number of years in North Carolina, that we’re finally starting to
deal with it constructively and the right way to protect the people of
this good state? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I have a second
time I think I can speak on this. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You do, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President, members, and Senator
Goolsby, I do appreciate your questions, but I’d like to say this, and
Senator Woodard, your comments were very nice. I think if we wanted to
go around here and play blame, everyone one of us could be blamed –
except Senator Rucho; he’s perfect, as we know. We all aspire to that,
but seriously, this has been around since the ‘30s, and the fact is none
of us have really done a lot to correct this problem over that
timeframe, but the good news is we can change that today. We can show
the people of North Carolina that we are serious about coal ash, and we
can all vote for this bill and send a message not only here but across
the county that North Carolina is serious about cleaning up coal ash,
and that’s the bottom line. We all want what’s best for all of North
Carolina, but especially our constituents. We want to look after those.
And I want to say probably one of the hardest votes I’ve ever seen
happen was the vote Senator Brock took. He would love to go home and say
“Listen, I tried to peel us out of this, tried to get us up top of the
list,” and going back to the list, every bill I’ve seen filed on coal
ash this session has had the same four companies in it – I mean the same
four sites. Senator Woodard, your bill had it. Even Representative
Harrison’s bill in the House had the same four, so it’s not an exact
science. We’re all trying to do the best we can, and I think this is
absolutely the best first step we can take to deal with coal ash in
North Carolina, and I ask everybody in this room for your support. Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senators, we have excused absences for Senators
Blue and Newton. Is there any further discussion or debate on the bill?
Hearing none, the question before the Senate is the passage of the
Committee Substitute to Senate Bill 729 as amended on its second
reading. All in favor will vote aye. Opposed will vote no. Five seconds
will be allowed for the voting. Clerk will record the vote. 45 having
voted in the affirmative and 0 in the negative, Committee Substitute to
Senate Bill 7299 as amended passes its second reading and it will remain
on the calendar. Senators, we’ll be moving on to second reading public
bills. House Bill 189, Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] House Bill
189, a ?? Child Support Orders. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Randleman’s
recognized to explain the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
President. Members, this act would require that the address of the
custodial parent or child be included in a child support order except
when there is an existing order…</p>

… prohibiting disclosure or the court has entered a 50-day domestic
violence protective order. The bill also makes technical changes to the
Uniformed Deployed Parents Custody and Visitation Act. I know of no
opposition and would appreciate your support, and Mr. President, Senator
Barringer has an amendment that has been agreed to by the primary bill
sponsor. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Barringer, for what
purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To send forth the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, you can send forward your amendment. The
Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Barringer moves to amend the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Barringer is recognized to explain the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. As has been
stated, this is a friendly amendment. You’ve seen these amendments
before; I will briefly list them. The first two were in the business
court bill and the first part of the amendment is the actual business
court part. There’s only a technical amendment or two in there to
clarify a few of the… really, truly technical. It is the business court
bill. Also in the business court bill was a holding court portion; that
is verbatim what was in that bill. And then the last part you’ve also
seen in Senate Bill 648. This particular amendment was known as part 5
when we vetted it very well, I think over three days in Judiciary 1.
There’s absolutely no opposition to it. What it does is it brings into
North Carolina the law that Delaware has that says that if a North
Carolina company puts in its articles of incorporation that has been
voted on by the shareholders a notice that a derivative action would be
brought against the company, it has to happen in one of our North
Carolina courts. I urge your support, and as I said, the primary bill
sponsor agrees with this. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any discussion or
debate on Amendment 1? Hearing none, the question before the Senate is
the adoption of Amendment 1. All in favor vote aye. Opposed will vote
no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting and the Clerk will
record the vote. Rucho, aye. 45 having voted in the affirmative and none
in the negative, Amendment 1 is adopted. The bill as amended is back
before the body. Is there any discussion or debate? Hearing none, the
question before the Senate is the passage of the Senate Committee
Substitute to House Bill 189 as amended on its second reading. All in
favor vote aye. Opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for
the voting and the Clerk will record the vote. Rucho, aye. McLaurin,
aye. 45 having voted in the affirmative and 0 in the negative, Senate
Committee substitute to House Bill 189 as amended passes its second
reading. Without objection it will be read a third time. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] North Carolina General Assembly ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there
any discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question before the Senate
is the passage of the Senate Committee Substitute to House Bill 189 as
amended on it third reading. All in favor will say aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, no. The  ayes have it. Senate
Committee Substitute to House Bill 189 as amended passes its third
reading. The amendment will be engrossed, it will be sent to the House
for concurrence in the Senate Committee Substitute. Senators, we have a
couple public bills for concurrence. Senate Bill 163, the Clerk will
read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 163, Reclaim Water as Source Water.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hartsell’s
recognized to speak to the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
President, members of the Senate. This bill went to the House as one
thing and has come back to us entirely differently. Not surprising, but
it’s totally different. It is in fact a new bill. It was originally
Senator Jackson’s bill. The long and short of it is the bulk of it is
pretty good, but there are some provisions that are technically
incorrect, and I would suggest that we may want to vote no on the
concurrence motion and get a conference committee appointed to make it
better. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hartsell requests that you do not
concur. Is there any discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question
before the Senate is the motion to concur in the House Committee
Substitute to Senate Bill 163. There’ll be one electronic vote. All in
favor will vote aye. Opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed
for the voting and Clerk will record the vote. 1 having voted in the
affirmative and 44 in the negative, the Senate does not concur in the
motion for House Committee Substitute to Senate Bill 163 and the House
will be so notified. Senator Tarte changes from aye to no. [SPEAKER

Bill 790, the Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 790, ??

[SPEAKER CHANGES] When we in the Senate last saw this bill, we passed it
44 to 5. It then phased in the sales tax on sales of electricity by the
Cape Hatteras Electric Membership Corporation over two years. The House
PCS added to this provision other provisions including phase in of sales
tax on sales of piped natural gas by the eight gas cities and a couple
of technical changes at the Department of Revenue's request. I ask for
your concurrence.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Cook asks that you concur. Is there any
further discussion or debate? Senator Hise, for what purpose do you
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ask Senator Cook a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Cook, do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Of course.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Cook, when we had gone through debate
previously on the sales tax, it was my understanding that previously
this community had not paid any of the utilities tax so that's why we
were phasing it in. Is the same statement true for these gas cities that
are selling piped natural gas? Did they not previously pay that and
we're phasing that in over time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, for what purpose...Senator Apodaca
has the floor for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, Senate Bill 790, I ask that it be
removed from tonight's calendar and placed on tomorrow's calendar,
please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection, so ordered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senators, that wraps up the calendar for the day. Do
we have any notices or announcements? Any notices or announcements?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Announcements, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca has the floor for announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, please pay careful attention. Tomorrow
morning at 10 a.m. there will be an Insurance Committee meeting.
Tomorrow morning at 10:30 a.m., there will be a Pensions and Retirement
meeting and tomorrow morning at 11 a.m., there will be a Rules meeting.
All these meetings will be held in Room 1027 and I suggest take a look
at your e-mail tonight. It will have a list of what we're going to hear.
Senator Davis, you'll enjoy one of these bills for the Insurance
Committee, so I ask that everybody attend tomorrow.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further notices or announcements? Any other
business to come before the Senate? If not, the Chair recognizes Senator
Berger for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. I move that the Senate do
now adjourn subject to messages from the House and the Governor. The
introduction, referral and re-referral of bills and resolutions. The
receipt and re-referral of committee reports, ratifications of bills and
appointments of conferees to reconvene on Wednesday, June 25, 2014 at 2
p.m.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The motion that the Senate do now adjourn subject to
the stipulations stated by Senator Berger to reconvene Wednesday, June
25th, at 2 p.m. Seconded by Senator Tarte. All in favor say aye, opposed
no. The ayes have it, the Senate stands adjourned.</p>
