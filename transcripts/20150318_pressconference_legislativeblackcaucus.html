  Leave that alone . . . Good morning, State Representative Pierce. House
Bill 48, Chair of the Legislature Black Caucasus and we&#39;re coming to
share today. We&#39;ve worked hard the last couple weeks to speak with
the Governor to speak of the House and Senator Berger about our ??.
We&#39;ve had some good conversations and I think they understand where
we are as a caucus, we&#39;re concerned about the USMC system as a whole
because its important that all the schools continue to operate and to do
the things they need to do to educate our young men and young women
across North Carolina, but we do have concerns when we start hearing
things about the possible of ?? being closed or merged with other
schools. These historical schools have provided education over the years
we want to make sure that they continue to operate, so we&#39;re doing
our part to stay proactive so that the word will be out that we did our
part to keep it in the forefront. I have some speakers today who will
share at least three minutes on concerns and one of our senior members,
?? will come and talk about the historic perspective of ?? in North
Carolina and across the country.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you. I just want you to know that as far as historical perspective
is concerned, these schools were born out of the ?? era, the strong
segregation era, as a means of keeping African American students
basically out of the white institutions. During this period of time the
five institutions that we have here in the state they have made
significant contributions to the state. We&#39;ve had a governor,
we&#39;ve a congress member, we&#39;ve had other folks making
significant contributions, not only to the state, but to the state and
to the nation. So, these schools play an important role. Since the
advent of integration these rolls have become more important. You take,
for instance a school like Elizabeth City, they now have an aviation
school there and its a dominate force in the North Eastern section of
the state. What they contribute to the Elizabeth City area, in terms of
businesses, in terms of prosperity can&#39;t be denied. You take ANT
State University, which is a engineering school. You&#39;ve had an
astronaut come from that school and now they&#39;re offering a PhD in
engineering. Elizabeth has ?? State, which has a strong, strong program.
And, the contributions that they have made in that particular area, ??
State has been a ??, particularly to the young forces with the school
being there and available to the arm forces. North Carolina Central, my
school I save for last, naturally. But, its a school that is now turning
out scientist in the bio-tech, bio-manufacturing era. You have 150
students in there now who are in the PhD program in that bio-tech
program. We&#39;ve got two bio-tech schools via with each other at North
Carolina State so what I&#39;m saying in short is these schools have
made significant progress, have been a boom and made a contribution to
the state, still are making  contributions to the state and the fact of
the matter is those schools are now more integrated than the white
schools are integrated when you do it on a percentage basis. That means
all and everybody&#39;s getting a good education, particularly out of
those schools. They are no longer to be put at the bottom of the list.
Be happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Certainly when we look at ?? . . . Paul Lowe, 32nd district. Certainly
when we look at . . . Senator Paul Lowe, don&#39;t leave that out.
Certainly, when we look at ??, I am certainly a component of went to
Salem State University where if you have been to any hospital in North
Carolina you&#39;ll just about find a Ram, somebody whose studied
nursing at our school and we&#39;re doing some great things there. One
of the unique things that I wanted to say that has not been done
anywhere is that motor sports is one of the big things in North
Carolina. Its a big money maker, it employees over 25,000 people are
employed by the motor sports industry and we have one of the

  The only motor sport, the greens, in the country, which I think is a
fantastic thing and I am a product of an HBCU and I certainly want to
see our schools continue to be vibrant in this community so we thank you
for coming. If you have any questions, let me know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just make my statement for Howard who could not be here. He had another
meeting, but he said good morning. My name is Howard Hunter the third
and I represent the fifth district, which includes Elizabeth City State
University. Elizabeth City State University serves 21 counties in the
North, Northeast North Carolina, is one of the economic engines, and its
impact’s approximately $130 million dollars per year to the region.
Signature programs include aviation, science, and the only school in the
state to offer a BA degree in aviation science. He talks about they
produced a lot of teachers in that area, visual performance, art, and
other things, and he’s really working hard to ensure that the Governor
and this legislature provides the $3 million for the next three years,
he’s asked them for that, that will help the school do what it needs to
do, and it also we will support the chancellor there as she prepares for
the future to move East Carolina forward, and that comes from Howard.
Elizabeth City, excuse me, Elizabeth City forward. Thank you for that,
on that. Senator Don Davis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Don Davis, North Carolina Senate, District 5, and extremely delighted to
be with you today, and thank everyone for coming out. Thank you for
coming out. The North Carolina legislative black caucus, we met
yesterday and obviously as reported at meeting, we were able to have a
candid conversation with the chair of the UNC Board of Governors. We
also had the chair of the public affairs, as well as President Ross and
staff members of the UNC system. After that meeting, we met as a
membership and I’m delighted to share the position that our caucus took
in terms of positions reflecting our membership. That included our first
position was to support the appropriation of at least $3 million each
year over the biennial that would be used for the purpose of enrollment
growth strategies at Elizabeth City State University. Our legislative
black caucus also took a position to oppose the cap on the development
expenditures on that, we saw on the Governor’s budget, and we also took
a position to support enrollment funding, and not only for our HBCUs,
but this would be the funding for our entire system. I’m realizing that
as we’re dealing with challenges with enrollment that it would be
important for us system wide to support such funding. And then the
fourth position that we took was to oppose the closure of any
historically black college and university in the state of North
Carolina. So that motion was carried unanimously, strong vote of our
caucus, and we stand 100% behind these positions. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning. I’m Representative Jean Farmer-Butterfield, district 24,
Wilson and Pitt counties. I want to thank our students for being here
this morning. I think that’s very important. I’m glad they were able to
join us. I’m a product of historically black university, and that’s
North Carolina Central in Durham so Representative Michaux is not the
only Eagle in the room, and I want to. I will say to you that my parents
had eight children, and six of them attended colleges in North Carolina.
One went the wrong way and attended ANT State University. Five attended
North Carolina Central University, and two went to Washington, attended
Howard University. So I understand the value of historically black
colleges. It’s a part of my heritage and I’m very proud of it. Our black
caucus has decided to have a historically black college and university
day under the leadership of Representative Pierce, our chair, and
Senator Gladys Robinson has been given the charge to make

  This day successful, so we&#39;re looking forward to having the alumni
and students and parents and others in the community concerned about
historically black colleges to come to the legislature. Our alumni are
in the community action mode and planning mode. They are concerned about
and appreciate the history and recognize the importance and value of
maintaining all historically black colleges and universities in North
Carolina, and indeed they want to strengthen them. So they&#39;re
planning to participate in the historically black college and university
day. They are also working to organize all of the stakeholders. Parents,
students, concerned citizens, and indeed alumni to make sure that they
have a plan of action to work together and develop and implement a
community action plan with strategies around items such as funding,
enrollment, tuition and grants, fund raising, marketing and branding,
and they&#39;re looking forward to working with Senator Robinson and
making sure that there is a liaison between them and the legislative
black caucus, and that&#39;s information I thought was important to
share on their behalf.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Carla Cunningham, Mecklenburg County. Let me say that we
had some candid conversations yesterday with the Board of Governor
representatives here, and they were very informative. I think they were
very straightforward, and I appreciate the caucus work on that. I am a
proud graduate of Winston-Salem&#39;s State University&#39;s Nursing
Program, and I got the message from them that that is quite a success
throughout the state, and it will continue to be. I am very appreciative
for them making the journey, but we do have commitments that we need to
stick by, because just like Representative Michaux stated, the
HBCU&#39;s rooted from the Jim Crow years, and now we are at another
junction. It is still to maintain that service to the African American
community and to the state, because we are inclusive in the HBCUs, and
we have to continue to monitor the funded. I appreciate you giving me an
opportunity to speak. Thank you, and if there are any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning. Senator Erica Smith-Ingram. I represent senatorial
district 3. That&#39;s eight counties in Northeastern North Carolina,
Bertie, Chowan, Edgecombe, Hertford, Martin, Northampton, Tyrrell, and
Washington counties. I want to thank you for being here today. North
Carolina hosts some of the top HBCUs in the entire nation. I am a proud
graduate of North Carolina Agriculture and Technical State University,
so aggie pride, and we are very excited that not only does North
Carolina ANT have state recognition, but among African American
engineers across the nation, North Carolina ANT is the number one
producer of African American engineers at the bachelors level, masters
level, as well as the doctoral level, on all three levels. We are are
the top producers, North Carolina ANT, of African American certified
public accountants. Because this is a national issue, we must make
priority for our HBCUs to continue to thrive and lead the nation in
excellence. I was glad to hear in our meeting yesterday that there will
be no efforts to merge our HBCUs or close our HBCUs. We are a national
forefront of educating students of all nationalities and all
ethnicities. They not only come from North Carolina, but students come
from across the world to attend our HBCUs. That&#39;s why we must place
paramount importance on giving these schools the funding that they need
that they may continue, and I am so happy  that we have a commitment for
Elizabeth City State University to receive the $3 million that it is
going to need as it continues to offer excellence. Thank you for being
here today, and we would be happy to field any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for coming here this morning. My name is Representative Ralph
Johnson. I represent Guilford county and I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re
here today. Senator Ingram already alluded to the fact, and I&#39;m a
proud ANT graduate. Marketing degree at ANT

  <p id="15:00">
  I&#39;m not going to repeat what has already been said because I guess
there would be some redundancy. But the key here is that we do not need
to close any HBCU&#39;s and we cannot allow folks to kind of  pick and
choose for the people of this state who are looking to receive a quality
education at an HBCU. Again, I&#39;m not going to take any more time but
I think the key here is that we&#39;re glad that funding is in place. We
did meet with the board of governors yesterday. There were some
interesting conversations that were had yesterday but I just wanted to
say that. That the key right now is for HBCU&#39;s to stay effective and
to stay funded.  We do understand that the General Assembly will have
the final say. The board is the board and we do understand that we know
that its going to take this body here working to ensure that that
funding stays in place and I&#39;m quite sure...we will continue to talk
about it. We do have those assurances from the board but now the real
work is here in the General Assembly and with the governor. Any
questions at this time?  Yes Ma&#39;am? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I&#39;m
wondering what your hearing about seems like you&#39;re concerned enough
to have the meeting yesterday, to have this event today, to put on a
lobbying day for alumni and so forth, so you must be pretty concerned.
So I&#39;m wondering what you&#39;re hearing and where its coming from?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]That they have been rumors I think that started in a
meeting down in Charlotte. One member of the board made some comments
that took wings. I forgot his name and that kind of got us our attention
and we&#39;ve been hearing some other things from that last session
about some movement and Elizabeth City&#39;s always been the target so
we just want to be proactive. There&#39;s no doubt about that. So
that&#39;s our plan of action. Stay proactive. Keep getting the public,
keep our alumni our students and everybody abreast of what&#39;s
happening and let them know that we&#39;re not asleep at the switch.
That we&#39;re just going to keep advocating on behalf of HBC. Would
anyone else like to make a comment about that?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]In the
past there have been efforts to do some things. For instance the law
school in North Carolina Central was on the chopping block, I guess
maybe thirty years ago and we came over and saved that. Since that time
that law school has turned out to be one of the premier law schools in
the country, particularly for women. Its right now integrated to a
point, right now its about fifty fifty and you&#39;ve got significant..
you&#39;ve got graduates coming from that law school that have made
significant contributions. This idea of closing or merging these
HBCU&#39;s is not new. We&#39;ve had to fight it. It looks like its a
cycle that comes around every twenty or thirty years and we&#39;ve come
back and defend them and we&#39;ve always been successful in defending
them and we&#39;re going to be successful this time.[SPEAKER CHANGES] We
just have two other presenters. Just a quick note too we have Mr. Fred
Yate, who is a board member of Elizabeth City and we
a student who&#39;d like to make a comment. Student you can come first.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Hi my name is Shayla Jackson. I&#39;m a current student
at the number one HBCU in North Carolina or overall North Carolina and
NC State University. (Laughter) But numbers are here nor there. I just
really want to comment on the fact that we all came up in stated how
great each school did in particular areas like WSSU in Nursing program,
ANT with the Engineering program but honestly we need to stand together
in order for this to occur. There&#39;s not reason why each individual
HBCU has to fight for their own stability. There&#39;s no reason why we
have to fend for what&#39;s ours. It&#39;s our land. It was granted to
us and so I feel like when it comes down to it we need to stand
together. Not just North Carolina as a state, any HBCU that may feel as
though they&#39;re being threaten to be taken over or overtaken.
It&#39;s just we need to make sure that we&#39;re standing for
what&#39;s ours. We produce some of the top students across the board.
HBCU&#39;s, we&#39;re African-Americans, we&#39;re minorities really.
It&#39;s not even just about being a black individual attending college.
Like some of the individuals here stated there&#39;s international
levels we can&#39;t even begin to imagine. There&#39;s an international
program...

  ...and being an honor student, we’re there.  We live in the same dorm,
so I see all the different cultures and all the different individuals
that are striving and succeeding at North Carolina A&amp;T State
University.  I, originally from South Florida, all my family went to
FMU, but I went ahead, I applied to five schools -- NC State, Clemson,
Auburn, Tuskegee and NC A&amp;T State University.   But the only school
that I felt saw potential in me was ??.  I plan to go there for graduate
school, I want to be a large animal veterinarian.
But anyway, NC A&amp;T State University was the only school to offer me
the [Daddy?] Scholarship currently.  I’m on a full ride right now and
I’m successful.  I have a 3.75 GPA and I continue to do better, not
because I have to, not because I want to keep my money, but because I
know I want to do good.  I want to do great in my field of interest.
And A&amp;T, their faculty, especially the school of agriculture, they
see that within me.
I’m here on this trip.  I was supposed to be watching the governor, but
as soon as I saw this information, as soon as this was brought to me by
my counter-party here, I was like we gotta find, we gotta see what’s
going on.
And so we made it a priority to come here.  We were out there.  I
brought it to certain individuals, but we decided to come because this
is a really, like this is a deeply rooted issue within me.  I chose to
go to a HBCU, I chose to represent NC A&amp;T State Univ.  And by making
that decision, I’m proud.  I have not once ever regretted attending  a
HBCU.
I’m sorry, I’m sorry, but this is like...I apologize.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, she took up most the time, so I’m not gonna take up all the time,
but my name is Sharly Schaffer.  I’m currently in environmental science,
a junior at NC A&amp;T.  I just wanted to come to tell you guys I’m from
San Jose, CA and coming from the west all the way to the east, it’s kind
of different.
San Jose is--we don’t have a lot of black people.  The amount of black
people is .2%, so in my classes, I was the only black kid in all the
classes.  Coming here, I grew, I found myself as an individual .  I
became something better.  I succeeded.  And without HBCUs, I don’t know,
I’d be another statistic, I’d be another number in the classroom.  I’d
just be the only black kid.
So being at HBCU, being at A&amp;T, especially with so much tutoring and
so much opportunities to do experiments, and work in the labs, it’s just
amazing.  And I’m just so grateful for HBCUs and attending A&amp;T.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??, give your name and where you’re from.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My name is Mayor Fred Gates.  I’m the mayor of Winfall, NC.  And I
happen to serve on the board of trustees at Elizabeth City State
University.  I’m not speaking for the board, so don’t misquote me,
please, but the board and the chancellor of Elizabeth City State
University is working very, very, very hard together to bring about an
enrollment increase.
The major economic impact of Elizabeth City State University in the
northeastern region is tremendous.  We appreciate the black legislative
caucus of taking this task on and making it a priority.  We are hoping
that the general assembly and the governor will provide the funds that’s
necessary to keep these HBCU’s operating.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, I have one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, just go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For you, I’m sure you get regular updates on how things are going at
Elizabeth City.  Do you have any current data on sort of how the
applications are looking for fall and what your numbers might be like?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They’re looking very good, very good.  We, matter of fact, we’re gonna
have a transfer date, April 7, that’s when students can come with their
credentials and be accepted on that day, using the community colleges.
We’ve got five community colleges in the district that we serve, and any
other school that wants to transfer into Elizabeth City State
University.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me add something to you about Elizabeth City State.  I just had a
client that made a significant contribution of half a million dollars to
Elizabeth City State University for the aviation school.  That half
million dollar donation turned, went to state
  </p>
  
  
  <h3>25:00</h3>

  <p id="25:00">
  Its share to that, $255,000 in there with the foundation there adding
another sum to it, brought that whole donation to $1 million as an
endowed share in the school of aviation and science in Elizabeth City.
That was my client. I’m a North Carolina Central graduate, so you know,
I had to get a bite of pudding on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And by the way, Elizabeth City State University is the only school in
this area that has an aviation program.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, that’s true.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I want to add on to the question. While it’s still early to look at
indicators, one thing that I believe is very important and we’ve
continued to impress upon colleagues as well as the Governor, is when in
this bill, members of the general assembly begin to talk and information
goes out talking about possible closure when language is placed into a
budget initially that references studying closure, that does not help
enrollment. So for there to be some initial preliminary indicators,
favorable indicators, that says a lot, but the reality of it is when any
governing authority is talking closure we have to be very mindful and
sensitive of what implications that language and that dialogue in itself
may have. So as there may be preliminary favorable indicators, I would
imagine, what would it be without that communication. And long story
short, we had a great communication, very constructive. There appears to
be a commitment to our HBCUs and with that being said, our conversations
must be geared around not only our HBCUs but all of our universities in
the system success. How do we bring about student success, performance?
How do we bring about success in our communities in terms of their
transition into the workforce and so forth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We also wanted to acknowledge councilman Horton from coming all the way
from Elizabeth City and as Senator Davis was sharing, the important
thing is to keep the conversation going. We must continue to dialogue
and support together.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do, yeah. I’m wondering, I understand what you’re saying about the
history and the heritage and the strength of these institutions. I’m
wondering if you all see the need for them to change given the rising
young population in North Carolina and the Latino population, the whole
shifting population of North Carolina in general. Do you think they need
to change?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think they are meeting that change much more so than the historically
white institutions, simply because we’ve been in that position to have
to meet the changes as they came, as they come about. So with the
shifting population, with the shift even in age group, you’re finding
now with most people who are going to colleges not in the 18-22 age
group, is somewhat a bit older than that. These institutions, these
HCBUs have served that type of population before, and they continue to
serve it now. So the, for us, there is no change. It’s just bolstering,
and I think once folks begin to realize we have been a bedrock in the
communities both white and black, then they’ll understand the necessity
of keeping these schools intact.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions? We want to thank you for coming, give you another,
make sure you have another question. You’re doing a good job, keep
asking us good questions. Thank you for, you get videos for, you can get
your own pictures, but if you need video let us know. But thank you for
coming to be with us today. Thank you.
