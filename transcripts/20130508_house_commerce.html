But at person job development and charity committee thanks everyone for
attending we have to start alarms with us today we have built a house
Joe Crooke and Martha Garrison identified job has another five bills
that we have before us today started off organized start with House Bill
69 opportunity advancement zones are presented for the builders of
talking about the pros committee substitute is Bill yes there isn't
represented Brown moves the PTSD probably before the committee represent
for your recognized present the bill? Good morning members of the
committeeshort and sweet on this one it is not a simple meal but it is
very important to what this bill would allow for us inside of specific
County areas that could be set your County that are more broader or more
or less economically depressed in other sections of the counties and
this would provide based on the specific criteria which is in the BLM
will take the time to go over you to redirect their is that it would
enable the county to determine where those districts are where those
areas are inside accounting and they could effectively address more
economic development that went through the current North Carolina tier
system and I'm a vital request? Further discussion for the delay on the
legislation ribs and what will question from Bill sponsor direct as
escort mission to orbit that I just need to put my mind at ease on this
question of an AV rating is totally incorrect that when I think of a out
the save accounting it where you're from and having a particular
segments of the county that could be here differently and I walked a
little bit late some off key here is to check me out so for your mind is
easier to calculate on in our more remote rural areas you may have to
grab an extra 30 or 45 minutes to get to where there may be a job but in
our world is populated areas in IDE or places I had better write access
jet drive only 10 minutes to get from one area to the next to find the
next best jobs of overall a big pot of money split some inlays now if
they can be split more ways that now it deletes the ones I probably have
the fighters to go to get a job as what I would appreciate your dress
with our I'll address it with my own analogy if I would if the world
according to John aside from the money to keep the state solving out
into the treasury try finer people jobs as well with it and what this
bill actually does it provides people of counties that have varying
degrees of economic up and down provide the enzymatic tool toolbox to
hopefully do something to attract jobs in those counties wherever they
are located and that's the purpose of visits to do everything we can
within our legislative powers to try to provide for additional job
opportunities out there an animal that eases your mind or not but that's
the intent in and out in the explanation thank you Ursula to recognize a
large network of early literacy recognize that disorder question for all
the organized boundary question still it would be safe to assume that
the intent of this video would be to level the playing field throughout
the county so everybody is equal opportunity for job creation if you're
addressing it from the economic opportunity to it in list businesses to
come to a specific area of the county it would assist with back yes is
far as the level playing field for job opportunity I would hope that
that that exists today I believe it does this just present a provisos
additional tool in in the county's economic toolbox 22 hopefully it will
bring that industry indicates that if it's a route to the human one
more, tool and will come to your area this is what provides what you
can't do it across the county you have to have specific targeted areas
inside accounting which are very specifically drafted in the words of
higher</p>

...Catlin, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As we're trying to lower our
taxes, which is going to be our big discussion in the next month, what's
the fiscal impact of this? How many tax dollars are we going to be
taking out of the overall pool and as we're trying to lower taxes on
everything?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Catlin, let me also make a point here,
that this bill does have to go to finance and so that probably would be
a question for finance. Representative Torbett, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll go with the Chairman's discretion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Avila, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I know I came in late on the
discussion, but in catching myself up to this, I don't know that I've
got so much a question as I've got a comment. Because I think I've seen
this on a smaller scale when we tried to manipulate business within
cities with enterprise zones. I think with something like this, good
intended though it may be, that we're just creating complexity of a
system that when we look at the overall health of the State and we look
at the overall fairness to the tax codes in the corporate and personal
world, that we need to focus our efforts in that direction. We need to
be able to work with these areas of the State and they come to us with
issues as they develop. I'm just a little concerned with so much
nitpicking micromanaging from the level of the State and creating some
areas and I don't know if other areas where they've been tried that we
really see the hoped for results.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Torbett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Thank you, Representative Avila. We
obviously have a little bit of different variation of looking at this. I
would ask all the committee members to think about yes, multiple folks
in this room are looking at the new tax policies as being advantageous
for job growth. However, they're currently not in place. They have yet
to be approved. And what I'm looking at is, and what I know in my heart
of hearts, is that if we can't get our folks to work by providing them
any necessary tool to enable opportunity for job growth when our current
industries and enlisting new industries. If we can't get them to work
earning an income, it doesn't matter what tax policy is in play because
nobody's going to have an income to apply to it. So I see it more
importantly to also, before we address our tax policy or simultaneously
to make sure we pull all stops and get our people employed in the great
State of North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Robert Brawley, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask, just to confirm. In Iredell County, one
section of county they've got a $73,000 medium income. Another section
of the county has a $31,000 medium income. The $31,000 area could come
under a different opportunity from the $73,000.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Real quick, Mr. Chairman. As long as that specific,
very well defined area meets the criteria ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative George Graham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm trying to
understand this particular proposal here. I'm of the understanding that
at the end of the day, what really matters is what it costs to develop a
job.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Torbett, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, I ask him to respectfully repeat the
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm trying to look at the end of the day, what we're
looking at is to cost of an incentive to create and develop that job.
Here, it seems to me, that what we're doing is we're going to have two
or three different systems within the overall system within the county
that's going to, you would need to put all those factors on the table
before you could determine what it's going to cost to create that
particular job.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually, Mr. Chairman, if I may. My economic guy and
the county manager tells me it's very simple. Once criteria is met and
an area is defined, it's located, it's mapped. Everybody knows where
that is. And so it just be an added addition. It's not a multiplier,
it's not a heavy piece of paperwork. They just add that additional
component for that opportunity advancement zone area. It's not a hard
process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do we know what the average cost per job in our
counties are now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The average cost per job? I do have that under the
current tier...</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Shepard, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair for a question of the sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Torbett, has anyone from our local or regional economic
development committees organizations weighed in on their input on
this--what they think--have we heard anything on it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
From the Gaston area they did weigh in on it.  Because Gaston, much like
Cleveland and some of the other counties that were mentioned, pretty
much has a split.  There's like a natural divide, where you have the
more affluent from the less--I even hate to put tags on people, but
that's what people are using in here today. All I'm trying to do is
develop areas that--across the state--that if it's a specifically
blighted or more heavily impacted they have an additional tool
there--they can attract industry there in hopes of opportunity for jobs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Final comment from Representative Goodman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Seems to me that a county like Mecklenburg or
Wake has the economic resources to create their own advancements on
zones within the county where a poor county--a tier one county--like
Richmond or Scotland, or Robeson, which I represent, do not have the
local resources to be able to do that.  And, I think that's the
difference that we're looking at there.  The district I'm in goes from
Robeson all the way to Montgomery, and every one of those counties are
tier one.  So, where somebody in a depressed neighborhood in Mecklenburg
can drive a few miles to another part of the county to get a good job,
where I live they gotta drive 50 or 60 miles to get out of one of those
zones.  So, I think this is a very problematic issue and I'm going to
vote against it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, if I may?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you so much.  Representative Goodman, I understand your sentiment.
 And, what I fear most of all is that we're getting to a we against
them--or us against them--mentality in North Carolina, because of the
poor economy we have.  And, I assure you, like I say, to the bottom of
my heart, that the intent and the direction is we should be looking to
find any and every opportunity to hire, to provide opportunity for job
growth for any and every North Carolinian.  I don't care where they are.
 But to continue this us against them, or rich against poor, or small
county against big county, it--to me--is just absurd.  I'm sorry, I live
in a county that has both.  It has absolutely both.  And we have to use
every tool we can devise to provide for job growth.  And, forget the us
against them.  We have to do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One final follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do not question your motives and I know your
intentions are good, but I just see the results being different from
what is intended here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Waddell, you're recognized for your motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I also represent one of those tier one
counties.  In fact, I represent three tier 1 counties.  And, I
understand the bill sponsor's intent, I believe, in this bill.  I went
and talked to the bill sponsor about it.  And I do believe that--you
know--in this state--this great state of North Carolina--we need to be
looking for jobs everywhere we can.  And I do hope that that's going to
cause those jobs to come back down into my tier 1 counties, too.  And,
when having said all that, I move that we have a favorable report for
the proposed committee substitute for House Bill 69 and refer it to
Finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Motion is properly before us, Representative Torbett?

Further discussion, further debate on the motion?  All those in favor
will say aye; all opposed say no; unable--the Chair is unable to

<p id="25:00">
for a presentation on House Bill 563.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning everyone. You
have in front of you, before you House Bill 563, and uh, what this bill
is all about is we're trying to create a foreign trade zone in
northeastern North Carolina using the Port of Norfolk. And the, this is
a tremendous opportunity for rural counties who are experiencing
significantly high unemployment and have been experiencing that kind of
unemployment for decades, sadly. This is an opportunity for us as the
fourth poorest Congressional District in the United States to take
advantage of partnering up with the, with the Port of Norfolk, and, uh,
the, uh, the opportunities that that will create. The dichotomy is this,
the Hampton Roads area is one of the fastest growing areas in the
country, and just across the border, within 60 or 90 miles, 60 minutes
or 90 miles we have, um, uh, 50, we have four or five counties that are
identified as finger counties, and these counties would serve as points
of assembly and so forth for businesses that are going to, would like to
locate in Norfolk clear, next to the port, but can't because there is no
room there for them to, uh, for them to expand. So the very natural
expansion for them would to be look Sou-, would be to look Southward to
those finger counties. So this is a bill that I'm really excited about.
This is something that I think is really going to be, create an economic
reneassance in northeastern North Carolina that badly needs it. And I
think it's pretty self-explanatory, the Port of Norfolk, the Port
Authority, they are very excited about this opportunity as well, and
this bill will enable us to partner up with them to create what I think
is just something very exciting that will not only touch northeastern
North Carolina, but, I believe the entire eastern sector of the state
will benefit as a result.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do members have the copy of the legislation before
you, it's House Bill 563? Has that bill been passed out? This side has
it? You have the summary. Members have the summary. The summary's longer
than the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's in the folder.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's in the folder? It's in the folder? It's in the
folder.
[inaudible]
Representative Jeter, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Um, if I could just briefly, well hopefully briefly
speak. I appreciate what Representative Steinburg's doing, and I
understand the provision of what he's trying to accomplish, but as
someone who makes his living in the trucking logistics and shipping
industry, let me tell you my concern with this bill. He, he referenced
it a couple times, this will be great for the poor in Norfolk, but we
have to understand, the Panama Canal is being widened for the first time
in a generation, which is going to allow super ships to come through the
Panama Canal that current, that can't currently get through the Atlantic
Seaboard. Anything we do to allocate those steam ships to go through the
Norfolk Port versus Wilmington, Morehead city, is going to be dangerous
to the existing economies we get. And let me tell you why I have such
concerns, it's not easy to get from Norfolk or Representative
Steinburg's district to where the major manufacturers are, and that's in
tier one, tier two, tier three counties to take, to take on a theme. And
it's not easy to get to the major population centers because of the way
the roads are built. That's not Representative Steinburg's fault, that's
just the reality of it is. Trucks buy mileage in road, if we advocate
and allocate a policy that increases more freight to Norfolk and that
port, it will diminish the amount of fre-, manufacturing in the rest of
the state, because it takes more miles to get there. Trucks buy miles,
trucks pay by miles, if you, if it costs more miles to get there, it
costs more money, the less likely they are to relocate in every else,
everybody else's county. And I appreciate the, what he's trying to do,
but I just think this is a bad, bad policy for the rest of the state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Steinburg, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Uh, Representative Jeter, with all due respect sir,
uh, this, this particular bill is, uh, is directly related to those five
finger counties in northeastern North Carolina. We don't expect that
folks in the other parts of the state are going to be using this. We're
going to designate foreign trade zone status</p>

...within these five counties, that's it. The Port of Norfolk is built
out, there is nothing more they can do in terms of having places for
assembly and so forth. They need space. This space is going to be
located within these five counties. These five counties have excessive
unemployment. This is an opportunity for us, the fourth poorest
congressional district in the country - in the country, not in the
state, in the country - to take advantage of the fastest growing
metropolitan area, which is right across the border in Virginia. For us
not to pass this bill is complete insanity. These counties are desperate
for employment and we have a plan here that can give it to them. It's
not going to impact your business or others in other parts of the state.
They can continue doing business as they've been doing it. This is
merely to build upon the problem or take advantage of the problem the
Port of Norfolk has right now, as opposed to the problem that we have
right now, which is excessive unemployment. So this is something that is
going to bring jobs to this region. We're looking at that for this
region, these five counties.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Steinburg, I've got 12 people on the
queue to list and we will vote these bills out this week. And if we
don't do it today, we will do it seven in the morning. So Representative
Larry Bell, you're recognized. Representative Tine, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chairman. I'll just speak briefly.
It was summarized very well. This is about economic development in the
Northeast. The former Logistics Chair for the Northeast Commission,
which takes all of these different considerations that Representative
Jeter was talking about, into consideration. And this is an investment
in economic development. It's going to require some additional
infrastructure, but we do have assets that they don't have, from way
down areas for manufacturing projects, to collection areas, to areas
that we could then start some manufacturing and start some of those
businesses right there in those five, which they wouldn't have very far
to travel. So at the appropriate time, I'd like to make a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Millis, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chair. Just a friendly comment in
regard to Representative Jeter's response to Representative Steinburg is
that that widening of the Panama Canal, one thing to consider about
Representative Steinburg's bill and this traffic going to Norfolk is
that we have to consider the capacity for the Port of Wilmington and
also the Port of Morehead to be able to harbor these ships. And one
thing that we need to consider is that these large ships coming in at
the Port of Norfolk, may have more access and capacity to harbor this
ships than Wilmington and Morehead and therefore they're not able to
take advantage of the shipping and trucking. That these ships will not
come to Wilmington or to Morehead potentially.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Shephard, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chair. Basically, I was going to
echo what Representative Millis said. I've been working with the
transportation of the Military and the Marine Core for 36 years. There
are a lot of things that could not go into Wilmington and Morehead City
that could go into the Norfolk Port. They could not handle some of the
items we ship in some of the ships, so I would counter what
Representative Jeter said, that thought that it is a plus, this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Riddell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chairman. I would just agree with
the previous comments of Representative Shephard and Millis. I have
sailed as a US merchant seaman into Charleston, into Wilmington,
Morehead and Norfolk. And the waters of Wilmington and Morehead City
unfortunately do not have the draft capacity to handle a Panamax sized
ship, so it's a new question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative George Graham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chair. I just wanted to simply echo
what has simply been said. The economic trade zone is awfully important.
We recruited spirit owl systems to come down to Lenoir County, and one
of the things that they demanded prior to coming or settling an
agreement, is that we put together the trade zone. That is critically a
piece that you need in your toolbox.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Graham. Representative
Floyd.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm just amazed when we start talking about jobs and
jobs and jobs, and we look at the mountains and we look at the
Southeastern part of our state which is about the most poorest in our
state. And we can create some jobs, both from the creation of this zone
and also from the infrastructure which may follow that, then I think
that this is a good opportunity for this state. It's about jobs to our
poorest other than the county right about me going to South Carolina, so
I support this.</p>

Rep. Avila --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is just a point of
inquiry for the staff. Could you tell us how many current foreign trade
zones we have in the state?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe it's six.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Recognize the follow-up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you by any chance know where they're located
generally?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I can get you the map, Rep. Avila. I know there's one
that's in Wilmington, one in the GlobalTrans? Park. There's one in
Charlotte. There's one in the Triangle, I think. But I can get you the
map of where they're located.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Starnes, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Question for staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Merchandise that comes into these trade zones are free
from ad valorem taxes. Does this, will this bill have any adverse impact
on either municipal or county revenues. This does have a subsequent
referral to Finance, Rep. Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does she have a quick answer to that question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No sir, I don't know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Szoka --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. My concern on this bill was that
what we have here between our short-term objectives in the state and our
long-term objectives. I’ve heard Sec. Trotzler ? and Sec. Decker speak
several times over the last month talking about our ports, the
infrastructure that we need to build up those ports that are in North
Carolina. And my concern is I've heard one or two of the representatives
say that there'll be some need for infrastructure to support this. In
our long-term vision of building up Wilmington and Moorehead City, if we
commit to this, we could in fact be diverting resources for our ports
that could definitely bring in a whole lot more money for our citizens
than supporting Norfolk. And that's my concern with the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Stein, be here recognized for ? to respond.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Am I on here? Okay. Rep. Szoka, I believe that you
heard the comments the other evening from Gov. McCrory when he was
talking about his new transportation plan. Were you there when the
Governor was speaking? I don't know if you heard that or not. Okay. The
Governor did speak specifically about northeastern North Carolina and
for us to take advantage of the Norfolk tidewater area as a gateway
region into the state. This is in no way meant to take away from your
ports in your particular district. This is to provide additional
business and revenue for the northeastern region, additional employment.
And I think in fact that your region may be able to even expand upon
this. And I'm saying that as it relates to other points that have been
made here previously.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Catlin --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. To answer a couple of questions: This
doesn't impact, foreign trade zones don't impact ad valorem tax. They're
duty deferrals, which allow ships that are, or something that's being
shipped out of Norfolk that doesn't have to, it could be stored in North
Carolina without having to pay a duty. The post-Panama Canal ships don't
fit in any of the Wilmington or Moorehead City ports. So right now those
ships are going to go to Charleston,  or they're going to go to Norfolk,
so if we can get some benefit out of what goes to Norfolk, I think we
should. The foreign trade zones, they are normally expanded by what's
called an alternative-site framework that I've been working on for two
years. It's not done yet, and we've got an existing foreign trade zone
at the GlobalTrans Park. Typically this would be a magnet site to that.
There would be no necessary infrastructure to make that, if there would
be infrastructure for whoever wanted to use it. But I have question
about this. This might be a staff question. I have no idea how this
definition of &quot;public corporation&quot; is going to create a magnet
site for a foreign trade zone. If it does, I totally support it, and I
don't have to have that answer right now. But this would be good for
North Carolina. But I have some concerns that this may not do anything.
So that's my question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Catlin, we struggled with the language as well
when we were developing this ? the bill's sponsor, and that's about as
good as it's going to get as far as how to define it. So I'll let staff
respond to that. But we went through the same kind of just how are we
going to define to get the goal. So I'll let the staff explain that as
well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Rep. Catlin, as the Chair
indicated we had some concerns that this language was actually doing
what was intended. What we discovered in working with the ? county
economic developer and [CUTS OFF]</p>

...with the federal trade zone, Representative, the best thing to do,
essentially, is to mirror the federal definition of this term, and
that's what this bill has done. It adds a clause that mirrors the
federal definition, and since we would have to get it approved by the
Federal Trade Zone Board, they'd prefer to see language that's like
their language, so that's why it is the way it is.
The Chairman: You're recognized for a followup question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Just real quickly, we will get the alternative site
framework authorization from the U.S. Department of Commerce soon? Or
I'll be very upset if we don't, but I think we will. And whether this
works or not, we'll still be able to do it by making your area a magnet
site to an existing foreign trade zone.
Representative Brian Brown: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Representative Catlin actually said a lot of what I wanted to say, so
I'll be briefer, but my concern was exactly the language in the bill and
how this will create a magnet site, so I'm glad that was brought up. But
just a friendly comment to Representative Szoka's concern of what this
would actually do, as someone who lives in the eastern part of the
state, and one of the largest areas in the eastern part of the state, I
can assure you that manufacturing and shipping and these industries
within our county, they don't ship things out of Moorehead City and
Wilmington; it's cheaper to send it to Norfolk, it's cheaper to send it
to Charleston. That's just the facts. If we can't pull anything, can't
pull any revenue, can create any jobs and any advancement whatsoever in
these northeastern counties, who are very poor, that is exactly what we
need to do.
And the reality of it is, too, regardless to what we do from an
infrastructure standpoint, in those two state ports, those five
counties, it's pure business economics -- they're still going to send
that product out of Norfolk. They're not going to send it to Wilmington;
they;re not going to send it to Moorehead City. It's just about
proximity.
So I fully support this bill and anything we can do to support the
northeast region, we need to do.
The Chairman: Representative Dollar, you're recognized.
Representative Dollar: I'll try not to be repetitive, but that area of
the state, the northeast area of the state, unfortunately is more of a
drain on the state budget than it is a contributor, so anything that we
can do that will help them develop the economy in the northeast will be
a tremendous help, not only to the rest of the state, certainly to the
state's budget, and most importantly, to the people who live up in the
northeast, who've had just tremendous, longstanding, systemic
difficulties in developing the economy.
The Chairman: Further discussion, further debate?
Representative Tine, you're recognized for a motion.
Representative Tine: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you, Representative
Dollar for the backhanded support.
[laughs] I move for a favorable report, and I did not see on line that
it had a serial referral; has that been added?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] It has been determined that it has had a serial
referral to Finance, a referral to Finance, by the Rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] That's correct.
The Chairman: Motion is properly in force. All those in favor say aye;
all those opposed say no. In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it,
the ayes do have it. [gavel]
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you, committee, and
thank you for the spirited debate.
The Chairman: We are displace House Bill 201. Please check your
calendars. We will reschedule. One of the beauties of the House Commerce
Committee is that the House Commerce Committee meets upon the call of
the Chair. So be watchful for your emails, because the Chair will call a
meeting tomorrow on House Bill 201, but I will relinquish the gavel to
present the next two bills.
The Chairman Pro Tempore: Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Next up will be House Bill 65, short title, amend pharmacy laws. We have
PCS before us. Representative Catlin makes the motion. All in favor say
aye.
Mr. Chairman, you have the floor.
The Chairman: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's a pleasure for me to present
House Bill 65, amend pharmacy laws. At this time I would like to make a
motion for a favorable report to the proposed committee substitute.
Section one of the legislation deals with establishing certified
pharmacy technicians. Currently pharmacy technicians have to have a job
in order to register with the Board of Pharmacy. This creates a
situation where a certified pharmacy technician, someone whose training
has already been verified through the certification process, can
register with the Board of Pharmacy without having to get a job, so we
can get the individual qualified before they register with the Board of
Pharmacy.
Section 5 of the legislation, if I could skip to that section --
Representative Susan Martin brought this to my attention -- North
Carolina schedule two prescriptions, the written prescription does not
expire; it has no expiration date. So I'm going to let that one sink in
for a little bit. The most controlled medications -- the written

For small business to raise capital. Congressmen Patrick McHenry…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Murray.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have a PCS before us. Representative Brown makes the motion. All in
favor say aye. Continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Congressmen Patrick McHenry sponsored this legislation in congress and
the Federal Government is working on establishing rules to the Security
Exchange Commission and it’s been in the law for over a year and no
rules have been promulgated so the advocates for this idea are going
State by State to get this exemption, this investment exemption in the
State of North Carolina. Kansas has already passed this law. Georgia’s
already passed this law. And I have a constituent here from Morrisville
who brought this idea to me and he’s Mark Easley. Mr. Chairman, I
believe we’ve got this room until noon so if you could recognize my
constituent who brought this idea to me, Mark Easley I’d appreciate it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, do members have the PCS or am I just the only one?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Who’s asking the question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes, I have the PCS, nobody else has the PCS? If you
have a PCS raise your hand. The majority of the committee has the PCS.
If the Sergeant of Arms could provide a PCS to Representative Starnes
I’d appreciate it. Mr. Easley if you could state your name for the
record.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Push the button Mark.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me. I’m Mark Easley. I’m a local Angle Investor and start up
adviser and part of the job 10CT that initiated this legislative effort.
I want to briefly describe and summarize what this exemption is and what
it is not. First what it is not. It is not some radical change to the
North Carolina or Federal Securities Laws. Equity Investment Crowd
Funding is also not like Kick Starter which might make you think people
will be able to go up to any crowd funding website and click on buy and
get some shares in a start up. No, no, far from it. So what is it? It is
definition of a new and simple securities law exemption that will make
it much easier for small businesses across our State to find investors
and sell stock in their company using Equity Investment Crowd Funding.
The normal security laws still apply for selling equities but the NC
jobs exemption allows 2 things that are new. Number 1, the exemption
allows unaccredited North Carolina investors, in other words, all your
friends and neighbors, to buy equities from the North Carolina issuing
company provided the disclosure reporting registration and limits
described in the exemption are allowed. Number 2 new thing, the North
Carolina issuer is allowed to promote the offering via the web or any
other method provided that the disclosure reporting registration and
limits described in the exemption are followed. That’s it, very simple.
So what will happen? A North Carolina entrepreneur will do what they
always do to get financing, which is take their idea, turn it into a
plan, figure out how much money they need and write it all down in a way
that a potential investor can understand. Then they will get assistance
in turning that into a sale of equities offering that meets all the
requirements of the exemption and North Carolina Securities Law. They
will also open up an escrow account in a bank or other escrow providers
that will hold the invested funds until the minimum amount required by
the offering is raised before it can be turned over to the company. At
that point, they will register with the Secretary of States Office to
let them know that they will be using the exemption.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mark, I appreciate you being here. We’ve got to be out of here in less
than 5 minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So let me just summarize. After that, they’ll find an investor and they
will do a private sale, direct sale from the company to the investor
using the standard documentation and equity securities documentation
that we use today. It’s really that simple.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for your comments. Thanks Mark.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Shepherd.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, Mr. Chair. For a motion that is appropriate in time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s a brilliant bill. I was going to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Bob Garner. Any questions from Representative Avila?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just one quick question in a illustration example. Give me one example
of what their exempted from that would help in this situation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A lot of the Broker dealer aspects where you have to register with the
Secretary of your State and all that kind of stuff. We have worked with
the Secretary of States Office to make sure that this exemption, they
still have a filing that they have to do, the Secretary of State but
your basically talking about a mom and pop type operation using a web
based platform to raise capital in small investments. We’re talking…in
the current version it’s $2000.00, some of the States have gone up to
$5000.00 but small investments and to help using</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I’ve been a securities dealer and I’ll just be honest with
you. I don’t want to go down this road. You’re talking about some rather
risky investments and you’re allowing some people to make some sales to
your friends and your neighbors without the proper disclosures or
oversight of the normal course of securities that are offered in this
state, and it better be buyer beware. You’re going down a road that we
haven’t been down before and I’m not going to vote for it. There are
consumer protections in this legislation for that escrow is not issued
to the company until they reach a certain threshold and that they have
to have a certain number of ??, and so we are putting in some consumer
protections, but when Congressman McHenry sponsored this legislation ??
in this legislation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Terry
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Did you say that there is a SEC report that is pending about this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This bill has been signed by President Obama over a year ago and the
Securities and Exchange Commission hasn’t promulgated any federal
regulations on this and that’s why we have a 2017 sunset on this
legislation because by 2017 we expect that the Securities and Exchange
Commission will have rules promulgated and implemented for the nation,
but in the meantime if we can help our small businesses in North
Carolina in the interim, we think that this SEC will be available and
the rules will be promulgated.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just worry about that impact.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have two more questions then we’ll hear the motion. Representative
Hall. Representative Stone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just want to make sure I understand this. By 2017 they are going to
come up with the rules. Is it our predication that by 2017 the federal
Securities and Exchange Commission will enable crowd funding at the
Federal level. We don’t want to inhibit small businesses to use crowd
funding in our state while we are waiting on the federal government to
promulgate regulations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They will be able to go ahead and do crowd funding in North Carolina
even though we are waiting on the rules from the Federal government.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We are more nimble, our secretaries state office will move at a rate
faster than the federal government to help enable crowd funding in our
state, and by 2017 this bill will expire and the federal government
regulations will supersede.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please sir. Is this bill have a ?? referral?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This bill goes to finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.

Representative Shepard, your recognized for your motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir Mr. Chair, I’d like to make a motion that we accept the proposed
?? substitute the house bill 680 unfavorable to the original with
referral to finance.

Motion is properly before us. All in favor say aye.
