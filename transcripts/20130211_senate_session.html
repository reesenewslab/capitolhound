The Senate will come to order. The Sergeant-At-Arms will close the
doors. Members will go to their seats. Leading the Senate in prayer is
Reverend Peter Milner, Senate Chaplain. All members and guests in the
gallery please stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let us pray. Loving God, tonight as I stand before you as we bow our
hearts to pray, I feel most vulnerable, exposed, because I just don’t
know what to pray or what to ask for. For I truly have nothing to offer
you, nor anything to say. We know, our father, that at this hour, at a
place where we might feel your absence, this is perhaps a time when
you’re drawing near as we feel weak, as we are able to draw down on your
grace. In this place at this desperate hour in state affairs, we need
you, we need your strength, your guidance, and your wisdom. The problems
far greater than any wisdom of man can solve. What shall our leaders do
in such an hour. May thy wisdom and power come upon the leadership of
this Senate to whom have been entrusted leadership. May the
responsibility lie heavily on their hearts until they’re ready to
acknowledge their helplessness and turn to you. Give to them the courage
and the moral integrity to confess that they don’t know what to do and
that they can come empty handed to you. Only then can they lead us as a
state and as a nation beyond human wisdom to thee, who alone has the
answer. Oh our God, may we never recover from our feeling of
helplessness and our need of you. In the strong name of Jesus our Lord
we pray. Amen.
