[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House joint resolution 64, a joint resolution honoring the 50th

Senate concurring.
Rep. Ross, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The House will come to order, the lady has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I'd like to ask that the resolution be read in its entirety
before I speak please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Whereas the State Legislative building was completed in January 1963,
making 2013 the 50th anniversary of the building's opening. And whereas
by the late 1950s facilities in the state capitol, which had been used
for sessions of the general assembly since 1840 were increasingly
becoming insufficient to accommodate the members of the general assembly
and their staff. And whereas the 1959 the general appropriated funds for
a new building to accommodate the legislature and enacted legislation
establishing the state legislative  building commission, and whereas the
commission consisted of the following members: Archie K. Davis and
Robert F. Morgan, Vice Chair, who were appointed by Lt. Governor Luther
Barnhard, President of the Senate. Bird-eye Satterfield and Thomas J.
White, Chair, who were appointed by Addison Hewlett, Speaker of the
House of Representatives, and A. E. Finley and Edwin Gill and Orville
Row who were appointed by Governor Luther Hodges. And whereas among its
many duties, the commission was charged with acquiring a site suitable
for a state legislative building, employing architects to prepare the
plans for the building, entering into contracts to purchase real
property, materials, and furnishings related to the building, and
providing general supervision of construction of the new building. And
whereas the commission selected architect Edward Durell Stone of New
York, and associate architects John S. Holloway and Ralph B. Reeds, Jr.
of Raleigh to design the new building, and whereas Edward Durell Stone,
an Arkansas native is widely considered to have been one of the
foremost, the most prominent 20th century American architects, having
designed numerous college, museum, and corporate buildings across the
United States. And whereas Edward Durell Stone was an internationally
recognized advocate for modern design, having designed prominent public
buildings in Canada, Mexico, Panama, India Pakistan, Lebanon, Croatia,
and Belgium. And whereas in 1961, the general assembly provided
additional funding to furnish and equip the building, bringing the total
appropriation for the new building to $5.5 million. And whereas the
state legislative building rises from a broad, 340-foot wide podium of
North Carolina granite, with a marble face building proper encompassed
by colonnade of square columns reaching from the podium to the main roof
of the second floor. And whereas the main entrance to the state
legislative building has a 28-foot diameter terrazzo mosaic of the great
seal of the state of North Carolina, and whereas the state legislative
building houses the chambers of the Senate and the House of
Representatives, members offices, principal clerk's offices, committee
rooms, and state</p>

for other essential functions of the General Assembly. And whereas North
Carolina was the first state to construct a building to house the
legislature, and whereas the General Assembly convened its first session
in the State Legislative building on February 6th, 1963. And whereas the
State Legislative building is today considered to be one of Edward
Durell Stone's most important works, along with such notable buildings
as the Kennedy Center, the National Geographic building in Washington,
D.C., and the Museum of Modern Art and the General Motors building in
New York City. And whereas the state legislative building has been an
important institution for the general assembly and for the citizens of
this state for 50 years, no therefore be it resolved by the House of
Representatives, the Senate concurring. Section 1, the General Assembly
honors the memory of the late Edward Durell Stone as well as many others
who helped to conceive, design, construct, and build the state
legislature building. Section 2, the state General Assembly expresses
appreciation to the 1959 General Assembly for the actions it took to
ensure the General Assembly had the appropriate funds and resources to
build the State Legislative building which as been a significant symbol
of state government for the past 50 years. Section 3, this resolution is
effective upon ratification.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Ross is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen. First there
are a few people to thank, for this resolution and the research that was
done to put it together. The first person I need to thank is Rep. Grier
Martin who served in this body and reminded me last fall that we needed
to do this resolution and put me in touch with some people who could
help. The second person is our clerk Denise Weeks, who did some research
of her own and put that into the resolution, and the third person is a
man named Myrick Howard who runs Preservation North Carolina, which is a
statewide organization dedicated to the preservation of historic
buildings and he dug up a lot of good information for our wonderful bill
drafter, Mirah Toraine. So don't think that I did all the work on this
resolution, lots of credit to share. This is a special day for the
legislature, and it's a special day for all of us because so many of our
colleagues have come back to join us today. It's also special because
we're celebrating the investment that this legislature has made in
infrastructure and important public buildings and architecture in the
state of North Carolina, this building being one of those examples. And
of course, the State Capitol Building being one of the first examples.
Recently the General Assembly has made investments in other kinds of
quality nationwide and worldwide acclaimed architecture, one of those
things is the North Carolina Museum of Art on Blue Ridge Road, and if
you haven't been there to visit, our new Secretary of Administration and
Rep. Weiss and I co-sponsored the funding for that building. Another is
right across Jones Street. If you go and look at the new addition to the
Museum of Natural Sciences. It has been acclaimed worldwide, and we've
had so many international visitors we can't even count how many
countries they've come from. So when we make these investments, we need
to be proud of them and they stand the test of time. We also need to
celebrate the creativity of our architects. And North Carolina's
produced several of them, even though Mr. Stone was not necessarily one
of them. But we had North Carolina architects involved. And if you drive
up Wilmington Street, you can see the building for the North Carolina
Association of Architects that was put there because the legislature saw
in its wisdom that that land could be used for private organization to
build on public property. The same with the State Bar building, which is
actually a state organization but it's building a new structure very
near the Legislature.
On a personal level, I want you to know that I've gotten to visit 3 of
the buildings that Mr. Stone designed, I've been to the Kennedy Center,
I've been to the Museum of Modern Art, and I've been to the US Embassy
in India, which interestingly really really reminds you of this
legislative building so I recommend it if you go to India that you go to
see it. This is a wonderful day to honor our history and to honor our
colleagues, and it is so special to have some of our former members with
us today. I commend the resolution to you.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House, and former members. My
first memories of this building occurred in the summer of 1963 when we
were visiting down here on the ?? day trip. I had the good fortune of
coming on the floor to see the members before the session. My father sat
back there in seat 106. His seat mate was former Governor Jim
Holshouser. So that was a great day for me as a young man to come down
here and see the makings of the state government, and I've always had a
fascination by it. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I commend the resolution
to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Pittman, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Maybe I'm telling my age a little bit to some of
the younger members in here, but when I was in the fifth grade, ten
years old, we came on a class trip up here to Raleigh, visited the
museums and the capital. We came over here, and this building was not
quite a year old at that time. I remember being very impressed with this
place. Good thing the teacher was leading us; I would have gotten lost
in here otherwise. But I remember that red carpet on that staircase
fascinated me, and I wanted to get on that thing so bad. And they
wouldn't let me get on that red carpet. Never entered my mind back then
that someday I'd be a member of this body, and maybe some of you
brothers still hadn't entered my mind. But I never thought that I'd ever
be a member here. I want to tell you, even though we may disagree from
time to time on some political issues, I assume that the reason that the
rest of you are here is the same reason I'm here: because we love the
citizens of this state and want to do the best we can for them. And so,
it's and honor and a privilege just to be here, and I thank each one of
you for your dedication and for what this building stands for, service
to the people. And I'm just thrilled to death to be here and celebrate
it. They did finally let us get on the carpet when we came to start this
session, so I guess my childhood wish was finally fulfilled. I'm just
thrilled that you love my home state, your home state, as I do, and
thank you so much for your service.

Representative Pitman, 50 years of effort paid off for you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House and our guest members
that are with us. It's odd that I'm going to stand up and proceed to
follow my colleague Representative West, whom I thought I was younger
than him all along. But, in 1963, some you know, prior to that, my story
that in junior high-- I went to Hugh Morrison Junior High, which became
Morrison High School, and then it's a post office now-- But, when I
would leave there in the afternoon, I would come through the old
capital, and my girlfriend and I would hang out in the gallery there and
look down in the chambers, and the spittoons were in use. I wasn't real
impressed at that age in my life, but then, in 1963, this building was
built, and it opened my senior year in high school at Broughton High
School. And we came over and saw the transformation, my girlfriend and I
that walked through the old capital, and we came over here and walked
through this place. And, I must admit, we sort of had an allegiance to
the older capital. This was new and beautiful and extremely different
for the skyline of Raleigh, having grown up here, but what a beautiful
building it has been. But I was told by former member, who is no longer
with us, Representative Gordon Allen from Person County, and he told me
when I first came up here-- We were sitting in the old capital, and he
looked around and pointed out the Speaker's office to me. We were in the
House chamber. He pointed out and said that's where the Speaker met
people, and the room across from that, right in the chamber, was where
the members met with each other and worked out the bills. He said,
&quot;And then, somebody over here got the harebrained idea that we
ought to have a secretary, and we built the monster down the hill.&quot;
I've always chuckled at that memory from Representative Allen, who
served in both these buildings. But what a great privilege it is for me
to be serving now in this beautiful building, and I commend the
resolution to you.

Finally in 1973, my office was down where the coffee room is in the 1200
court. Half of y'all don't even know where that is but that's all right.
And the office right up from it on the main corridor out there was the
one that I wanted but the legislator who was in there stayed about three
weeks and died. And not knowing the rules or anything, I moved into the
office. I really did. I moved in. I didn't ask nobody nothing. I said,
&quot;The man is gone, so you know the office is empty.&quot; So I just
went on and moved in. I didn't see the rules [??] I really didn't even
know who the Speaker was, you know, for a long time. But fortunately
they had pity on me and let me stay there. But those of you who don't
know, you really got it made now. We had that one office. And that was
the first year that we had legislative assistants. Because it used to be
a pool before that and when you wanted work done you had to go
downstairs in the basement and find somebody who was free to do the work
for you. But the problem was that your LA sat in the front part of the
office and you sat behind her. That's what the arrangement was and if
you had constituents to come in then she had to move out into the
hallway and sit there until you were through with your constituents. But
things have changed. We didn't even have the legislative office building
at that time. I can remember I. Beverly Lake was the one that kept, when
the building was built, I. Beverly Lake was the one that stopped the
tunnel from going under the road to that new building 'cause it was a
waste of time. So he said, &quot;Legislators are hearty. If you want to
do something, build a walkway across. It ain't gon' hurt 'em to walk in
the rain or the wind. It'll toughen 'em up a little bit.&quot; But
anyway, this building has withstood the test of time. It's a monument to
the way that we do business in this state. It's indicative of the people
who live in this state, and I commend the resolution to you.

Gardner, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]The first time I came here, since everybody else is
telling their story, I'll tell mine. I was in grade school, and this
building was still fairly new. And it was a real thrill to get to come
up here. And I remember how nice everybody was. I was in the seventh
grade, went to school in Gaston County. We left on a bus early in the
morning, came up here, and that was 1967. Tells my age a little bit too.
I recommend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
House. My wife was was telling me that when they had the open house when
this building was brand new, her parents drove her up one Sunday
afternoon so they could look at the building. Of course that was in, she
was from Harnett County. It wasn't very far to come. She just said she
remembered being impressed with the grand staircase and the red steps.
Well, you know, they didn't bring any school groups to Raleigh from
Caldwell County when I was growing up, so I was out of college and grown
before I ever came here and saw this building first hand. And I'll be
honest with you, when I, the first time I saw the building, I didn't
think it was especially pretty. And I thought, &quot;It's sort of plain
and stark looking.&quot; And I read a brochure and it said the walls
were built out of blocks made of crushed marble. And I thought,
&quot;Well, only in Raleigh would that be crushed marble. If that was in
Caldwell County that'd be a cement block.&quot; But you know, we've all
learned to call this our home away from home, and it has a special place
in each of our hearts. But you know what makes this special? This is the
Legislative Building. We're the only state in America that has a
building dedicated to the legislative body. All the other states, they
have a capitol, and they have their House and their Senate and their
Executive branches all in the same building. But we're special. We have
a Legislative Building. This building is dedicated to the legislative
branch.</p>

Thank you Mr. Speaker, I couldn't miss an opportunity to start this
session with a Churchill quote.  Who is surprised?  Winston Churchill
once said, &quot;We shape our buildings and then our buildings shape
us.&quot;  Representative Daughtry painted a picture of a rather
confusing building.  Which leads to a conclusion of how we might be
shaped.  But I'm happy to say that, as well, Representative Starnes
noted that this is truly a unique, in more ways than one, building.  The
only truly legislative building in the country.  For that we are
grateful and we are moved.  And it is a lesson for us and the state to
take that responsibility so very seriously as I am sure that we do.  It
is an honor to be here among you to serve our fellow citizens in this
building, I commend it to you for your consideration.

rules as you may recall a couple weeks ago, and we have the revised or
the permanent rules and what I would like to do is to simply go through
the changes from the temporary rules that we are presently operating
under to the permanent rules.</p>

<p id="035:00">
As proposed. So I'll go through these, these bulleted points. We made a
change to the three minute rebuttal following a previous question.
Presently the rules requires that the majority leader and the minority
leader themselves speak to issues of previous question unless they are
absent. The new rule allows the leaders to designate any other member to
speak, to offer that, that three minute rebuttal. We also narrowed the,
the rebuttal period on the previous question. Now, it would only apply,
it would only occur on the second and third readings of the bills. It
would not apply to amendments. So we, so we've expanded it in one way
and, and, and restricted it in another but again, it was, I would think
a very practical modification and I didn't hear, I didn't hear much
protest to that issue because it really was to ensure that there would
be an opportunity for some debate on that. And I think members can see
that last year when the previous question was called, generally it was
done after there had been substantial and protracted debate. Changes to
committees, we, under commerce and job development, we struck two
committees under there. Business and labor, science and technology, and
we created the new Regulatory Reform committee also with three new
subcommittees, those being business and labor, environmental, and local
government. We renamed public utilities to public utilities and energy
and we also created a new subcommittee under appropriations for
information technology. We adjusted the bill filing deadlines.
Commissions or committee recommended bills need to be filed by February
twenty seventh. They would have otherwise been subject to a later
deadline but frankly, those should all be finished at this time. Those
are things that, the reports have already been made, and they should be
ready to go. Public bills with a finance or appropriations component
must be filed by April seventeen of '03. The temporary rules had said
May eighth, but given our objective of when we were trying to adjourn,
it makes sense that those be done by April the seventeenth. There are no
bill filing deadlines for committee bills that are originated by the,
either the appropriations, finance, or rules, or rules committees. We
thought there is, if the committee finds something that, that warrants
or necessitates a stand alone bill, it's generally something to respond
to something that, that has come up for some reason and it would be
among those, obviously finance would deal with issues of finance
affecting the state, appropriations for appropriations issues, and rules
would kinda cover, run the gamut for everything else. There's a
technical clean up provision in rule 35.1, the legislative committee on
UI sensing boards no longer exists and the name and structure of the
legislative commission on municipal incorporations has changed. So the
new format's reflected in that rule. That rule 38B removes a reference
to something called public, local bills which have not existed since the
1940s. So even when this building was built those were long gone. Those
are the changes from the, from the two thousand, excuse me, from the
temporary rules, and I would urge the body's support of this resolution.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As you’re looking at the amendment near the top,
there’s a button that says View Associated Bill. It will open a second

bill on your display at the same time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I’m almost there, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House, be at ease.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, I’m ready to proceed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, this amendment is offered
because on line 10 of page 14 we have the following. No member, this is
quoting from the, from the resolution, no member may introduce more than
10 public bills. For the purpose of this subsection, the introducer is
the members listed as the first sponsor. And then listen carefully to
this next sentence, please. A member may assign a portion of this limit
to another member by notifying the principle clerk in writing of a form
prepared by the principle clerk. Members, this part of the resolution is
a solution in search of a problem. There is no problem with letting
members introduce as many bills as they wish. Remember that each of us
has a constituency, and many times our constituents say there’s an issue
of special concern so important that they would like to have us
introduce that bill. Now, some would say well, it would just make too
many bills clogging up the committees. But remember, those of you who
have been here before, and for those who are here the first time,
committee chairs can decide whether to calendar a bill or not. So, a lot
of the bills that we introduce, I think a lot of bills I introduced
’11-12 session, are never calendared by the committee chair. So, the
fact that a lot of bills are introduced has nothing to do with the
operation of the House. Really, in terms of clogging things up, it
doesn’t. The chairs make that decision. Further, when I actually I did,
or I asked staff to do research on what happened in the ’11-12 session,
it turns out that 41% of the Republican majority exceeded the 10 bill
limit, 41%. And 28% of Democrats exceeded the 10 bill limit. Now, how
did they do this? Because of that sentence in there about borrowing
bills. So, here we are trying to simplify things, but you have got to go
around, find a colleague who’ll say yeah, I’m not going to do my 10
bills. You can have one. You will have to walk in the clerk’s office,
sign a form. What’s the point? There simply is no point to it. We can
just introduce as many bills as we, as we wish and we’re just fine. I’ve
served here since 1991. Between 1995 and 1998 there was a 10 bill limit.
It wasn’t a good idea then. We had the limit last time at 10. And I
remember when we had this discussion of the permanent rules that I put
an amendment in that asked that the limit be raised from 10 to 20. That
amendment failed. But this year, in the spirit of compromise, I have an
amendment that raises it to 15, not 20. And I say, in all seriousness,
this is a good idea to not put a limit on what we members can do. And I
urge adoption of the amendment.

While I appreciate Representative Luebke’s concern for all of the
requests from his constituents to get their piece of legislation
through, I think we ought to think about the staff around here. We’re
asking a small number of people to be open to any of us just bombarding
them with anything. I think quality is much more important than
quantity. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Members. I would urge Members to vote against
the amendment and would sort of follow up with a point that
Representative Avila I think aptly made. There’s a lot to bills being
drafted. There’s not just some bill genie that pops up and produces
these things. There’s a process that it goes through.
It goes through the legislative research side of things. Then it goes to
bill drafting. If it has fiscal issues or appropriations issues it
involves that side of the staff. Then it involves the administrative
side of the staff here in the Clerk’s office. Then it goes through the
process of the bill referral system.
It’s not…And I’ve come to appreciate more of the mechanics behind the
scenes since doing the job that I’ve had now for a couple of years, and
there is a lot to it. I can somewhat sympathize with Representative
Luebke with the position of being able to essentially file the bill
knowing perhaps that it’s not going to go anywhere but being able to
make that statement on the record. I understand that.
The way that I think there’s kind of a, I won’t say compromise, but it
somewhat is, is that the 10-bill limit only applies to where your name
is first on the bill, that’s it. So, your name could be second, third or
fourth ad infinitum. You could literally be the second, third or fourth
primary sponsor of a bill for every other bill filed if folks asked you
to do it.
So, it’s only the ones where you’re the lead sponsor. So, while it does
limit to 10 in that respect, it’s not that major of a limitation.
Additionally, let’s say that a member had an idea that they wanted to
have a bill filed and they’d used their 10 bills, and they couldn’t
convince any of the rest of the 119 of us in here to file that bill with
them as the primary sponsor and them being the number two, three or
four.
There is already a procedure where they can go to any committee on which
they sit and ask that the committee file the bill in the name of the
committee. There’s also the procedure where a member can go and borrow a
bill from those who don’t use it.
So, while there is a 10-bill limit, there are so many exceptions built
into it that I don’t think it really restricts a person being able to
file a bill for the purpose of being able to show, “This is my position.
I at least want to file it and get it on the record.” So, members I
would ask that you vote against the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the amendment. If not, the
question before the House is the passage of the amendment sent forth by
Representative Luebke to House Resolution 54. All in favor vote, “Aye.”
All opposed, vote, “No.” The Clerk will open the vote.

Representative Jackson moves to amend the bill on page 22, lines 20
through 21, by inserting the following between those lines:
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, my amendment goes to what was commonly
referred to as the veto garage last time. The procedure for veto
overrides last time was when a veto was re-calendared, it was added to
the calendar with two days notice as required by our rules, and then it
stayed on the calendar for unfinished business for the rest of the
session and into the short session. My amendment would simply have a
rule, have it part of the rules, that once a veto override is added to
the calendar, once that two-day notice is given, it would stay on the
calendar for a total of 10 days. If it wasn't heard within that 10 day
period, then it would come off the calendar and be void. Quite honestly,
the reason for this rule, I wrote down some of the issues I had with the
rules last time and I kept it in my old book, my rulebook, and I wrote
this one down under the next to the last day of session when Bishop
Wainwright was here and he wasn't feeling good, and I think we went
maybe 12, 14 hours that day, and he was here for one reason only, and it
was for veto overrides, and 'cause we were told we needed to show up for
work, and we were told in our caucus, at least within our caucus, that
we needed to be here. We were five minutes late, people were scurryin',
callin', worried about you, I was actually, ran down to the courthouse
one day, on a lunch break, had the misfortune of hitting a city bus in
the rear and was about 20 minutes late to session, not many people know
about this, but people were panicking, hey, they're gonna override,
they're gonna override voter ID, they're gonna override racial justice,
and that's what we lived with, and I know that there's part and parcel
of being in the minority party, but you also need a life, you need
balance in your life. And it was very approprate that Representative
Warren was here, Edith Warren was here, earlier. She lives about an hour
and 15 minute, hour and 20 minutes past where I live, and I'd often see
her when we'd leave here at night at two in the morning. And I would
think about her driving on those county roads home. And maybe she wanted
to be here to vote on that vote that we were having at 12 o'clock in the
morning. Maybe she did. But my guess is that she was here, just like
Representative Womble was here in his wheelchair, and Representative
Wainwright was here on his deathbed, was because they were scared that a
veto was going to be called up if they missed session. And so this bill
would give the majority the flexibility to put a veto override on the
calendar any time they wanted to, with two days notice, and then would
let them have 10 days to have it heard. And if it didn't get heard
within those 10 days, then it would come off. I'd ask for your support.
Thank you.

I have had a lot of conversations with the rule shared about president,
about what happened in the history and the course. We are making history
now and we are setting a president for what happens in the future and so
even though this might not come into play this session, might, might not
don't know depends on whether the speaker is coming back or not and I
don't know anything he doesn't know. But we are setting the president
now, you are making the history that we are gonna build upon now. And
whether or not these 10 days enough, they affect all of us. Despite the
best efforts of the speaker last session there were members of even your
own party who were also having to stay here because they were not
necessarily sure. They weren't positive about what was going to happen.
They wanted to discharge their duty. They wanted to show up for work.
And vote was an important issue to them.So this gives you some period of
expectation. If it's not 10 days maybe it should be 20, these are 10
legislative days and not calendar days. And so it gives everyone some
period of expectation to know when they should focus on the issue, be
prepared to vote on it and be able to explain to their constituents why
or why not did they vote on the issue. I think it's a good amendment, it
serves the purpose it was written for and I'd ask you to support.

Mr. Speaker and members, actually I had one fact wrong earlier and I
want to point it out and I don't wanna seem too partisan. But I do want
to point out this, The provision requiring the two days notice is
something that when the president majority took over two years ago we
put in the rules, When the previous majority was in power there was no
kind of notice requirement at all and the veto could be done anytime. I
think that's worth pointing out. I'd ask again the members to vote
against the amendment.

Lady is recognized to speak on the amendment.

I actually wasn't gonna speak until representative Moore brought up
history and rules we put in. Just for folks who have served only 1 or
two terms, we have dealt with Gubernatorial vetoes when we were all of
one party and when Governor Easley vetoed things we always knew what day
we were gonna come back. It was a polling of the members. Even when we
over rode one of his vetoes, I don't know if you guys remember the White
boat bill. He didn't wanted big boats on the road so it's not like you
are not gonna wanna be able to override vetoes but the difference, when
Speaker Tillis we asked for the 2 days notice rule. That wasn't offered
by the majority party, the majority party didn't say &quot;Oh yeah,
we'll give you a two days notice&quot;. That was something that former
Speaker Hackney negotiated with Speaker Tillis, two years ago, I know, I
was in the room. We had the list of the things we wanted, some of them
we got, some of them we didn't, but we did negotiated. No body thought
that rule was then gonna turn into this permanent veto ?? which is what
we called it that would last from long session until the short session.
So this is an attempt to deal with something that we thought have been
fixed two years ago. And then the last thing that I want to remind the
members of was the veto override of the NCAE dues bill, a bill which
have been since have been struck down as unconstitutional costing this
day hundreds of thousands of dollars. That was done because we were
called back into an extra session when we were for a different session.
Don't tell me that the rules can not be abused and once we have seen
them abused or applied in a a way that was not intended, it's our
obligation not just to each other but to the institution to set good
rules and good behavior going forward. I hope we never have to use the
amendment that representative Jackson has put forward but the fact that

[Speaker changes.] would that have not been in conflict with that rule?
[Speaker changes.] Well, Mister Speaker, had the bill been drafted that
way, which in fact, it was not, then some of the amendments
might...might not have been in order; however, that was not the case
with the bill that we had on the floor so it just...that example just
wasn't appropriate. There may have been other bills...there may be other
bills in the future where that would be appropriate but the example of
yesterday was not appropriate.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Speaker, would the gentleman from Cumberland,
rise to a question?
[Speaker changes.] Would the...which gentleman from Cumberland?
[Speaker changes.] Representative Glazier.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Glazier, would you yield to a
question?
[Speaker changes.] Certainly.
[Speaker changes.] He so yields.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Glazier, I couldn't help but notice in
my peripheral vision, when I posed the question about the practical
matter, not the nuance that someone far better trained in debate and
legal matters than you or Representative Ross, but, as a practical
matter, would you agree that the title rule that was in place for the
four years...that at least I was here and perhaps longer, had been used
primarily for the purpose to prevent amendments from being introduced on
the floor. Many of those amendments have been introduced in committee.
[Speaker changes.] I'm inclined to take the fifth amendment
but...(Laughter.)
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Speaker.
[Speaker changes.] but in full answer to your question, Mister
Speaker...in full answer, seriously...I think that Representative Ross'
last statement was correct in the sense that I think we were sorta
crossing paths. The bill as it was introduced yesterday, because it had
short title, the amendments would not have violated the rules in 07-09
but would 07-09 as a practical matter were there more uses of long
titles. I think the answer is &quot;there were&quot;, but I think it was
used strategically and the majority, I think to their credit, eliminated
the use of the long titles strategically. I think that still relates to
the original point Representative Ross made but I do concede and agree
that long titles were used more in 07 thru 10.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Speaker?
[Speaker changes.] For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland,
Representative Lucas, rise?
[Speaker changes.] Point of order.
[Speaker changes.] Member may state his point of order.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Speaker, I believe that the lady from Wake's
reference to the Jackson Amendment to be  attributed to Representative
Luebke not Lucas. (Laughter.)
[Speaker changes.] That is noted.  Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham,
Representative Michaux, rise?
[Speaker changes.] To speak on the resolution.
[Speaker changes.] Member is recognized to speak on the resolution.
[Speaker changes.] I mean, you know folks, I still have the
simple-mindedness of an individual. One of the reasons, Mister Speaker,
that the title was...that rule was put in because we didn't have a
super-majority and we had to find some way of getting some things done
without havin' to go around Robin Hood's barn. The problem I have right
now is that you got a super-majority, why are you gonna be restrictive
in the rules.  You can do any blame thing that you want to do without
any hesitation at all. So I mean...to par...I mean you're not gonna get
a vetoed bill...we don't think...now unless ya'll got a problem between
the two houses and the other house...
[Speaker changes.] Mister Speaker?
[Speaker changes.] For what purpose does the gentleman from Iredell,
Representative Brawley, rise?
[Speaker changes.] When I finish...
[Speaker changes.] Member wants to stand, please state your
purpose...did you wish to ask a question? But you don't wish to yield?
[Speaker changes.] Not...not at this...because I'm very serious about
this. There were problems...at most times we did not have the
super-majority that you have in order to get things done and simply,
when you got a veto and you gotta garage that you park this veto in that
you could bring up at any time if you wanna bring it up, you know...that
was...that was really unfair. Right now, I say you've got everything.  I
don't see why we do hafta have this garage veto. I don't see why we
can't do some of these other things that we have offered, the amendments
or...because you gonna change some things anyway, comin' down the line,
I can...everybody can see that coming so I've just got a problem as to
why we can't get one or two little items in here like to veto garage in
this bill and I would vote against.
[Speaker changes.] For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake...</p>

representative Dollar rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just, and I apologize for speaking.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The number is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  But I have to comment on the title thing.  And with all due
respect to a couple of my colleagues over here, I remember an annexation
bill that we had back when some of us were in the minority.  And that
bill came through, and it came sailing out of committee, and we made
attempts to amend that bill and a committee, substantive committee, and
then I believe in finance committee.  We were thwarted by the title at
the time, and we were particularly thwarted when we got to the floor.  I
think the title was two, three, four pages long, and representative
Brown, who was here then, Larry Brown had amendment's.  Couldn't get
them heard because of the title.  That change but the speakers talked
about a moment ago is exactly right.  Those of us who have been here for
a few terms know it.  The rule as it stands today that we have an
opportunity to vote on is a great rule because it keeps the title short,
and it keeps the debate lively, and the opportunity for amendments on
this floor of this house within the hands of these members, and I just
think it was a great move to democratize this chamber, and it would just
amaze me that folks who voted for essentially the same rules two years
ago wouldn't do so again today.  And I would recommend you vote for the
rules.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake, Representative Paul
arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The member is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speaker, tell us.  I'd like to thank you for the changes that you've
made.  You posed a question in your remarks, would we'd prefer to go
back.  Of course we wouldn't.  Of course we wouldn't.  I had the chance
to meet with you before we began serving here.  I believed then that you
were going to reach across the aisle and do a great deal to cooperate
with us and having been the minority that you would be understanding and
make things easier for us.  By some of the things that have been sent
here today, I completely, 100% still feel that way.  But I have to go
back to the question, again you posed, would you prefer to go back?  And
to me, but it could be worse is just not a logical argument.  To say,
but it could be worse is not an argument for not trying to make it
better.  I actually walked in here this morning wanting to vote for this
resolution.  I wanted to vote for speaker Moore's resolution.  I wanted
to reach across the aisle, and I was looking for the smallest reasons,
and to me, the most reasonable amendment was Darrin Jackson's, and I was
hoping so much that that one would pass, and that was the one I was
looking for to give me the reason to vote for these rules.
Unfortunately, I didn't feel there was bipartisanship because of that
most reasonable amendment, and for that reason, I'm going to vote
against the rules, and I urge the other members to do so as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blust, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Members of the house, I'm going to support the
resolution, and I don't disagree with what's been said.  Some of what's
been said on the other side of the aisle, because I still remember very
vividly, seared in my mind that being in seats like that, and I'm going
to support this.  For years, I did work on rules the way I thought they
ought to be for a great legislative, deliberative body, what I thought
the founders would intend, because I first came here, I was in the
senate for two years and then came over to the house, and it was a time
where it's not an exaggeration to say we were under absolute despotism.
I mean, the speaker and the president pro tem were God, you didn't
question them, you questioned them at your peril.  And literally, one
reason I'm not running amendments now to try to do more is so much of
this kind of needs to happen when you have a change in speakers, because
when you have a speaker to say the rules need changing is in some
quarters viewed as you're attacking that speaker and the way that
speaker did business or the way that president pro tem did business.
There have been so many abuses, and many of them have been cured in the
rules as we did last time.  I have a checklist, and members of our
caucus know</p>

what I've tried to do in our [??] two years ago when we first got the
majority and I just checked the other day looking at this how many
things that we have been done bearing the order of business from the
calender we used to come in here and you couldn't follow things the way
we jumped around and speaker Tillis has been fairly diligent of
following the calender unless he asked leave of the body one of the big
things changes we made was the general direction of the hall in rule 6
used to be taken as the permission for the speaker to do anything he
wanted and disregard the rules and we put in there the word last time
subject to the specific provisions of these rules and that was a huge
difference and I have gone over for the rules chairman in past to say
how in the world could you do this this is in the rule they had
disregarded the rule blatantly and that was the ruling of this the rules
chairman was speaker has charge of the hall and that was how they
interpreted that rule so it is important to get these things right
overriding the chair was dropped and that rarely happens but the vote to
override the chair was dropped from two thirds to three fifths the
previous question at least now there has to be something said on the
bill by both sides I've seen many of time something handed out and voted
on question called voted on with no explanation it's happened it
happened on the redistricting bill in 2003 on this floor complex bill
handed out question called no questions asked passed becomes law another
thing that was not mentioned by the speaker was the discharge petition
representative Hall someone can at least to a degree get a [??]
temperature of this body by going and filing a discharge petition you
don't have to even go through a committee and you can actually get
people behind the bill to start urging the legislate towards to go sign
a discharge petition so that is a way to get an idea heard and when it's
being blocked by the majority the committee [??] I actually think the
democrats had gone away with that before we even took power that was a
tremendous abuse I just sent out an email I received from our esteemed
clerk I'm sure acting on orders in 2003 assigning right before a key
vote assigning four new members of the finance committee because they
didn't have the votes to pass something that the speaker wanted hey you
guys get over there and vote and that was literally done I also was once
if you wanna know despotism and some of you [??] were here there being
assigned to a dungeon office I sent out one of the emails I got it's
like seven days in a row I got an email from Denise everyone got one
representative Blust is removed from the committee on something and
another member assigned one at a time everyday the slow bleed you're
throwing off every committee and so there has been a lot of things done
I sympathized and voted with the amendment although I don't think it's
that [??] this year since the governor is of our party but leaving
things on the calender is an abuse and I can remember in 2001 when we
were here till December the redistricting was left on the calender well
first the budget then the redistricting then the senate redistricting
then the Congressional redistricting and they've literally waited and
ambushed for the time when somebody'd be absent and they'd have the
votes and I just point out that Mason's manual which governs a lot of
our proceeding says the whole reason for rules is so the will of the
majority of the members maybe determined and revealed in an orderly
manner while protecting the minority members because each member is
presumed to be equal with the others and when you leave something on the
calender you really aren't interested in taking really finding out what
the body wants to do as a body as a deliberative body but to take a
snapshot to do what the leadership wants at any particular time and that
is something that can be abused it hasn't been but and speaker Tillis
has come a long way speaker [??] started us on that journey the heavy
hand was lifted in 2007 when speaker [??] was elected speaker and many
of the things that had been done stopped being done.

And I think, Speaker Tillis, with these rules, we have continued down
that path.  If I am here, I am willing to continue down that path
further the next time.  And I think we should work together to do that,
because it is an honor and a privilege to be here.  And we really should
remember those people who put us here.  And everyone here, represents
80,000 people.  Your people are as important as my people. And the games
that are played, and the abuses through the rules need to come to a all
time stop.  But I think significant progress has been made and I support
these rules.
Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
To debate the resolution.
Gentlemen, it is recognized to debate the resolution.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
A couple of other things, I don't wan't to belabor the points that have
already been made.  I think Representative Bless and Speaker Tillis,
when he spoke.  I have an amendment that I am not going to send forward.
 But, there is an amendment that could be sent forward that would simply
put us under the 2009 rules.  And those give a lot less protection for
the Minority Party.  And I think that our present majority, both last
session and this session, have been very accommodating and very fair.
For those of you who are new members, it really was.. there is no
exaggeration, you would flip for page and page.  It was just the
title...If you see the bill its like... House Rules is the title...
Literally, all capital letters...just pages and pages.  So if you filed
an amendment and did one thing or another, then it was out of order. And
I had a number of my amendments that were -- I thought they were good
amendments -- that got ruled out of order.  They never got heard.  It
was a way of not allowing those ideas heard.
I think yesterday's debate, I think both days debates for example on the
UI bill, showed that this body is a deliberative body.  The amendments
were brought up and considered.  They were given the chance to make the
argument.  Members were allowed to debate them.  And the vote and
amendments were voted up or down as the will of the majority.  That's
all.
The rules are designed exactly as Representative Bless says, to allow
the majority's will to be done. But at the same time to respect the
rights of the minority.  I submit to you, these are the fairest rules
this House has had. I don't know how else to say it. We have been
accommodating.  I would ask the members to support this resolution, and
let us  move on to adopting these rules so we can get on with the other
business we need to address.
Representative Larry Hall, please state your purpose.
To speak on the resolution.
Gentlemen, it is recognized to debate the resolution.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Certainly, Representative Moore said that we could have gone backwards
on these and we have had a good discussion this afternoon on them.  I
know there are specific reasons, all of us even,  Representative Bless
see that there are some improvements we can still make to these
resolutions and everyone is going to make their minds up on what they
are going to stand up on these.  And whatever they are going to make on
forward.
We do and can do better.  We talked about the areas we can do better in.
I would hope that folks would decide for themselves what they think is
most important as we go forward. We know that they're gonna  pass. [??]
We know we are going to take some of the side tracks.  We took some of
the issues on the rules that are in front of us now. But certainly, we
know this is serious business.  Again, as these pass, we know that we
can do better.  We have already identified where we need to improve.
They can be changed, they can be improved. I hope the Rules Chair will
look at those areas that have been brought up, that we have talked
about.  And he has heard the census of the body.  And I hope that action
will be taken on them.  And again, I hope that our democrats will decide
for themselves, what areas of the bill that you feel strong enough to
stand on that we can improve these House rules as we move forward
Representative Collins, please state your purpose.
To briefly debate the bill.
Gentlemen, it is recognized to debate the bill.
Again, I am amazed we are calling the veto override [??]. That's fine.
I don't have any problems with that name. But we are calling this a
partisan, Republican issue.  And that really boggles my mind. If
somebody makes a motion on the floor to bring something that is already
on the calendar to a vote.  We bring it to a vote and...</p>

So, I don't understand how this is an partisan republican issue when
basically if we want to override vetoes we can do it. I fail to see how
this is a partisan issue that only advances the cause of the republicans
and I would certainly advice you to vote for this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate. If not the question before the house
is the adoption of house resolution 54 as amended. All in favor vote
aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote. All members
wishing to record please do so at this time. The clerk will let the
machine record the vote. 98 having voted in affirmative and 22 in the
negative. The resolution has been adopted and will be ordered printed.
21, chair apologizes. Members just to close out the discussion and I
appreciate the debate, there were couple of comments that ?? ?? of the
chair would like to be expressed here. The chair has no intentions of
changing any of the primary roles without  the consents of the minority
caucus. I did not wanted to make that material to the debate but the
communication that I have made to the minority leader is if we find
things that are appropriate or changed from this point forward, we will,
but as long as I am speaker that will not be something that will be in
conflict with the minority caucus and the chair does anticipate one
potential change and it'll be the change if we can work out the
statutory  under pendings to allow members to join from community
colleges or certified sites so you can actually ?? being in the
committees without actually traveling to Raleigh but without that
exception the chair is not aware of any initiative, certainly none that
are supported by the speaker.
Representative Howard, please state your purpose.
