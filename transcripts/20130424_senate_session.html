Are accomplished when they are serious about powering their operations
with clean energy. Our own Bank of America has dedicated itself to a 10
year, 50 billion business initiative, bringing the company’s global goal
to 70 billion, over the next 16 years. The largest of any financial
institution. Bank of America is partnering with Ceres, an organization
dedicated to mobilizing investor and business leadership to build a
thriving sustainable global economy. They have seen the impact the bank
suffers have had on the marketplace.  In 2012 alone, Bank of America
provided more than 4.5 billion towards underwriting, advising and
financing a number of innovative transactions under its institution.
Bank of America also has a high energy in water efficient pilot building
and floor in their corporate headquarters in Charlotte. A model of what
can be done. Bank of America buys all “Energy Star” equipment. Including
computers and furniture. SAS, a business analytic software and services
company, right here in Raleigh, is a leader in investing in solar energy
and 0 energy usage. They have just completed a second solar farm, which
will produce an estimated 1.9 million kilowatt hours each year. Enough
to power more than 175 average size homes, I think I left a 0 off there.
 It has a tracker system that catches up to 25% more energy over fixed
systems. Throughout the country there are net 0 energy commercial
buildings. There are buildings that not only are energy efficient, but
also use the heat generated in the building to power the buildings other
needs. They’re called self-powered buildings, and use a combination of
energy, efficient building materials, and onsite solar and wind powered
technologies to service entire onsite heat, electricity and hot water
needs. Other companies, such as Whole Foods and Target, are entering
this movement. Our Solar industry is one of the fastest growing in the
state.  There are many solar roof tops including one in Raleigh,?? I’m
wrapping up.  350 million Chinese have solar ?? on their roof tops. We
can do it here. So, which is it going to be? 20th century polluting
energy, that destroys our beautiful  landscape, and can pollute our, I’m
done, our water? Or, 21st century job creating clean energy? Do we have
vision and bold courage, are we forward thinking or are we stuck in the
