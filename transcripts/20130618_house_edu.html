Speaker Changes: thank you me chairman members of the committee I'm
gonna take couple of minutes to explain why this bill is in front of you
and i ask staff to go through it and you'll be ask any questions to
clarify what is all about we have facilities in the sate reffed to act
in to P R T S and then those psych ?? residential treatment facilities
and these are for our children and the children in these facilities off
course  are pulled out of their schools and not receiving their
education and there have been issues raised about the lack of the
education received while they are here and what has been happening is
that here is there is no formal plans fro education dollars state
dollars to follow the children to these facilities and a number of these
facilities have taken up themselves to fund the education part of the
children time there and my personal feeling is we are  trucking our
responsibility because awe are responsible for educating the children of
the state and this comes to you through a lot of negotiation and talking
and meeting which actually isn't over we git lot of fine points to work
put between very detailed process and procedures and i want first of all

The due process right of children with individual, individualized
education programs.  The new language continues to specify that a PU or
TF that has been approved by GPI as an exceptional  children's program
and the ones that are documenting that they are going to have to deviate
from educational programatic requirements when it's nes, medically
necessary those who are the P or TFs that will be eligible for the state
funding for the educational services.  Sub-section 'C' which begins on
line 16 of page 4 that talks about how funds are gonna be transferred
from the Department of Public Instruction into division then will help
in how these funds will be held in the P or TSs will build for their
educational services.  In Sub-section 'G' if the Department of Health
and Human Services receives notice from DPI that the P or TF is not
providing educational services, they would withhold funding until they
receive that is again the P or TF is  providing these services, P or TFs
will come forward  with all audit and accounting procedures if any,
publicly funded agency. So I'm in line 31 page 4 that PCs talks about
information sharing so within 3 business days of admission into a P or
TF, the P or TF is going to  notify DPI of the child be in place there,
also going to notify  the local school administrated unit  in which that
child was last enrolled in that information is known.  Our understanding
is that the children move around a lot in that sometimes they don't
really know exactly which was the last school that child was enrolled in
and but they are gonna work together to try to get the best information
possible so, that the P or  TF can implement the IP in any other
educational services.   Upon this starts the P or TF is gonna work with
receiving LEA so the school system where the child will go back and be
enrolled to develop the transition plan and update the individualized
educational program the  IP is necessary.  At the bottom of page 4, you
will see that the state board of education and DPM they are directed to
offer  training to P or TFs on how to comply with special education
modules, DPIs are going to maintain the list, current list of the
children so that they would be a better idea where the kids are located,
then  DPI and the State Board will ensure  the due process right so
children with indualized education programs and that they are going to
develop an important roles to make those happen.   Okay, page 5 of the
PCS, Section 6 is basically a grand father class so that P or TS are
already licensed to serve children would have 6 months and then some
additional time for  DHHS to work with them so that they can  become
certified as non-public certified childrens programs.  Section 7  is
also a grand father class saying that for the  P or TS that already has
 signed educational agreements with education agencies local system that
they also can quality  for the educational funding to meet any unmet
needs than dianim.  Section 8 grants the State Board of Education
authority to adopt emergency role so that the implementation of this
time will not be delayed.  Section 9 is requiring the department of
health and human services and department of public instruction working
with other interested agencies is cord to jointly record about how many
children are being served and how many hours of education they are
receiving cause any recommendations on how to improve this process.
Then Section 10  outlines the budgetary process of funding that would go
to the PI and then DPI would transfer that money over the DHHS to
provide these educational services and P or TS and then finally section
11 at bottom of page 5 in on the back of your view of page 6 you will
see that department of public instruction will process the applications
on number 4 of section Number first and</p>

the approval to the PRTS no later than Dec. 1st of 2013. Thank you Rep.
Langdon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Patsy. Outstanding.
Rep. Avila?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Before we start questions, if you will look at the front page and the
title, you will see how intense that this has been by the fact that
we're on version 42 of this legislation. And what has happened is
version 36, one group's happy, version 40, somebody else is happy,
version 26, somebody else is happy, so the objective is going to be to
take all of these versions, and all of these still not quite right
there, and work it out for a 2 year period because literally we don't
know what the situation is for a lot of these kids in this state. Simply
because they have been moved from one facility to another facility, and
unfortunately we may have lost track of some of them. So one of the
objectives over the next 2 years is to find out what is the situation
with our children who go into PRTFs, how long do they stay there, what
kind of services do they receive, and have a much better picture both of
the process that we go through with them as well as the cost that's
involved so that we don't ask any one entity to bear an uncomfortable
burden of funding responsibility that rightly lies with the state, and I
would ask for your support of the legislation proposed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
Actually, I have a point of inquiry and probably for staff. I see no
referral on here to appropriations or finance, yet we're dealing with
some financial matters in here. Should there be a referral for this
bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They're shaking.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Will they tell us where?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Appropriations. Rep. Fisher?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
I first of all want to applaud this effort, I think it's important that
we meet all the needs of all of the children in North Carolina, and I
like the idea that the Dept. of Public Instruction and DHHS are working
together to accomplish this goal. My question is, and it looks like
you're going to hear a whole lot of information that you don't really
have the answers to yet, in terms of how many children, how long are
they staying. My question has to do with how many are- how many PRTFs
are there in North Carolina? I mean I have several questions, but that's
the first one. How many are there in North Carolina, presently?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do we have an answer?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe it's 42, but I can ask staff to verify.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We do know that we have 521 licensed beds in PRTFs that are not
hospitals, and I'll count out real quick to find out how many facilities
that is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And regarding the number of students, we've heard a number between 6 and
900, and that gives you a broad range, so it's- there are short term,
longer terms, so it's not like you can pinpoint that this one's going
in, or everybody's going in for a prescribed period of time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Fisher?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
Is there or has there been before this legislation any kind of per
people expenditure going out to the ?? for their education once they
leave the public  school?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The only 2 that I know of that any state funding has gone to in any way,
shape, or form has been organized as a charter, and then one in the
Winston-Salem ?? county area that actually is under contract with its
local LEA.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And then one more follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
Once this is established, what kinds of requirements for meeting
achievement levels would be required for this nonpublic entity once it's
established?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Avila?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would assume that the answer would better come from people involved in
the education. This is another one of those situations I find myself in,
with no background or experience. But I think first and foremost, we
have to</p>

<p id="20:00">
Keep in mind why these children why these children are where they are.
It's not for an education. If it was they'd be in their local schools.
These children are in these facilities because they have serious mental
illness and that in terms of what we should be taking care of is the top
priority. And we just don't want the fact that they're there and getting
behind and behind because the objective is to get them back into their
community school. And we're just exasperating the situation if we send
them back way behind. The objective is to keep them up with their
classmates so that when they return to a classroom they would be on
equal footing and we wouldn't be creating additional problems. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] One last comment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You may. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well again I appreciate this effort and I will look forward to hearing
more about how it works down the road and how the responsibilities are
shared between the two departments. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Whitman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. I commend
the concept. I have a question and I'll leave it to Representative Avila
as a discretion whether you answer it or you refer it to DPI. On page
five section ten it talks about there is appropriated to DPI and it's
got the figures of 1.6 million for the upcoming school year and 3.2 for
the following year to then be transferred to HHS. Sounds like we've got
a little bit of some unknowns in terms of total numbers. From a
standpoint of when we do this, if that's not enough, question one is it
does say to be appropriated so that's good. We're not just simply
finding the money in a department. What do we do if it far exceeds that?
And I apologize for the opening question but if you want to run with it
or at  your discretion please.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually, that's going to be a question for the budget
drafters in 2015 because what we'll be using this money for is pretty
much as I stated earlier. The PRTF's have been funding, on their own,
any education services that they've been providing for the student. That
includes any kinds of supplies. It includes any kind of personnel needs.
We've not been helping out any at all. So anything that we can help out
during this two year period as we try to get a handle on what are the
costs? While these children are in the PRTF's to what level do we
continue their education that they would be receiving if they were in
the LEA? And really trying to determine what the financial impact is.
And that is going to be for 2015. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luke
?? [SPEAKER CHANGES]This is just to follow representative Whitmire I
mean two other points and representative Avila has understated I think
the negotiations that have gone on here. I'm planning to recommend her
to the White House to go to the middle east after this is done. But I do
think you raise a really legitimate point. One thing we should all know
is that we've got a lawsuit pending. There is litigation that's been
stayed in the Wake County Superior Court pending this legislative
session to respond to this. At least as to one set of providers in a
very kind of defined area. But we really do have a requirement now
pending on us to create appropriations for these children in some way.
The second thing is, I think in the appropriation that's in here
representative Avila has been working with representative Dollar and I
think is going to try to figure out the match of what additional monies
are going to have to be there versus what's taken from existing funding
based on formula kinds of concepts and the numbers that we do know for
right now. And I think that remains a little bit of an open question to
try to figure it out. Also depends on how many kids who are in these
PRTF's are coming from an LEA so that there's some way to do that versus
they're coming from private situation where they were never in an LEA. I
think that creates a different kind of calculation. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lucas [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. I want to
commend representatives Avila and Glazier for tackling this complicated
issue. We already recognize that the need is there and we must address
it. We've failed thus far to do that. So again I commend you for
attempting to tackle this. The question I have is and I know that this
is a difficult answer to reply to. I think representative Whitmire
stabbed at it a little bit. Do you feel like the</p>

...?? recommended funding is going to be adequate to get us off the
ground.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Aliva.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think so. Just in the fact that we are making an
effort where we haven't done it before I think is going a long way to
moving us through this process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In your 36 to 42 versions of trying to address this
issue, have you been able to satisfy all of the stakeholders, or most of
them?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To a degree. Everybody has, of course, their budgets
they're concerned about. Everybody has the area of, when things go wrong
who has responsibility and those are the fine-tuning and the rubbing off
the raw edges that we're still working with, but like I said earlier,
the manner and attitudes which these various groups have come forward to
discuss and work on this has been, the reason that it has come as far as
it has. And I just feel like that they're committed as we are to make
sure that these children get taken care of in an appropriate way by the
State.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, a motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Sheppard?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For a question, Mr. Chair. Representative Aliva, and
maybe I didn't read it in here, so my understanding this to mean that
the local LEA's will be responsible for those facilities that are in
their districts or is this something that will be taken care of by DPI
at this level?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Currently as it's written, the LEA responsibility is
going to be the PRTF and that is one of those areas of discussion that
we still have, you know, what is the proper level of oversight. And it
will be up for further discussion and fine-tuning as to which entity
will be best able to monitor and guarantee that the services would be
equivalent to what the child would be receiving if it was in the home
LEA.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lucas?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, I'd like to make a motion for a favorable
report to the PCS, unfavorable to the original and that we refer it to
appropriations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You've heard the motion. All in favor to the motion
say aye, all opposed no. Ayes have it and the motion is carried. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tucker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 168. And there's a PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I need somebody, OK. Representative Warren moves that
we have the PCS before us. All in favor say aye, all opposed no. The
ayes have it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 168.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
The last time I brought an irrigation bill before you and it was quite
an opportunity to receive 46 questions from the House committee that day
on irrigation. Now we're in education. I'm a little bit apprehensive
about standing up here before you. And if any of you have ever presented
anything in the Senate bill, whenever you see Senator Tillman do this,
that means it's going to move so if you review the bill, you're welcome
to do that, it won't offend me at all if you want to move the bill.
This Senate Bill 168 kind of was my bill. Senator Tillman's had some, a
bill like it. Representative Whitmire, Representative Martin had a bill.
This bill became a all-inclusive bill for that. And so Senate Bill 168
would repeal several of the reporting requirements for the State Board
of Education. And it would reorganize teacher licensure and the
education program statute. I have Denise Adams from staff to begin to go
through the bill with you if that's your pleasure, Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Denise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] She can be pretty quick with it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Section 1 of the bill would repeal the annual report
required for the evaluation of the disadvantaged student supplemental
funding initiative and low wealth initiatives, which began in 2005. The
evaluation was eliminated several years ago but the reporting
requirement remains, so this is just a clean up.
Section 2 of the bill would eliminate the requirement that the State
Board of Education periodically review and report...</p>

The funding stopped. The reportings continued to be required. The
disadvantage and low-wealth has kind of been replaced by PEP, is that a
fair statement, Ms. Adams?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] PEP is still required; this would just eliminate the
reporting requirement to Joint Oversight.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just was concerned. Most of
the time whenever LEA’s ask for reports, people like us, we’re the ones
who usually request this information. We want to know what is going on
here, there and everywhere. And I was just wondering who would determine
what should be eliminated and what reports should be required and all of
that? And who had been finding all this to be a problem, other than just
a teacher, someone who’s not wanting to do a report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Can I have staff respond to Representative Bell’s
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A number of the requests for the elimination of these
reports came from DPI. The information will still be available; it’s
just not coming to the Joint Ed Oversight committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s still there. A few requests ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bell, if you request it for your area
to see what’s going on, you certainly still will have that information
available to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What I wanted to know if the information was going to
still be there, because it’s vital information.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just the report- Excuse me, Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I respond? Again, I’m being redundant. Just the
Oversight’s not going to get that report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I guess my question- Over
here, Senator. My question on this is really along the lines of the
others just a moment ago, Representative Bell, Representative Adams, and
that is in Section 2 it seems like we’re taking away the report on the
progress of students who have been identified at risk of academic
failure. We’re no longer requiring that that SBE report be sent to Joint
Educational Oversight. And I guess the question is, why not, would we
not want to know how well we are doing with children who have identified
at-risk? I guess I don’t- And if I’m missing something, maybe staff or
Senator, you can explain it. It would seem to me to be useful to
continue to have that report on how at-risk children are doing in the
schools. Why is that taken out, I guess is a more correct way-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, Senator. ?? you want DPI to assist? There’s
been some of this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. That’ll be fine. Yes, sir. That’ll be fine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please state your name and who you work for.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir, Mr. Chair. Rebecca Garland, Chief Academic
Officer, Department of Public Instruction. The report that is referenced
in this statute is simply that superintendents have been required to
certify to the department that PEPs, Professional Education Plans, are
in place within the schools. And the only way that we at the department
have had to be able to ensure that PEPs are in place is to ask
superintendents to have their principals to certify that they’re in
place, because to monitor it would require us to be out in all the
classrooms to see that they are done. We certainly do monitor the
performance of disadvantaged students. We get annual reports to the
State Board of Education on the progress of each subgroup, it’s in our
annual report that we get on testing results from across the state. We
have a District and School Transformation group that works with all of
our disadvantaged schools in the state where we go out and monitor
student performance and provide technical assistance. So it really is
only the elimination of a report from the superintendents to the
Department of Public Instruction that certifies that PEPs are in place,
when the statute already says that those PEPs have to be in place.
 
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It eliminates certification…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] …by the superintendent and the principal.
Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.</p>

we have professionals in the field that are conscientious and do this.
Power school, which replaces the NCY is another tool to ensure that our
students are properly tracked and the information goes there. And with
that, I move that we find this PCS favorable, unfavorable to the
original, and I commend the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You've heard the
motion. All in favor of the motion say aye, all opposed say no. ayes
have it the motion's carried. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tucker, I apologize for demoting you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] That's okay, I've been called worse. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Fact, I probably did. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bil 231, Senator Davis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Representative Graham is going to present the
bill for us. Thank you Mr. Chairman, we do have a PCS. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
We need a PCS. Representative Horne moves that we have the PCS forced.
ALl in favor say aye, all opposed no, ayes have it the motion is
carried. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the
committee, Senator Jim Davis and I have worked on this bill. He and I
both serve on the North Carolina ?? education advisory council. And as a
result of serving on that council, we have had some communication with
the reporting of the advisory council. And this bill basically modifies
that report, which is an ?? report.
And it strengthens the reporting that's made by the advisory council.
And this bill addresses those issues that's important to the purpose of
that council. Just to review a couple of those items in the bill. If
you'll look at item 3, in that bill, the modification actually
strengthens the duties of the board. It requires the board to come out
with an action plan at the end of that report, to report their findings
and have a stronger action plan for the services for those children. And
actually it will benefit and improve the quality of education for our
American-Indian students here in North Carolina.
It also, if you'll look at section 4, the report will improve
consultation among the state board of education, department of public
education, and the American Indian tribal communities. As you know, in
this state we have 8 tribes, we have 7 sate recognized tribes. We have
the Cherokee tribe which makes the 8th tribe. And we have four tribal
organizations. So communication, to the parents, to the educators, to
make sure that our children who are the most deprived some of the most
deprived children in our state, and some of the most under achieving
students in our state. We're looking at their educational needs and the
advisory council certainly over the past 25 years has done a great job
tracking those students. reporting their progress of those students or
the lack of progress. And not only at the state level but at the
national level.
And this bill strengthens the duties of that council and makes the
performance of the council a much better council and one that we can
track the growth of those children at the end of the year. And I would
be glad to entertain any questions at this time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any
questions? We have no questions, I'll accept the motion. Representative
Carne. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I would move for a
favorable report to the proposed committee substitute for senate bill
231 unfavorable to the original. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You've heard the
motion. All in favor of the motion say aye, all opposed no. Ayes have it
the motion is carried. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman members of the committee [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Graham. Senate Bill 243. Senator Alrad. Somebody gon' to
run that bill? Representative Gill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Need a motion for
a PCS. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lucas moves that we have the PCS
forced. All in favor say aye. All opposed, no. Okay, representative
Gill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. This is a very, I won't
say simple bill, but it's cut and dry.</p>

<p id="45:00">
The Department of Health and Human Services have sent a memo out
indicating that there's a shortage in supplies required to provide
tuberculosis tests, so they are asking that we give local school boards
or superintendents the authority to defer certification of these tests
for teachers upon their initial employment or reemployment, and this
will be effective. As you know there's been quite a few breakouts of
tuberculosis and they're testing all of the students that have or all of
the people that have been in contact or exposed to that disease. So this
is just a defer. They are asking us to defer it until they can revamp
their supply and make the necessary changes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, just one question and then a comment.
Representative Gill, do they predict when the vaccination may be made
available in enough amount so that the teachers can get them?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't think that all teachers, all of the ?? are going to be affected
by this. These are counties in which the Social Service Department
notified the superintendent that there is a shortage, so it's not in all
of the counties, just those that have a shortage.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman for a motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK. Anyone else wish to speak on the motion? Representative ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Gill, thank you Mr. Chairman. Do you know what counties
are affected by this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I'm not sure. I know that Wake County is one of them, but we have
someone in the audience that may be able to give us that information.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? have an answer to that? OK, Leanne?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning, I'm Leanne Winter with the North Carolina School Board
Association. We were contacted by the attorney for the Wake County Board
of Education about this. They had received a letter from their local
health department. We made the-- We did not go out to survey who else
had gotten a similar letter, but assumed that if Wake got it, then there
was probably instances in other places and also that it could happen
again. The main issue is if you go actually to the bill itself. On the
second page you will see in existing law, if a teacher did not receive
this before being employed, that's actually a misdemeanor offense.
That's what raised the real concerns for Wake County public schools,
that if they complied with the letter at the request of the local health
department, that then somebody would be in criminal violation of the
statute and that's why they asked for this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Leanne. Representative Collins?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sir, I'm no expert on this topic, but I just have two ?? in this bill
that trouble me a little bit. Number one is that I don't see any
specifics in this bill. I mean, are deferring it forever, or are we
deferring it for six months? I don't see any specific time frame in
here. The other thing is, to me it seems like a little bit of a
backwards approach. If we're having outbreaks of TB, rather than ignore
testing or defer testing, it would seem to me we'd be doing everything
within our power to try to find some-- to come up with materials to do
the testing or something. It just seems to me that we're kind of running
from a problem. We're acting like it doesn't exist, and trying to fix an
issue of making sure teachers can be there, whether those teachers have
tuberculosis or not, rather than fighting the tuberculosis outbreaks.
I'm just a little bit concerned with how we're going about this with the
fact that I don't really see any specifics in here about what we're
actually allowing the schools to do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We're going to let Staff assess the information on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The requirement in the statute is actually upon initial employment or
reemployment, teachers are required to go get a test to see if they have
tuberculosis. It's a standard, even if you're not showing any symptoms
or have not been in any contact. What DHHS has suggested, is because of
the shortage that they would prefer to hold the supplies for people who
are showing symptoms or signs--</p>

<p id="50:00">
So obviously the vast majority of teachers do not have, and are not
showing, signs of tuberculosis. If you go to page 2, lines 3 to 5, there
is a provision that requires the local board to develop a policy that
when supplies are available, that they would resume tuberculosis
testing, so during the deferral period those people would be noted and
then there would have to be a policy as to how to handle catching up on
tuberculosis testing during that deferral period.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This shortage local, statewide, nationwide, I have a problem with the
entire concept of not testing when it's required. And I just can't
believe that the testing materials, that what's needed for the testing,
can not be found someplace in the country.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? have an answer for that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do not know whether there is a national shortage. VHHS had indicated
that North Carolina is having a shortage, and I would assume that might
affect other parts of the country, but the memo was specific to this
state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think before we proceed much further with this, we should find out if
this is a national shortage. If it isn't, the materials are available
and they can be gotten.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. I understand the reason and certainly understand
the need to, as they're hiring right now, to be able to get some
exemption from the criminal prosecution. But I share Representative
Cleveland and Representative Collins' concern that we really -- what
started with a question by Representative Fisher, and that is that I
would be a whole lot more comfortable if this had a short term exemption
date when it could then be revisited, even in the interim, by jointed
oversight or something that could then move forward. But leave an
open-ended exemption when there is an outbreak issue strikes me as not
good policy, number one, and number two, a liability problem later on if
you're looking at it from a ?? point of view.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We're going to pull the bill. You raised good questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 557. Senator Hise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is a PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dockham moves we have a PCS before us. All in favor say
&quot;aye&quot;.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed no. Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, over to your right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's on the back, turn it over. Representative ??, I couldn't find it
either. (laughs)
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. We're actually
beginning this. This original report that came back originally came from
the house and was part of the House's budget proposal in the previous
??. I was looking to be able to determine funding for Pre-K on a
classroom basis versus an individual basis, and directed the department
in order to do a pilot study. This was passed as part of the last
budget. Moving forward to do a pilot project so we get that information
and look at that as an option. We're back here again today quite
frankly, because the department did not do that pilot or report. As a
matter of fact, the secretary refused to submit what she had because The
Division of Child Development says ?? Education, the group that works
with Pre-K, rather than doing the pilot, had interns in their office
model this pilot and submit that information to the secretary to be
submitted to this committee. She refused to do so, so we are once again
authorizing the pilot with a new...</p>
