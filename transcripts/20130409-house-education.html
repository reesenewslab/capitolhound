I'd like to call the meeting to order, and our Sergeant at Arms today is
Bob Rossi, Charles Godwin and Doug Harris. We thank you for your assist
as always. Our pages for the day, Carly Venters from New Hanover (??).
B. Hammerton (??) is the sponsor. Todd Brown from Gaston. Torbett (??)
is the sponsor. Bree Campbell from Halifax, Ray is the sponsor. And
Alexander Fish from Union, Schafner (??) is the sponsor. The first bill
we're going to take up is House Bill 127, art education as a graduation
requirement. Representative Carney and Johnson. Representative Johnson.
Yes, you may go.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Apologies. I was giving you a run, but I have in the PCS to have a
motion for the PCS to be before us. ?? moves that. All in favor say aye.
All opposed, no. Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was reminded coming up the steps today we
like to quote people up here, famous people, and I was reminded of
Abraham Lincoln who ran for public office so many times and then he'd
lose and he'd come back and keep running, and he said once, &quot;I will
study and get ready and perhaps my time will come.&quot; Well, Linda
Johnson, Representative Johnson, and Representative Adams, and
Representative Glazier, and Representative Fisher, and numerous others,
a couple that are no longer up here, have been working on this for six
years and we have had numerous- a couple of arts commissions, that have
taken us to a broadened height. DPI has worked with us and the different
organizations representing education have worked with us and it seems
that we've all come together around this bill today, and you can see
what the bill days, states that the state Board of Education will
require one arts education credit for graduation. I think everybody in
here recognizes that the number one driver with companies looking to
recruit people to work for them is creativity and innovation. That comes
from having exposure to the arts with our children. Arts is more than
just taking a piece of paper and painting a picture. It's music, it's
dance, it's creative writing. It takes on many forms. What our bill says
is that every child in North Carolina between grades six and twelve, and
that was where we finally came to the compromise with the department and
with the superintendent, that we would accept this that that graduation
requirement could be met between six and seventh grade. I reiterate
that, because before it had been just in high school. That means that
over the course of seven years, a student has to take one course, have
it documented, and it will count towards graduation. We ask that you
support us and I don't know if representative Johnson would like to-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm not one to talk about something. I do want to mention a little bit
about our journey to solving this problem. The key to this legistlation
is that the state board of education shall establish a report, and
that's the key to understanding. During our first and second commission
meetings, or commission and committee meetings, I think it was, we
discussed what we were- the ideas that we could not agree on, instead of
working together as a team to try to solve the problem. The solution
that the representative was talking about, Representative Carney was
talking about, is something that we already had a solution for in math.
We already have algebra that is carried over from the middle school.
When we sit down to discuss the issue this year, the department of
public instruction and the North Carolina-</p>

of school administrators all agree that this was a way that we  could
bring a credit to arts education without cost possibly. There may be
some cost, we're not sure they will report back to us after they finish
their allotting, but I know of no one who is in opposition of this
legislation, I believe we have the support of the NCAE and the North
Carolina Association of School Administrators, DPI, and of course the
Arts Council. We would hope that you would support this legislation,
we're open for any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wanted to just add one think we might have left off. I thought of so
many things I could say to you all, but I thought no, less is best.
We've learned up here, but I think this stands on this merits but this
if when it is passed, it will be implemented with the 2016 9th grade
class. That's when it will start.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Ross?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much Mr. Chairman. This is a great bill, I'm glad that I
got to vote for it  every single time through its journey, and I, even
though I know you had to change it to go back to the 6th grade, I think
that that might be better because you might catch some students who are
younger who get inspired by the arts and that might help keep them in
school if the schools try to satisfy this requirement earlier on. So
sometimes with- like fine wine, it just takes a little time and it comes
out better in the end. And at the appropriate time Mr. Chairman, I'd
like to make a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you.
Rep. Adams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair.
The Representative beat me to that request to make a motion, but let me
just say first of all it is a wonderful bill, the arts are truly basic,
they are absolutely essential, they're nice, they're niceties, but
they're also necessities I think, particularly for children as we try to
expand their knowledge not only in creating things, whether they are
performing, or whether they are using their hands to make things that
gives- it opens so many doors to so many possibilities. I've just had
the privilege to study the arts, and to be involved in the arts for over
40 years, all of my training is in the arts and I really know what it
does for young people and how much they are going to learn about
themselves and about their communities. So I commend the bill to you, it
is a wonderful bill and I'm happy to see it come, and like the
representative from Raleigh I'm happy to support it over and over again.
Thank you very much and I hope the committee will support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks. Whenever I hear that everybody's on board, I think of the
Pirates of Penzance and how they rounded up everybody and put them on
board. And I may be the first of all to establish my bona fides on this,
I was a 2 year government funded artist in my youth, and my brother and
my wife are lifelong professional artists, musicians, full time. However
the problem is this, if you require- and also I teach 4th grade, I teach
them how to sing as well as the bible. Okay. Having said all that,
there's some things that are better taught to people who want to be
taught than not. And the problem here is if it's a credit required for
graduation, that means a credit that somebody's going to have to take
that they may need for something else like math, or economics, or
whatever, and if you have an 11th grader who comes into the system anew,
what's going to happen to them? All sorts of practical issues. And how
do you say you're dealing with basic education, when you're requiring
for graduation something that is necessary for society but not
necessarily necessary for every student?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I address that, Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Johnson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If it were my children, they would certainly prefer not to take History
either, but sometimes we feel those things are valuable. I do believe
that arts education is so necessary and that this is the time for that
to happen. Two things that</p>

<p id="10:00">
The economy and the education of an individual in itself are necessary,
and the two things that are happening in the 21st century are two things
that people need to be successful, it's creative thinking- critical
thinking and creativity. And that's where the arts comes in to make a
successful entrepreneur, a successful student, or as Representative
Adams says, &quot;A personal gain.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wanted to share a quick story about why the arts are important and why
they should be required. Sixteen years ago, when I was a county
commissioner, our community went through a major debate about funding of
the arts and the importance of arts in education, and that's where it
became the big centre focus of discussion in our county, was that arts
education was important. But I had a teacher during the budget period
that wrote to me, and I had numerous teachers that wrote to me during
our budget process, but I had one teacher that wrote and said, &quot;Let
me tell you why the arts are important and why it's important for
students in middle school to have that exposure and why they should take
it. I had a student,&quot; she wrote, &quot;who was going to drop out of
school. Had been telling me for three weeks and finally walked in one
morning and said to me, Miss so-and-so, I am dropping out. Friday is my
last day.&quot; She looked at him out of desperation and said,
&quot;What is it that you love to do? Tell me one thing you love to do
and let me see what I can do about it.&quot; He said, &quot;Well, I love
to sing.&quot; She went to the principal an asked the principal,
&quot;This kid is worth saving. I would like to know if he could come in
and sing the morning announcements.&quot; The principal let him, that
child stayed in school, found his direction, and became a graduate in
the school system. That's why it is important. There was another letter,
and to Representative Stam's comment, from a mother who said, &quot;I'm
trying to find something that my child will be focused on.&quot; The
child had some learning disabilities, and she said, &quot;What is it
that we can do?&quot; and this teacher said, &quot;Well, have you tried
any of the electives with arts, dance, chorus, any of that?&quot; and
she said, &quot;Oh, he's so shy.&quot; So she, again, another teacher in
the system, worked with that parent and that student and the choral
teacher, and the child found that they could sing, and it was never sang
out in the class, would not do that, wouldn't join the chorus, but it
was that one initiative that propelled that child and went on in high
school, and then got into the chorus at the high school level. The arts
do keep kids from dropping out of school, that's proven data that's out
there nationally. It is- you know, I keep thinking, one course week we
tell our students, &quot;You have to do this, you have to do that.&quot;
Well, at some point, you need to say, &quot;You have to be exposed to
culture, and we're just asking you- we're telling you to take one course
during your seven year to graduation, and that will count.&quot; 75 to
80 percent of our students in this state are already getting at least
one course in the arts. It's the others within the systems because it is
not required that there's not every child, and every child, certainly,
deserves to have that in their curriculum.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Pittman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First I want to say that I have no doubt that
Representative Johnson, Representative Conrad (??) have the best
intentions for this bill. However, I know, personally, we had art in
lower grades and I was so glad when it was over with because I had no
talent for it. I think art is a fine thing and for those who have the
talent and have the interest, it should be available, but is not an
essential. In thirty years' administry, I'd never had any need for it.
When I worked for fourteen years in the shipping department, Schneider
Packaging, I didn't have a need for any artistic knowledge. Thank God
somebody did have that knowledge and ability, because they were
producing things I was dealing with in shipping, and I wouldn't have had
that job without them, but this is just something I think should be an
elective that's available to those who have a talent and have a need for
it. I just guarantee you, I had-</p>

<p id="15:00">
Had to have passed an art course to graduate high school, I would not
have been able to graduate.  Algebra II and chemistry almost did me in,
and but I have no talent for art, I love it when I see other people do
it, but it would have killed me trying to get through high school having
to pass it.  And I just don’t think it’s something that we need to
require of those who don’t have the talent or the interest in it. Just
make it available for those who do but don’t force it on those who
don’t. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Rep. Lucas
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chair.  My inquiry may soothe or sustain
some of Representative Stams concerns and that is the idea that those
who espouse this bill perhaps we should coach and encourage those
students who will not have obtained 9th grade by 2016 to begin early on,
they have 2 years that they could begin early on to acquire that skill.
So why not encourage them during that two year interlude, so that they
won’t be faced with the situations that Representative Stam inquired
about in fulfilling their curricular program, grades 9 thru 12 since
they can start 6th.  Can we encourage them to do that, starting early?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think that reason for the 16th date was to make sure
that they established, they will continue to have arts in middle school
and they can carry those forward possibly, some students could acquire
that course through mastery, they also talked about that.  The state
board will of course send back what they think is the best policy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Shepard
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair.  I have a statement and a
question.  I told Rep. Carney earlier, I certainly support the arts. I
took Music in high school and also took some piano at one point in time,
I think it was very important to me that I was exposed to those arts.
But I have an educator of principle that I asked about this because
before I vote on anything I want to know how my local educators feel. He
said I think it would create another class that would cause students to
have to choose from, especially those who are taking AP electives. Keep
the programs but not the Grad requirement. But I also, now that you
mentioned to me that this could start in the sixth grade I think that
might would answer some of his problems, because I feel like he was
talking from the perspective of as high school principal and that it
might would interfere with some of those students and their AP electives
and so on and so forth. But if this in fact will start in the sixth
grade I think that will remedy some of those concerns that he has and I
do have a follow-up after you respond.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That was our problem in the 4 years prior. This
process that DPI is planning on coming up with does start with the sixth
grade but we have someone from DPI.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Christy from DPI could you step forth and address
this…Identify yourself for us… and… yeah that right there…the mics not
on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]There we go.  Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I’m Christy Lynn Shebert and I’m with arts education at
the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction. Request permission
to address the issue at hand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]You got it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So I believe the question was about students being
able to take the arts in middle grades and alleviating the concern of
having the pressure to fulfill that requirement solely in high school.
Is that correct?... So currently our basic education program says that
students will have access to the arts in grades K-12 and that in the
middle grades they will have access to all 4 arts disciplines and
required to take at least take one each year. So we know we have
students who are already fulfilling this without a formal requirement.
They do have access to the arts of middle grades they can take them and
as electives, they also should have access to the arts as electives in
high school.  In regard to the requirements issue my impression is that
we already have a six unit elective requirement in high school that may
be any combination arts education, career technical education or world
languages and…</p>

<p id="20:00">
so it seems that one of those 6 elective requirements could be the slot
that was taken. This would not be adding additional requirements for
high school graduation. I had the opportunity to attend meetings with
the joint select committee back in 2008 all along this journey and
testify to previous commissions and committees and pulled together lots
of research on the arts and I'm happy to address any of those questions.
But I did want to point out that it we look at the most recent data on
numbers of students enrolled in arts education courses from our
statistical profile for the state, within a given school year, we have
163.6% of all students across the state enrolled in 1 or more arts
course. Now it's higher than 100% because we have kids who are taking
more than 1 arts class within a given year, especially in the middle
grades. So it includes those, but it's also estimated as Rep. Carney
mentioned that approximately 75 to 80% of students across the state are
already taking an arts course in their high school career. So we don't
feel- the department does not feel that this is going to cause undue
hardship on the schools. The superintendents have been very supportive
of this, through the arts education tax force, through the proposed
legislation, and they like the flexibility of students being able to
obtain that credit in a lot of different ways, that they would have
options, and that it's not limited to high schools.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a follow up question, Mr. Chair.
I wanted to ask the bill sponsors just off the top of my head, would
carpentry  qualify for an arts?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm sure wood turning would, I'm sure wood turning would.
We have to look in the future. A lot of these will be under in the
future with technology, a lot of these things will be under the
technology program or different programs, but they will be classified as
&quot;art&quot;.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, may I?
I want to read a quote to you from Steve Jobs. I think everybody in here
knows who Steve Jobs was and is.
&quot;The Macintosh turned out so well because the people working on it
were musicians, artists, poets, and historians who also happened to be
excellent computer scientists. &quot; That's what the arts brings to our
students.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Whitmire.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
First a point of appreciation, then I have a three point question-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Your mic's not on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Test test. Alright.
A point of appreciation  and a 3 part question to follow.
The initial bill was concerning from the standpoint of making sure it's
not unfunded mandate. I greatly appreciate expanding to the 6-12th
grades. When it comes to this, the push back was coming from a school
system that is not a small school or low wealth system, and I see that's
removed from the bill, which already has 77% of their high school
students taking one of the art electives during their 4 years of high
school. By expanding it, I think that is great because that allows you
to sort of absorb what could be challenging especially with small
schools. That being said, 1: Do you perceive any assistance having to
maybe undermine their elementary arts to be able to spread their art
capabilities to the middle and high schools to be able to achieve this?
Number 2: Are there any licensure issues, and the big question is this:
In the 2 school systems out of the 3 that I'm referring to in my
district, we do art exploratory along with other exploratories in middle
school. That is not a year long situation. But, it allows a greater
breadth and scope of ETE, foreign language, arts, and a whole lot of
peripheral that are very important to the whole person concept. Will
those middle school exploratory classes count, even though they're not
one year?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I'd think ?? I might want to respond to that, but I will say on
the licensure piece, arts teachers are licensed from 6 through 12th
grade.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think I'm on permission to respond?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, in regards to taking away from</p>

<p id="25:00">
K5. I don't believe that that would be an issue, in that we already have
the percentages of students enrolled in arts courses in grades 6 - 12
and grades K - 12. So, and as Representative Carney mentioned, our
licensure actually goes K - 12 in each of the arts disciplines, so any
arts educators--and we do have arts educators that are teaching in K-8
settings, or 6-12 settings, or any other combination you might be able
to think of--there probably would not be any kind of unintended
consequence to K-5 if this goes through. Licensure issue, we addressed..
exploratory in middle school, I think that the legislation says that DPI
will look at what the options and guidance would be for meeting this
requirement. I know in the conversations with the research team that we
talked about flexibility, maximum flexibility for school systems. We
know about the exploratory courses. There's also an emphasis with the
state board right now on mastery-based learning, which allows students
to meet requirements not just based solely on seat time in school. So, I
think that what would be sought is maximum flexibility.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you, Christopher. I've got a number of people that want to
speak. I'm wondering what is our position here.. we're gonna run out of
time, we've got another bill, so.. I would like to move on here, with
Representative ???.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, just two very brief things. I did not have the question answered,
what do you do about the 11th grader who comes in from another state?
Are we gonna hold them back a semester if they can't fit into credit?
And secondly, I'll point out, Chapel Hill had a requirement for decades
that you had to learn how to swim to graduate. Now, I think it's very,
very important to learn how to swim, but we had people at Chapel Hill
that did all the coursework, and never went swimming, and didn't
graduate! And they finally repealed that. The question, all of the
argument about this is it should be widely available. What I have yet to
hear is an argument about why it should be a requirement to graduate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will take just a stab at a comment about.. U.S. employers constantly
are rating creativity and innovation among the top 5 skills that will
increase in importance over the next 5 years. I believe, and I think the
other bill sponsors and the numerous people that have signed onto the
bill in support of this throughout this stay, we need to be on that
competitive edge of our skilled workers. For them to be able to apply
knowledge and proven outcomes through arts training.. this is a bill
that says in 3 years we will start the implementation. We're asking the
legislature, this legislature, to say to people that look at North
Carolina, that we value the arts, and that we value our students and a
creative workforce coming out of our schools in North Carolina. Here's
some amazing charter schools that are already doing this; they're, of
course, private schools that are doing it.. and there's some amazing
public schools that are already at the table. It's those schools that
have not stepped up and said we just don't value the arts enough to find
that position, and we have a few of those in the state, but they're
willing, if it's required of them. This is a 3 year process for DPI,
where we have put in the bill they shall establish the procedures we're
talking about. There is a lot of flexibility built into this with DPI.
Students who are on the AP tracking, they.. it maybe that they are able
to take a course of the summer. If they are in an intense dance group
outside of school, it may be that they may be able to used as a credit.
Those are the things that the DPI will be charged with looking at, the
implementation and the criteria that you were talking about with the
11th grader that has not, that moved in here.. and by the way, I think
there are 27 states that require arts for graduation, so we're in a
minority right now, but I believe there will be a way to address those
students who move here from another state that didn't have an arts
requirement. I believe there will be that flexibility, and again</p>

...of why this Bill drives me so much is the creativity that the Arts
brings that will find a way, to work around those, those perimeters that
might affect just a few children. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Representative ??. Representative Graham.
Representative Adams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you Mr. Chairman. I don't want to prolong it. I
wanted the person from VPI to talk a little bit about. Don't have to do
that but what I didn't hear was, and that was not the question, about
the value of the arts in terms of increasing student's performance
academically. And I've got to tell you, being an Arts educator, knowing
what the data and research says, the Arts are basic. They are as basic
as Mathematics and Science and all those other things and the Arts do
help students to reason, to organize, and do all the things that are
necessary to do well academically. So, I hope we can move on and pass
this Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Representative Horn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you Mr. Chairman. I do believe you answered
Representative Stam's concern. It was a concern of mine as well, but
given the implementation as you've laid it out, I accept that. When it
comes to requiring something like this in K or what is it? Sixth through
twelve. I can't sing, I can't dance, I don't have any real ability to
draw, any of that stuff. But I'll tell you what Art does bring to the
party. Perspective. Perspective, which is key to success in Business, in
Academia. It's key to success in life. It's perspective and that's what
an Arts course would bring to our kids here in North Carolina. I urge
this Committee to recommend favorably this PCS. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Representative Fisher.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you Mr. Chairman. I just want to, I know I was
a little bit late coming into the meeting, but I just want to emphasize
the fact that Arts is a big part of what keeps children in school in the
first place. When you don't find them being productive in other classes,
if you get them signed on to an Arts class, that's the thing that
inspires them and keeps them going toward graduation and beyond. And,
this has been a long time coming. And I'm sensing a pretty good bit of
support in here and I'm really hoping that people will vote in favor of
this Bill to send it forward and thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Representative Elmore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you Mr. Chairman. Two of the points that have
been made basically deal with the idea of talent, and also about the
idea the Arts make you feel good. I wanted to address the idea of talent
first. We know all of our children in the school are not star athletes,
but yet we require them to take a physical education course because we
understand the importance of trying to be physically fit. Some are not
talented physically, but yet we require them to take that course because
of, and we're seeing more and more today, the problems with obesity,
etcetera. It reminds me of this same situation. We understand that not
everybody is going to be talented piano player, or a wonderful singer,
but exposing them to it helps them with the understanding of it. Also,
the Arts have, they go beyond this feel good and I think that's what we
ran on for years. Saying the Arts make the kids feel good and a lot of
people have that type perception. It really deals with job development
these days. This Committee has been very committed to looking forward,
especially with digital learning, because we're seeing the changing
world in front of us. Representative Carney is correct. The job market
now, as we move to a service based economy, you hear key words,
entrepreneurship, collaboration, innovation, people that can work in
groups, creativity. Because these problems are put before them for them
to solve, those are essential job skills. Those are job skills that my
kids in district 94 are not really getting. This would allow that to
happen so when they get out, they can meet this new job market. I've
never seen so much change in the past five years in education and in our
economy and we've been forward thinking with the digital learning to try
to look for the future. I think this bill does the exact same thing, to
try to tackle this new economy. Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Representative ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you Mr. Chair. I'll be really quick. I do have
a question about the capacity. I know that we talked...</p>

<p id="35:00">
the capacity on the student end, I worry about the capacity on the
teacher end, because I know in my district a lot of teachers go from
school to school, because there are not enough art teachers and if we
built in a lot more students taking art, I wonder if we have the
capacity for us to serve all those additional students taking art. A
second thing I’ll say, I love the Bill, I’ll support the Bill, but I do
think that there are things like financial literacy and [literacy’s]
that I think we could require that think would be a lot more suitable.
So, I hope we would look at that, I mean we have people that are
graduating that don’t know how to write a check or don’t know what
credit is and don’t know how to balance books and things like that. I
wonder if we are requiring such things why haven’t we looked at those
essential cases for people to have basic life and live.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Johnson, do you have an answer to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just want to say we have tried through the
legislature for the financial point, that Bill did not make it, maybe
it’s in the same string that this art education Bill is. As far as the
availability of teachers, I believe DPI did address that, but if you’d
like to explain it again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Christy a short answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Quick answer. This is an addition to what I shared
earlier, state wide we have just over 5200 arts educators, that’s 6.81 %
of all teachers in the schools are art teachers. There was a physical
report done with the commission last year in 2012, which stated that
current capacity exist for at least one arts course per student
currently.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you.  The final person before I have
Representative Ross is Representative [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. I’d like to directly answer, I
think Representative Stam’s question. One of the things I’ve seen in
arts through my 56 years here is that, if it remains an elective, as
funding continues to get tight in education, more times than not funding
is removed form those electives and pushed to the basics. I know that we
had a problem with this some years ago when every one was talked about
reading, writing and arithmetic, understanding that only one of those
actually began with an “R”. What I’m hoping is that, with this becoming
pretty much mandatory that it helps to build the professions, that I’m
aware of, that can emerge from someone with a skill, a capability and a
talent that comes from the art community. Professions, architects, I you
can go down the list and name professions, our sporting teams, even
their design of their uniforms and the colors that are put onto the
uniforms is an artistic skill and capability. Not even to mention the
economic impact just in North Carolina that we have from our arts
community is tremendous. So, what this actually is, it promotes, I look
at it like more of a technical type, where we might have used to teach
shop or electrical HVAC, to teach professions. This is an opportunity to
have this be taught as a profession and improve the job development in
North Carolina. I’m in full support with that Mr. Chairman. Call the
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Ross, I’m ready for your motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I move that we give . . .This
is a Committee substitute?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Its the PCS and goes to appropriations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I noticed that, thank you Mr. Chairman. I move that we
give the Committee Substitute for House Bill 127 a favorable report,
unfavorable as to the original Bill and that Bill be referred to the
Appropriations Committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you have a division?

Thank you. Thank you so much me chairman and me chairman we have an
amendment that is being passed out to start off with that simply changes
the title. We did not anticipate the title being this long and so we
want to have the perception that this is a friendly bill to allow folks
to offer amendments. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Me chairman? Me chairman? Over here. We don’t have the PCS [SPEAKER

I think we're headed there sorry. I thought we had already handed all

as the pcs is coming to you what is also being passed out is just an
amendment just to shorten the title that’s all it does so that if the
folks have amendments they’d like to offer the title would not prohibit
us at any point in committee or on the floor or wherever so that’s all
that this amendment does is just to shorten the title and if we could

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have a motion to adopt the amendment all in favor say aye [SPEAKER

Aye [SPEAKER CHANGES]. All opposed no. ayes have it. The amendment is

Thank you Mr. Chair. folks this is House Bill 452 452 the 2013 school
safety act and throughout all of our years in the legislature we've seen
so many different pieces of legislature that deal with school reform as
we just debated arts education and all those bills are very very
important however if our kids aren’t safe all these bills really are in
vain for me That’s really the most important thing we can do for our
students and our school system. Will this bill offer a 100% secure
blanket of safety to our children and our students? The answer is no I
don’t think any bill can do that but without question this bill does
some common sense things that will help us and help make our schools
safe.  very quickly I’m just going to walk through the components of the
bill and I've got several other bill sponsors with me and I’m going to
let them speak and go through the parts that they would like. but I’m
just going to walk through the PCS very quickly with you the first and
foremost important thing this bill does is it makes an effort to put
more SRO officers in the school system there’s also a second component
of that which creates a volunteer program which Representative Arp was
kind enough to allow us incorporate into this bill and I'm going to let
Representative Arp explain that part since it was his measure but the
part of the bill in its original form it creates a 2:1 match for
counties to help them put more SRO officers in the school system. The
second thing it does is it puts panic alarm systems in every classroom
much like we as legislatures we have panic buttons in our offices that
we could press in case of an emergency. This bill would put a panic
alarm system in every classroom so that the local law enforcement cold
be alerted immediately. Part four puts in place school safety exercises.
It requires that at least every two years each LEA must hold a full
system wide school safety and school lockdown exercise with local law
enforcement agencies that are part of the local board of education’s
emergency response team. part five which is also a very common sense
part puts in there that every school system should have a schematic
diagram of the schools facilities given to the local law enforcement and
for them to have a master keys that they can get instant access into the
schools in case of a crisis every second is critical and we don’t want
law enforcement to have to ram a door down or break glass let’s let them
have key so that they can get instant access. part six creates an
anonymous tip line which Representative Glazier said his county
Cumberland had significant success doing that and we want to incorporate
that part as well.it also calls for crisis kits to be placed
strategically  into the school system and that pretty much wraps up the
highlights of the bill with the exception of what Representative Arp
added I will tell you what the PCS does differently from its original it
requires the local board of education to adopt an emergency response
plan establishes the volunteer school safety resource officer program
which Representative Arp will explain and it just makes conform and
technical changes but again folks I’ll tell you this bill</p>

<p id="45:00">
Not 100 percent answer, but I don't think that any bill can provide
that. But I can say that this is honestly the most comprehensive bill
that has been proposed since the New Town tragedy, without question, and
I think that we would be, well, I think that would be very unwise for us
not to move forward with these kinds of policies because we don't want
tragedies like that happening in our school systems. With that being
said, I'm going to turn it over to explain this part of the bill as
well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank you Representative Holloway, and members,
and I'll try and be brief, but I do want to point out, aside from taking
through a couple of things, I also want to point out where some of it
came from so that you can have the context for any discussion, and what
I will say is to follow Representative Holloway's point out to call NCSL
late last week, and we talked and I asked them, they're tracking of
course school safety bills all across the country, and they did say that
it is safe to say that this bill is the most comprehensive bill in the
country on school safety and they are tracking it, and every move that
we are making on it, and going to be highlighting it to our colleagues
across the country. And it is a bipartisan bill, so while we sometimes
have our partisan differences, it is nice on an issue like child safety,
to have a real bipartisan consensus and to do something that will
actually save kids lives and make schools safer. So with that, and if
I'll go through this very quickly, Representative Holloway has already
talked to you about section 1, which adds SRO officers on a 2 to 1
match. The other thing to point out here is we added in Charter schools
so that we can make sure that they can apply as well, and to make sure
that the LEAs can use this money for training as well as for hiring,
because obviously training for SRO's for elementary schools is a new
issue, and there has got to be real cognitive and social kinds of
development and training that we didn't necessarily have to do for high
schools, although it has its own set of issues. Section 2 of the bill is
a bill, a part that also adds on a 1 to 1 match, substantial additional
dollars this year and next year for the hiring of school psychologists,
social workers, and guidance counselors. Despite the fact of New Town
and the tragedy it was, the biggest threat to schools is internal, and
not external: Columbine as a good example. The most that we can do is to
have more bodies gaining intel in the schools. There was a really good
article our state legislative magazine and another one in the American
School Board Journal this past year, that said our first line of
prevention is having the best intelligence, and these folks are the ones
that can do that. In doing that, in section 2b of your bill, you'll see
that we adopted actually a provision that Representative Larry Bell has
been on for quite some time, which is if we're going to have school
counselors and we're going to have additional school counselors they
ought of be told that they can just do their job, as opposed to being
given everybody else's job to do. So no longer would school counselors
be assigned Testing Coordinator full-time responsibilities, as opposed
to really acting as guidance counselor for kids which is what we want
them to be doing. Section 3, the panic alarm section, came about as a
result of New Town. One of the first studies and came out, and
conversations was out on CNN and then on NPR by a couple of safety
experts across the country, and they said one of the easiest and
cheapest things you could do, was to hook up an alarm from each
classroom directly to the first provider, so that if something is
happening somewhere else in the school, there would be a way to kick it
in instantly. Some school districts are doing it now. Wake I think is
undergoing it, my system is undergoing it, but there's also a lot of
systems that can't afford it and this is a way to help them do something
that is cheap and effective. You'll see in section 4, we require safety
table top exercise. This is one of the classic lessons of New Town, and
that is you've got to practice what you're going to do, and so there has
got to be, both system wide and at each school, practice exercises to
deal with a crisis situation. As you may recall in New Town one of the
reasons the teachers were able to handle it so well is they had just
gone through a table top exercise recently in doing that. And if you
want to know we're on the right track on this, last week's education
week, the New Town Commission issued its school safety report following
the tragedy, and one of the specific things they said was that you have
to have the table top exercises being done on a routine basis. You'll
find on part 5 the school schematic and this Representative Holloway
referred to, the thing to know

<p id="50:00">
there as this talks about whenever you make a change to exit and
entrances, as well as you add buildings, the police need to know about
that.  ⁭If they're running to a place, they don't need to know that
you've changed the exits on them, and so sometimes we provide the
original diagram of the school, but then when we go about and renovate
it, we never give them a new diagram.  Section 6, the anonymous tips
line, I talked with, just in the back actually with Secretary Shanahan's
folks, I think the Secretary is going to be instituting a statewide
anonymous line so I think the system can either go with the statewide
line, or create their own.  In my district we created one 3 years ago on
a grant, and there were in those 3 years, there were over 300 calls, but
there was over 80 identified, substantiated calls that either saved an
incident, or prevented one that they thought might have happened had
they not had the anonymous tip line, so it is well worth it.  The school
component, Part 7 the school safety component, do you remember, we took
out to eliminate paperwork, the school safety plans last year, but we
still have school improvement team plans.  Well, it's what
Representative Holloway said, you're not going to be able to educate
them if they're not safe.  So this just makes sure that within the
school improvement team plan the safety component not only is thought
about, but actually reviewed by the superintendent which hadn't been
required under the law, and by the school board, which hadn't been
required under the law, so they actually had to meet and adopt those
plans so that they know what's happening in each school and you'll see
that on page 5.  If you look further, the Crisis Kit section of the bill
is actually a recommendation by the International Association of the
Chiefs of Police and so we've adopted that.  And then, if you look,
finally the last pages, Representative Arp will talk about, but there an
addition of the volunteer schools safety resource officer program,
emphasis that it is volunteer, volunteer both by people, and by the
sheriff, and he'll talk about that.  And I guess I would close by saying
that nearly every provision in this bill is something other states are
looking at, or enacted, but no state had put it together, and I think
the impetuous should go to all of us here on a bipartisan basis, and to
the speaker of the House who actually allowed this tasks force to meet
and put this bill together, and I hope that you will join me in voting
to move the bill on, and I thank you.  With that, Mr. Chair, I do have
an amendment of something that was left out.
Okay, is the amendment passed out?  Yeah, go ahead Mr. Blane.
This was just a sentence that we, in putting in Representative Arp's
section, that we forgot to add it in, and it's just to put it in that
the volunteers accepted does also have to receive training on social and
cognitive developments, and any other standards the sheriff wants them
to have if they're going to be working with children.  So, it's the same
thing we had in the other part of the bill, but we're just adding it
back in the volunteer section.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]We'll pass that amendment now.  Representative Rodan?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Question for Representative Glazier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative, could you just tell me the costs of the
anonymous tip line?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yeah, the anonymous tip line for Fayetteville, for
Cumberland, we got a $50,000 grant for a 2 year period, and so you'll
see there's also a sentence in that bill that says DPI's to alert all
districts to federal, state, and private money that's available, because
there is a bunch of private money available for support of these tip
lines.  And I can give you, the one that we were using out of New York
City, actually.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Does everybody got a copy of the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Horn moves for the adoption of the
amendment.  Any discussion on the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes, Mr. Torbett
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  If I could ask the presenter
a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]You may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Representative Glazier, the
bill's very well drafted, and I support the bill.  My concerns go a
little bit deeper in that the drill down of the technique that we
provide for the kids in the classroom, and the teachers, and the
administrators.  It's just point on, it comes to my attention through an
exercise that was run back in my district, that some of the technique
now is a simplistic technique where they pretty much huddle the kinds in
one area of the classroom, and in doing this exercise, it's not a happy
outcome. That when everyone was centralized at one location, the outcome
was not successful.  But some of the more practiced techniques of
retaliation</p>

<p id="55:00">
And exiting out exterior windows.  That seemed to be, well actually
during the exercise, it proved to be a more favorable outcome. So I hope
that as we just enact this legislation openly, that we will do more than
that.  That we will ensure that the techniques that are applied through
this legislation, in the classroom, are actually techniques that provide
the most successful outcome should the worst possible incident occur.
That's my concern.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And Representative Torbett, I completely share it.
And if you look on page seven, lines twenty-two to twenty-five, we
specifically tasked the Department of Public Safety under the
Secretaries plan of creating the Center for Safer Schools in conjunction
with the Department of Justice, and DPI, to develop those school
emergency in crisis training modules, so that i looks at the best
practices, and I think it does exactly what you're talking about.  Which
is making sure that we're actually training and teaching the best way to
respond, and not sort of the tornado drill, just adapted kind of thing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman for follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's it.  Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman.  Thank you Representative
Glazier on that comment.  Do you feel satisfied that, inside your
legislation, there is a report back language, so not only do we enact
something, but we actually get feedback, and a guarantee that what we
have enacted is providing the best possible outcome.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I do actually, and I think in several places.
And so I'm certainly willing, and I think we'd be willing at the next
stop to add in anything, a different reporting mechanism, but I feel
very comfortable about that, and I suspect as well, to the extent that
there are the granting and appropriations process outcomes are going to
be really important, and those processes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We're going to polish here.  We got a motion to accept
the amendment.  All in favor there, say aye.  All oppose no.  Ok, we got
some other presenters here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, if the other two have some brief
comments, and then Representative Arp wants to quickly explain his
volunteer SRO program, and then we'll be finished.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Very briefly, members, you note that we've tried to
design this so that you can implement it, and tailor it to local usage.
I appreciate Representative Torbett's concern, and that's the reason we
want to have the LEAY drill every two years, and the school wide drill
every year, so that you can tailor this to suit each individual school.
We recognize that the schematics are different for various schools, and
some schools may modify and hone their process in a way that other
schools do not.  It's all designed for the matter of safety, and in the
first sections of this bill, we recognize that not everybody is going to
have the resources to implement the floor plan immediately.  Some
affluent school systems may have more resources to implement this faster
than some of the schools who are challenged, and so we've designed it
purposefully this way.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Faircloth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman.  Just a couple of words.  This
bill represents the bringing together of best practices by law
enforcement, and the protection community, and from the educational
community, and the protection they try to do.  And what it does, I
think, is give the clues, and the powers to these two groups to work
together for the best protection for our children.  The Chief's and
Sherrif's are definitely on board.  They are willing, and want to work
with the schools, and the schools are certainly are willing to work with
law enforcement because we've all seen what the problem is.  I certainly
do recommend this whole deal on the behalf of law enforcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you ladies and gentleman.  My piece of this is
what I termed &quot;The Gold Star Officer Program&quot;.  The genesis of
this came to me when we realized we had four school shootings last year,
four, in the K-12.  That doesn't even include what was happening in the
University level or in other shootings outside the public places of
assembly.  I had folks in my district, who are retired law enforcement
officers, that came to me, and said, &quot;What can I do?  I can't do
some things, but here is what I can do.&quot;  And so that was the
genesis of this idea about volunteer school resource officer program.
We're calling it &quot;Gold Star Officer Program&quot;.  What this does
is allow the counties, as voluntary, the Sheriff, or the local police
chief can...</p>

-institute this program where they can come in and vet the volunteers
just as they would any other deputy, they can go through the firearm and
education training and be certified as a school resource officer, and
can go into the schools and be utilized on a voluntary basis. The great
thing about this is America is at its best when we used volunteers, and
these people bleed red, white, and blue. They want to help and this is a
way, and I think the public feels very safe with law enforcement
personnel in the schools protecting the students, and this follows along
with that. I was so pleased to marry these ideas about additional
resources from school psychologists and SROs, but this also allows a
different perspective of volunteers. The people who qualify for this are
people with retired law enforcement experience, people who are in the
military police and have military police background and training, that
are either reserve or honorably discharged, they can all be a part of
this. It's totally discretionary, they're under the control and
direction of the police chief or sheriff at all time, they have arrest
powers just like SROs, so I would answer any questions regarding this,
but this is basically the piece that we want to bring in.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What we've got is a number of people who want to speak and I'm going to
take them in the order I take and then it may be a little off from what
has just been said, so you can raise that question at the time you are.
Representative Holloway?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That completes our presentation ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Shepard?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. Representative Holloway, if your local school system already
has an emergency response plan in place, will that suffice for this, or
will they be required to develop a new one that would be accordingly?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll let Representative Glazier answer that one, but in my opinion it
would suffice, but I may be wrong.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I agree that it would as long as it's now reviewed by the superintendent
and by the Board of Education so that everybody kind of knows what we're
doing and we're working on the same thing game plan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brandon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just wanted to say that I'm kind of jealous I
didn't get to be on this bill. It's so perfect, it's a really good bill,
but I wanted to say that from all the school counsellors that I hear
from all the time that this is really good for them in terms of they get
to do what they do, as a person who's only here because of a school
counsellor who took time to do their job and I realize that they don't
get to do that any more. I really appreciate you guys putting that in a
bill. I do have a question about the volunteer part. When you say
volunteer, at the end of your comments you said they were retired law
enforcement. Can anybody volunteer or do they have to have some type of
police training or something close to that, or is anybody can say,
&quot;Hey, I want to be a volunteer&quot;?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I can answer that. In short, they have to have law enforcement
background, whether it be military or former ?? police officer, but I'll
let Representative Arp ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's correct. To qualify as a volunteer you have to have that police
training in your background. Again, that goes to the confidence that the
public has that these are school resource officers. We also put in there
additional training- volunteering from military-police background. So
one of those two qualifies you, but the chiefs and the sheriffs vet the
volunteers as they would any other deputy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fisher.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. For a comment and then for a motion: I have
just a great admiration and appreciation for the bipartisan work that's
gone into this bill and the thing that is most heartening to me is that
we are getting ready to set, once again, North Carolina is going to set
the example for the rest of the country in healthy ways to approach the
school safety issue, and I appreciate the bipartisan aspect, the fact
that you all worked together to bring us this really comprehensive bill,
and Mr. Chairman, at the appropriate time I would like to move for a
favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Elmore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was going to make a motion-</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Time but I think Representative Fisher would probably
do a better job with it considering all the amendments, and PCS’s and
everything else.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Graham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. I think this is probably one of
the best things we’re doing this legislative session this year. Probably
the premier bill, and I commend the bill sponsors for using their
imagine and coming together in the bipartisan way. I do have a question.
I love every aspect of this legislation. My question is, why are we not
fully funding this, as opposed to that match to local school districts.
Especially Tier 1 counties, like the ones that I come from that may not
have the financial capacity to do that. That’s my question and a
concern.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And I think all of us certainly understand that. We
were trying to operate within the confines of the budget circumstances
we face. I think that Representative Holloway is one of the
appropriations chairs and certainly knows it as well as anyone here. And
I think the goal was to leverage money so that we are putting out
essentially 34 million over a two-year period, but it’s really
leveraging about 70 million. There are districts that can match. You’ll
see some language in there that need-based comes first in these grant
proposals. And it will require the systems also to pick which one is the
biggest priority for them. But it was really a question of just
extraordinarily tight resources, trying to leverage it, and getting the
most we possibly could. I hope there will be an opportunity for more
later, but I think in candor, given where we are, this is as good as we
can get right now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I agree with Representative Glazier  Everything he
said is true. And we just feel this is important enough that we need to
get moving, get the ball rolling. And as was said, there’s always an
opportunity to put more in later. But considering the budget situation
we have, it just has to be dollar amounts we can afford. So that’s where
we started.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Warren.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. This will be for any of the bill
sponsors. I noticed in part two, when you talk about increased funding
for school psychologists, guidance counselors and social workers, the
one position, the duties of the school counselor, you went to some
length to enumerate those. To be very specific, that the direct services
do not include the coordination of standardized testing and that the
support activities also do not include the coordination of standardized
testing. I can understand from the emails I’ve received from school
counselors, I guess a good deal of their time has been devoted to
serving in that capacity, and taking them away from their primary
responsibilities. So it begs the question, if they’ve been pulled away
from that because of cuts in the staffing due to the budget crisis we’ve
had for the last four years or so, how are the schools going to offset
the loss of being able to utilize them for any ?? of time in that
capacity?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well Representative Warren, I’m assuming you’re
talking about the standardized testing and how they’re going to be able
to take care of that? I suppose the administration may have to kick in
and help a little more. I can tell you from my exposure in the school
system and the six years that I spent teaching full-time, that basically
the guidance counselors, they just administered tests. That’s basically
all they did. And Representative Glazier hit the nail right on the head.
A lot of the problems with school violence is internal. And they need to
be there to help these children and students who need those services.
Again, we put the additional funds in there to provide grants to LEA’s
so that they can hopefully bring more of these folks in so they can
spend more of their time helping the kids who need the help. But again,
schools systems, I think the administrators, they can find a way. I
think the kids’ safety and making sure these internal problems don’t
occur would far exceed any test or anything they could ever take. But
I’ll let Representative Glazier speak to that as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank you, Representative
Holloway and Representative Warren. And also if you turn on page two, to
the section you were referring to, but also the section right underneath
it 2C, provides for each LEA to develop a transition plan for
implementing that, to make sure those duties are taken care of in
different ways. And of course Representative Bell may could talk about
this maybe more than anybody, but I agree with everything Representative
Holloway said, it will require the people to pick up, but the one people
we don’t want picking up these duties anymore are the people who are the
trained…</p>

...wants to be working with kids so it may require a different plan for
different schools, but we are asking each ???? to look at that and I
will say that we've run this bill past all of the educational groups and
have not had any opposition to this clause.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. I thank you for addressing that. That was a concern expressed to me
by some school officials. And, I just want to say, in conclusion that
it's an excellent bill. I commend you all for the hard work you put
forth on it; look forward to voting for it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fisher, I'm ready ??? The motion should be favorable to
the committee substitute as amended. Rolled into the original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And we are gonna send this to appropriations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. You took the words right out of my mouth. I move that we give
the proposed committee the substitute as amended a favorable report
unfavorable to the original bill with a re-referral to appropriations.
Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You've heard the motion. All in favor of the motion say Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
AYE.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed, No. The Ayes have it. The motion's carried.</p>
