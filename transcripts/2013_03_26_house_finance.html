<p id="00:00">
Committee members, we'll go back to the top of the agenda. House bill
179. Representative McElraft, are you? Hearing none. House bill 191,
Representative Brown. Oh, Representative Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chairman. Members. House bill 191 is
very straight forward bill. Back in 2006 there was a partial of land in
Grifton, North Carolina that was annexed into the town of Grifton so
that they could connect to the water supply and the sewage system for
hopes of a day care center. Unfortunately, the day care center never
came to fruition, and it never connected into the water system or the
sewage system. At this point the home owner seeks to be [DNXed] back out
of the town of Grifton, and what should be coming around now is not only
the proposal by the partial owner, but as well as a resolution passed by
the town of Grifton proposing this. This was brought to me by the
Grifton town manager. And with that I'll take questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Harry Warren.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister Chair did you say this was a PCs or was this
just an original bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is a original bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Mister Chair at the appropriate time I'd like to
make a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further questions from the committee? We have an
appropriate time. Representative Warren.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I'd like to make a motion to give a favorable report
on the bill before us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee you've heard the motion on
the floor. Any further discussion? If not, all in favor say,
&quot;Aye.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed? Motion carried.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Brown. At this time we will
have a report from the occupancy tax subcommittee. Representative
Moffitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chair, members. Last Thursday, the
21st of March, the House finance subcommittee on occupancy tax convened
to consider House bill 193. After much discussion - as well as a
position from the North Carolina travel and tourism coalition. Not
opposing the bill, we passed it out favorably.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Moffitt. Representative
McElraft just arrived so we'll take up her House bill 179.
Representative McElraft. There is a PCS for this. Representative Wells
moves to have the PCS before us for discussion. All in favor say,
&quot;Aye.&quot; All opposed. Motion carried. Representative McElraft.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chair and members of the committee.
I apologize for my tardiness. I had to go to my office to get my bill. I
thought I had it in my car. Hopefully this is a simple bill. It is-- it
was requested by three of my little towns in Carteret County. They, only
one of them had police, fire and EMS. The other two really depended on
the county for that. And what they did was form an inner local agency -
the three towns did - and got together and used the resources combined
to allow them to have cost-effective fire, ambulance, EMS, and police
protection. And when they formed that ILA, inner local agency, they
realized that they had not in the general statue been protected - the
same way they were as individual towns - from paying sales and motor
fuel excise taxes. And all this does is give them as an ILA the same
authority that they had as individual towns, and be exempt from those
taxes. And Mister Chair I'll take any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative McElraft. Representative
Brawley, Robert.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chairman, at the appropriate time
I'd like to make a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further questions from the committee?
Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Does this treat all inner local agencies
the same across the state, or would they be the only ones that receive
this exemption?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll ask that, but I believe this is a state-wide
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Roney?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, it would treat all inner local agencies the same.
But it's limited to inner local agencies that provide emergency
services, fire services, or police services. And so if there was another
inner local agency that provided the services, then it would be entitled
to sales tax refunds and be exempt from motor fuels.</p>

<p id="05:00">
Any further questions? Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just for staff, a notice on the fiscal note,
the impact is minimal. Is that because we’re really talking about a very
limited group that we’re adding to the statutes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Johnson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right now, many of the interlocal agreements would qualify for the sales
tax refund because of a bill we passed back in 2009 that applied to
volunteer fire...well, fire departments, but it was originally designed
for volunteer fire departments. That town...the interlocal agreement
hasn’t had any problems with their sales tax refund. It’s actually the
motor fuels refund that we’re not sure how many agencies right now that
it would be applicable, but in talking to the firemen’s association,
there’s a universe of about a thousand possible, but we don’t know how
many of those are created through interlocal agreements. It would open
the motor fuels tax refund up to that group.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Representative Luebke? Representative Luebke, we’re not
hearing you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m sorry. Trying to look both ways. Minimum general fund impact. How
can you be sure it’s minimal? Your answer...I understood your answer,
but it’s not clear to me that would make it minimal. It make it more
unable to determine? Or… I’m just curious.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It was the highway trust fund that would be affected by the motor fuels
refund. Many of the organizations already have a sales tax refund
because of a previous bill, so this was just creating due any
uncertainty, but as of now, I also contacted the department of revenue,
there aren’t any outstanding sales tax refund requests that apply to
that, so there was no foreseen general impact.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Warren.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I apologize because I’ve just now got the PCS here with the fiscal
impact statement there. On the last page, it says at maximum, expanding
the exemption reduces the highway and highway trust fund availability by
over $900,000. Is that the worst case scenario that you’re projecting
here? I guess that’s a question for staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir, that is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A question for staff again. Who all do we exempt from motor fuels tax?
Cities and counties, but who else gets this exemption? My guess is it’s
not very broad.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Cities, counties, community colleges, schools, US government, state
government and aviation fuel.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mss. Johnson, when you say cities and counties, does that include
volunteer fire departments and rescue squads?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To the extent that it’s applied for through the county. Often, county or
city fire departments have a voluntary component, but it’s the city that
applies for the sales tax refund and the motor fuels refund exemption.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m not real clear, but I think we need to be careful before we start
going down the road of exempting motor fuels tax from a lot of these
agencies. If I’m not mistaken, most volunteer fire department and rescue
squads, they don’t get an exemption on this, but they may. I guess it
depends on how they’re billed and so forth, but I just want to go slow
on exempting motor fuels tax. I’m not opposed to the sales tax.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Starnes. Any further discussion from the
committee? If not, all in favor…you’ve heard the motion from
Representative Robert Brawley for favorable report of this PCS. All in
favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed? Motion carried. Thank you, Representative McElraft.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. I just would say in the case of my towns, these
three towns would have been exempt and that one fire department would
have been exempt anyway because it was a city fire department. They
would have the motor fuels tax exempt anyway. My towns are not bringing
any more cost to the state, but opening it up might so.</p>

Representative McElraft, you have escaped the Finance Committee.
[Laughter]  Be thankful I would run.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  I know it.  I know it. [crosstalk]
SPEAKER CHANGES:  That motion's out of order Representative Blust, bless
your heart.  Will...[laughter] I think you would be safe.  We'll now
hear House Bill 193 explaining the use of the from Mecklenburg County
Charlotte local tax Representative Sameulson.  And we have a PCS for
this Bill.  Who would like to...Representative...Well, Bill Brawley
moves to have the PCS before us for discussion.  All in favor say aye.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Mr. Chairman.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Yes sir.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  All opposed.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Can I ask one question.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Of course.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Is this PCS different from the PCS that was approved
in the subcommittee, the Occupancy Tax Subcommittee?
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Sir, I didn't.  ??   I missed the question.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Just on PCS's I know we normally make them routine but
I would like to know whether this PCS differs from the PCS that was
favorably reported out of the Occupanc...Occupancy Tax Subcommittee of
the Finance Committee.
SPEAKER CHANGE:  Would you like for me to address that?
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Absolutely.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  It does but that's because the Occupancy staff, the
committee directed staff to draft the particular language so they OK'd
the intent.  We just didn't have the language that we needed to get it
done in committee, so staff, and she can add...explain that, she did it,
she drafted this according to the directions of the subcommittee.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Follow up.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Follow up.  Well, my question, Representative
Samuelson, is this, that typically our PCS's are just very routine but
we also know that under, under the rules it's possible for you and other
sponsors to really recommend an...another PCS to us that's different
from the PCS that was voted out of the subcommittee.  So that's my
question.  Is the PCS out of the subcommittee identical to the one
that's before us?
SPEAKER CHANGES:  This is essentially what the...this is in essence
exactly what the subcommittee approved.  It was just some of the
particular language they were working with the City Attorney to make
sure they had the right references and to get the language correct.  The
subcommittee approved the details of this and what it accomplishes, they
just didn't have the exact language.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Thank you.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  We have a motion on the floor to have this PCS before
us.  All in favor say aye.  All opposed.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Motion carried.  We have the PCS before us.
Representative Samuelson.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Thank you Mr. Chairman.  Some of you already heard a
good bit about this Bill but I'll go through it sort of briefly as an
overview.  Back in the nine...1990s when the Panther's came to Charlotte
and to the Carolina's, they did so with minimal amount of public impact.
 The public impact was, or public financing was primarily in the form of
land that the city owned that the stadium sits on, some road
construction and some other sorts of infrastructure.  There was no
actual city money or public money that was put into the stadium or to
any other part of the team.  Now you fast forward many years and even at
that time that was contrary to what was happening generally in
professional sports, and particularly in the NFL.  Now you move forward.
 You've got a stadium that's got some age on it,  you've got some
changes in the NFL around the country, and so the team had begun to
consider some improvements to their facility.  During the middle of that
they were approached by some other potential buyers that were willing to
put up a lot of public money to help the team relocate.  The City of
Charlotte then got in touch wih the team owners and said, look, we would
really like to keep the team here, can we work with you on some of these
improvements to see if we can help to make it such that it is in your
best interest to stay here in Charlotte?  So, they originally came to
us, to us being the Mecklenburg delegation, and I do want to recognize
that I've got Representative Earle on the Bill, Representative Carney,
and Representative Brawley and we have all been in a  number of meetings
with the team and the City of Charlotte.  Their original request was for
a one cent increase in the prepared food and beverage tax.  We all
looked at it and decided this was not the time to do that in Mecklenburg
County, or frankly in the state, given the fact that we're in the middle
of tax reform, but the economy is just now starting to turn around, and
the fact that Charlotte is the beneficiary of more special occupancy and
food and beverage tax, and other sorts of taxes.  They are the
beneficiary of more of them than any other municipality in the state.
But, we did recognize that Charlotte's in a unique position, not only of
having an NFL team, but that that stadium sits on city-owned land; and
so if the team were to relocate, you would have an empty stadium with an
absentee landlord sitting on city-owned land, plus you would lose all
the economic impact of over four-thousand jobs and over
three-hundred-million-dollars of economic benefit into the community.
So, I personally, and I want to speak this with the other three members
but.</p>

<p id="15:00">
When I looked at that, I thought, you know, the City, in under just
about any scenario at some point, is going to be put in the awkward
position of needing to invest in that property.  Because it sits on
their land. And so, the question I had was, &quot;Is it better to try to
do it now while we have the economic benefit or to wait until after the
team leaves and the city is either trying to buy the stadium, or tear
down the stadium, or at the very least put a fence around the
stadium?&quot;  And so it just seems to make better economic sense to do
it now than to wait and do it later when you've got an empty stadium.
So what we offered in exchange for -- not an exchange, as an
alternative, to the one cents sales tax was we said to the City,
&quot;The special taxes that you have currently going to the convention
center, which frankly is the same age as the stadium, they have a 3%
occupancy tax and a 1% prepared food and beverage tax. That one percent
prepared food and beverage tax does have a sunset in it in 2034.  Those
taxes are being used to pay the debt and the other pieces of running the
convention center.  They currently have some excess.  And so, what we
have recommended is that they use that money and any other prioritize
money that the City wants to use to help do what they can to keep the
panthers in Charlotte.  To keep that stadium occupied.  And to create a
tether of sorts to the team.&quot;  Hopefully to tie the team to the
area for as many as 15 years so that we make sure  we get all of it
back.  This bill gives them that permission.
The changes that we were making in the Occupancy Committee was to make
sure that every part of it confirms to the reality of the situation.
Which is, that the panthers would contract and solicit bids for a set of
improvements.  The portion of the improvements that the city would pay
for would then be billed back to the City.  The City would pay for those
improvements and the City would own those improvements.  They would own
the improvements that are in the stadium. So if they build escalators,
they would own the escalators.  They will then lease those escalators at
fair market value back to the stadium.  So the Panthers pay for it as
part of a package. The City pays for their portion. They own their
portion. They lease it then back to the stadium.  The stadium will then
charge the City a fee for the maintenance on those. But the ownership
will still remain with the city. If in some unfortunate circumstance the
team is moved,there is in the contract some sort of way of compensating.
And we haven't worked out... they haven't worked out all the details on
that.  It's their obligation to do.  But there will be some sort of
compensation to make sure that the City is compensated for the
improvements that they paid for in the stadium.
The other thing we had to do on this to accommodate all that was to make
sure under current,... I am not sure what the statute... it's not a
statute, but with the ..Charlotte Regional Visitor's Authority currently
is set up to operate anything that those taxes pay for.  The complicated
part that we had to do is to make sure that the CRVA, the Charlotte
Regional Visitors Authority, is not obligated to run the escalators in
the Panthers stadium --that the Panthers will run the escalators in the
Panther's stadium.  So that was the complicated piece that we were
trying to figure out.  And I think they found a neat and as tidy way to
do that.  And I believe that covers everything on here.
So what we're essentially doing is saying to the City of Charlotte,
&quot;You have an asset sitting on your land that you need to do your
best to retain and keep functional. We are going to give you permission
to use the taxes that you already have to make that  more likely to
happen&quot;.  There is no new increase in taxes. It's just new
permission.
Floor open for questions.
Representative Blest
You've used the phrase, &quot;if the team still leaves&quot;.  If this
Bill is passed, is there still a chance or a threat that the team could
leave? Is there no guarantee that, hey, you guys do this and we're
staying.
This bill does not require that the City choose to use these funds to
help tie the Panthers to the Carolinas.  This bill doesn't require that.
 Our hope is that the City, if they choose to set their priorities such
that they should choose to enter into a contract with the Panthers, our
hope would be that they would be able to get a tether on it. That had
originally been part of the original agreement. But this amount of money
is less than what they had originally asked for.  So I can't guarantee
in this bill what the City would do. All we are doing legislatively is
giving the City permission to set their own priorities to do what they
can with the money they already have to make it more likely that they
would be able to create that tether.
Representative Holly.

<p id="20:00">
I just want to understand, if they do leave we will get the money back
that we've invested in the stadium at that time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I can't guarantee that you'll get the money back. They have, as a
requirement that they set up, a way to be re-compensated for it should
they leave. Those details, because we haven't given them permission yet,
those details have not been set out yet. They do have a document that
they're using right now when they're working with the Panthers that
includes a provision that that be in there. Bear again, all we're doing
is giving the city permission to consider and begin the idea of using
this money, as well as other monies that they may have, to, we don't
give that permission, they already have that permission, but to use
whatever monies they have to make these negotiations. We're simply
giving them permission to consider using these funds as part of their
negotiations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Representative Samuelson, you said you were giving
them permission but I read this as, &quot;Shall be applied in
accordance,&quot; and they can't move anything until they do D and then
E. Is that correct, if it's a shall or a may?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Which, can you tell me which line you're on?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma'am, sorry about that. It'd be line 18-19.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This, okay, this original part in section 2 is in the original statute
where it was being limited only to the Convention Center. If you look on
line 13, they marked out Convention Center facilities. And so it's
saying that they can only use the monies for the things in this section
2, which would include the Convention Center, the possibility for the,
what we call the Panther Stadium, the Bank of America Stadium and then E
is if they should choose to get in to amateur sports, which is another
thing they've requested. So we're really giving them full choices to
decide what to do with the money that they are collecting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representatives Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I guess, let me just ask staff a couple questions. How much
money is the occupancy tax generating currently? Because basically
you're talking about the occupancy tax funds.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I may have it if they don't. Do you have it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, the 3% portion of the occupancy tax generates
approximately 11 million and then the food and beverage tax is about 20
million.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And they are currently using a good bit of that already on the
Convention Center. So they would only be considering the excess and some
money that they've saved. I think it's about 24 million that they have
already saved that they weren't using.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So how much money are you saying will be used for the Panthers annually?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We, in this bill we are not directing them to spend any particular
amount on the Panthers. We're allowing them to choose, within the tax
that they're collecting, what they want to spend. A good portion of it
is already allocated toward paying the debt on the Convention Center.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up then.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, you've got some idea how much money you want to give them or how
much they're asking for?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They're asking, they actually asked for $60.5 from the state. They asked
for another $60.5 from, no, they were going to do $60 and then we, then
they wanted $140-something from the city. This doesn't come anywhere
close to giving them what they asked for. We are not giving any, and
according to this bill and I'm not aware of any other way that they are
getting any state money at all, and so what we countered to the city
when we found out we had that, they had that 24 million that was not
currently allocated we said, &quot;Why don't you use the money you
already have and you set the priorities about what you think is most
important for your community.&quot; And so it really is a local bill
that's saying to the local officials, &quot;You need to make this
decision, don't come to us and ask us to be giving you additional
revenue at this time.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up then.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
How much money is required for the debt service and the operation of the
Convention Center?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I can look and see if I have that chart. I do know that the city told us
they had 24 million that is not currently used for that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that on an annual basis?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, that's the, they've got it in, right now, in a pot and at some
point, as the debt goes down on the Convention Center they will have a
little bit more</p>

<p id="25:00">
But at this point most of the numbers that we’ve seen have just been
using that 24 million and using that 24 million to either finance or pay
directly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, what I’m trying to figure out and your answers are very evasive
because the debt service for the convention center is so much and then
it costs so much to operate the convention center and then so these
taxes generate this amount of money so you’re saying they have a little
bit of surplus but I’m trying to figure out how much do you anticipate
diverting to the Panthers and if that creates a short fall then does the
city, are they going to be required to raise property tax or come up
with other tax money to pay the debt on the convention center?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are correct that if they should choose, in other words, we are not
telling the city what to do with their money, we are giving them the
option of deciding what they think is the best use of the money they
already have. We’re not requiring them to give it to the Panthers, we
are merely saying, if you choose to use your tax money that is collected
by your citizens and you want to do this we will give you permission
within these two sources. They also have four other special taxes that
we’re not touching. They also have property taxes that we’re not
touching. All we’re saying is if you want to use these that are already
allocated to the convention center and use the excess or however you
prioritize for the Panthers that is your choice. I’ll admit that there
are some who said, well we think we’d rather use it on the convention
center and that is still their choice. If they look at it and decide
it’s in their better interest to use it on the convention center, they
may. What they recognize is they own the land under the stadium and at
some point they’re going to have to do something with that stadium and
so we are giving them the permission now, so that hopefully they will be
able to keep the Panthers, but if they can’t or if they choose to do
something otherwise that’s their decision. We’re not telling them what
to do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a comment, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
By all means.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well it almost seems disingenuous. You’re collecting occupancy tax and
sales tax on food for the convention center for its debt service and its
operation. So now you’re saying well we are not going to use any tax
money for the Panthers but we will divert this over there to the
Panther’s stadium but then if there’s a shortfall in the convention
center then they raise taxes for the convention center and so I mean
it’s just, you’re shortchanging one fund to buck up another fund and it
just seems like it’s a little bit disingenuous.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We aren’t telling them to; remember they have asked us for this. They’ve
asked us for this flexibility. They came to us; we didn’t go to them and
impose our will on them. They came to us for additional options to allow
them to have the option of funding the Panthers and they support this
option so it’s really the elected city council who’s responsible to
their citizens who will be making the decision that you’re talking
about. We’re not ordering them to do it, we’re simply giving them the
choice.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well then one last question, please. Does this tax money generate enough
to provide for the convention center and the Panthers both?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It does not provide enough to fund everything the city wishes. The city
wishes for convention center money, they wish for several, for a lot
more money for the Panthers, and they also wish for money for amateur
sports. We are not increasing any of their money we’re saying you need
to set your own priorities and we’re going to allow you the flexibility
to set your own priorities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Carney.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a motion when you’re ready.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Ross.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much Mr. Chairman and I think that this is a good bill. I
think that the city should be able to figure out how to use this money;
I also would point out that because most of this particular revenue
stream comes from occupancy and prepared food and the Panthers probably
generate most of the occupancy and prepared food taxes that this pot of
money represents to say that they wouldn’t be able to benefit from it
for the stadium seems to be somewhat unfair and if you lose the Panthers
than you’re going to have a whole lot less money in this particular pot
to pay for anything so it seems like an appropriate marriage between a
revenue stream and a potential use, not a mandatory use but a potential
use, and I trust the city of Charlotte to make</p>

Use of this money in the way that it will benefit their city and their
people.  Thank you.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Thank you Representative ??.  Representative Bill
Brawley.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Thank you Mr. Chairman [laugh].  As you can imagine,
we've had no controversy over this issue at all.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  None whatsoever.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  None at all.  This Bill doesn't really commit us to do
anything with the Panthers.  It doesn't commit the state to do anything.
 The City of Charlotte did approach us about asking for a tax of one
cent for thirty years, which would've generated a billion dollars of
which they wanted to give one-hundred-twenty-five-million to use it to
up-fit Panther Stadium, which they would own and put in a fifteen-year
tether.  That's all well and good but I didn't see it reasonable to ask
this body to vote for a one-billion-dollar tax increase without a vote
of the people, and a lot of other people didn't.  We negotiated some
more and there were other back and forth, but as part of that
discussion, it came out that the occupancy tax that was originally
passed in the City of Charlotte, and the prepared food tax, which was
passed specifically to pay for a convention center, and I know this
because as a member of the Matthews Town Council I came up here and
lobbied and supported.  That tax has just about paid off the bonds.  It
will generate one-hundred-ten-million dollars during the period of need
of cash that is not committed to pay bond debt service on the convention
center.  Would the City of Charlotte use that for something else related
to convention center and the related facilities if that money were not
needed somewhere else?  Yes they would.  Do they have to?  No.  They
would lik3 to invest in Panther Stadium as part of a move to support
keeping the Panther's in Charlotte.  They have other issues in which
they would like to invest.  We are not able to provide them in this
political climate with additional revenue.  What we are doing is giving
them the freedom to allocate all the revenues they are currently
collecting and for them to decide where there priorities are.  Somebody
said, what are you really doing?  and I said, well, my kids came to me
and said, Dad, we want our curfew extended so we can start going to the
football games 'cuz we can't get home until late 'cuz we have to go out
and eat afterwards.  You know, you been there.  Okay, great, no problem,
you can stay out late.  Well, I need more money for the football games.
No, you've got money.  If you want to go to football you just rent fewer
videos or you buy fewer Itunes.  They get to set the priorities.  All
we're doing is allowing them to allocate the money as they see fit.
We're not committing the state to do anything for the Panther's for the
convention center.  We're not requiring any bonds to be done.  We're not
requiring them to raise property taxes.  We're simply saying you've got
more of these special taxes than anybody else in the state.  We'll give
you the freedom to use them as you see fit.  It's your city, you deal
with it with what you already have.  That's all we're doing here.  Thank
you Mr. Chairman.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Thank you Representative Brawley.  Representative
Jones.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Thank you Mr. Chairman.  Just like to make a few
comments, if I may, and for one Mr. Chairman I,I expect this is going to
be a divided vote and I would ask at the end that there be a division
and show of hands on the vote if that's possible.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Very well.
SPEAKER CHANGES:  Just from the comments and in all due respect to my,
my friends from Mecklenburg on both sides of the aisle here, I
understand what you're trying to accomplish.  I think I understand your
explanation pretty well, but as a, as a representative from the district
where I come from, I'm just gonna share a few concerns that, that I
think are out there.  And if I understand you right, basically what the
Panther's were asking for was at least two-hundred-million-dollars, if
not more, in tax money from the state, from the city, if you do the
math, maybe so, I think you said one-hundred-forty-million from the
city, a-hundred-and-sixty more from the state and so forth.  And so
basically what we are offering them it looks like is a portion of a tax
that generates somewhere between eleven and twenty million dollars and
that's going to be an incentive to actually keep them to stay.  You
know, where I come from that's a lot of money.  I think there are a lot
of people in the state that have a philosoph...</p>

Ethical problem with what is happening in professional sports and with
the NFL in particular the mental picture that I get when I hear the
description earlier is that we got this dilapidated rundown facility
down in Charlotte this just about the folly and and we got to somehow
put it back up as evidence beneficial to use and I think the reality is
is that we are in a competitive bidding war with cities all over the
country that some places that are willing to expand a tremendous amount
of taxpayer funds to build stadiums that are well over $1 billion and
the NFL is big money wasand without a big business here they certainly
exert a lot of influence disabled based the question is meant as a
nothing by represented stars in particular about the dedicated times
that have been raised for a convention center in which we had net and
your Senators $24 million in the pot that is not necessary for the been
silent about money that we can use in another way ISOs wholesale half of
the 87,000 citizens that I represent and I think a lot of other
districts after like-minded in a $24 million ago a tremendous place in
our state to do a lot of good we got water needs we got NEEDS where we
can't get a fraction of that billion steel if we Money to daily studies
are not running along that I'll just say that this sounds a lot like the
argument that were not raising taxes were just allowing them to read
dedicate a portion of what's already there something that it doesn't
already have the authority today and my concern is what we see a lot
around here is the of the show game if you will that the money comes
from here today but when the convention center goes down tomorrow is
another need of the city will be back and and Italy are an avid Is have
a dilapidated facility that somehow we need to take taxpayer money to do
have in the day I just have problems with this I think many of the
people that I represent have problems with it I don't think I can that
sort again I respect the sponsors and what you trying to do and is our
for Mecklenburg maybe I would see things a little differently that time
you on behalf of my Matthey politest felon and a decided negative
symptoms of several thank you as always say that we would look at the
big picture on yes the scenes have a lot of money and that they are in
great demand also in a country that an awful lot to this economy for the
state and for the local and a region and on okay from Navy with a
considerable oh well districts or whatever they benefit from this money
that comes in from this team the players alone pay and contacts in the
state and that's a huge amount of money that this generated from the
businesses in the area which are generated by the Panthers being there
is likely a good look at the at the big picture over $40 million comes
to the state of North Carolina if he leaves the way to have to make up
that difference somewhere in the and in your accounting Rep. journalism
sure that there are appropriate benefit from those dollars that come in
from the Panthers and the Richeson's finance this team from the very
beginning and have had very little of the public and hope you know that
there's only 32 of these teams and they are in great demand at any they
could be bought and moved someplace else is hope that we would look at
the big picture you may not support giving my two NFL teams of whatever
but bottom line is we need to keep this team in North</p>

this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative [??]. Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the work that the
Sponsors are doing. I’m in the Government Committee that this Bill
passed, pretty overwhelmingly in the Government Committee and so I
expect it’s going to pass here. I have no illusions about whether the
political clout is there on behave of the Bill Sponsors to get the Bill
through. First of all Mr. Chair, I want to talk about the history of the
[Occupancy] tax and should also say,  I hate to vote against my seat
mate, I just hate to do it.  Representative Carney and I have talked,
and Representative Carney has been an outstanding Chair of the
[Occupancy] Tax Committee over the years. Oh, you didn’t Chair it? I’m
sorry, but you’ve been an outstanding member. She should have chaired
it, right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] She just suffered through it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually, it’s a very important sub-committee and let
me tell you why Mr. Chairman and members. The [Occupancy] Tax
Sub-committee was set up in response to requests from the Travel &amp;
Tourist Agency Advocacy [??] statewide. Half of all of the counties and
cities that benefited from the [Occupancy] tax and the reason why they
were here, they came up and convinced us, Finance Chairs at that time
and I was one them, to put together the [Occupancy] Tax Sub-committee is
because too many juries and cities in their opinion were diverting the
money form direct benefits for what they had asked for and were putting
elsewhere. They had a set of requests and they felt a lot of counties
were violating that. That is why we have that Sub-committee, the
Sub-committee came in and basically would say to Bill Sponsors, you Bill
doesn’t meet the criteria, so you need to change it in order for us to
bless it and send sent it on to the whole Finance Committee. Those of us
who have been here a while remember that process. What bothers me in
this Bill, if I read correctly, Representative Stam and Representative
[Burr] if I’m wrong correct me, but on page 2, line 4 of the Bill it
says that the Charlotte Regional Authority has no power etc., having to
do with this diversion of the monies for the Panthers. So, am I not
correct that essentially the power that typically is given to [??] taxes
for the Visitors Authority to run, that that is being taken away from
the Regional Visitors Authority. Am I right on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Only for these improvements that are being inside the
stadium that would be run by the Panthers and they Okayed this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Who’s they?
[SPEAKER CHANGES The CRVA. It doesn’t impact their ability to run
things, only those improvements that inside the stadium.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And why would they do that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Because it would be very difficult for them to run
score boards and escalators inside the stadium that’s being run by
another team and they were okay with this and they understood it.  The
convention center, they run the whole the convention center, so it makes
that they would run that. In this case, they don’t run the whole
stadium, which is part of the problem because the stadium sits on city
owed land but it’s owned by the Panthers and these improvement will be
owned by the city. This is trying to make it function more smoothly for
everybody.
[SPEAKER CHANGES I guess to speak on the Bill Mr. Chairman. First of all
Representative Samuelson, you and I know it’s not quite accurate to say
that the convention center and the . . . well maybe you’re right. Maybe
I should ask, I’m sorry. When did the convention center went in?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] 1997? No earlier than that. I’d have to look.
Somewhere in the 1990’s.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Panthers came in 95’ . . .
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Shorty after.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I understand. Thank you. It just seems to me, my
conclusion reading this is, this is corporate welfare</p>

<p id="45:00">
This is welfare for a major profitable corporation. In my opinion,
corporate welfare has always been wrong. I just don’t think it’s right
to do what we do with that. And I’ve been indiscriminate on this
corporate welfare policy of this state since it was first initiated. And
I will say under Governor Hunt, so I didn’t mind disagreeing with a
fellow democrat.  But we’ve got a situation here, where as
Representative Starnes says, if the convention center runs out of money
because this money’s been diverted to the Panthers, I guess it’s tough
luck or they’re going to go to the City of Charlotte and ask for help.
So, we’re doing a kind of, maybe again Representative Jones talked about
as a shell gate. And it’s hard for me not to see that it is just that.
And also in this sense if there were not an occupancy tax in place
allowing the bill advocates and by extension, the city, to direct the
money to the Panthers, you would have to ask for a tax increase. Is that
not true? Tend to generate the money. If the occupancy tax weren’t in
place…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They asked for additional taxing authority and we turned it down. They
happen to say to us that they had some excess money in their existing
taxes. So we’re saying, “fine. If you, elected body, decide that you
want to spend your money that’s collected in your community on this
property that sits on your land we will give you the option of using
your money that you were elected to allocate on land that you own.”
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, it still seems to me that this money, as I said following the
occupancy tax subcommittee, was supposed to be used for things directly
related. For example, the 1989 Statute, as I understand it, was to build
a Convention Center. That’s where the revenue was supposed to go. Now
with your diverting the revenues, I’m just saying if you didn’t have an
occupancy tax that was passed in 1989. So you didn’t have an occupancy
taxes. How would you help the Panthers right now? The only way you could
help the Panthers is if they weren’t occupancy tax dollars to divert is
to generate a new tax. So, I know you’re against new taxes, but in a way
this is just a roundabout way to, in effect, have new taxes because
you’re diverting money from the reasons why the bill was passed in 1989
to a new effort. So finally I’ll say on this, I tried to argue
subsistently why it was wrong. But more generally I just do not agree
with the idea that money should go toward the Panthers. This is both
wrong in terms of, I mean it happens in sports all the time. The
franchises move from one city to another. It just does. The reason why
the Los Angeles Lakers are called the Lakers, bizarrely, is because of
course it used to be the Minneapolis Lakers. And the reason why the New
Orleans Hornets are called New Orleans Hornets is because they used to
be in Charlotte. And I could just keep on going and those who know more
about sports franchises do better than I. It just seems wrong to me and
from my perspective, and I know not everybody in here will agree with
this analysis, but this is particularly wrong given that this General
Assembly has cut unemployment benefits for unemployed people. It has
refused to take medicaid that when given 500,000 people who are without
health insurance right now, would have provided health insurance. This
General Assembly has voted to get rid of their earned income tax credit
for 900,000 North Carolinians of moderate and low income. And when you
look at just those three bills that were passed and then we contrast it
to this, it’s really that for the unemployed  and the moderate income
poor folks of this state, we have to cut you back. Tough time. But for
the Panthers, it’s not a tough time. We’re diverting money around to
help them. And I know some may disagree with that analysis but that’s
what I think it is. And to me, the cuts we’ve made to average citizens
in the state, contrasted to what we’re doing here for the Panthers, is
wrong. And I’ll be voting against the bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

... due respect we're talking apples and oranges.  If you don't stay in
Mecklenburg county overnight you do not contribute anything to this tax,
and if you don't eat out - and I'm talking about more than McDonalds or
Burger King - you really don't contribute.  So I think we're talking
apples and oranges, and we do have this ?? tax in place and it's been
there for a while, so that's basically what we're talking about - we're
talking about a pot of money, a revenue stream that is there, and we are
looking at options as to how to use it. So I think we need to be very
clear on where we are and what we're looking at.  So I just wanted to
make sure that we're talking apples and apples and oranges and oranges
if we're gonna ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Earle.  Thank you
Representative Hall.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, and I'm a little bit late
coming in so I may address some issues that have been addressed earlier,
so I apologize for that, for everybody who has to sit through that, but
I do have a question about Section 2E as to why amateur sports
facilities are included in this if this is primarily about the
professional sports team, the NFL.  Is there something going on that
hasn't been discussed or that relates to this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's actually a good question because this is not
only about the Panthers.  A local elected body - which I'm sure some of
you all have served on local elected body - a local elected body needs
some options for spending money that they are already collecting.  They
are going to collect that money whether we pass this bill or not.  They
would like additional options for the allocation of the resource now
that some other needs have been highlighted to them.  They came and
approached us for an increase tax to pay for two things: upgrades to the
Panther stadium which sits on city-owned land, and for amateur sports.
We are basically saying we aren't giving you any increased revenue, but
since you are the elected body that's supposed to decide how to spend
the money that you are collecting, we will allow you the option of
spending your existing taxes on the two things that you have asked for.
So the city will be making the decision as to whether they spend it on
the convention center, whether they spend it on the stadium, or whether
they spend it on amateur sports.  That will be a decision for them to
make looking at their long-range goals and plans and how much revenue
they have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? Can I have a couple of ??. So in this discussion
were cultural amenities discussed at all as far as being able to be
eligbile for some of these expenditures?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is where you missed part of it.  They have four
other tax revenues one of which is already being used in that vein so
they've got those covered in other areas.  These were the two taxes that
were not originally voter approved and seem to be most closely aligned
to the interest that was included with the stadium and the amateur
sports.  They're hospitality/tourism sorts of things.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  And finally, has there been any discussion then about
- and I know this is not decided in this bill - but any discussion about
what the effect of this is gonna be? In other words, are we just being
used as a bargaining chip to up the ante for somewhere else?  Do we have
any ability as we give this additional authority to get some kind of
guarantee about the length of ?? we'll have that'll be enforcable?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  What they're trying to do is create a tether - Mr.
Richardson who owns the team has made it clear that he does not want to
move it.  However, he's 76 years old and a recipient of a heart
transplant, and according to the NFL the team must change hands within 2
years after he dies.  And so that put the sense of needing to deal with
this now.  We have not been told that they are actively negotiating with
anybody, if anything he has said that he intends to keep it here as long
as he's alive.  The desire is to create a tether that would keep it
longer than that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Wales.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I don't know if it's because I'm a new member, or
because this debate has generated such strange bedfellows, but I'm
confused.  I thought we were dealing with a local issue.  Now, before I
became a politician, I had a 20 year run as a son of a city manager.  So
I gotta tell ya, I'm bowing up a little bit at the continued suggestion
that our cities are incompetent.  Granted, some have some issues, but
they're not all bad.  And after being here only a brief time, I got...</p>

…I’m not really impressed with some of what I have seen at the operation
the state government over the last 10 years. And we may have our hands
filled right here before we go tell Charlotte what to do. We are not
raising taxes, we are not allowing Charlotte to raise taxes, we are
allowing them to use an income strength that already exist, that’s
already been approved for uses that they choose to use it for. I’m
missing the entire philosophical debate here. Now, I’m from a community
and just lost 30,000 jobs so I got a little more to worry about in my
district and what's going on the city of Charlotte and I support this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Alexander.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen and the committee first I
wanna tell you that I plan to vote for this and I plan to vote for this
in a full realization that from my philosophical position what the city
of Charlotte requested in the first place is the measure that I would
have preferred that we dealt with because it would have generated much
more revenue and we would have been able to do a number of the things we
are talking about but this is not the morning for me to climb upon that
particular political soapbox and start beating drums one way or another.
What we have to deal with is where we are and where are if we wanna play
in the NFL game, we have to upgrade the stadium whether we like it or
not. And I’m afraid that stadiums don’t get upgraded without spending
money and the amenities that have been discussed by the current
ownership with Panthers are reasonable, cost effective and we will help
create a stadium that it may not be state of the art because the art
keeps changing but it will have a traditional stadium they are calling,
‘Classic Design’ now that will be around for a very a longtime and will
be an extremely useful building. Please understand in case you are
missing this that in North Carolina benefits and Charlotte benefits by
being able to see the team play on national television, it’s advertising
a whole lot of money all the time. And that’s part of what we have to
do, I think you all will know how we still investment…Local control of
this and that and another and I’m moving this because that’s always we
asking for, we are asking for some local control the ability to try to
help advertise North Carolina, advertise Charlotte, and bring some more
economic activity into the state. That’s all I have got to see, I hope
you better vote in favor of progress coming into the 21st Century and
building all those good things and we always make speeches about. And
the motion I would make if it’s appropriate…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have on the Representative Carney but after…
[Laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ross.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman I will just be brave and I just wanna reiterate
the point that I had made before, one of the entities that generates
most of the revenue that we are talking about here is the Panthers and
to tell them that they cannot then since they are all very involved in
generating this revenue and promoting tourism in this area that they
can, that we are not gonna let them benefit in anyway they perform from
this is ridiculous I mean we want this revenue to come in if we wanna
keep it coming in, we need to continue to invest in the travel and
tourism attractions need to trust our cities to be able to figure out
how to…

with these issues and making sure that it balances its books. I see
absolutely no reason why this would not be appropriate, and if it was
originally the occupancy taxes recommendation, if it came in and this
was the first time they were doing the occupancy tax and the Panthers
were there, I can not imagine the occupancy tax committee would not have
reported it out favorably.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Ross. Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Nobody hates, what's normally called corporate welfare, more than I do.
I tend to think of it in terms of these incentives that we talk about,
but the thing I hate about the incentives is generally it favors out of
state companies over in state companies and it picks winners and losers
between businesses in the same industry. This does neither of those. We
are talking about an institute that is already in North Carolina, and as
far as I know they don't have any competition. I don't know of any other
NFL teams in North Carolina. If there is another one I certainly haven't
seen them. So we're definitely not doing that. Something else, I'm not
so sure this is...this is disconnected from the convention center that
we're talking about. I don't know how many conventions come to Charlotte
because they have professional sports teams there. I know I'm a member
of a professional association that has its annual convention every year
in September and I've been to San Diego, and was actually able to see
the Panthers beat the San Diego Chargers in an opening game if you
remember that crazy catch that guy made a few years ago. And then I've
been to one in San Francisco where we saw the Oakland A's play baseball.
To me that's always an added attraction if I can go to a major league
sporting event. I'm a lot more likely to go to those conventions than I
am if it's a city that does not have those things. So I'm not sure the
convention center itself doesn't benefit from the Panthers being there.
It definitely benefits the city of Charlotte and the State of North
Carolina. Now we're talking about some revenue here. If we're concerned
about the moderate income poor people, every year we have to find
hundreds of millions of dollars more in Medicaid for those folks. Where
we gonna find that from if these professional athletes aren't paying
income taxes to State of North Carolina? If the other tax revenues we
generate from sales? We are generating revenue from sales in Rocky
Mount, North Carolina off Panthers sweatshirts every year. There is
revenue all over the state coming from this stuff, folks, and we are
gonna have a lot more than this $24 million dollars or whatever we're
talking about to replace, and that's occupancy tax money. We don't...The
State of North Carolina has basically no investment in this, and yet we
do get a lot of revenue from it so where are we gonna find all that
money that we're talking about? Now, I'm, I believe in philosophical
things, but I'm also, there's a pragmatic side to me as well, and I do
believe, very much, in the trickle down economic theory that
Representative Earle described so well a few minutes ago. It works.  It
always has worked. It always will work.  And, for all those reasons, I
am going to vote for this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Collins? Representative Blust and then
Representative Carney for the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, I agree with a lot of what has been said
here actually on both sides so I'm somewhat ambivalent on the bill. I
think what Representative Wells said was well spoken and Representative
Collins, but I too was...I wanted to say something because I wish we
could capture this debate here today. Representative Earle,...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is being captured. I'm sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
...did. She did? Now, we've been accused on our side of the aisle, in
sometimes belligerent fashion,  so far in this session about favoring
the greedy over the needy, and we've heard about how our side represents
that 1%, and it is ironic that in this situation we have some who would
ascribe to that sort of description of things, in this instance are
arguing to help that 1%, and explaining very rationally how helping that
1% helps so many down at the lower levels. And we've heard a description
about how the economy works so I hope that we can temper some of the
rhetoric going forward since we are being asked to vote for this bill
that helps Representative Alexander. It helps those at the very top.
Helps them the most, but they are doing things that spend money in the
economy that helps people down at the bottom also. Representative
Collins explained how this can even effect our Medicaid so I hope we'll
learn something from this, and I think Representative Earle was very
right...</p>

About how the economy works and I am glad Mr. Richardson and the
Panthers are doing well because it does help everyone when some, when a
few do very well it helps other people do somewhat well themselves. So I
hope we'll learn from this today and remember this description about how
the economy works.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hall and then Representative Carney
[SP]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair and I'm opposed to any reduction
in heated rhetoric that we might have so I hope this committee is not a
temper [??].
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We're not going to change, we're not going to change
at all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] As we go forward first of all so I want that on the
record.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Second of all...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's part of our by-laws.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Seriously on this I hope we're not - and I want to
borrow a word from Edgar Starnes, I hope we're not having a disingenuous
discussion about this because we are partners in this whole NFL
franchise, the state of North Carolina put a lot of investment in the
infrastructure, highway, interchanges, etc. This is not just a local
situation, this is a state and it's called Carolina Panthers for a
reason and not the Charlotte Panthers. So I do want to make sure we
understand Charlotte is not alone in the investment that was made but
rather the people of North Carolina made the investment that ultimately
help ensure that team got here. And this appears to be a continuing
investment and wanted to make sure that we did  look at that, the idea
that folks downstream are benefiting I would say that we continue to
invest in this team and we took those same resources and invested them
in a different way, I think quote folks down stream would benefit as
well or maybe even better. So I want to make sure we make those two
points as people talk about voting for this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Hall. Representative Carney
for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Wow, thank you Mr. Chairman. First of all I do want to
give credit where credit is due and Representative Edgar Starnes is the
occupancy tax guru around here.  I've worked with him many years on
this. And I want to say to representative Wells, that was extremely
profound, we could have used that Amen and moved on with the motion
then. And representative Collins you summed it up well yourself.
Everybody has spoken eloquently on this and that's what this committee
process is for and I think it has been a very good debate this morning
and pointing out all this particular bill,  not looking in the past or
forward, this particular bill has no state money, it is not a tax
increase, it is local flexibility, and I would move that we give house
bill 193 the proposed committee substitute a favorable report,
unfavorable to the original.
