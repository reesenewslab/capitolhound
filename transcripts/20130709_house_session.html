us the wisdom to see the needs and the courage to meet them. Grant us
your sense of justice that we may govern fairly with prejudice to none.

and understanding, and now oh, God, we ask you to bless us and
strengthen our individual resolve that we may collectively do your will.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Wilkens is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Members of the House, you have heard the
contents of the resolution. What you didn’t hear is that James Ramsey
was my cousin. His mother, whose name is actually Odie, and my father
were siblings. James is….and with James I keep on saying is, and if I do
that repeatedly today, try to understand. James was nine years older
than I am and so at an early age it was drilled into me by my parents
that this guy was pretty special and I ought to respect him not just
because he’s your cousin, son, but because he’s quite a person. Quite a
person, he was.
Back in my young days, his young days, schools had debate teams. I don’t
know if they still do that now. Rockspur High School had a reputation
for winning statewide debate cups. They were, I think back then, we
called the loving cups. But Rockspur High School had powerful debate
teams and for four years, James Ramsey was the anchor.
After College, and I guess I’ll say this for the benefit of
Representative Hall and Representative Cleveland, James Ramsey had the
step in the Marine Corps and then he and Eunice came home. The first
office he ever ran for was something called Judge of a Recorder’s
Court, I believe. I see Representative Michaux is nodding his head, so I
got it right. That was an interesting time, I was roughly sixteen,
seventeen years old, my dad owned and operated a grocery store and one
of the things that made that grocery store special was that we
delivered. Once I turned sixteen, I became the delivery guy every day
during the summer and every saturday during the school year. Well, James
was running for Judge of Recorder’s Court and I’m delivering groceries
on Saturday and that would mean six or eight different trips around
town. So I got this brainy idea and I came up with a couple of James
Ramsey yard signs and taped them onto the sides of that green...</p>

T-49 Chevrolet pick-up. I think there were three colors that were used
back then: green, blue and black. I think that’s it, but I take them
right over the market part of Wilkin’s Markets so you could see
Wilkin’s, and then you could see James Ramsey’s sign. So I completed one
trip around town delivering groceries, and my dad met me outside the
store and said, “I want to see you in the office after you pull those
signs off that truck.” And I thought this is not a good thing. It turned
out to be my first lesson in why you ought now to mix politics and
business. My dad said don’t you get it, that not everybody who does
business in this store is going to support your cousin in this election
so do not put any more signs back, and I didn't. But there were many
more chances. I had opportunities to support James Ramsey in other
elections and other ways. When he died recently I was asked for comment
by the Rocksford newspaper, and my comment was, “We have lost a giant.”
I commend the resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Baskerville, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to take you back to
seven years ago, 2006. A young, recent graduate of law school went down
to Person County to start as Assistant District Attorney, didn't know
anybody. I’m talking about myself, and so court starts at 9:30. I got
there around nine o’clock to try to organize the docket and get my cases
together, what I wanted to try. Judge comes in at 9:30, and we’re
rolling. I’m calling the cases. We’re going. About 10:30, 11 o’clock,
this big tall, about 6’2’’, a giant of a man comes in the courtroom, and
the judge stops me from calling the docket and says, “Good Morning, Jim.
How can we help you thing morning?” And I’m looking up at him like
Judge, I've got a program here. I’m trying to run the program here and
that was my first introduction to Jim Ramsey. When he came into the
courtroom, the courtroom stopped, and folks took the time to try to
accommodate Mr. Ramsey. And so, we took a break, and I said I got to
talk to this guy. And we went into the back room, and Jim Ramsey sat
down, introduced himself to me, and started giving me advice on how to
call the docket, on which cases I need to be trying first, and how to
improve my cross-examination. And you want to talk about a lawyer. Now,
I used to even when I wasn't schedule to be in court, I used to go into
the Superior courtroom and sit down and watch Jim Ramsey try cases. I
used to sit down and watch him pick a jury, and he used to back up.
First of all he taught me this. When he used to go into the courtroom
and try a jury trial, he’d get in there before everybody. Then he’d move
the tables around. He moved the defense attorney’s table a little bit
closer to the jury box. He moved the prosecutor’s table a little bit
further away from the bench, just to show that this was his courtroom.
And he was, you know, in control of the things there. Anyway, he took me
to the back, and he gave me some good advice. And I used to watch him
try cases and pick a jury, and he would back up his seat. He’d lean into
the jury, put his elbows on his knees, put his hand there, and just have
a conversation with the jury. Someone that didn't even want to give
their name at the beginning of jury selection was telling Jim Ramsey all
about their family and where he went to school, and about his first
relationship. I mean, he could talk to people. Complete strangers and
get them to open up and talk to him, and that was a skill I didn't see a
lot of lawyers have, a way to talk to the jury and that certainly served
him well in other aspects of his life and political aspects is all. I
just want you all to know that we lost a true statesman, a giant of a
man, who had a booming voice</p>

help you, and that was one of the reasons why I made it through my first
couple years down in the district attorney's office in Winkie's
district. And I just wanted to let you all know we lost a giant of a
man, and I commend the resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen of the House. I guess
I'm the only one around here who knew Jim Ramsey. My first term, 1973,
Jim Ramsey was Speaker of the House during that term. And one of the
first calls I got after I was elected was from Jim Ramsey. In this
telephone call, he said Mickey? I said yes. He said this is Jim Ramsey.
I said who? Jim Ramsey. He said you're going to be serving with me in
the House next session, and I want your vote for Speaker. I said do I
get to vote for Speaker? I mean, hey, I'm brand spanking new. I'm coming
to the most powerful legislative body in the country, because at that
time the governor didn't have veto power and everything that anybody
passed out of this General Assembly was law. So anyway, when I finally
got here in that January, Jim Ramsey called me in the office. He said
now look, he said you need to vote for me. He said there were only two
other black folks here at the time, and that was Henry Fry and ??
Johnson, and we made up the legislative black caucus at that time, so we
felt we had a little bit of power. He said, so your other fellow
legislators are going to vote for me. I said, you mean Henry and ?? ? He
said oh I don't know, I haven't talked to them, but I meant the others
are. He said why don't you join the others? Anyway, you have to
understand that this was the only building that the Legislature had at
that time. It was the first time that we had legislative assistants. And
they sat in, ?? ourselves, even around here, each legislator and senator
had an office, an office. In other words, your LA sat in front of you,
and you sat behind the LA in that one little office that you had then.
And Jim would point out to me people, he said, you know, you're from
Durham County, I'm from Person, and there's some kinship. Anyway, the
whole story was during that whole session in 1973, he really ran this
House. I also have to tell you that this was a time when Speakers ran
only one time, and served only one term as Speaker. And he really showed
how to actually run this House. I learned a lot from him about how the
House was run. And I learned all the other little nuances that were here
then. For instance, there were rules that some of you all still don't
know are here, but we knew what were here in the building. It was a lot
of fun, really, serving with Jim. And even after he left in after the
'74 session, when we got out. The fact of the matter was we didn't, we
only served '73. We didn't come back in '74 because that didn't start
'til the next session. And that happened. But anyway, Jim was an
effective, very effective speaker. He had the governor's ear, and I do
have to tell you this, that in 1973 when I came in, Jim Holshouser was
elected that year, too. And Jim taught me how to get along with
Republicans, because we had a few of them sitting back there where Skip
Stam is sitting. I think we had about maybe eight Republicans at the
time. And I didn't know what a Republican was and Jim taught me what a
Republican was. He said you've got a governor who ??, you got to go talk
to him, and he would take me with him to do that. The last time we had
any active political activity was in 1982, when I decided I wanted to
run for the Congress of the United States out of a newly formed district
that had been formed--the second district that had been formed at that
time. And Jim Ramsey decided he wanted to get in that race too, and
there were four of us in a primary. Fortunately, I won the primary, and
but I</p>

<p id="25:00">
That time we had the fifty percent plus one rule, which meant that if
you didn't get fifty percent plus one of the vote, that you didn't win
the primary and you had to have a run off. And I thought for sure that
Jim Ramsey was going to come in behind me, but it was somebody else, and
I went to Jim and asked him for his support and he graciously divided
his support between me and my opponent at the time.
I mean, really, really, but the other part of my reactions with Jim was-
I practice law and I was basically new, well I had been there sometime,
I new that he had run for Judge of Recorder's court. Now this is new to
a whole bunch of you folks, you don't even know what Recorder's court
was, and you don't know also that I was the assistant solicitor in
Durham county in Recorder's court in 1969. And Jim knew that also. So
when he got out of the House, I was still practicing law and I had a few
cases in Person county, and naturally I'd go to Jim Ramsey because he
was the foremost lawyer in Person county at the time. And I go and said
&quot;Jim i got this little case over here, and I need some help on
it&quot;. He'd look at me, he'd say &quot;Nicky, You remember on such
and such a day in 1968 or 69, whenever it was, and I was in Durham
county court and you were the assistant solicitor at that time.&quot; I
said &quot;I don't remember that one&quot;. And he said &quot;Well, I'm
going to remind you because you whipped my you know what.&quot; He said
&quot;Now what do you want me to do for you over here in Person
county&quot;.
Anyway, it was a great relationship that I had with him. One of the
really, founding speakers. He set the tone for a lot of the things that
are happening here in this body today. I don't want to say he set the
tone for the way that I react to a lot of things around here, because I
don't want to blame him for that to any extent. But I do want to tell
you that I wish he were here today and I know that when I'd talk to him,
when I would go to Rocksbury to try a case or something like that, I
always sought his council, always sought his guidance and he never
failed in giving it to me. He was a giant of a man. he was a giant of a
person. I will always remember it because he was my first speaker and I
commend the resolution to you.

Mr. Speaker, on the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentlemen is recognized to debate the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a bill, I don't know how familiar everyone
is to the Global TransPark. Global TransPark was started about twenty
years ago. Moneys we collected from an additional five, five dollars
that was assigned to a license plate fees in those counties, at the time
I believe there were nine counties, we paid an extra five dollars and we
got an extra GPT plate. What this Bill does is it takes that money and
returns it back to the counties to use for economic development. Its
been twenty years, the Global TransPark hasn't done, hasn't gotten
anywhere. Its been a solid waste of money in my opinion. But this money
belongs to the counties. It was money that was put in a pool to use for
infrastructure needs. To loan to the counties. Its been a couple of
years since the money has been loaned out. The TransPark has been
holding on to it in case they needed to use it for operating expenses.
If we  didn't give them anymore money, here at a general assembly,
bottom line is, the money belongs to the counties. We already passed
this in another Bill. This was added to another Bill. So this is
something we already agreed upon and I ask that you would concur.

The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies
and gentleman in the spirit of today, I'm going to keep my discussion
very short. This bill had a very thorough committee process in one of
the Subcommittees of Commerce and it was heard twice in the Finance
Committee. There were issues that were addressed in Finance. The changes
were incorporated into this bill. Basically what the bill does is two
things. The first several sections bring North Carolina law in
compliance with the recent federal guidelines and the second section
protects appraisers who are mostly small businessmen in the event of
appraiser management company bankruptcies. I'd be happy to answer any
questions. I ask for your support on the bill. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not, the question before
the House is the passage of the House Committee Substitute Number Two to
House Bill 565 on second reading. All in favor will vote aye, opposed
will vote no, the clerk will open the vote. The clerk will out machine
record the vote. 114 having voted in the affirmative, one in the
negative, the House Committee Substitute Number 2 to House Bill 565 has
passed its second reading and without objection will be read a third
time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The General Assembly of North Carolina Enacts.

question before the House is the passage of the House Committee
Substitute Number Two to House Bill 565 on third reading. All in favor

The ayes have it. The House Committee Substitute Number Two to House
Bill 565 has passed its third reading. It will be returned to the
Senate. House Bill 444, the clerk will read. The chair stands corrected.
That has been removed from the calendar. Ladies and gentleman, that was
a very productive hour long session. We've completed the calendar for
the day. Have two reports of committees, again if any members, there
were a couple of non-concurrence votes. If we could get those conference
committees as quickly as possible. Representative Brawley and Iler are
