Let me have your attention, please. We’ll go ahead and get this meeting
started. Good after noon, everyone. I’d like to welcome you to the
appropriations meeting. Let’s recognize our Sergeant-At-Arms. We have Ed
Kessler. Ed? Thank you. We have Canton Lewis. Canton? Thank you. Isaac
Walker. Thank you, Isaac. And Billy Fisher. Hey, Billy. Thank you,
Billy. And we also have our pages, and pages, if you would raise your
hand when I call your name. Meredith Roach. We have Quinton Beal.
Quinton, where you at? We have Sophia Polatis; did I pronounce that
close enough? And we have Rachel Figuard. Rachel? Thank you all for
being with us today. We’re going to have a little change in the agenda
and we’re going to put the Medicaid budget comparison up first. We’re
not sure if someone from OSBM is planning on joining us or not, but
we’ll give them the opportunity should they come in a little bit later.
I do not see anyone from there at this point in time, so at this point
in time we will move right into the Medicaid budget comparison with
Steve Owen and Susan Jacobs. I think Steve’s going to present and I was
told Susan’s answering all questions. Is that right? Thank you, Steve.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman and committee. I think you all
have a copy of the numbers I’m going to go through in a minute, but
before I get there, I wanted to spend a little time and give you some
context as you consider these numbers for the Medicaid rebase. The
department, OSBM and Fiscal Research have faced data challenges this
year trying to put together an estimated shortfall as well as a rebase
for next year. There’s a lot of information that we do have, but there’s
some critical information that we’ve never been able to get access to or
don’t have at this point to do an estimate in terms of 2015. The basic
areas where we’ve had challenges this year are first in enrollment.
We’re not been able to get accurate or consistent enrollment data that
allows us to see how many people are enrolled, which programs they’re
enrolled in and present it is a consistent manner to allow us to do any
analysis or evaluation. The second area is in backlogs. We’ve got two
types of backlogs that we’ve been looking at. The first one is around
claims. The claims backlog really results from the implementation of the
new EMIS system and how that affected the processing of claims. The
second one is in application or enrollment. There have been a number of
things that have happened there. First the food stamp issue, in terms of
its having resources diverted to take care of that at the local or the
county levels; the second, they were operating two systems at the county
levels for enrollment; and third, the implementation of the ACA exchange
actually has shifted a number of new applicants into the system. The
third area is really access to other information; information that would
allow us to do some analysis of utilization and trends, to be able to
look at the impact of items that are unique to 2014 like the ACA
woodwork, like the presumptive eligibility, and finally our ability to
understand what the impact or achievement has been for items included in
the reductions for this year’s budget. So this was really where the
challenge lies, or at least we think where the risk lies. The first big
area of risk is, how big are these backlogs? The importance of really
determining an accurate backlog for 2014 is that the 2015 rebase is
really built on that 2014 expenditure level, so making sure we have an
accurate or a reasonable number to build on to ensure that we have
adequate funding for 2015 is vital. The second one, without that
enrollment data we mentioned earlier, we really can’t assess, or truly
assess, what factors such as the annualized impact of woodwork next
year, presumptive eligibility, changes in utilization, to what degree
we’ll achieve budget reductions. And finally, the final area of risk is
how consistent will North Carolina’s growth in enrollment and changes in
utilization be compared to other years or other around the country. The
presentation we did earlier this year really showed that in 2003 to
2013, that if you normalize changes in mix of enrollment, neutralize the
effect of legislative changes, Medicaid and North Carolina expenditures
would grow like the national trends in healthcare. None of the numbers
that we’re going to put out today or talk about are absolutely correct.
They’re based on a series of assumptions, and the decision in large part
is what degree of caution…</p>

we wanna have in terms of a re-base for next year we've used everything
that we know we've used all the actual information we have available to
us we've also tried to quantify those things that we don't know trying
to put a value on those so if you're making a decision about a re-base
you have information at least to where we think we could be the senate
chose to use fiscal researches worst case scenario the house chose to
use the majority of the senate assumptions around re-base the one major
variation was in the back log where they chose to use the governor's
back log number with that I'll try to walk you through the sheet that
you have here it's a front and back sheet and I wanna start with the
medicate summary of state fiscal year 13-14 shortfall the four columns
the first column is the original estimate that fiscal research made
which was what was used as a basis for the senate's budget the second
column which was the fiscal research [??] revised estimate utilizes
information year to date through May of this year to update all the
assumptions and all the calculations that we did the major difference
between what we used in preparation of the senate budget and where we
are right now in terms of our estimate is in the back logs when we did
the original estimate we had a back log of about 407 million dollars a
157 million dollars of that was in claims about 250 million dollars was
in application or enrollment back log at the end of May where we think
we are right now is about 25.6 million dollars in total requirements for
the claims back log about a 187 million dollars in terms of the
application enrollment back log we also in this sheet represented some
of the key components in terms of where we factored into the estimate as
example we start with where we think claims and utilization will be
we've indicated how much of the back or how much of the shortfall in
this year will be at trivial to not achieving budget reductions the
presumptive eligibility etc so we're giving you the pieces in parts in
terms of medicate where we expect the end of the year from on a cash
basis is with a cash surplus of about 43.2 million dollars this year
when you had the health choice cash surplus of 9.4 million we expect in
this year for medicate in health choice with a cash surplus of about
52.6 million then comes in the back logs these are liabilities that
we're all into next year under the revised scenario we're resuming about
a 112 million worth of liabilities that we'll roll into next year so
from a budget prospective this year when you recognize that a 112
million dollars you'll have almost a 60 million dollars shortfall in
terms of what's in the revised budget again the senate's budget
originally used original estimate and the house used the for the most
part the senate assumptions with the exception of back log they also did
not include presumptive eligibility also did not include a expected
change in use patterns in utilization rights in terms of response
towards rate reductions so their back log we're assuming their shortfall
from a budget perspective in 2013-14 was [??] at 25.3 million dollars if
you flip the page over I'll go into state fiscal year 14-15 again using
the 2014 as our base to build our 15 obviously as we will do start back
log from 407 then we go down to 312 million dollars we see on 2014-15
revised estimate will come down as well in terms of where we ended up
from medicate perspective we moved from 206 million dollars in terms of
additional re-base needed next year down to a hundred just under a 185
million dollars again this compares to the house original position of a
117.8 million dollars the health choice surplus in 2015 is also expected
to increase from 14.5 to 14.8 approximately so in terms of a net bottom
line re-base needed for next year using May information where we think
we'll be right now is we'll go from a 191.5 million in the worst case
scenario down to 169.9 million again that's the worst case scenario at
this point I'd be happy to take any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay thank you Mr [??] any questions from the committee members senator

<p id="10:00">
I'm a little off because I was on the wrong side the whole time. I can't
believe I did that but it's just not my day. OK. And Brock is not much
help over here. Anyway, my main question is really where you got
started, and I'm not on HHS so some of you may all know some of this
stuff and I'm just a lot behind. In terms of the, you were saying some
things, none of it is exactly right because some things we just don't
know, so where are we with knowing our data, the enrollment data, what
part do we know and what part is it we don't know and will we ever know
what we need to know? I don't know of another way. And is there a
timeframe on that? I'mm not trying to be funny, but I hope that makes
sense. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant, what we do know is in terms of
total spending through the end of May we know actually what we have
spent. So we have confidence that the spending is accurate. We're
probably between 95 and 98% confident when you get down below the total
in terms of how that spending breaks down between the various programs,
categories of service like hospitals, physicians etc. So those two we're
pretty confident about. The things we don't know and we still don't have
a date when we think we will know is enrollment. We've not known all
year how many people are actually enrolled in Medicaid. We've gotten
information that changes from time to time. We don't know how it brakes
down between aged, blind, disabled, children, etc. and that's important
because a child, for instance, in Medicaid, spends about $208 a month, a
disabled individual, about $1400 a month, so knowing how those things
break down is really important. At this point we don't have any idea.
That's probably the biggest one. There are some other pieces of data
that are important that we don't have as well. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow
up, Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Is it
knowable? And is it knowable and we just don't have the money to pay the
people to count the files or find the papers or is it just something
that we will never know for ever and ever. I mean, it's just not
knowable. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Susan [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jackson,
members of the committee, this year is different. In the past we have
had that information, so it's not information that has not been
available, but this year they implemented two new systems as you're
aware of, NC Fast Eligibility system and the NC Track system so both of
those systems for Medicaid will take quite a bit of time for us to be
able to get accurate information out of those systems, so. And then
you've got local, the counties who've had to deal with the food stamp
issue. I mean there's just been a whole host of things that have gone on
that makes getting data, accurate data, challenging. But I do think, we
have had it before, accurate data before, and I'm hoping that once these
systems get resolved, completed, that we'll get that accurate
information again. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. One more follow up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Can I hold you to that, Senator? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, you
can. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK, thanks. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there an outside
date of us, fairly comfortable that we will have the data we need to
know what our numbers are in terms of enrollment? You know, what our
liabilities and responsibilities are. Is there like a outside possible
date? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Generally, Senator Bryant, you know closeout by
the middle of August what your actual expenditures were. The reason this
year is different is because of backlog in claims payments and backlog
in eligibility and the fact that the state has to go back three years
prior to the application date and pay those bills. This year I don't
know when we're going to know, I think someone from the department will
have to respond to that or someone from state budget, but we think it
will be sometime probably late next year before we even know what our
accurate total expenditures were for Medicaid because they'll have cash
on the bottom line but they'll have outstanding liabilities. We just
won't, it'll take a little while to reconcile all of that I think, but I
don't have a timeframe for you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK, thank you Susan,
thank you Senator Bryant. Senator Robinson. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Chair and thank you Steven, Susan. My question here gets back to
what we had looked at earlier when we had projected what the backlog
would be and what the Medicaid shortfall would be and were saying in
terms of claims and growth $114 million here. Does that take into
account the numbers of providers or are you estimating the numbers of
providers that we still have outstanding because they're still having
difficulty with the North Carolina Track system? I know in my area we
have quite a few who call all the time. So what are you including and
are you including that, or how close do you think you are in estimating
what that particular backlog is? And then I had one</p>

<p id="15:00">
… question, Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Steve? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson, in terms of the original forecast, there was about 157
million dollars of claims that we estimated at that time. At the end of
May, we’ve seen claim payments actually accelerate to some extent. At
this point, we see about 25.6 million dollars worth of claims that we
think are in that bucket that you’re talking about, and that number is
in here. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If I could just add to that Senator Robinson,
let me tell you a little bit of how we ended up with this estimate. So
you passed the budget last year for both years of the biennium for
13-14, 14-15. Based on the rebase we did and the continuation budget,
the certified budget that you passed, we know where we should be in
expenditures, so Steve modeled it out to say this is how, based on
historical data, we should have spent this much money by this point in
time. If you hadn’t done that because other policy changes haven’t
happened, that’s how we try to figure out where you should be in
expenditures, so to the extent that the budget was accurate, we can
project how much providers should have been paid by this point, and if
not then there’s something wrong, potentially a claims backlog or
eligibility backlog. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And I’m assuming that means that you’ve
included that in here, but the presumptive eligibility in terms of the
woodwork group, does this take in or does this factor in the numbers
that we had estimated would be in the woodwork already, or is there an
increase in here or a decrease? [SPEAKER CHANGES] In terms of the
original, the estimate in the Senate budget in both the original and the
revised, we’re assuming the same level of activity for woodwork.
Presumptive eligibility was actually not in the original budget, so what
we’ve done is estimated based on another set of scenarios, what we think
the presumptive eligibility impact would be if there was a ten percent
error rate, and again, the only way presumptive eligibility costs the
state is if ultimately we have people that are presumed eligible and
well they’re not, so we’ve assumed a ten percent error rate in that
factor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Ford. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. Can you share with us the percentage rate of growth for
Medicaid? [SPEAKER CHANGES] In terms of the 2014-15, we assumed a 1.1
percent growth in enrollment and a 4.2 percent growth in utilization. We
also assumed that we would continue to see a shift in mix of enrollment
to a higher, if you will, cost recipient, so those three things went
into the enrollment numbers. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up, Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m asking for the
percentage rate in growth in overall spending by the state. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] You mean historical spending, Senator Ford? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. Mr. Chair, may I follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Just hoping to clarify my question. What I’m looking for is
based upon the historical data that you have, based upon what the state
has spent from budget to budget as that increase, what is that
percentage increase over time? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I can get… I don’t have
it with me but I can… When you look at history in terms of growth, you
have to make sure that… because in past years we’ve had
legislatively-approved reductions that would tend to lower or dampen the
rate of growth in prior years. What we try to do, in terms of the
analysis we did earlier this year, is try to extract or normalize the
data so as if those things had not gone into place. In that case,
Medicaid base spending grew at about 5 to 5.4 percent. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, and I’m going
to…  First of all, I’m glad Senator Robinson allowed me to share her
microphone. She doesn’t usually give me a chance, so… but maybe to you,
Mr. Chairman, this Medicaid portion of the budget is the lynchpin to
getting this problem solved, and would someone explain to me why we
don’t have OMB or staff people from DHHS here to help us get to an
answer so that we can move this budget forwards? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well
I’ll attempt to answer that for you, Senator Rucho. We had spoken
earlier with our budget director, and he has informed us that he’s
almost to the point of having numbers he’s ready to put out to public,
but he does not have them as of this meeting. Senator Brown, would you
like to follow-up on that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, it’s my
understanding that they’re having the same problems we’ve been having
with getting numbers to present anything different to us, so they felt
like they had no new information, and I think that’s why they’re not
here today. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up, Senator Rucho? Senator Tucker.</p>

<p id="20:00">
[Speaker Change] Thank you Mr. Chairman, in my short time around here,
you started by saying out that the numbers are not accurate and you said
we don’t know seven or eight times, have you as far as claims and
backlog have you checked with the hospital ?? Carolina in UNC, to see if
they have any backlog claims that are outstanding? That is owed to them
by Medicaid?
[Speaker Change] We have not surveyed ??. The department as provided us
information where they have surveyed the providers in terms of claims
they’ve also given us information about the enrollment backlog and we’ve
tried to work through some of that we have not directly surveyed the
providers. Follow up sir
[Speaker Change] Yes sir, that would certainly be fiscal knew that if
those numbers were real would be indicative of kind of what we’re
looking at and how it may or may not skew your number. You know also
too, Medicaid enrollment they said, was about 65,000 and is that a good
number. From the HHS.
[Speaker Change] I’m not sure I understand when said 65,000.
[Speaker Change] Yeah roughly 65,000 is the Medicaid enrollment
increased by rather than aggregate number of 27,000 that they had before
which is a considerable growth. Is that number correct,
[Speaker Change] We’ve received information, have received information
this week that shows that enrollment grew by about when you take out the
effective children being shifted from health choice to Medicaid that the
other Medicaid enrollment has grown by 65,000 before you add in the
backlog. This issue as we look at the data, there very wide variations
as an example in April according to the data we received, enrollment
dropped by 97,000 people. So we’re trying to reconcile, we jumped by
50,000 in July down by 97,000 in april so we can’t reconcile it doesn’t
line up with prior years or months.
[Speaker Change] Just one more comment the 60 million dollar hiccup that
we have for next year because it was disallowed by the feds all the
money we were supposed to save, we’re already in the hole now is that
not correct?.
[Speaker Change] Sen. Tucker it’s our understanding that communication
from CMS the federal government and HHS indicated that it is not an
allowable assessment as this point so the house did not include that
item, the senate included it, but it’s our understanding you can’t move
forward with that as proposed in the governments budget.
[Speaker Change] Senator ??,
[Speaker Change] First kind of looking at these, some information coming
in on what the county backlog, when we’re looking at a backlog number.
We have one number that’s in the system and then we have another
potential number of backlog claims that aren’t in the system and I know
that we were dealing with food stamps earlier this year we had a sudden
appearance several thousand applications conveniently stored under
someone’s desk. That appeared near the last day of that. What kind of ??
that the counties might be holding that aren’t reported in the system.
[Speaker Change] Senator Heist, what we have, the recent information
that we have is there’s 104,000 applications that are beyond what’s
called the standard time for processing. Last year this time around this
time there was about 1600. So there’s about 102,000 more than normal. If
you can consider that normal, the other factor is that about 44,000
applications pending that have come through in the exchange about
facilities that 50,000 applications that would have come through the
DSS. We have extra information about the applications that you are
talking about those that either have not come into the system or not in
the system as of this day. Have not received any information about
those.
[Speaker Change] Let me clarify, we have received some information
yesterday or day before yesterday on what they think the paper
application that they haven’t made any action on. We’re still reviewing
that data and asking questions on counties. We want to contact some
counties to see what their response actually is, but it’s bigger than
the number that is pinged.</p>

<p id="25:00">
Because federal policy requires, even for recertifications, that you
can’t take someone off the Medicaid roll until they have been determined
ineligible, so to the extent that counties are backlogged on
recertifications or even new applications, a person remains eligible
until they are determined ineligible, and so our backlog number
hopefully will anticipate both backlog and potentially some of those
other expenses that haven’t been built into our rebase for people who
will receive Medicaid services who should not be receiving services, but
because of these issues at the local level will remain eligible until
they catch up at the county. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. One of the assumptions that the OSBM and the
Governor’s budget as well as the House in accepting those numbers and
operations made was that a large majority of those pending applications
would be significantly denied, that they were ineligible. I believe all
calculations, somewhere about 75 to 80 percent of them would be thrown
out for various reasons. What type of estimates or calculations are you
using for the assumptions as to how many of those are coming through,
and what’s the difference in those two numbers? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise, I’ll respond to the first part of the question, then Steve
can tell you what he’s actually done in his model that he’s presented,
and that is we’ve seen that information from the department where I
think it’s about an 8 percent approval rate, but without knowing whether
that’s just a really random sample or whether it came all from just a
few counties, it’s hard for me to know whether that’s a real 8 percent
or whether it’s been skewed in some way, so I don’t know whether the 8
percent is a valid 8 percent or if it’s just because of the sample that
they actually used, so we I think have gone back to our original ACA
projections for our worst-case scenario, so Steve can talk about what
he’s actually included. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We’re trying to parse the
applications between those that are coming from the exchange and those
that are coming through the DSS. The information we’ve got from the
counties are that about 62 percent of the applications that come through
the county process ultimately get approved, so as a parse, I’m using 62
percent on that side. We’re using 22 percent on the exchange side,
partly… that’s one of the numbers that we’ve also seen from the
department. Based on some of the research I’ve done in terms of the
exchange processing, that seems to be fairly reasonable, but those are
the two numbers and we’ve also added in a little extra on top of that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just for a final
follow-up, if we had gone to this… if we, based on your estimate right
now, if looking at your estimate, if we were instead to accept the House
position or OSBM’s position on the budget, what would be your total
estimated shortfall we would be looking at coming into next year?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think for the House budget, ?? here, the House’s
number would be 103.3 million in 14-15. Their current year shortfall
number based on our revised numbers would be 25.4 for 13-14. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] So about 130 million just for that calculation. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Tillman? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m going to try to take off
a little bit ??. I think you’re getting to what I was wanting to get at,
and we’ve been working with Senate and House budgets and trying to
reconcile them over the last several years. Now we all start off knowing
what the problem is, and we come up with assumptions, and based on those
assumptions, if you look at the bottom line on 2014-15 budget, we can
see a 90 to 100, who knows? It could be 150 million, but we’ve got a
huge difference there with two groups trying to come up with an answer
to this problem, and everything else that we’re going to do down here
with the budget cannot move unless we fix this problem that we’re
looking at. Now it’s like nailing jell-o on a tree. You ever try that?
What I want to know is whose numbers are we going to trust, and over the
years, whose numbers have been close to right and whose numbers have
not. Somewhere you’ve got to say this is the set of numbers that we
think is best at estimating what the shortfall will be. Tell us what’s
the history and what do you…</p>

… think? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Either one of you two want to jump at that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don’t think I can handle that. I will tell you that
last year in the various budgets that the same rebase was used from in
the House and the Senate and also in the conference process, and those
were fiscal research rebase numbers. So starting last year, you changed
what you had been doing, and that is you used a national growth rate.
You didn’t use flexible cuts; you used cuts that were tied to specific
policy changes. I do believe, and I can verify for you, that all three
budgets had the same rebase, and the cuts may have varied but the rebase
was the same. In this instance with the House going with the Governor’s
backlog number, that’s a number that can be debated. We’ll tell you that
we have our methodology for trying to figure out what’s at the local
level. It’s not probably much better than what the Governor’s using;
it’s just that we are using a worst-case scenario. We were asked by the
Senate to prepare a worst-case scenario, and that’s what this is. So the
decision by the Senate was to use a worst-case. The House’s decision was
to use sort of a hybrid. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] My point is if we don’t choose the
worst-case scenario, we’re going to be back where we’ve been every year.
A billion, billion and a half, two billion dollars that we’ve had to
make up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Last year, Senator Tillman, you had a
structural problem of over 200 million and you had the growth, so a
growth rate, if you look at 5.3 percent, hopefully you’ve made some
progress there. It shouldn’t be 500 million again unless something goes
really wrong. Part of the problem is that there are budget reductions
that haven’t been achieved this year, or else you wouldn’t be looking at
200 million dollars. 90 million dollars is associated with cuts that
were not implemented by the Division of Medical Assistance. But moving
forward, we would be hopeful that the worst case is really the worst
case, and however you decide to fund it, you’d have funds available that
would cover that and you wouldn’t have to have a shortfall bill, but
given the fact that we don’t even know how many people are enrolled in
Medicaid, I can’t give you an answer on that. I can tell you we’ve tried
to think of everything possible and put a number to it, but I can’t… we
don’t know what the ?? would be. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well… [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Tillman, let Senator Brown. He hasn’t… [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I just thought I’d ask Susan maybe to respond to this. This is
a totally different budget just because of information, compared to what
we’ve been dealing with in the past, and that’s one of the reason you
have to take worst-case scenario, is because you don’t have the
information that we’ve had to deal with before, and even at worst-case
scenario, I’m sure Susan would tell you that she’s real skeptical about
these numbers dealing with worst-case scenario because there’s so much
uncertainty out there, and I think that’s important to make sure
everyone understands that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Berger. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, and I’m kind of new to this process,
but what information is it that we’re missing, and have we asked for
that information? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Steve? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Berger, the information we’ve asked for relates… is around enrollment;
how many people at what program and category, numbers of recipients.
We’ve asked for… we’ve tried to get information about the applications
that are pending in process, the number of applications that are in the
DSSs that haven’t been put into the system. Those are the three, and we
have… enrollment is probably the most significant one. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And you’ve asked
for this information from the department. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And what if any response have you received? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] We’ve received multiple iterations of the information. It
changes every time and when we get it and ask questions, we never can
get a satisfactory answer that we have real information. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think everybody knows the answer
to this question, but what impact would we expect to see on the budget
if we don’t have that information and, I’m going to call it “guesses”
that are being made, are incorrect? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We think, Senator
Berger, that if we had the same enrollment data we had last year, the
worst case would probably look better. So that would be… we would hope
that that additional information would help us be able to get better per
member per month utilization data and help us firm up our numbers, and
some of these risk factors that we’ve had to put a dollar sign to
wouldn’t necessarily be as high. So I think that would be the impact of
the additional data, but… [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well just a statement, Mr. Chairman. I think that’s the reason the
committee…</p>

<p id="35:00">
You wanted to have somebody from OSMB be here today to help us answer
these kinds of questions.
[SPEAKER] I would agree. Senator Tillman, did you get all your questions
answered?
[SPEAKER] No, but I'm gonna stop.
[SPEAKER] Okay, Senator Rucho.
[SPEAKER] Thank you. Mr. Chairman and again along the line and I
appreciate trying to canvas the counties and the providers since we have
a challenge in getting that information. But, along the line of what
Senator Burger was talking about, without that information as to how
OSMB actually came to their numbers and they're not even here to defend
their numbers. Then a prudent business person, and I ask a prudent would
take worse case scenario to put some certainty in the budget. Would you
agree?
[SPEAKER] We believe if you do not want to be facing a potential
shortfall when you come in here next year, that's your goal, then you
would go with that scenario.
[SPEAKER] Okay, Senator Bryant.
[SPEAKER] I wanted to follow up, to some respect, on the line of
questioning that President Pro Tempore Berger was on which was similar
to mine about what's knowable and non-knowable. And I was only going to
ask, are we completely or do we have to be completely at the mercy of
the executive branch agencies on an issue like this that is so critical
to what we do. And this is more of a going forward question since we
know we're in this transition according to staff it's not even predicted
that maybe by the end of 2015, if I'm correct? We really know the
answers to some of these questions. Do we have the capability to somehow
implement something that gives us more control over the numbers or the
process or can somebody go into the account files or do we have to go
back to some old fashioned process or something and get people to do
that. I don't know what needs to be done, but I just cannot believe it's
un-doable. And I wonder to my question to the chair and perhaps even to
President Pro Tempore, or whoever might know; is there anything we can
do?
[SPEAKER] Okay, before l give you my opinion Susan would you like to.
[SPEAKER] Sir, Senator Bryant this past year, we want to let you know
that HHS has given us access to their data warehouse. So fiscal research
will have the capability now and can go and look at their data. The
problem that we are facing and they are facing is the actual data.
Because these are new systems and they are still having issues with the
systems, the data is not as good as reliable as it should be. Now we're
hopeful that will change moving forward. And when it does, we will have
access to the raw data that we need and can run any kind of scenario or
analysis that we need to. So that is coming, it's just that we don't
have that for you unfortunately right now.
[SPEAKER] Okay. Senator Ford.
[SPEAKER] Thank you Mr. Chair. Based upon the uncertainty and the lack
of data, how can we say for certain that people are not being overpaid
or underpaid?
[SPEAKER] Susan.
[SPEAKER] We probably can't say that.
[SPEAKER] Follow up?
[SPEAKER] Follow up.
[SPEAKER] To me, that is a very disturbing scenario where we are taking
tax payer money with good intentions but with no verification that we're
doing th right thing by it because of a broken system. Mr. Chair, I
encourage this body to take some actions so that we can bring some
correction to this situation.
[SPEAKER] So noted sir, thank you. Any other questions or comments from
the members? Did anyone by chance from OSMB show up? If not. Senator
Page, excuse me.
[SPEAKER] Just one statement Mr. Chair. I do believe that this shows the
critical necessity for reorganization of MEDICARE, MEDICAID excuse me.
Let me pick my terms out. It really shows that we need to reorganize
MEDICAID so that we will have accurate data and do the best we can for
the citizens of our state.
[SPEAKER] Thank you. Any other questions or comments. If not. Senator
Brown.
[SPEAKER] Can we vote on that?
[SPEAKER] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I just regret that OSMB isn't here to
make their presentation. I think you know as a body we try to put
together the best budget we can. These are are difficult budgets, but
you got to have as accurate numbers as you can have to put these
together and.</p>

And I think, I hope, I hope you see that using worst-case scenario in
this situation is probably the only way to go because of the uncertainty
we are dealing with trying to put this budget together. And, before you
can continue on with a budget process you’ve got to have good numbers
and I think the numbers we presented today are probably the best numbers
to move forward with. And I hope that we can get our House counterparts
on board with that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, we’re sitting here and what is it June 19th, I
believe? And we still don't have numbers. If push comes to shove, we can
always issue subpoenas, and have the numbers come to us. So, let’s don't
take that off the table. I mean we need to get moving here and get out
of here. Thank you Mr.Chairman [SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re certainly
welcome. Any other comments or questions? If not , thank y’all this
meeting is adjourned.</p>
