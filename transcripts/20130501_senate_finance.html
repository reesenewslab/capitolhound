Him him and you and now you're dating is a low welcome webpages today
and then Johnson is it within a matter of what offered was sponsored by
Senator Nesbitt, welcome and hope you enjoy your week in the Senate.  I
would like thank.  I started arm shaft.  There is standing by Ernie
Cheryl Anderson matters Donna Blake and Ken Lewis and welcome.  We have
two bills to be heard today.  The first one is the one to be presented
by Senator Brown said no.  Fifty eight.  Increase funding for graduate
and I believe we have a PCS do I have a motion to PCS.  Some of the
buzzer to block all in favor say I motion passes the third round you,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Chairman, I advise really thought about this one a but I think I
try to take a lot input from a lot of people to continue to work on this
bill and I think we got the bill hugged as good as I can do nothing.  We
have to an obvious stuff, and I can go back over why we need to bail law
and might want me to do that I think I think I'm explained that a couple
times mouse.  I don't know that I need to go through that whole process,
but anyway I will tell you what the changes in the BCS.  Those in the
and and then we'll talk about decision was what the BCS will do is if
it's a twenty five foot boat or lasts will raise the registration fee
from fifteen to twenty five dollars thirty IgG blocking insights on.  I
got him not to do this.  Twenty six.  They are above the raise at the
fifteenth fifty dollars.  It also takes some a little over two million
dollars onto the highway fund and this would generate a little bit over
six million that we were trying to generate as we work through this bill
also the night is coming out a highway fund that is one sixty one
percent and that really tries to recruit some of the dollars that are
spent the orgasm, but it's at the pump and recapture some of that those
dollars are actually more, but this does recapture some of it.  The
piece that out on the titling phase it in our increase on the funny
thing is, is still in the bill and also the one-to-one match the locals
have to come up with is still in the veil.  So having a sacred phase
because I hated by lives on the coast knows that their communities are
going to have to match this saw about four dollars police dollars, down,
I think that it's very much to what the bill does now, Jeff, maybe
anything, it just my one had anything that I got covered to the recovery
of the deep are nevertheless I do have a man lies in for affected Mister
yesterday, members of copy limit, they should click over to discuss
limits.  It just changes the effective date tool on the October one of
two thousand thirteen.  It just gives the wildlife will work on it ready
for the changes in discussions on even a commotion of utilizing
perspective.  Remember his accept the moment, but him, I think that in
them, and all the things that I will remember the passes and will be
enrolled with little thought in our discussion on the bill is the
Senator, I am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess discusses first to begin with those on, I'd probably was part of
the amendment as much as anything but my concern is that you're putting
off the delay in the day sometime in the future.  Now it's the October
pilots coming in while a three-year permit under the current thirty is
still an option and still out there and college bloopers, fiscal note in
the us idols of Maine.  I don't know that were accounting for the fact
or I think my vote.  It will have a lot fewer permits sold in the next
three years goes in the next three months ago.  So a lot of three-year
permits</p>

The technology that was promised and should be cheaper than was
available right now if that's the case then the babies on said date
should not matter because that energy should be cheaper, but were
looking at North Carolina competition is interesting.  This committee;
who talk about what's happening is hard in China, they hurriedly passed
Senate Bill three.  How would put a burden on companies and people in
North Carolina right before a crisis that we had in our economy,
economic development, followed low-cost energy outset as the Ford
eighteen fifteen.  The first meal in North Carolina was in Lincoln
County of pushing and his him all Warwick, which are my ancestors built
in North Carolina because of cheap energy they need is to say we would
have higher energy cost in North Carolina desktop to get jobs going
because it is an undue burden on companies are companies are suffering
our people are suffering in North Carolina in areas where we have
double-digit employment.  We have higher energy calls.  Now we want a
stuffed country.  We got three percent if you're eager to be fearless,
look what we have here and allow for that and allow for development and
wealth least technologies to come true.  As promised, we hope that works
with the meantime, we have people that are looking for jobs in a far
mail truck companies don't have the energy reliable low cost is only
tougher and tougher for people to be higher is something we need.  We
need to put this in was built three went through the roof.  A lot of
people interested a lot of promises made some other thinkers among the
morning to look at where we are right now and where we want to go as a
state to create jobs, North Carolina jobs, followed low-cost energy.  If
you look at the competition submission before in China of what they're
doing.  That's what competition, not across the border, not across the
South Carolina Junior, KSC, our competition of worldwide if we don't
have low-cost energy.  We are losing effort.  Competition seventy
different ways and if we put a mandate on our companies and our people
to pay higher calls these products are imported from China is just that
is further behind this again.  This realist is different from the one of
Stefan Thurlow, the different one.  It was passing through health of the
nation before I would do we just keep what we have right now and these
technologies were developed and progressed the way they were promised in

It's already providing thousands of jobs.  They expressed concern that
they participated in this deal.  They spent thousands, millions of
dollars to implement waste-to-energy lagoons and as you know, the
practices of sale.  All of these different things to investors and they
express great him him him him these things, and consequently there at a

since the same kind of negative message to their investors, and it
adversely affects their operations out there was a lot of pressure put
on them, but they comply and they invested in these lagoons and other of

way to go low-cost energy is achieved through the renewable energy

legislation is really amazing when we gotten in five years is one point
Seven billion dollars invested in North Carolina, twenty two thousand
new jobs in the renewable energy for four in sustainable energy,
cleantech sector.  There is hundreds of millions of dollars in
investment waiting to happen.  I have a buddy of mine good friend is a
bit player in the subsectors of a small business fifteen people.  That's
all he's got a twenty four twenty five million dollar deal.  It will
close in four weeks.  If we would stop messing with this bill.  If we
would allow there to be some business certainty, civic businesses know
how to get investors.  Investors will not play long as were playing
these games for every million dollars.  That's twenty construction jobs
for three to six months were talking about five hundred jobs in
construction, they can start a month.  Now if we would just put this to
bed.  He has another twenty five to seventy five million in deals that
can happen this year.  That's a small player.  While we would try to
destroy one of the few sectors that have actually grown over the course
of the recession is beyond me.

<p id="25:00">
Also I think something that most need to know about the bill is this
bill’s going to be referred to Commerce so we can debate it more. I’ve
heard some of the concerns that Senator Blue has heard, and I’d like to
hear more of those and we’ll continue to work on this bill, but sooner
or later you’ve got to put an endpoint to this. How long do you
subsidize it? If 2023’s not the right year, then somebody tell me what
is the right year. How long do you subsidize it? So I think that’s the
question, and again, we’ll debate this and we’ll listen to the concerns
as this thing moves to Commerce, but again, I think you’ve got to find
an end date eventually. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Ralph.
Senator McKissick. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I’ll be completely candid.
This bill gives me very grave and very deep concern. I was around when
we passed Senate Bill 3, and it was a careful balancing of competing
interests among all the stakeholders, whether they were
environmentalists, whether they were utilities – all those that were
interested in our renewable resources program. What we were all
interested in doing was coming up with something that was livable,
something that was practical, and something that would most of all look
at alternative forms of generating energy in this state, and I think
it’s been very, very successful in accomplishing that objective. If you
look at our renewable energy portfolio and look at what it is composed
of today as opposed to what it was when this bill was passed, we’ve made
quantum leaps forward. We’ve come a very, very long way. It’s generated
thousands of jobs. If you look at the number of solar farms that are out
there today in North Carolina compared to what it was previously, my
understanding now, we’re among the top five states in America. If you
look at what the, as Senator Blue was pointing out, what these hog
farmers were doing with their waste and how it could be utilized, the
investments that were made to capitalize upon that and to include that
as part of our alternative sources of energy, we’ve made significant
strides forward in accomplishing that. I don’t know why, in the face of
significant progress in better utilizing our resources, in trying to
make customers and users of electricity more aware of how they utilize
electric power, why we would turn our back on a program and initiative
that has been successful for North Carolina. If anything what we should
be doing is perhaps continuing to bring these stakeholders together to
see what we can work on together to continue going down this path – not
abandoning it, not turning our backs on it, not sitting here and
basically saying we’re going to keep it at 3%. We need to get it on up
to 12%. We need to do what was originally envisioned in this state, but
when we abandon our efforts and we create commercial uncertainty in the
marketplace, particularly when this is a section of the economy that has
grown during the recession and which has been good for this state, it’s
bad public policy and it creates mistrust. People don’t know what the
state of North Carolina is going to do next. One thing that we’ve begun
to do is back away and back away and renege on obligations that we’ve
made as a matter of public policy and passing laws and initiatives, and
this is just another quantum step backwards, and I’m disappointed to see
this bill being brought before us, Senator Brock. I guess my question to
you sir is why in the face of all the progress that we’ve made in
pulling together alternative energy sources and trying to pull together
these stakeholders which have been unified frequently in the past as a
voice, why are we going to now turn our back on this effort? Why are we
now trying to rethink this direction, and what do we gain from it all?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator McKissick. I’d love to answer this
question. We’re talking about the thousand jobs that were created? I’ll
tell you about one of my first “welcome to Raleigh” moments. When I went
over to the Commerce Department, sat in a chair with my nameplate on it,
they told me to get out because they were waiting for Senator Brock to
arrive because I was… they thought somebody much older would sit down.
We lost four thousand jobs out of ??. Some of those were my family
members. Freightliner losing from 45 hundred down to four thousand. Now
those were a lot of environmental regulations and other regulations on
why it was easier to have business in other countries rather than North
Carolina. Eight thousand jobs directly related to those, you look at the
effect of that, of what it did in my area. When I did a comparison, no
other area in the state of North Carolina or the country</p>

Jobs in that area.  My district is than Senator Hartsell differed in.
We knew what I mean Annapolis which we share was in the center
depression.  There greatly went on a working layout of it.  We get back
to the point of religion ones offer creative and Senator son 's body
over there.  Claim twenty jobs each time they delighted to have a and
installation one of the long-term effects of those jobs.  That's a job
for the temporary decision.  We want something.  If reliable and
cost-efficient when you're working about a competition where a copy out
of this is not South Carolina, Virginia, the people is in China right
now that is what our job for the one in which we are putting a anchor
around the leg of North Carolina's economy to subsidize.  I heavily
subsidized industry for solar is eight hundred two, one for natural gas
eight hundred one, and we let it area syndrome.  While they had the
title subsidies.  It came from the federal government.  Their normal
stimulus packages.  How many of those when the stimulus went away win
under the Java boundless people cause it doesn't pay for itself.  You've
got to find something that's cost-efficient that the economy can grow
seven S dependable three sixty five, when nothing was a bill number less
everyday of the week.  If you're looking is always on carnivore of the
energy they don't have that constant need that when you flip that switch
to energy will be there.  We have to wait and is familiar.  There's a
lot of variables we want technology to be there.  We have to three
percent or less for additional ten years and the technologies I have it.
 Also they get of major breakthrough, we can come back to the general
family, but we won't need to, because the marketplace.  The marketplace
will dictate the energy source, and if it comes much cheaper.  We figure
out we had we are well great way to look at solar may currently or
development families.  You can put on eating window right now to get
some type of energy, power, you can still see for what phrases like the
but it doesn't pay for itself, it doesn't come close with that
technology advances, the generation coming to look at the list, though
there is more cost efficient emissaries and the subsidies and those that
come from the federal government.

The rug away beyond broke up one quick follow-up and litigious about
twenty seconds when I brought you up to China in the largest producer of
solar equipment in the world, it would compete with China.  We need to
be about producing solar energy, domestic, I have run usually have to
buy it because her talk to us or his mother produce a misnomer.

I think they got owned to something that we need to get on to as well to
be smart about doing it and get ahead of the curve within the high
recovery like that.  Q because, lastly right.  I think of you bringing
those from title VII, as it would be positive and hesitant ways from
here on a few like to be recognized.

this energy bill out that we have been very mindful when we start him
ceased to our small business people do this and then we change the mill
destroying that's my concern.  I question answered Walters and other
numbers considered whether Mister and if a man like this question,
Mister Conrad said that was left on red dye, who with the again, I think
Konrad Steffen, North County utilities commission, but if I heard what
you said a minute a day, but I'm not sure it really sunk in with me and
so I got to ask it back to you to be sure, the way I understood it, is
what you really tell them up, I'm a residential customer on the Duke
energy grid were you telling me that next year the rights they propose</p>

residential customer, that with the reps rider on there, my monthly bill
would be a little bit lower than it would be without the reps rider on
it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes, Senator Clodfelter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]That's what I though you said.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Senator Clodfelter.  Member, any more
questions for the committee?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Jackson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chairman.  I'll be brief with my
comments.  Senate Bill 3 was a bad idea in the beginning, and I
appreciate the work that's been done on it, but here's my concern with
it.  We've had folks that were told this is the bill that's going to be
handed to you, we were dealt this hand, they were smart enough to go out
there and figure out a way to begin to work to make what we've done as a
legislature push down on them.  They were smart enough to take that and
start figuring out a way to make poultry science work in this thing, the
wood pellets try and  work, the swine industry has done extensive work
in trying to make this work on lagoons, and now we're going to try and
change the policy.  I mean, these are entrepreneurs, in my opinion,
that we've been trying to stifle because of the policies that this
general assembly is making.  We flip flop back and forth, and that's the
problem we've seen in agriculture overall.  Weather's going to come and
go, we can't predict that, but what's going to hurt agriculture in this
state is going to be the policies, and I think, being that we've got
this bill in place, that we are trying to mandate to, or we are getting
with the reps credits.  We need to leave it alone and let it try and do
its own thing, and give it some more time.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Senator Jackson.  Senator Hunt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chairman.  I basically have the same
concern.  Excuse me.  We have a lot of subcontractors, a lot of
contractors that made deals based on the original legislation, and I
just wondered, have you all considered any kind of a compromise, like
5%, 6%?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yeah, that's one thing we're working on, and also as
Senator Brown mentioned before, we are going to commerce with this bill
after finance, to look at the numbers.  And that technically, Senator
Hunt, is what we're trying to, hopefully, get into discussion here
today, not so much on the policy side of it, but the numbers side of it.
 And those are something we're trying to work on to get to those numbers
that are workable, and make sure that the experiment of renewable energy
is being subsidized to make sure we get something that actually works,
and work on those numbers, instead of subsidizing a particular industry,
and picking a winner in this area.  And that's what we're working on.
Also I know the House, they had a bill that ran through a hurdle there,
but they're looking at something else.  They're trying to work on
something that working on these rates and this structure is a continual
work in progress.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Senator Brock, we're going to now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Follow up, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Open discussion.  One more, you have a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes, thank, a follow up.  And so you're going to be
working on that, and based on that I can support it, but would you get
with me sometime in between now and commerce, and we'll talk about it?
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Clark, did you have a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]No, I do not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.   We're now going to open the floor to
members of the public.  I have a few ground rules here that I always do.
 I would ask you,  you have signed up, I will call your name, if you
would, please identify yourself afterwards.  You'll have 2 minutes.
Please address the bill as it pertains to finance, we will address the
commerce portions of the bill when it's in commerce, and everyone will
have a chance to speak over there.  The first signup is Summer Lanier
from Prestige Farms.  Welcome Ms. Lanier, you have the floor when you're
ready, if you'd just turn on your mike.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I think it's on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]That mike, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Okay.  Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, thank
you for allowing me to speak to you today.  My name is Summer Lanier,
and I'm the public relations director for Prestige Farms.  We're a
family owned and family operated pork and poultry production company
with over 70 owned company facilities, 1,100 employees, and 300 contract
growers, independent producers in Southeastern North Carolina.  We
recognize and appreciate the efforts of our lawmakers to maintaining the
agricultural car bills put forth in Senate Bill 3, but Prestige Farms
still opposed the proposed committee substitute to Senate Bill 365, and
we will not support any changes to the reps in any form.</p>

financial stability to the state 's largest employers to invest millions

not only the opportunity that economically but also environmentally
sustainable in the long term.  They do thirty seconds.  Please support

So come Butler welcomes about the obvious German numbers of many
thinking fillets, executive, you might the press a button, you are no
other just testing the house of yes or okay,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
thank you for letting me off, spank you today, my name is Tom Butler and
I have a hog farmer on.  I am here today to speak on behalf of all
reforms and the Johnson Council is six Swan waste-to-energy projects in
North Carolina.  Currently, and one of those projects is dislocated my
form, we take a life methane from our covered with Vince and we make
electricity.  We also have installed solar panels is up to me at our
electricity needs that are formed by reforms is proud to be known as a
hot day, environmentally friendly renewable green energy phone were
proud of their into oh seven, the General assembly may permit a junior
moratorium on expanding all forms with lagoons and Sprite feels as
though way to handle their waste.  We could build a new farm.  But it
must meet strict environmental standards at present there is no
technology available that we can afford to do that were still working on
the industry spent millions of dollars in research to try to compensate
no, we do know that the superior technologies that we are asked to put
in place capture missing and that's what we're doing at our form are
taking methane and make electricity on in the electricity generating
business.  Not because I want baby because I feel like I should be.  I
firmly believe that the ability the sale electricity derived from home
waste is a sexual energy to the future viability of our industry.  The
new version of the video before you would eliminate any future
opportunities for all farmers to produce electricity section three of
the veil will not allow people currently in the pipeline that have time
to recover their costs for my project.  It took more than year to
negotiate an agreement.  And I think this bill call for sixty days.
Another problem is the sunset of reps in two thousand twenty three as I
was like a long time that is just not enough time to do the research and
to see what happens and</p>

I read playing their investment.  Please reject efforts to reveal this
renewable energy.  The love, boundless Ralph Thompson
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
good afternoon Tom on the German and the other committee money.  Ralph
Thompson.  I'm the president of Holocene energy here in Raleigh were
drawn normally present opportunity to speak on the owned on the Senate
bill three sixty five holes is a renewal energy company whom it is made
up of three different companies on.  We have all men are all located
here on Atlantic Avenue, just this dentistry from the legislator the
first of those is a technology company is a small company is a
manufacturer and developer technologies that were primarily in the
thermal energy arena.  Our products are manufactured in here with long
folks from Raleigh that that otherwise would be working today.  If we
didn't if we want actually in the middle of this this process.  Our
employees are our welders, carpenters, plumbers, electricians,
engineers, level staff of usually staff member is spent on his career,
developing these types of products that these parts are being sold not
only in the US, but we're talking to a countries north of us and sell
the bus and was a bus.  Another part of our team is a construction
company that works out primarily on the East Coast, but we do a project
in the geothermal, solar thermal and also impeding our our clients are
both private and public companies and others invest vast knowledge is
our destiny types of projects.  We also have a project finance company
which is doing very well in circumstance put them at the same time with
the all common legislators creating quite a bit of store for us but with
with our own experience.  We developed here in North Carolina were
actually in the process of talking to the states.  Both north and south
of us and and dumb on the Midwest about developing, owning, operating
projects.  I think it's a concern, even Moses lose you about that free
markets.  There so much discussion about free markets.  I want to make
it really clear that the other when it comes to energy in North
Carolina, a free market doesn't exist on the utilities have a monopoly
over this arm of the state were no energy portfolio standard introduced
limited competition, which is given our company.  Companies like us
opportunity to build all technologies start again.  We aren't.  We are
not drawn a company, because and we are in North draw because Lorrie PS
we have a lot of choices on invested personally in this business, and we
taken the money that we may invest in new technologies.  Please vote
above continue competition and all and elevation and voting no phones in
over sixty five.  Avis Chairman, members of committee on Paul Sherman
North Carolina Farm Bureau on this life take a quick moment and imagine
of it to Farm Bureau was a participant in Senegal three was initially
negotiated all men, even the somewhat skeptical on participant in that
negotiations on, but it was a very long drawn out process and in the
end, we ended up with with the site policy from North Carolina and calls
that state policy investments were made on both the home bother poultry
and the All port livestock industries, and we would like you to not
support this bill so that we can see that investment continue to grow
and enviable to bear fruit.  I keep is my strong German anonymous Don
Butler, a vice president for government relations and public affairs for
Murphy Brown, which is the livestock production subsidiary of Smithfield
foods with the largest pork producer in the world and were head
quartered in Warsaw, North Carolina.  We are very much opposed to the
bill was for you today.  We have spent literally tens of millions of
dollars over the last fifteen years.  I investigating various
technologies have come to the conclusion that we know a lot about
growing things we don't know a lot about making electricity.  So, our
business plan is to partner with companies from around the world who
have that expertise have their own capital and are willing to come and
try and make energy production work on swine operations, and we have had
people from around the globe come and talk to us and they were here
because of Senate Bill three Senate bill three did not exist, they would
be in Iowa or Wisconsin or Minnesota</p>

...they would not be in North Carolina, and we understand that if Senate
Bill  3 were repealed or significantly changed—amending it or sending it
to a study bill, is the same as saying to the world that North Carolina
is really not serious about renewable energy from swine farms. It would
be a grave mistake in our view as a business. I'm a pork producer myself
and I'm telling you that the investors and the bankers and the
technology providers have sent a very clear signal to us.
Without Senate Bill 3 you won't see us again and you would be jerking
the rug from under those people who have invested tens of millions of
dollars. Have it on the ground today. Tom Butler's farm and several
others around the state. Three are currently under construction. Those
investors, those technology providers are scared to death. They want to
do multiple projects going forward.
If you cripple Senate Bill 3, that will not happen. Now, thanks to the
wisdom, or lack thereof, of the North Carolina General Assembly we've
had our hands tied behind us for a decade. We are the only state in
America that has a moratorium on a legal business. We're in the food
production business. So, I would ask you to think about what's already
been done to this industry. Please don't do this. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Butler.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, members of the committee. We have a bill before us. Do I hear a
motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. chairman. I think we've heard some good discussion today
and it still leaves opportunities for us to go forward in Commerce and
address some of the issues that have been brought forward, and I think
we will be doing that in Commerce.
But, it's still a factor that renewable energy sources really don't
provide a constant reliable source of electricity to be put into the
grid; and that means that we still have to have the base load plan cost
into delivery electricity So that any time that switch is turned on,
there has to be power there. With that being said, I move that for a
favorable report of Senate Bill 365-PCS and unfavorable to the original
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. The motion before the committee...
