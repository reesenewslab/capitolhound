[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the Senate, House Bill ?? 50 is the
Omnibus tax law changes for this session. It has several parts. I will
go through those. The Revenue Laws Committee met over the last seven
months. We met monthly and during that time we set up four or so
subcommittees to look in to different parts of this bill. I will go
through them quickly and I have asked staff to join us, I don't see them
yet, to help with questions and would ask that the, I think we've
already suspended the rules on that so that will be fine. We'll start
with part 1. Part 1 the deduction of for the state net loss. It replaces
the corporate net economic loss deduction with the state net loss
deduction. North Carolina is the only state in the U.S. that still does
it the old way and this brings us in to conforming with the code and the
other 49 states. Excuse me. Part 2 is just other income tax changes. It
corrects the dollar amount in the section 159 of the revenue code and it
needs to be enacted as soon as possible because it enacts, or it affects
the 2013 tax year returns. Some people filing their taxes, because of
the error in the law, are filing extensions and others will be filing
amended returns. Part 3 is the agricultural exemption certificate and
this defines who is actively engaged in agriculture and sets the limits
of who the farmers are and what they're incomes have to be to be met.
Part 4 is the prepaid meals plan that has to do with our colleges,
universities, and some other institutions. Part 5 is admissions and
sales tax on various admissions throughout the state and how and when
they would be collected. Part 6 deals with the service contracts and
this defines who must collect the tax and how to administer the refunds
of sales tax paid on service contracts that are later rescinded. Part 7
is a retailer contractors and this defines who the retailer contractors
are and that the retailers themselves are the folks that pay those taxes
when due. Part 8 has to do with just other tax changes, some are for ??
and need to be brought up today. The most significant of those has to do
with rental of one's personal home or cottage for a short period of
time. Part 9 is a recommendation from the committee for various changes
in alcohol, tobacco, and motor fuel excise taxes at the request of the
Department of Revenue. Part 10 has to do with tax law compliance changes
and this was a request from the Department of Revenue to the committee
to enact tools to ensure better compliance with the department. Part 11
deals with telecommunications equipment and how it is appraised by the
Department of Revenue at their request again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick has the floor to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I realize that there are many of us who served in local government
before coming here. I know that many of you are from small towns, some
of you are from large urban areas. One thing that we know, regardless of
what size communities we may served on in the past as being a part of a
public body or those that we may represent today, is that they all have
a bottom line that they have to look at. If we eliminate these privilege
taxes, which is proposed after this coming year, these communities will
be put in a very precarious financial position. We know one thing's for
sure, just based upon the physical impact, we're talking about 62
million dollars. On over in Durham it's projected to be a 2.2 million
dollar impact, the large urban area which I represent, and we need to be
exceedingly careful about how we perceive</p>

<p id="15:00">
I hear we’d like to study this further, but I shared these same thoughts
and these same concerns as a member of this Revenue Law Study Committee
as we proceeded to move forth with these deliberations. Even when it was
proposed that it is a hundred dollar level tax, not one based upon a
number of employees or other parameters that might be reasonably
established, it still would have impacted our cities in this state to a
tune of about 40, 45 million dollars. Significant implications, and the
only places these communities can go to is to increase their property
taxes. To increase their property taxes, for some small towns they’d
have to increase their property taxes so high, we’re talking about
double digits percentage-wise to make up for this revenue loss. I know
there’s been some discussion about limiting the amount of tax increase
that cities and counties can level in the future – maybe 8 percent. Well
if you’re taking this away, for some communities – some small
communities – it can have a devastating impact that, as I say, are
double digit impacts. So I really hope and trust that we will consider
what’s happening through our small towns and our larger cities as well –
our larger of an area such as Durham, Charlotte, Greensboro,
Winston-Salem, Asheville, the like – and understand that we might not be
able to hold them harmless to make up all that lost income. But moving
forward, we need to provide them with more than an idle promise that
we’ll do it in the future because unfortunately come of those promises
don’t always come to fruition, so I hope that you’ll support this
amendment today. Even if we do something after today moving forward, it
will at least give us something for the cities to fall back upon.
Something that they feel comfortable with. It doesn’t prevent us from
going further above and beyond. That we can always do. But the last
thing that we should do is just say “We’re pulling the rug from
underneath you after next year.” [SPEAKER CHANGES] any further
discussion or debate? Senator Tucker, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak to the amendment, Mr. President. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Tucker has the floor to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I, like Senator Rabin, thank Senator Ford for bringing
this forward, but I could not support the amendment because my ??
company has more than 75 employees. I don’t see the fairness in us
having to pay the thousand dollar tax the same as Bank of America or
Wells Fargo or any other large corporation, so I couldn’t support that,
and in reference to the discussion about the 65 million loss to the
cities, Senator McKissick, I submit to you that if there is a loss in
revenue, you have another choice besides raising taxes. You could reduce
your budget accordingly or not offer incentives for hotels or whatever
else they do in Durham or any other city around the state, but they
could reduce the size of their budget and still be able to operate. So
with that, I will take Senator Rabin’s suggestion that he’ll work on
this and try to offset some of the loss with consideration later on, but
I could not support this amendment. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any
further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question before the
Senate is the passage of Amendment 1. All in favor, vote “Aye”. Opposed,
vote “No”. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting and the Clerk
will record the vote. Gunn. Gunn, “No”. Woodard. 17 having voted in the
affirmative - [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister President, I need to change my
vote. I voted the wrong way. [SPEAKER CHANGES] From…? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m sorry, it should be “Nay”. [SPEAKER CHANGES] From “Aye” to “No”. 16
having voted in the affirmative and 32 in the negative, Amendment 1
fails. The bill, un-amended, is back before the body. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho, for what purpose do you
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To send forward an amendment please. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator, you can send forward your amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s on the dashboard, I believe. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho moves to amend the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President, members of the Senate. Part three of
the bill tried to, as we were trying to define who a real farmer was and
who was actually someone that is deserving of a sales tax exemption
because they’re using it in the activity of their business in farming,
we set a ten thousand dollar gross receipts average over three years,
and that works well, and I think everybody…</p>

<p id="20:00">
was in agreement with that, a problem came  up about the new farmer,
someone was just starting. So what we were able to come up with, and we
checked with members of the House to try to make sure everybody was in
line with this, was a conditional exemption for the first year. That
person would come in and tell the Department of Revenue, &quot;yes, I
need to have a sales tax exemption because I am indeed in the farming
business.&quot; They'll sign the paper, they'll get the conditional
exemption certificate for the year and then second year and third year,
even if they didn't reach the $10,000 level, say they were taking their
time getting there, as long as they showed a schedule F or something
from the Internal Revenue or the IRS tax report, they would be able to
get it for two more years and by the end of that period they should be
at least $10,000 gross. We felt that it was a way of not hurting the new
farmers and allowing them to take advantage of a sales tax exemption
which, as a real farmer, they would be eligible for. So I would urge
that members were to support this to go along with our, the rest of part
3.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate? Any discussion or debate? Hearing
none, the question before the Senate is the passage of amendment 2. All
in favor vote Aye. Opposed vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the
voting. The clerk will record the vote. Done, aye. 49 having voted in

as adopted, is back before the body.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clark, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you can send forward your amendment. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clark moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clark is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senators, currently as are constituted the bill before us would impose a
tax on cigarettes based upon the content of the e-liquid. As it's
written it would be five cents per milliliter of the e-liquid. What the
amendment does is it changes that formulation and bases the tax upon the
nicotine content contained within the liquid. And I won't bother you
about going over the formula so what I've done is I've sent you all an
email that contained the Excel spreadsheet. But it would actually
perform the calculations so that you could see the impact of that
particular formula. So, for instance, if we consider the views product,
which we have been briefed so for, given that that has about a nicotine
concentration of about 4.8% the excise tax on that particular product
would be $0.48 which is equivalent to approximately to what we have
today in terms of excise tax on a pack of cigarettes. Excuse me, it
would be $0.43. Now, let's say that R.J. Reynolds decided that they
wanted to produce a ultralight version or light version of that
cigarette, which they will probably do, so if the light version lowered
the nicotine content down to about 1.2% versus 4.8% then the excise tax
would go down to 10% for the 3 milliliter cartridge, which is less than
the 15%, I mean $0.15 that they would pay on their current product.
Let's say that R.J. Reynolds decided that they have, wanted to have use
ultralight. Okay, well then since the nicotine content would go down to
0.6% of the concentration then the excise tax would only be $0.5 for
that 3 milliliter cartridge. So, in essence, what we're trying to do
here is we're trying to draw a relationship between the nicotine content
of the e-liquid and the excise tax opposed therein. I appreciate your
supposed on this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do we have any discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To discuss the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin has the floor to discuss the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Senator Clark. I'm sure that,
again going back to our original bill and to pick particularly this
portion of the bill, that this will be, without a pun, a hot item and
will be discussed and debated in many ways in the coming, in the near
future. I would, however at this point, like to stick with our original
bill and go with what we have and then as we tweak and move forward
we'll all work together and have time to settle on the proper way to
proceed. So I will ask you, please, not to support the amendment. Thank
you.</p>

The clerk will record the vote. Twelve having voted in the affirmative
and thirty-seven in the negative, Amendment 3 has failed, the bill as

rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator you can send forward your amendment. The clerk
will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Robinson moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Robinson you’re recognized to speak to the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Chair. I appreciate the fact that in this
legislation you have done some exemptions for schools and those others
that have to depend on low fundraisers to help them do things like maybe
uniforms or school supplies or whatever the kids need, but the other
pieces of small nonprofits that really don’t have enough staff to do
anything. Maybe one person that almost volunteers and has to depend on
small fundraisers to do things like maybe the big brothers and big
sisters program that you saw here today where they have to do little
things like pay extra fees for kids at school or whatever that, and they
raise minimal amounts of money. This amendment, what it does is it
exempts those who have gross income or revenue of $50,000 or less and
you know that barely pays for a staff person, or raises no more than
$5000 in a single event, and those are minimal amounts of money but ???
protect the small nonprofits who really don’t have any revenue of their
own and have to raise a little money to support the clients they serve
so I ask for your support of this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Clark could you turn your microphone off there
please? Thank you. Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator
Rucho what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To debate the amendment please.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Rucho has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you very much for your amendment and when the
revenue laws study commission was there and we had a special group, we
were trying to clarify exactly how and who should pay sales tax. We
tried to be consistent with our approach. You have a lot of very small
businesses that are there, and just in a similar manner as what you’re
describing is, we paid specific attention to organizations that had no
paid employees and they were exempted from it like a little league team
or little league league or that manner, but it was a matter of remaining
consistent in how we’re handling the sales tax so that there was
clarify. There was a lot of confusion after the last bill and so we
wanted to bring it to the point where we were consistent and clear and
that’s why we moved in the direction that the bill before you states it
and I would urge that we oppose this amendment for the reasons of
simplicity and clarify and it will be important for each consumer and
each business to understand how to best manage it.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Senator Robinson what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To ask Senator Rucho a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Rucho do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you. Senator Rucho I’m sure that with your
experience you’re familiar with small organizations in your community
that start from Mom and Pop shops to help kids in communities and are
you aware of any that later decided that that Mom or that Pop would be a
part time person so that they could dedicate more time to that
organization?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Well it’s a matter of they were in the business of
generating revenues however they were doing it, through entertainment
and amusements and other things then they would still be required to pay
that benefit.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Just to speak again on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Robinson you have the floor to speak to the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen my point is that these
people are one step removed from being volunteers. Oftentimes they are
homemakers at home or oftentimes they are retired people or somebody
else who simply volunteers their time. They’ve moved to being a part
time person so that they can help some mission of some organization that
serves our community.</p>

and it does not look good for us to tax those things in our community
where citizens offer their time to make our society better. Often times
the things we are not funding. If they get $50,000 it probably doesn't
come from the state. It probably comes from a foundation. And then they
take their time and they try to raise a little bit of money just to have
an event so that they can help to supplement the cost of these children
or these individuals, could be elderly people, too. So I don't
understand why we could not exempt these small organizations. It does
good for our community and it helps us with the causes in our state.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This particular amendment is pretty straightforward. It deals with part
seven of the bill, dealing with these retailer contractors. For some of
you this is the section of the bill dealing with the way that home
improvements are taxed, such as dishwashers, garage doors, the like,
that type of thing. There's been a difference of interpretation that the
way Lowe's might have done it versus the way Home Depot may have done
it. I simply say that to equate you with a particular provision of the
bill that this particular amendment would address. What it simply says
is this: at this point in time our physical staff cannot estimate what
impact the bill, as drafted right now, would have on our revenues,
protected revenues. We do know that there's about 26 million dollars a
year that come in from these home improvement stores, 26 million. Now we
don't know how much we're gonna stop that income stream from coming in
by moving forward the bill as the way it is presently drafted. We could
obtain that information from retailers such as Lowe's, such as Home
Depot, and other similar type of stores if we were to get our Department
of Revenue and our physical staff placed in a position we could obtain
that information. So this particular bill would allow for a minor
tweaking to allow for that type of confidential information to be shared
with our physical staff and our Department of Revenue so that we, as
legislators, will fully know, understand, and appreciate what it means
when we move forward with this type of an amendment. We don't know what
it means today. And when I say amendment I'm referring to the change
that's anticipated through this bill that's being proposed for our
consideration. So what this particular amendment would do is say we're
gonna go back. We're gonna determine what percentage of current sales
are made at a retail level and how that tax would be generated versus a
wholesale level. We'll also look at the average difference between the
retail and wholesale prices. What does that really mean? What it means
is this: right now carpets installed, it gets taxed a retail level.
After this bill is passed it's gonna get taxed at a wholesale level.
What does it mean for dishwashers? Right now it's retail level. What's
it mean after the bill? Wholesale level. What does it mean for those
garage doors today? Retail level. After the bill? Wholesale level.
Garage door openers, the like, I could go on with a dozen of these
illustrations. We need to know, we need to understand, we need to be
able to project what our loss revenues are. When our physical staff
tells me they cannot project what our loss revenues are I get to be
concerned. Of that 26 million that's coming in today are we gonna get 10
million less? That's 10 million less that we can't use for things like
teacher's salaries or things that we might want to do, as a General
Assembly, that are important to us to meet the needs of this state in
our ongoing operational expenses. So this would basically say</p>

We're going to leave it the way it is right now. But, we are going to go
ahead and let this move forward. By, January 1 of 16, we hope to get all
this information in, we come back here in January, we can decide what to
do. Its a logical, reasonable, analytical, and appropriate way for use
to proceed. We don't know how much we're retorting our income stream
we're really neglecting our duties. When that question can not be
answered by our physical staff we ought to be real careful about walking
out here on this pier, because we don't know what we're jumping off into
in terms of that sea. We don't know what impact it's having. We've done
that to many time. Its the law of unintended consequences. We don't want
to come back here fixing six months to a year from now something that we
could thoughtfully and more appropriately address if we just waited. Let
the Department of Revenue get that information, let our physical staff
get that information. Depend upon reliable data, so that we know how
much less income we're talking about walking away from. Do we need to
fix the problem? Yes. Its a matter of having the appropriate information
available and before us, before we do so? I think that its imperative. I
hope that you'll support this amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Senators we have a leave of absence for Senator Wesley Meredith.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. President.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Barringer for floor purpose you ask?
[Speaker Change]
To debate the amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Barringer has the floor to speak to the amendment.
[Speaker Change]
This particular amendment was studied very hard, its been studied for
several years. Even before this particular session a group of
legislators with all stakeholders there over several meetings, discuss
this, worked out a good bill, a good way to move forward. We need
predictability in our business. Lowe's, and Home Depot, and many others
were at the table. These retailer or businesses need to know how to deal
with this issue and I encourage you to vote against the amendment, the
bill as it stands is good law.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. President.
[Speaker Change]
Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you ask?
[Speaker Change]
I have Senator Barringer here, a question.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Barringer do you yield?
[Speaker Change]
Yes, Sir.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Barringer, do you know the physical impact that this bill will
have in terms of the amount of decreased taxes that we will receive,
what's projected, what's approximate as a result of ?? as currently
situated and drafted?
[Speaker Change]
What I do know is it gives our businesses predictability and it gives
our economy a good stand. That's how we get taxes.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. President, can I ask a follow up question?
[Speaker Change]
Senator, do you yield?
[Speaker Change]
I yield.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Barringer, are you aware of the fact that there are actually
assessments at this time, involving some of these entities. Do you know
the extent, the magnitude of the money that's involved, at this time,
that's lost money revenues to the State of North Carolina?
[Speaker Change]
I'm sorry, could you repeat the question? I didn't hear the first part.
[Speaker Change]
Sure. Are you aware of the fact that there are pending assessment, right
now, involving these issues. Funds, which our department of revenue will
not receive. Are you aware that that is the case? Are you aware that
there will be lost income? That is income that the department of revenue
believes that they're entitled to receive. That they will not receive as
a result of the passing of this bill the way this provision is currently
drafted.
[Speaker Change]
What I am aware of is there were some businesses being assessed one way
and other business being assessed in another, and that is not fair. What
we are looking for is not picking winners or losers and not taxing one
business in one way, one business another, consumers one way, consumers
in another. This is actually a good bill for consumers, it will reduce
the tax to consumers, the people who install the refrigerators. When I
put, when you put a dishwasher in your home its good for consumers. This
is a good bill for consumers and what we're looking for is a fair, and
even, and equitable way to tax. That is the purpose of this bill. It is
long been needed attention, and I do again urge the vote of no against
this amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. President.
[Speaker Change]
Mr President, can I ask one final question?
[Speaker Change]
Senator McKissick, Senator Barringer, do you yield for another question?
[Speaker Change]
Under the stipulation that this is your final questions, Mr. McKissick.
[Speaker Change]
It will be my final question to you, Senator Barringer.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you, Senator.
[Speaker Change]
You always have to put an answer in there. Senator Barringer, do you not
believe it is a matter of good public policy if we're passing tax laws
to decrease our revenue stream to our state. That we need to be able to
accurately and approximately.</p>

Project how much decreased revenues we will have from a particular
source when moving forward with these types of changes since they can
have profound and significant implications as it relates to our overall
budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I think that it is profoundly important for us to do
tax efficiently and fairly across the board to both consumers and to our
businesses in this state so that they have predictability and they know
how taxes will be levied. Thank you sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Senator Tillman what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Senator Tillman has the floor to speak to the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Some of us seem to be worried about how much revenue
the state is going to lose, Senator McKissick. Some of you are worried
about how much revenue the state is going to lose. Some of us are
worried about how much it’s costing taxpayers.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Senators we have Senator Meredith has returned to the
chamber. We have leaves of absence for Senator Bryant, Senator Newton,
and Senator Curtis. Senator Rucho what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Just to provide a little bit more information. If
people look fiscal analysis memorandum, the net impact by this entire
omnibus bill is zero for 2014-15 and 2015-16. Zero net so there really
is no impact to the state.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Stein what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To debate the amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Stein has the floor to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Rucho’s right that it says zero but we asked
the fiscal staff how much does this one provision as it relates to
treatment of wholesale versus retail when you install it as well as sell
it and they said we don’t. It could be a million it could be many
millions, we don’t know, we can’t know because the department of revenue
cannot share us that information. All Senator McKissick’s amendment does
is say let’s know. I agree with you Senator Tillman, I’d rather nobody
pay any taxes to the state but the fact of the matter is we’ve got a lot
of important business for the state to do so when we make changes to our
revenue system it is only the most basic and sound policy that we know
what the implications are to the state going forward. We have no idea
what this is going to cost us. Are you telling me that if it costs us a
billion dollars that this is a good idea? I don’t think it’s going to
cost a billion dollars, of course not, but the point is that there’s a
price at which this a bad idea. We don’t know what this costs so for you
all to put it to us to vote on something that we don’t know what we’re
paying for when there are people that have desperate health care needs
that are not being paid for by Medicaid or teacher’s not getting a
raise? That’s what you’re asking us to do, it is bad governance. Senator
McKissick’s idea is a good idea and I encourage you to support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Any further discussion or debate? Senator Brown what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Speak briefly to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Senator Brown has the floor to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I think you can argue this point that what you will do
here is put more money in people’s pockets of which they spend and
generate more revenue. I think you can argue it that way as well. I
think the argument that you’re trying to make is that it takes more
revenue away from the state. I would argue that it would put more money
in people’s pockets who will spend more money to generate more of an
economy in the state which will generate more revenue. I guess it’s how
you look at it, I just think people with more money in their pocket will
find ways to spend it to stimulate the economy and that just creates
more revenue for the state in the long run.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Tucker what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Tucker has the floor to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Currently right now Senator Stein we sell a heating air
condition and we pay the tax on that system and we buy it at wholesale
tax and we sell it to the consumer so we don’t add any tax on to it so
we fairly remit the wholesale tax to the state. I submit to you that if
you were to change all ??? that more products would be classified as
wholesale and the state would lose money on that. We don’t charge the
consumer any sales tax on the system we put it, we just pay the
wholesale tax, that can be tracked. The other thing I’ll say to you is
that just looking at this, I know fiscal staff said they didn’t know. I
bet the department of revenue couldn’t quantify it for you or for
Senator McKissick either and the fact that they wouldn’t know what I
charge for that heating and air condition system, you’re dependent upon
me to tell you I charge $6000 for it but I only paid $3000 in wholesale
tax so it would be a very very difficult task to..</p>

… try to come back to it, and I’ll go back to what Senator Barringer
said. It is longstanding that it’s been successful, that businesses are
treated fairly and equitably and everybody pays everything across the
board, so it would create a lot of confusion now. We’d like to know
everything we do here, and we’d like to know that there’s be no
unintended consequences, but right now it seems to me the systems
working, and it would… in my business, if we had to heighten the tax and
pay out more money and charge more to the consumer, I just don’t think
that would be a good situation. Thank you, Mr. President. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President? [SPEAKER CHANGES] One second, Senator McKissick. Senator
McKissick, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask a
question of Senator Brown. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown, do you
yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown, I guess
in the argument you put forward about taxations, it sounds as if we’d be
better off eliminating any taxation at all on any of these types of
goods or appliances or services. Is that what you would favor? Because
the only thing this bill essentially says is we need to wait a couple of
months, get the data in, find out exactly what it is that through our
Department of Revenue and physical staff that we are losing as a state,
and if we get that information in so that we know how much we’re losing
as a state, at least we can make intelligent, informed decisions about
the tradeoffs that are involved, so I’m trying to understand - [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. President? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick, if you have
a question, would you ask Senator Brown the question please? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yeah, that’s the question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK, let’s take the
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Again, Senator McKissick, according to
Senator Barringer, this had been studied for quite a while. We’ve has
all the parties at the table to discuss this issue. I think you and I
just have a different philosophy. To me, I see it as a way to put more
money in people’s pockets, which will stimulate the economy in a
different way than maybe you do. I think I could argue that it may
generate more revenue for the state. You think it may take revenue away
from the state; I just don’t think that’s the case. I just think if we
can put more money in people’s pockets, they’ll spend that money in a
different way, which will stimulate the economy. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One
last follow-up, if I could. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown, do you
yield for a follow-up question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] In your opinion, Senator Brown, wouldn’t it be good for us to
have these extra funds available. if in fact we get ready to walk away
from them now, to use them for things like teacher pay and those types
of initiatives that we’re going to have difficulty funding potentially
in future years unless there’s significant revenue growth? Would that
not be a good thing to think about, look at and consider beyond the
immediate impact? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Again, Senator McKissick, this may
generate more money to do just those things, so I guess it’s just a
difference in philosophy. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question
before the Senate is the passage of Amendment 5. All in favor, vote
“Aye”. Opposed, vote “No”. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting;
Clerk will record the vote. Tillman, No. 15 having voted in the
affirmative and 31 in the negative, Amendment 1 fails. The bill as
amended is back before the body. Senator Blue, for what purpose do you
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Blue has the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
President and ladies and gentlemen of the Senate. First I commend
Senator Rucho and the Revenue Law Study Committee, those who served on
it, for I think making some commonsense changes in this bill, but I’m
reminded of an expression that even a broke clock is right at least two
times a day, and because some of the suggestions that you’ve heard on
making this a better bill make sense, even though they may have come
from the members on the back row. One that pops out at me, and one that
I mention to you because of Senator Tillman’s comments about worrying
too much about how much it’s going to cost the state as opposed to the
tax payers, is a provision here that we could easily fix in section…</p>

...five. If you want to confuse taxpayers and ?? then we switch the
system so the people who are selling tickets, admissions tickets and
stuff like that, have to report it earlier than they do now, before an
event occurs rather than after an event. I can't for the life of me see
why you're unwilling to accommodate these huge businesses in this state
- the professional athletic organizations, but also a lot of the
non-profit organizations. And so we're more concerned about extracting a
dollar from them in front of the process than allowing them to keep that
money, as Senator Tillman said, to churn other activity, and to allow
them to keep a reasonable set of books without having to create volumes
upon volumes as they report these sales, sometimes a year or half a year
before the event occurs, not knowing when they're going to have to give
refunds for them. So you create a bookkeeping nightmare for them and
you're willing to do that because the Revenue Department tells you it's
convenient for them, without any thought as to the inconvenience of
these taxpayers. And I regret that we do that in this bill, because it's
got so many good parts to it.
But the other thing that I will emphasize is that this time next year,
most of the cities will have their budgets set, just as the counties try
to do. And I'm hoping that we get out of here before July 1, but
historically that hasn't been the case. And so these cities are going to
be heading off this cliff, just one year from now, as they try to
finalize their budgets, and this legislator still probably in session,
repealing the privilege tax. Again, for the convenience of the
taxpayers, we ought to shift the burden. We ought to shift the burden
from these local government officials to us, to change the privilege
tax. We ought to let them know we're going to change it, but while we
dither around here, trying to figure out how to change it, we're not
going to adversely, negatively affect you. And you can go ahead and
start putting your budgets together knowing that we're going to change
this privilege tax. But at least they will have something they can plan
toward rather than the absolute obliteration of it.
And the last thing that I think we can substantially improve on. Senator
Clark came forth with an idea on taxing e-cigarettes. E-cigs, or
whatever they're called - since yesterday we just defined them as
&quot;not tobacco products,&quot; so I guess it's not fair to call them
a cigarette. But what we're doing, none of us - I think most of us - do
not encourage people to smoke anymore. We don't encourage them to use
these alternative forms of getting nicotine, because we know that at the
end of the day it has a negative effect on your health. But what we
ought to be concerned about is, North Carolina came to the game lately,
for good cause, in taxing cigarettes. We were the lowest state in the
Union for a long time - us and Virginia - because we manufactured them.
But we finally got into the game and we started taxing cigarettes,
realistically because of the health challenges that we know they ??. We
know that these e-cigarettes hopefully will reduce the consumption of
tobacco cigarettes. And as we do that, it erodes the revenue for the
state. So if we're going to introduce a tax on a non-desirable product,
perfect for people to use it however they want to, we have freedom of
choice, and if they want to use e-cigs they're welcome to do it. But we
ought to be thinking about how we're aligning a tax system for this
thing that's going to replace the cigarette revenue, and have a more
realistic approach to what it ought to be. Senator Clark offered you one
that measures something other than just an arbitrary five cents. You've
studied the data. We charge forty-five cents a pack for cigarettes. One
of these instruments, I think, is the equivalent of two cigarette packs.
So proportionately, we'd be charging them ninety cents rather than five
cents. But at least Senator Clark came forth with a way that you can
measure - there are other ways that you can do it. We can treat them as
other tobacco products - tax them at 12.5%. But it's looking with some
consistency in how we're trying to change this tax code, and how at the
same time we're trying to be fair to the taxpayers in this state. And I
think...</p>

He had an opportunity to do it. He decided not to do it. I wish he would
so that as we do this reform, that it’s truly reformed and we’re
adjusting the tax code in ways to benefit the tax payer, not necessarily
to benefit the Department of Revenue, and so for that reason, Mister

provisions in it, I’m going to vote against it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any

before the Senate? If not, the Chair recognizes Senator Berger for a
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Just a little
additional information as far as tomorrow’s concerned: We’re going to
adjourn to 8 am in the morning. The 8 o’clock meeting will be a skeletal
session. We’ll just come in and then take a recess so that the
committees can do their work as the day goes along, and I suspect it
will take most of the day. Your budget should be released electronically
later today and hard copies should be delivered to your office as well.
Committees will meet tomorrow – the Appropriations Committee, Finance
Committee and the Pensions Committee as the day goes along – and those
announcements will be made. But with that, Mr. President, I move that
the Senate do now adjourn, subject to receipt and referral of messages
from the House and the Governor, the introductions and referral and
re-referral of bills and resolutions, and the receipt and re-referral of
committee reports, to reconvene on Thursday May 29th 2014 at 8 am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The motion is the Senate do now adjourn, subject to
the stipulations stated by Senator Berger, to reconvene Thursday May
29th at 8 am, seconded by Senator Krawiec. All in favor say “Aye”.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, “No”. The ayes have
