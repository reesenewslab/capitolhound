Will you  join me in prayer please? Heavenly father we come before you
today to acknowledge that you are our good and great god. May we always
do that with humility. But those times do come when we are tempted to
toss humility aside. We're in this place, because we were chosen by the
people. We might reason, the electric has anointed us. We sometimes
boast to ourselves. It is during those times that we are most
vulnerable, most fallible. May we understand that the true strength that
lives in this chamber or in any other seat of human authority comes only
from out good and great god and let it flows to us only because that
good and great god is also a generous god. Lord you know the heart of
each of us. You know that we came into this place of human authority
with the best of money. Help us to understand that our motives will
remain pure, as long as we remain focused on you. I ask your blessing on
each person that serves here and on each person that is serves. And i
ask it in the holy name of our heavenly father. Amen. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of America. And to
the republic of which is stands, one nation, under God, indivisible,

please send within statute. what was the motivation we read this
recently heard discussions along the same line where saving money was
the objective. this is a one-time notice that can cover a multitude of
storage units that are going to be auctioned what what was the
motivating. I have to get back to my knife. I'm sorry I was just
prepared to present the changes from the house person pathetic happy to
equity and significant question making this into the bill must always
recognize of a demotion. thank you members of our rise to ask that we
not concur because of this section, we recently had a very long drawn
out in-depth discussion of what public is an analogue of the blade will
be in continual debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm what you would be asking members to do is divided against
concurrence, unless it looked at the motion before the houses the motor
can personally be asking members to vote against concurrence thinking
later percent nation
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
the reason I ask that we go back into conference and remove the either
proposition and leave it to the both of them have to be done is when you
go in and say they are consistent definition in statute is that it the
disposition of collateral and make three different paths, and if she
would say in one of those testers otherwise, in conformity with
reasonable commercial practices among dealers in the type of property
that is the subject of the disposition. well, one of the ways that this
particular industry advertisement itself is almost subscription website
that is not public notice, but what we're writing here within either are
you still allow them to advertise on website that people have to
subscribe to it were cutting out the tremendous number of people who get
their information as we discussed the other night through the public
notices in the newspapers, and is clarified in statute. they were
talking about the public site. Neil and I feel like where ever we start
this little slippery slope and the camel 's nose under the tea.it's just
going to run and we have to maintain and guard the integrity of our
legislation in this General assembly. therefore, I would ask that we
don't put for concurrence. thank you what purpose does the gentleman
from person County represented welcome drives the government, especially
the gym has afforded to make much like a much bigger.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
first of all, I've got a confession to make. when this bill first came
through left electronic notice the speaker
don't may continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I left electronic notice get by me. you normally use Parker God, you
know, if I went in my right mind. I wouldn't let that go, but I'm just a
missed, but I rise now to all oppose the motion to concur
when we go to electronic notices, especially in this instance, it
becomes restricted access that information, I ask you to vote not to
concur
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
members of that objection rule twelve hundred phobias suspended. what
purpose does the lady from Surrey County works in a statement draws a
countless poker members recognized victimized the second banking on a
settlement this is only changed two things.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
this is a bill we passed out with rather good notice. I would agree with
the two speakers and we got some problems with newspapers and legal
notice advertising, but to be honest. how many you ever look at the
legal notices in the newspaper. very few people day on it. we talked
about some kind of ad that's more directed at people like yourself that
are your Belfast MIB Giffords. below are talking that here's a little
legal notice the cost quite a bit of money to send out. this is not what
we're concurring about where concurring with the Senate changes, which
added to definitions that ask for your support. imagine what purposes
the Lady Carter et County represented. we characterize being on the
motion member has been ordered to make motion. I think you share on if
you will remember this one has me on BL, that we talked about what the
military was that they all wear electronic now the</p>

the easiest way for the military to be notified when they were in
Afghanistan or wherever they were. and quite frankly no self storage
units in the eastern part of the state of North Carolina are used when
the military get orders overseas where they get worse Afghanistan or
wherever they have to move out of their apartments are out of the
derricks on inadequate notice they use their self storage units, they
have to move quickly. I don't have time to leave anything other than an
e-mail address because I don't have anything other than an e-mail
address electronic know this is the proper way to notify them and please
confirm with this because this is the best way I am. I am totally for
more notice in the newspapers or our government meetings in all, I am
all about disclosure, but this is themost important in the best way to
notify our military when their things are about to be so they need to be
notified electronic notices the best way to do that. thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
what purpose of the monthly County represent  it also is become the
minimum members recognized by promotion
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
basically, one of the McElrath to share with you soon true, I will
confess a soft drink or by scavenging several years ago I found that
sometimes when you even mail notices to the military. when I received it
doesn't always get their Hotmail several packages up to young men that
we need very well and so out of the four packages didn't get there and
she's exactly correct. if it's done electronically. they will get the
notice and say for the most all of them have access to computers and a
way to get those electronic notice of the new will not get necessarily
even if it so I think you litigants is a book about to concur. I want
purposes, the general term can irrefutably derives Rosen stein 's
yields. the question is late for Surrey County or guilt of the general
and our shields. thank you, Ensign Stevens fly water under the bridge
since we first had this bill that I had been under the impression and
incorrectly that we had taken late fees, late fees out. that is the same
increase in late fees. you remember that that that that gets changed in
the negotiations with the Senate think they know it. it's not that I
think there was a discussion that we had two different issues were
working on, and we continue with one with you and not the other, but I
recall I don't remember the other specific issues. Allah is the radio
through second question, I think shields the Uruguay certain then that
you would admit. this is not yet changed by the Senate and government on
page three, lines eighteen through twenty three is again my

believe when this bill. if this chamber. he had him an amendment to the
family said it would be by electronic and male, and I think that's what
it should be. I am very uncomfortable at this stage in our electronic
close in the country of just sayingthe things can be done
electronically. everyone here knows that that's, but I don't really
think where exactly is the right spot required to be done. I do not
think we should concur. I think it should go back and it should be
electronic and male. I is the lady who might wish to profound request,

<p id="020:00">
over to the Senate. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This is for us to concur with the
Senate. We don’t have a conference report. The change that was made by
the Senate is adding a definition of, if you’ve got a copy of the bill,
it’s on the first page of the bill. 440A-40, subsection 9 and subsection
10 were added to the definition, and that is the only changes that were
made by the Senate. So this is a bill that we’ve already hashed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I ask another question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the
lady yield to a second question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] She yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well Representative Stevens, if
we don’t concur, would you be willing to see if the Senate would make
the changes that people have raised concerns about on the floor, to make
it be “both/and” rather than “either/or”, not taking the electronic out
but having it be both, and then having that be in a conference report
and let that conference report go to a committee under our rules and
then come back to the floor? Would you be willing to do that if we chose
not to concur? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well if we don’t concur, something’s
going to happen that way, but the electronic notice is only if the
lessee signs up for it at the time of contract. It’s only if the lessee
signs up for it, if the lessee chooses that as the preferred method of
communication. That’s why it’s an “or” situation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] May
I ask one more question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady yield to a
third question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do, yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] She
yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well Representative Stevens, there are two
places where they talk about the “or” for the notice, and there is one
that talks about when you’re selling stuff out of the… It’s on page 2,
lines 40 through 44, where before everything had to be in a newspaper of
general circulation, but now it’s been added “or” in another
commercially reasonable manner, and then there’s a test for why it’s
reasonably if three people show up. So that could be in play too if it
went to a conference committee. Is that not correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s correct. If I may respond further. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady’s
recognized to respond to the question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The difference
is a commercially reasonable manner can be the normal advertisement like
you have for ?? or for other things that are a larger ad. that stick out
to people, as opposed to the old manner, which was simply a legal notice
in the legal section that most people don’t look at. So this allow a
commercially reasonable manner as set forth by the UCC. The whole intent
here was to try to get more bidders to come to these sales because the
years we’ve been doing them as legal notice, nobody shows up and the
property goes for a dollar. What we’re trying to do is a more
commercially reasonable manner to get more people to the sale, and that
may be by buying an ad. space that we know is much cheaper than the
legal notice. An ad. space or another way that will solicit to bring out
those bidders, to get the greatest purchase for the property. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Just a final question, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the
member yield to a final question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] She yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] However, you could change the
word “or” to “and” and have it be both ways so that people could have
notice both in the old-fashioned way and in this new way, and then maybe
you’ll get even more than three bidders. Is that not correct? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I agree with you in some parts. I don’t think putting the legal
notice in that section’s going to bring more bidders out. I think that
is much more of a bone of contention, and I think the longer we leave
this open, the more contention we’re going to have because I think the
press association’s really been working it, and I don’t know that it’s
intended to bring out more bidders. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, just
to speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The member from Wake is
recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Or the motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well members, I think since a
couple of issues have been raised and there’s no harm in sending this to
conference to try to get them worked out, I join with Representative
Avila and Representative Wilkins and encourage you to vote no on the
motion to concur. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the lady from
Wake County, Representative Avila rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the
motion a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The member is recognized to
debate the motion a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Earlier I referenced the website. It’s
www.storageuntiauctionlist.com, and there’s commentary by the president
of the website about how they’ve established this list of storage units
and auctions and across all 50 states, and if you subscribe you can find
out where they are. Currently there are 135 in the state of North
Carolina, and one of the interesting things that he expresses here is
the problem</p>

<p id="025:00">
Too many people at storage auctions.  When there are too many people the
prices get driven up and they don't advertise it widely enough.  A lot
of belongings, personal, expensive, cheap, worthless, whatever will go
for a little bit.  I don't think that's what we want around here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  What purpose does the lady from Surry County
Representative Stevens rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  To see if Representative Avila would yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Avila, does the lady from Wake yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  The ?? is that at a national site that they feel
like too many bidders are signing up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  It's a national website that I'm assuming the
directive is that the motive behind the selling of the product is to cut
down on the number of people who know about it so they can get good
deals for a little bit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Does the lady yield to a second question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].  She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Do you realize that currently the law says we only
have to post a notice and nobody can show up at the sale and that at
least this requires there be three independent bidders if you don't go
with that legal notice?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I realize how the law is written.  I also know that
as a business owner I spend a significant amount of money in advertising
to draw people to my business and if that is the intention of this
storage unit owner, then he would spend the money that's necessary for a
successful business.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  For what purpose does the gentleman from Mecklenburg
County Representative Brawley rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I wonder if Representative Avila would yield for a
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Does the lady from Wake yield to the gentleman from
Mecklenburg?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you Representative.  You mentioned that one
had to sign up to find the notifications. Was there a fee involved with
that or subscribe I believe was the phrase you use.  Was there a fee
involved with subscribing?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  That's usually when you talk about subscription
there is a price.  I didn't go on to try to sign up so I don't know what
it was or would be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Okay, does the gentleman  wish to present a second
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  And does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  What I'm trying to discern is from your research we
became aware that these notices are not freely available but are only
available to those that pay for them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  That's what this website is about.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you  Ms. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  You're welcome.

motion to make at this time?

Whereas in December 1762, Mecklenburg County was formed from a western
section of Anson County, and named in honor of King George the 3rd's
wife, Charlotte Sophia of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Germany, and whereas
before a courthouse was built at Trade and Trion Street, court in
Mecklenburg County was first conducted on February 26, 1763, at a cabin
of Thomas Fratt, which was located in what is now Caswell and Randolf
Roads. And whereas in 1767, Lord Augustus Selwin agreed to sell 360
acres of land, known today as uptown Charlotte, to Abraham Alexander,
Thomas Polk, and John Purlhot for the price of 90 British pounds. And
whereas in 1768, Abraham Alexander and Thomas Polk where put in change
of establishing Charlotte town as the Mecklenburg County seat, an
emerging center of political power in colonial America, and in the early
years of the United States. And whereas the Mecklenburg Declaration of
Independence, the first Declaration of Independence made in the 13
colonies during the American Revolution, was adopted on May 20, 1775 in
Mecklenburg County, as honored on the great seal and flag of the state
of North Carolina. And whereas on May 31, 1775, the 27 signers of the
Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence met again to draft the
Mecklenburg resolves, which were new laws to govern the now independent
citizens of Mecklenburg county. The signers included patriots
representing the families of Alexander, Revard, Harris, and Polk, among
others. And whereas the North Carolina state Constitution approved in
1868, gave the citizens of the county the authority to elect officials
who govern them, called a Board of County Commissioners. And whereas the
Mecklenburg County Board of County Commissioners has honored the rich
history of a county by designating February 26, 2013, as the 250th
anniversary of the founding of Mecklenburg County. And whereas the
Mecklenburg County Board of County Commissioners celebrates, honors, and
recognizes the anniversary by designating calendar year 2013, as the
year of the Mecklenburg County sestercentennial celebration. Now
therefore, be it resolved by the House of Representatives, section 1,
the House of Representatives honors Mecklenburg County and joins the
residents of Mecklenburg County in celebrating the county's
sestercentennial.</p>

Section 2, the ?? Clerk of Court shall transmit a certified copy of this
resolution to the Chair of the Mecklenburg County Board of
Commissioners.  Section 3 - This resolution is effective upon adoption.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  For what purpose is the lady from Mecklenburg County
Representative arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  To speak on the Resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Member is recognized to debate the Resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker and Members.  You've just
heard how Mecklenburg County got it's start in 1762.  May 20th, however,
is very significant in the history of Mecklenburg County.  We wanted to
do this last night, and I know how disappointed you are we didn't come
in to hear this on May 20th, but I thought that probably hearing it
today you would be more receptive.  On May 20th, 1775, Mecklenburg
declared its independence from Britain and it was the first to do so.
The Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence was signed the year before
the United States Declaration and the Meck Resolve drafted on May 31st
was as significant as the Meck, referred to often as the&quot;Meck
Dec&quot;.  Mecklenburg County will go onto have first of many.  I am
very proud to live and to represent Mecklenburg County.  Mecklenburg is
a growing, diverse and progressive county.  The major industries are
banking, manufacturing and professional services, epsecially those
supporting banking and healthcare.  Mecklenburg is home to seven Fortune
500 companies.  Bank of America, New Corp, New Progress Energy, Sonic
Automotive, Family Dollar, Goodrich and SPX.  The largest employers are
Carolina's Health Care System, Wells Fargo and Bank of America.  It is a
freight railroad transportation center with twenty-five freight trains
daily.  It's the hub for the trucking industry and it's US Air's leading
hub.  Mecklenburg has expanded over the years to almost a million
people, and I would think that probably with the under count that
Mecklenburg has reached nearly a million population.  When I first moved
into uptown Charlotte, ??  in 1993, Uptown Charlotte was almost dead by
five o'clock in the afternoon, the streets were deserted.  Now it's a
very popular place.  We have many hotels, restaurants, bars.  We have
museums.  There's a lot going on in uptown Charlotte and that just
reflects on the growth of the county.  When I first started in the
legislature in 1995, my district went all the way to Huntersville,
Cornelius and Lake Norman.  Much of the speakers' district and much of
Representative Jeter's district was my district at that point.  And then
when we redrew the districts my boundaries came a little back closer
into the city and then after the most recent redistricting, I came even
more back into the city.  So that just reflects on just how much
Mecklenburg has grown over the years and we have increased the number of
Legislative Represemtatives from Mecklenburg County.  And with the
industries we have here you can see that Mecklenburg County contributes
quite a bit to the economy of this State.  I have placed on your desks a
bit of history and trivia concerning Mecklenburg County.  I know it's
probably more than you ever thought you wanted to know about Mecklenburg
County but just in case you had the need to have more, you have it at
your fingertips.  Also, In your trivia piece, you will see that Lance
crackers were started in Mecklenburg County and it still remains there</p>

In fact they are celebrating their 100 year anniversary, and my first
idea was to put crackers on your desk, and I couldn't do that. So there
is a basket of crackers back there on representative Jeter's desk and
there's crackers over here on my desk. We just want you to enjoy some of
what Mecklenburg has to offer and again I am very proud to live and
represent Mecklenburg county.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Gaston county
representative Bumgardener rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, on 433 I wanted to vote yes on
that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection? The gentleman's vote will be noted.
For what purpose does the lad from Mecklenburg county representative
Samuelson rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the resolution. Member is recognized to
debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members this is probbaly a little more of a Charlotte
thing but as one whose lived in Charlotte since I was two and since it's
in the resolution and since representative Earl brought it up I wanted
to correct a mistaken impression as to why we call it uptown Charlotte.
All my life it was uphill, and so anybody who tells you that we named it
uptown Charlotte because we're uppity doesn't know the geography, but
uptown Charlotte is uphill, it's always been uphill and the ring around
the uphill part was part downtown, and I thought everybody had an uptown
and a downtown until I got old enough to go somewhere else. So it's
uptown Charlotte cause it's uptown and if anybody ever tells you
anything else they're wrong.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Mecklenburg
county representative Brawley rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, with all due respect to representative Samuelson
there are some people in uptown Charlotte that are kind of uppity. But I
grew up in Charlotte and now I live in one of the smaller towns in
Mecklenburg, and one of the things that I never understood as a child
but as I got older I really began to realize it was the nickname. It was
always called the Hornets Nest, and I want to know why is everything a
hornets nest? Because every time I get in a hornets nest I get stung.
That was actually a name given to us by Lord Cornwallis [SP],. and he
said that Charlotte's town and Mecklenberg is a veritable hornets nest
of rebel activity, because they were very independent minded people. And
I have to admit that we still are occasionally argumentative and very
quick to assert ourselves as most North Carolinians are. Now look there,
Rodney is over there and he's agreeing with me. Right on my brother. But
we thank you for this honor today and that is also why you keep hearing
hornets as theme names, absolutely. Mr. Speaker I commend the
resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not the
question before the house is the adoption of house resolution 508, so
many have favored the passage of the resolution will vote aye, those
opposed will vote no, the clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock

the founders of the town of Wade while observing the towns 100th

[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland
county, representative Szoka rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The member is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentleman, this past weekend I went to the
town of Stedman and you might recall that you voted unanimously to honor
the town of Stedman on their 100th year anniversary. While I was there
we formally presented that and they hung it in their brand new museum
and they were very appreciative of the fact that we recognized here inn
the general assembly that their small town is special and unique and
that we took note of that. Before us today we have another two towns
from Cumberland county, my district. The towns of Wade and Lindon [SP].
Unfortunately the mayor and the commissioners of those two towns could
not be with us today which is why I ask that the full resolutions not be
read.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the house, and guests and
family in the gallery. Growing up in a small town near the Canadian
border in upstate New York back in the 1950s there was a lot of fans of
a team that was known then as the Brooklyn Dodgers. And the Dodgers, in
the 50s, had someone who was on their roster by the name of Jackie
Robinson. And Jackie Robinson was the first African American to play
Major League Baseball. He was a hero to both white and black alike. He
was recognized as a boy by me for his ability as a ball player, never
even considering growing up in the north of the racial implications of
what transpired with his being hired by the Dodgers. but, growing older
I had learned a little bit more about Jackie Robinson and what he had to
go through to endure what he did to make history and to pave the way for
others to follow in the black community. Today, we're not honoring
Jackie Robinson, but, we are instead honoring Leander Respis. Leander
Respis is a star in his own right. Or was. While Jackie Robinson got
national notoriety, there were other players on smaller stages
throughout the country that were accomplishing equal to the feat of
Jackie Robinson and other pioneers in the Civil Rights movement. Leander
Respis was one of those individuals. Think of Elizabeth City , eastern
North Carolina back in the early 1960s and the police department there
was a police department that was all white. That wasn't certainly
unusual in the south back in those days. But, they were turbulent times,
and the police chief of Elizabeth City at that time recognized that
perhaps maybe it might be a good idea to have an African American join
the ranks of the Elizabeth City police department. Now, it could not be
just any African American, it was going to have to be someone very, very
special in-
&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

Deed. For you see the chief recognized that this was a difficult
decision and it needed a very special player, and this player was going
to endure taunts from not only the white community but he was going to
be called an uncle Tom by members of the black community. As a little
sidebar the police chief that hired Sargent to become Sargent Respis
[SP], the police chief was the a man with the last name of Owens. now if
that name Owens sounds familiar to you from Elizabeth city, that was the
father of Representative Bill Owens. Mr. Respis [SP] as you heard in the
resolution was someone who education meant a great deal to him and to
his wife. Leander[SP] Respis [SP] was a college graduate, his wife she
attended college as well. In fact they as a couple raised 10 children
and all of those children are college graduates. All of them excel in
their respective disciplines. $44.00 a week, in 1963 that was the salary
of a beat officer in Elizabeth City. Now Leander Respis [SP], when he
came on the force he agreed to do this at 46 years of age, he entered
the police department and was given a stick to carry. He didn't have a
gun, they weren't quite sure yet how this was all going to work out. So
out on the beat he goes carrying a stick. Well the amazing thing is that
ti was a very short time thereafter that we was issued a weapon and it
was because of the great admiration and respect that he earned from not
only those in the white community but those in the black community as
well. This man was a healer. He attracted people like a magnet, they
liked him, they respected him. He was fair in the way he handed out
street justice, which is often much more difficult than that we see in
the courtrooms. He was a student of human nature. He knew the difference
between right and wrong and he exemplified those differences not just on
the Elizabeth city police department but within the ranks of his
wonderful family as well. Several weeks ago at the museum of the [??]
and Elizabeth city, marvelous edifice, there was a celebration honoring
this great man. He left us back in the late nineties, and I was honored
and privileged to be in attendance that day and to be able to sit and
listen to people speaking about this man and about his family and
sharing some very personal details, and police officers sharing some of
their stories that only police officers can tell to one another. And my
jaw just continued to drop and drop and drop and I thought, oh my god,
I'm not just here for an event, I am here honoring an American hero.
Well you see, that's what this man was, was an American hero. We are a
nation...</p>

I have a little bit different story with regards to the respice family
because I ws in school with a number of his children. I spoke to the
daughter this morning and she shared some interesting things with me
about her gradnfather. During the time I ws in the city between 59 and
63 and as you know during that time was civil unrest in the city of
elizabeth city that is where the university is located. I was apart of
the sit ins that took place and I can just imagine that someone in
charge of law enforcement knew the importnce of integrating the city
police dept in a time like that. So mr respice was tapped and he was
placed ther as a beacon for the black community. He would tell you right
quick that there was no black or white in his eyesight. THat is was all
blue. A group of black citizens met to about mr repsice accepting the
position due to the fact due to the fact that he was not allowed to
carry a gun. He responded to a concerned citizen &quot;Once I am in, I
believe I can change that&quot; nd with only a nightstick and a badge of
courage he took to the streets. And blessed with the shill of gods
favor, he changed the community and he was respected by all. HE became
captain oline leary stated Respice stressed there is no black or white,
only blue. HE also stressed never to do anything to tarnsih or
disrespcet the badeg. He was a family man who stresed the importane of
integrity and education. Having ten children to attend colege, 9

because in fact we did not legally pass this on third reading on Friday
it was a roll call bill I got a call from Mark Los Rios of weeks hereby
halfway been Thursday afternoon saying this is roll call bill. we could
not pass on third reading Thursday and therefore that's the only reason
you see it, and I think we've had unanimous support on this every time
we voted on it so far. I would ask you to give me unanimous support on
it. once again, I want purposes, the gentleman from Craven County

I thought it was a pretty good bill and as part of a section in it that
said that the General assembly would have to have any tolls but at some

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't think that is a good idea to leave it in DOT 's hands as to
which roads get told in which roads don't think that's why we were sent
up here to make those types of decisions and I don't think that we
should abdicate our positions by turning it over to an unelected
bureaucrats to make those decisions for us. I think DOT is that it is a
defined position obviously to go out and look at the roads to determine
which ones should be told to get public input to do all the legwork, but
once I've got everything together. they need to present it to us to
ensure that we up the body of elected representatives stand for that, on

one of the ones coming up at Wheaton we can fund was coming up through
the gas access planet. we can't want to make hotlines and what if you
slide through North Carolina, where Florida and pay for it, that's fine
as well. that's not my concern do think that my collective Bob, my

just prevent the conversion of free lines tall lines. it prevents any
toll lanes from happening at all without a vote of the General assembly
that means this bill proposes or pretends to be a bill to protect us
from runaway bureaucrats what it actually does is cut part of the heart
out of HB eight seventeen. the reform bill that we passed in this body

there are additional protections, I really like the genius of Rep.
Collins's bill, he's basically saying &quot;if you've got free lanes,
you keep the free lanes.&quot;  Those are not in jeopardy. But if you
want more lanes, this is a way you can pay for it without having to
raise a bunch of taxes. Now here in Wake county, we have the one
operational toll road. It's a $2 billion project, of which we have put a
billion dollars in the ground. The largest road project in the history
of this state. We don't need to come back and impede that, in fact
thankfully, in the transportation bill, we took the impediments off of
that project so that it can move forward, so we can finish our
investment that we have made. It's not only gonna help Wake county, it's
gonna help all of eastern North Carolina and the whole state for that
matter. So please, I respect the gentleman's intent, but this will harm
our ability to finish the largest road project in the history of this

don't want one you don't have to have one.  But don't impede us from

Speak on this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
I would like to speak in support of this amendment because I don't
understand the argument that &quot;if we don't do the toll lane we can't
have the road&quot;, that's just allowing people to say &quot;let's
build this toll road&quot;, and when the voters question us about it,
we'll say we couldn't help it. And as far as the last comment, the
people in the county where I live have been hearing we- They've been
saying &quot;we don't want a toll road&quot;, but they've been hearing
&quot;you're gonna get one anyway&quot; for a long time. And so I don't
understand if a toll road is so absolutely necessary and it has to be
done and it can't be done any other way, why we can't come back and have
a vote on it and the General Assembly say &quot;Okay, put a toll
there.&quot; or wherever it is you need it. And so I am in support of
this amendment, thank you.

Thank you sir.
I had problems with the tolling language in 817, and talked to some
other members and they basically said &quot;well, that's going to be
taken care of in 267. And so on that basis I was gladly able to vote for
817 because it had a lot of stuff in it that I liked, except for the
tolling stuff. And so the other day when we voted on 267, I didn't
realize that language had been taken out, and so I went ahead and voted
for it because I thought it was going to help slow down or stop the
tolling, but I would not have voted for 267 if I had known this was in
there at the time the other day. I just missed it somehow. So I'm glad
to say that Rep. Speciale's trying to put it back in, so I support him.
I hope you'll vote for this amendment so I can vote for this bill again.

before the General Assembly, if you want a toll road in your district,
it'll let you vote for it.  But those uf us who don't want a toll road,
this amendment will let us try to stop it. I urge you to vote for the

You know, those of us who lived all of our lives in North Carolina have
heard an awful lot about our road system, and at times we brag about it
and say we're the &quot;good road state&quot;, other times we would be
riding along while potholes were tearing up our tires and saying
&quot;What's going on in Raleigh?&quot;. It seems to me, in the last
little while we've seen some progress here in Raleigh particularly with
the bill that Rep. Collins worked on, and I'm impressed that he's put
together something that will work, that will get us going in the right
direction again. And we'll recognized that we've got some- gotta be
innovative in the ways we address the future. The future is not all in
toll roads. There's a lot more involved to building roads than just toll
roads. But that's a part of the puzzle. And I have faith in this General
Assembly that if the people we give the responsibility through the
legislation we've done this time, if they don't do their job the way we
like, we'll be talking to</p>

told you not to do it. if you do it anyway will ditch and I would
anticipate legislative action to correct that if that consultation, but
I think a more experienced representative than myself could probably
answer that question better, should one be willing to volunteer to his.
I will say that if I'm a member of that committee and a proposal comes
in. that does not make sense and I think is not in the best interest of
North Carolina and I advised against it,and it happens anyway. I would
be willing to introduce a bill to stop in the next

questioning whether or not I was debating another bill that was is a
very clear connection because the language that we either vote up or
down in this amendment is going to be controlled by what is in eight

behaves us to think very clearly about the kind of action that we're
going to be able to take in case there is a disagreement in what comes
before us from all of the analysis sentiment that David is put before

Long as the following conditions are met. And what we’re putting in
there is one of those conditions that the authorities directed to
collect the tolls on the existing interstate highway by an act of the
General Assembly. I, I cosponsored this bill. I thought it was good
bill. Okay we all have our reservations with, most of us have our
reservations with tolls and this and that. But the bottom line is we
have to, we have to look at all the options in any ways that we can to
improve our roads, way of raising revenues this and that. This tolling
is, is another option. And, and I don’t have a problem with that. But I
do want to make sure that before we start tolling even additional lanes
on roads that the people have already paid for, that we’re doing it
because that’s what we the elected representatives of the people intend
to do. And that’s what this is all about. And as far as I’m concerned
this amendment is, is not about tolling or not tolling. It’s about not
abdicating our responsibility to the people to make those tough
decisions. And they are tough decisions. And I, I have no problem going
on record with any of the decisions that I make. And I hope that nobody
in here has problems going on record with any of the decisions that they
make. And I ask you not to abdicate your responsibility and please vote
for this amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McElraft please
state you purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] When I came in here I had promised Representative Speciale I
would vote for this amendment. And I, I thought because it was in the
original bill that I would. And then I’ve started thinking about what
the original bill said and what the bill says now. And the reason I
wanted to stop tolling is because of I-95. I did not want the people
that use I-95 to get to the beaches to have to pay a toll. I love the
bill the way it is now. I love the fact that those who want to travel
faster are gonna pay for that fast lane. They’re gonna be the ones to
pay for it. But those who don’t want to pay for it are gonna have three
free lanes to go down there. So we have actually accomplished exactly
what I wanted with the no toll lane. Yet we’ve also found a way to find
another lane that others will pay for because they want to go quicker
down the road. So I think that that accomplishes what my people, the
people that I represent wanted with the no toll lane. So I will be
voting against [CROSSTALK] Representative Robert Brawley please state
you purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ask the representative a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Elraft, does the lady yield? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative do you understand one of reasons this is such an issue
with me is because it was agreed that I-95 would not be tolled. They
would toll I-77 which is in my district? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I only
represent my district. I’m sorry. I would like to further explain, may I
talk for the second time [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And I also see an issue with 95 because we have so
many different opinions all the way down with Representatives. So when
you leave it up to people in the General Assembly you might have one
opinion down in Lumberton area on 95 and a different opinion in, in the
upper area of 95 and then you’ve got Representatives fightin’ each
other. We need to leave that to the DOT. Now that we have our free lanes
I think we have taken care of the people that we represent. And I hope
we can take care of your people too. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I ask Representative Robert Brawley a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Robert Brawley does the gentleman
yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley you said about somebody
has told someone that I-95 would not be tolled. I, I have not heard that
from anybody. Could you please expound at that and please say who, who
told whom that I-95 would not be tolled if this bill passed? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I can expand upon it. It’s not part of this issue. If you
really want me to. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Speaker spoke to the trucking association and told
them that I-95 would not be tolled. And then shortly after that we
started hearing about I-77 being tolled. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
