call the meeting to order, please take your seats. welcome too members
of the committee, welcome to the guests of health and human services
committee into the peoples house. we will be discussing house bill 695
family faith and freedom protection act. the bill is still in the senate
clerks office and has not been sent to the house as of yet. normally
when a bill is sent to the house for concurrence, it does not go to a
committee but directly to the floor for a vote. house leadership feels
that the bill should be heard in committee. a notice was sent out last
friday announcing todays committee meeting. senate bill 553, originally
scheduled for this morning, will be heard 15 minutes after session later
on this afternoon. the meeting room for this meeting was changed to this
room to accommodate more guests to the committee and to allow 2 hours of
discussion instead of 1 hour. overflow is in room 421. the format this
morning, the bill sponsors will present the bill, secretary Bosch and
Rextel Prat from the department of health and human services will speak.
there will be discussion among members of the committee.I'll recognize
representatives of various organizations who may address the committee,
there will be a time limit of 3 minutes and there will be a 1 minute
notice of time remaining. if we have time i will be happy to recognize
members of the general public to speak as well. the committee will
follow house rules. decency of speech shall be observed and disrespect
to personalities carefully avoided. emotions on todays issue run high on
both sides. the chair welcomes everyones input and asks that guests
respect everyones right to their opinion. i will now recognize the
sponsors of the bill to come forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
thank you mr chairman members of the committee, guests. I'm sorry we're
just catching up. what i would like to do since this is the health
committee and not the finance or anything else i want to just go through
the portions of the bill in detail that are new and not the portions
that we had before but I'll go really quickly over it because i tend to
be one of those people who reads the table of contents before i read
everything else so from a table of contents standpoint the first section
starts on page 1 line 21 is actually the bill that we had already passed
on foreign law, the sponsors of that were representative Chris Whitmire,
Jacqueline Schaffer, George Cleveland, and Larry Pittman and i think
some of them may be here but we've already covered that and that does
not pertain to this committee because there's nothing directly health
related to that one. then if you flip forward to page 3 line 16 this is
the part that had also already been through here it does have a health
part to it but we had already covered that when it came through the
committee the first time, this is whats called the health care
conscience protection act, that was the part that was sponsored
representative Jacqueline Schaffer, Rena Turner, Debra Conrad, and Susan
Martin. I do believe all 4 of them are here. and so we prefer not to
bring that back up becuase once again that one has already been through
this committee and passed. then if you will advance to page 4 line 13
this is also a portion that has already been through this committee and
passed our chamber, this was titled the clarify law to prohibit sex
selective abortions, this goes back to the piece about, we don't want to
be doing abortions for the purpose of sex selection. the sponsors on
that were myself, representative Samuelson, Pat McElraft, Jacqueline
Schaffer, and Rena Turner, and I believe all of them are here. so all of
those portions, all the way up until you get to page 5 line 35 are all
portions that we have already covered in the house and most of them
through this committee so those were not the elements that we want to
bring up to look at for this committee today. where we will start is on
page 5 line 35 and i will have staff go through it but i wanted to ask
the senate sponsor, would you prefer to give your comments now or let
staff go over the details on that part first.

Something that had come up was, does this imply that they have to come
back for every dose? Interestingly, the manufacture of the medication,
prescribes that all three of those doses, if you end up having to have
three, be done in the presence of a physician. I thought that was
something I would be happy to give people copies for of the drug . . . I
can't pronounce these things, M-I-F-E-P-R-E-X, which is the drug that is
used for that, and the prescriptions that they use for that. So, that
does address the fact, that yes, its already required that they come
back for those. Then, the other thing, I think that Senator Daniels
actually mentioned, in a way, is how long its been since the rules were
changed. I had a conversation with someone who used to run an abortion
clinic in the 80s, when you had to get a certificate of need and needed
surgical care license requirements. So, I do think that things have
changed. They've gone from one side to another side. It may be time to
consider, figuring out in todays world, how do we need to be doing this.
I think secretary ?? has some questions and comments on that, if you
would like to recognize her.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Okay, Secretary ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Representative. Since, we recently
at the department are aware of this bill. Our department has been
reviewing the proposed legislation and still much uncertainty remains.
In just a moment I would like our staff to address the uncertainty of
these bill. Present is Drexell Pratt, who is the Division Director of
Health Services Regulations and Ozzie Conley, of Human Service
Regulations, who oversees and survey's these clinics. They are available
to address concerns and any questions that you may have. Now, as the
Governor said, yesterday in his press conference, we need to ask serious
questions about our current regulations. Are the regulations that we
presently have sound? Are they reasonable? And, are they being enforced?
Unfortunately, on these issues the experts in the Department of Health
and Human Services where previously not asked for their input. I would
like to take this opportunity to thank the committee for giving us this
opportunity to provide some input. The Department of Health and Human
Services and the Governor agree with parts of the bill. Such as, the
ability of the health care providers to exercise their moral, and
religious, and ethical beliefs. We also agree on the need to increase
education for expecting mothers. But, the Governor and the Department
agree, and we agree on the importance of health and safety for the woman
of North Carolina. But, there are other parts of the bill that are far
more complex and require further discussion and clarity prior to passing
of this bill. In particular, the section 6 provisions about the changing
standards for the certification of the clinics. The experts and the
professionals at DHHS, believe that some of the most consequential ways
we could improve the health and safety to woman would really be to
dedicate resource to provide more frequent, regular inspections and to
review our existing regulations. In the process of reviewing the present
bill, we discovered that regulations for safety have not been updated in
our department since 1995 and to our knowledge, there has been no study
on how to improve safety in the clinics in North Carolina. One of the
biggest regulatory challenges facing our department, is how infrequently
we are able to conduct regular inspections of the clinics. The acute
care licensing section of DHHS has 10 full time staff, who survey
hundreds of facilities across the state, including general acute
hospitals, abortion clinics, ambulatory surgical care centers, dialysis
centers, and psychiatric hospitals. All this done by 10 people. As a
result, DHHS, is only able to inspect the medical component of abortion
clinics every 3 to 5 years. Now, for those that disagree with any new
rules and regulations, this is unrealistic. As medical science advances
we constantly have new information. We must review our rules</p>

Rules and regulations, and we must become current. We have gaps in our
existing rules. We must take this opportunity to thoroughly review what
is in place and decide how best to improve our policies. I urge you to
follow the Governor's advice and leadership and spend more time studying
these issues and how North Carolina can best improve the health and
safety for everyone. I would like now to request Drexel Pratt the
Director of Health Service Regulations to speak. Mr Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Pratt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. DHS has some
technical concerns as mentioned centered on part 6 of the bill amendment
to Men and Women's Right to Know Act. First off let me say, I know it
has been addressed briefly here this morning, we at DHHS we do not have
authority to regulate physicians in the practice of medicine. We don't
do that. We do report incidents where physicians we believe have done
something that may have lead to the harm of injury of a patient. So we
do report those. But in section 6A, discusses a physician being present
during an abortion procedure or administration of medication. There's
several areas of this section where it is unclear from a regulatory
perspective what is intended to occur. First, on the surgical abortion
issue, which is referred to in lines 46 to 48 of the page 5, the term
&quot;during the performance of the entire abortion procedure&quot; is
not defined. It could mean just a surgical procedure or it could include
all aspects of the abortion procedure from the initial procedure work up
through recovery. Additionally, it is unclear term &quot;physically
present&quot; means what exactly is required. These are terms that we
need to understand. What was intended so that we can properly assess
what is going on in these clinics. Second, the requirement to have a
physician physically present in the same room during the administration
of a drug or a chemical, which we've heard about already, to induce an
abortion which is on pages 5 and 6 line 48 and 2 could be interpreted to
mean present during administration of all drugs or chemicals to complete
the medication abortion procedure or it could be interpreted that the
physician would only have to present during the administration of the
initial drug or chemical as this is inducing, as the bill requires,
phase of the medication.  As standard drug procedure, three doses has
already been mentioned approximately three days apart with the abortion
procedure generally finishing 4 to 5 hours after the last dose though it
may take up to several days after the last dose. This regulation could
be interpreted to mean that the woman would have to return to the
facility to get the physician to administer the follow-up dosages. This
is not standard medical practice currently in other circumstances. The
HHS does not have information at this time to determine whether this
would actually improve safety. DHHS was not charged in the bill to write
rules for section 6A because that falls under other's regulatory
authorities, however, as mentioned earlier regulation can cite
non-compliance with these matters if it is determined that the violation
has resulted in a threat to the patient's health and safety. The DHSR
also has technical concerns with section 6C in the bill which requires
the department to amend the rules for abortion clinics to similar to
rules of ambulatory surgical centers. The key phrase that lacks
definition is &quot;similar to,&quot; and the rule development process
DHHS will have to define &quot;similar to&quot; and have documentation
to support that definition. It is likely this rule will (as you are
familiar with the 150B process) it is likely this rule will receive 10
layers of opposition before the rules review commission and be sent back
to the general assembly for further action. Before it can actually be
enforced. As an example quality assurance measures are required for
ambulatory surgical centers, but it is unclear whether they would be
required for abortion clinics under this regulation. In addition, the
language asks for the department to ensure that standards for clinics
are similar. This could be interpreted that any change pertaining to an
ambulatory surgical center would require revision of the abortion clinic
regulations as well. Further it is unclear which of the requirements of
license of ambulatory surgical centers this bill intends to be applied
to for abortion clinics. The mandates that it be similar but then goes
on to specify two requirements that DHHS adress...</p>

the rulemaking process a few years ago, people are still adjusting to
it.  We also have new staff in the departments who are also adapting to
our rules making process.  The Senate worked with staff, sent over what
they thought was clear definition particularly using the comparison to
the ambulatory care centers that would provide the type of coverage that
the Department needed and says they were willing to accept to rewrite
the rules.
We are realizing as we met with them, that there may need to be more
clarity, we are not exactly sure so the Senate and the House are willing
to continue working with you all on figuring out how to make, if the
language is clear, okay, then let's work with it.  If the language needs
to be clarified, then let's figure that out but I wanted Senator Daniels
to comment on that but we are in agreement that the goal is safety, the
goal is not to shut down clinics and we will work with you all to figure
out how to do that in the best way.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Samuelson and Mr. Chairman.  I appreciate the
Secretary's remarks and I look forward to working with you to improve
the contents of this bill and to give further clarity for your
department.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Secretary ?? did you have anyone else that wished to speak over there?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just for questions since we have the person who really goes to the
clinics to regulate it if there was a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you.  I will now open up discussion among members of the
committee and to start off with, I want to keep the discussion among
members of the committee somewhat brief because I want to spend a lot of
time to hear from the public and with that, we will go ahead and start.
Representative Insko.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to make a brief statement and then I have
some questions for Dr. ?? or Mr. Drexall.  One of the favorite old
sayings my parents often said to me is actions speak louder than words
and I think there is a lot of evidence that the intent of this bill is
not primarily to protect the health and safety of the women.  I
appreciate the comments that have been made, I think this is very
helpful what we are hearing, but there are so many examples of what has
been done this year that would really undermine women's health and
access to reproductive health.  Denying the expansion of Medicaid is an
example
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, a point of order.  I believe in this discussion she is going
far afield of what we are anticipating discussing; she is going into
other bills and things that have been passed and she is impuning the
motives of what Representative Samuelson just said.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stevens,the point is well taken
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Wait a minute, Representative Insko. We will give some latitude to
members of the committee for now, please continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you and let me just say that I don't perceive that when someone
disagrees with me, that they are impuning my motives.  We have
disagreement among, in a democratic society is very important, no one
has all the answers, it is very
important to have open and free discussion and try to resolve
differences cordially and that is my intent.  I do want to add that this
specific issue regarding access to women's health for pregnant women
would deal with the proposal to remove women from Medicaid who were
between 130 and 185 percent of poverty so that did actually direct
impact on women's health care.  The comments that I have, the questions
that I had for Dr. ?? or Mr. Drexall are, you mentioned the cost to
build an ambulatory care center, you didn't comment on the cost to
operate one and have you had a chance to look at the cost between
operating an ambulatory care center and a current abortion clinic?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, Representative, we have not looked at the cost of operation; what we
were trying to look at was the physical plant cost of actually
constructing a facility that meets the requirements similar to or equal
to an ambulatory surgical center and that is what these costs were based
on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I have just 2 or 3 more questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One follow up
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can you tell me of the abortion clinics that we have, how many have no
findings against them regarding safety or regarding impairment</p>

Mr. Pratt. If I may, I'd like Ms. Azzie Conley to answer those
questions, since she's in charge of the inspection

Based upon
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ma'am, excuse me. If you would identify yourself for the Committee
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes I'm Azzie Conley, I'm the section chief for the Acute and Home Care
Licensure and Certification Section within the division of Health
Service Regulation. In regards to the question, at this point, we do not
have a clearly defined time frame. If we were looking over an extended
period of five to ten years, it would be safe to say that each of the
abortion clinics have had some type of deficiency or violation of the
regulations. In regards to whether or not it would meet the definition
of clearly a safety issue or a true quality of care issue, we would need
to do a review of our data to come back with a final answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can I make just one comment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Briefly, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And that is that I do agree that if you really are interested in
protecting the health and safety of the women, the best way to do it is
to increase the inspections of the clinics.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jones.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity to just briefly
comment and perhaps steer the discussion back toward the actual content
of the bill. I would like to reiterate, as one of the chairs of this
committee, and I have been inundated with all kinds of interest
regarding this bill from folks probably both in this room and around the
state for the last few days. And it's interesting how much focus and
discussion there has been on the greater issue of abortion, in you will,
and how little of the discussion has actually focused on the contents of
this bill. ?? That really is what we're here to discuss and I would,
once again, point out the unusual nature of the meeting that we're
having here today. I would once again point out that the vast majority
of the Senate PCS, the House Bill 695, has already passed this house
after quite lengthy committee discussion and floor debate. It has been
pointed out that those sections have to do with foreign laws with no
sex-selective abortions and with health care conscious protection. We've
already covered all that ground pretty thoroughly. I would point out
that the purpose of this discussion is to give the members the
opportunity to discuss those portions of this particular bill that the
House members have not previously discussed. And I would again point out
that this is quite an unusual step. Generally when a bill comes back
from the other body for a concurrence vote, it goes straight to the
floor. We don't have such an occurrence as this but I would point out
that there was 4 day's notice for this meeting and here we are today,
having this discussion. So what do the new sections of the bill cover?
The new sections of the bill simply provide that doctors must be present
during the abortion procedure. Furthermore, we are requiring the
abortion providers to meet some minimal standards. To something similar
to what other health care providers such as ambulatory surgical centers
have to do. The question of cost just came up. I don't see anything in
the bill that says that we are proposing new ambulatory service centers
to provide abortions. But i do think it's important that we have some
minimum health care standards and it's not unreasonable to require that
these clinics would have the same reasonable standards that these other
surgical centers would have. Mr. Chairman, I would point out that most
people that call themselves pro-choice on the abortion issue say that
they want for abortions to be safe and rare. I would say that the new
sections of the bill are all about that. They're all about fairness and
equal treatment for these woman patients by securing basic health and
safety standards. I would hope that we could all agree that all surgical
centers should have the same standards of safety and that no health care
patient should be subject to sub-standard health care facilities. A
surgery center should not be allowed to have lower safety standards just
because all the patients are women or because the procedure involved is
abortion. I believe that we need to demand the same level of safety at
women's surgery centers as we would for any other surgery center. I

more suggest that there not be any special treatment or loopholes for
these particular women's clinics. We have heard already and it's been
pointed out in the news that recent events in our state at various
abortion clinics are clear examples that we need to make improvements to
ensure safety for all these women. It's been pointed out that just in
the past couple of months one abortion clinic in Charlotte was shut down
by DHHS due to the improper administration of drugs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, Ms. Chair, point of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] President Baskerville.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That has absolutely nothing to do with the content of
this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I disagree, I disagree.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I continue? Thank you, Ms. Chair. I believe that
we're talking about improving the safety standards of clinics in North
Carolina. I would submit humbly that when clinics in our state have to
be shut down because of improper safety standards that perhaps that
relates to the contents of this bill. I would just cite that even this
past week we've seen another abortion clinic in Durham have to be shut
down for lack of quality control procedures. So I would conclude my
remarks and just say that I would hope that whether a person identifies
himself as pro-life or they favor the choice of abortion on demand that
they would want any women's clinic in this state to be held to the
highest safety standards. I believe this is a common sense approach. I
believe it's in the best interest in the better health of the citizens
in our state. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insko.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I ask Representative Jones a question just for
clarification?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones, I'm assuming and I don't want to
assume. I want to know whether or not you actually favor the ambulatory
surgical center standards for abortion clinics. That would be helpful
for me to know that. I've heard Sec. ?? talk about maybe some more
regulations but not to meet that standard and so I'm curious about your
position on that issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insko, I have to admit that I'm a
little bit still confused about some of the comments that I heard
earlier. I do agree with what Sen. Daniel and Rep. Samuelson said. I
believe that the supporters and the sponsors of this legislation are
certainly willing to work with the administration as far as any
language. Quite frankly I think you could go in and make an inspection
of every abortion clinic in North Carolina at 5 o'clock every afternoon
and I'm not sure that you're going to answer all the questions that this
bill provides for. For instance, is it reasonable to require that a
doctor actually be present during the procedure. I believe that it is.
Now that might be . . . you may disagree with that. But quite frankly I
don't know how that 5 o'clock inspection is going to guarantee that that
happen. So I think that's a good provision. I think it's reasonable to
have the Department of Health and Human Services allow resources to be
available on their website so that women can get more information. I
think that's reasonable. You see, when I received the emails that I
received this week from my constituents and I actually engaged those
folks on the contents of the bill, I didn't get any answers back and I'm
still looking for some of those answers. So I think the specific
provisions of this bill are good. I think if there's technical changes
that need to be made in language so that everybody can follow it, that's
a good thing. Furthermore, I'm not really sure how I can further answer
your question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Earle.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I've got a question for staff and then a
comment. On page 6, section 6C, could you kind of tell me what some of
the requirements will be that, I guess, are currently now in place for
the ambulatory centers. Could you tell me some of the requirements,
please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms. Johnson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I can go through some of the current requirements for
the ambulatory surgery facilities. The bill indicates that the role</p>

<p id="040:00">
This would need to be similar, and so given that the roles do not exist
at this time I can't specify how exactly this will correlate with the
certifications of ?? of abortion. There are several regulations ranging
anywhere from what information has to be on the application for a
license are, the minimum standards for construction and equipment
including building code requirement that involve plumbing, HVAC,
electrical things among those lines, they also have sanitation
requirements, and specific requirements for their operating ??.
Adjacently there are ?? through this quite a few with plumbing and
electrical. They also contain regulations involving medical records, the
itemization of charges, personal records, laboratory services,
medication and anesthesia regulations as well as radiology and
pharmaceutical services.
Regulations go into details involving house keeping and quality
assurance, and then the nursing administration on their staff. Some of
those topic areas are already covered with ?? for clinics of abortion as
well, but those are specific topics for the ambulatory ?? facilities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you, I guess my point is that I have gotten
some correspondence from different places and some of what are received
say that they would have to make adjustments to the parking lot, to the
surgical sinks, to the colors of the paint used, and I am fine to figure
my mind how this has anything to do with the safety for women, and it
has more to do with limiting access because also I am hearing that all
of the facilities would be closed with the exception of one. So, to me
it is quite clear that we are talking about more about access anything
else, and I would just like to quickly address some of what I have heard
already about the doctors being present. Will you know we allow home ??
where no doctor has to be on site at all.
So, I am thinking that having a baby is one of the most serious health
issues that women could experience, and we allow that without having
doctors available, and it seems to me like the process of inspections of
these facilities is working. If we have got to that's been closed
because of violations then I think that that process is working. We just
need to give the department the resources to do on a more regular basis,
and I think they could do a better job, and when we talk about safety, I
want us to be very clear that if we close this facilities, we are
talking about sending women back to the backroom kinds of places that
used to exist because if a woman wants to have an abortion, she is going
to have an abortion, and I would prefer women having a place to go that
is a let's say the sanitary, and I think that's what we need to be
concerned about in that sending women back to unsanitary, substandard
backroom conditions where folk that are not trained, and I would just
like to say that I think this bill needs more study, it needs to be
looked at, and I think we just need to send this certainly not tested it
out it here as it is. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: I would ask the members of the committee to keep
their points brief. I want to make sure we get to members of the public
and so at 11 O'clock which is seven and half minutes we are going to go
to the members of the public. Representative ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you Mr.chairman, I try to be very first allot a
red hearing is being thrown out, and ?? men and ?? women and stuff
thrown out. I would just like to sheet one down very, very quickly.</p>

And that's this whole business of Medicaid expansion, has absolutely
nothing to do with women's health whatsoever. Pregnant women are covered
up to 185% of Federal poverty now, that's more than the Obama Medicaid
expansion covers, so it's a complete red herring, it has nothing to do
with pregnant women, or women with children and the like. It has nothing
to do with children, it has nothing to do with breast cancer coverage
and cervical cancer coverage it goes up to 200%. Those folks are already
covered by Medicaid now, currently, so if people would kindly get off of
that, or get their facts straight. I would like to ask Mr. Prax just a
very quick question on this matter of regulation, and my question is
this, and I'm trying not to be too pejorative, but I don't know any
other way to ask it, and that is, if the clinics, for example, the
clinic that's been mentioned in Charlotte, and the most recent clinic
that was closed down in Durham, had they been required to have a higher
level of certification or licensure, or higher level of standards, isn't
it fair to say that those facilities, maybe wouldn't have had to have
been closed down, had they had to adhere to some higher level of
operational standards and regulations? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Dollar. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Representative Dollar,
the two clinics that you mention were actually cited and closed for
existing rule violations, to say that additional standards, I would be
unsure whether that would make any difference because there were already
standards in place that affected those particular clinics, and that was
what was used to actually close those facilities. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just
one quick follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right, but the standards and procedures and what you have to do in order
to operate something on the order of an ambulatory surgical center is
far greater than what is required under the certification that, for
example, the clinic in Durham was supposed to be operating under, is
that not correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely [SPEAKER CHANGES]Is that
correct?[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Absolutely. The
requirements are much more stringent in an ambulatory surgical center
than is currently in an abortion clinic.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Farmer-Butterfield. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. They say if you listen long enough, a lot of your
questions have been answered and comments made, but I do want to comment
to the department that I genuinely appreciate your assessment of this
bill, and what it means to your department. I think it's honorable, I
think it's good to have people to come forward and actually state facts,
and that's what we need here. It's a very important issue. My question
is, first of all, what procedures specifically apply in this bill to
ambulatory surgical units? I think that's already been alluded to, but I
want the bill sponsors to talk specifically about what they had in mind
when they proposed this legislation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Farmer-Butterfield, who  is your question addressed to? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The bill sponsors. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Daniel or
Representative Samuelson. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Restate your question,
please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Which procedures or regulations specifically
did you have in mind to apply to this bill from the ambulatory surgical
centers. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If you'll notice, the language doesn't say
they have to do it exactly the same in every way, it gives them, through
the rules-making process, to determine similar, standards that are
similar to those for licensure of ambulatory surgical centers. In the
rules-making process, they would look through and decide which of those
pieces need to be similar, and which ones aren't, and what go through
that rules process. So that's not our job, as one and not that one, they
would look and say &quot;here's what you got for ambulatory care, here's
what we're doing in an abortion clinic, how do we bring that up to the
same sort of outcome and the same sort of provision on that?&quot; There
again, that's what we've said to them, if that needs to be clearer,
we're willing to talk with them about that, and I said that in the
beginning. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Earl just cited some that
are not specifically related to women's safety and health, and that's
why I was asking. The other question I have is what type of quality
assurance measures did you have in mind when you devised the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Quality assurance for what in particular? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] In terms of looking at standards and regulations for the
centers themselves.</p>

the abortion centers?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
That would be part of the rules-making process that they would look at.
I don't have the full statute in front of me on what you do do for
ambulatory care right now. And so we, again, did not give specifics in
that way, we wanted them to look at it. The intent, there again, was
safety. And to make sure if you're preforming a form of surgery that you
have the safety provisions that are needed to make sure that that
surgery can be done safely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Do you agree...?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
One more follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up. Do you agree that the fact that two centers have closed means
that it's working, and that it will not deter, hopefully, young people
from going to other means of abortions, in that two were closed, that
means something is working if somebody is doing the job of making sure
that imminent danger is not there for women, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
We've never said that we thought none of them were working well. We just
believe that it's time to review the standards that have not been
reviewed since the early 90's, and look at it and determine whether or
not, given current standards today, do we need to improve it. If they
were to go through the rules-making process, do these comparisons, and
say, you know, we're almost there, that's something they can give us
feedback on, but it's not that we're coming out and saying, gee look at
all these problems. We're saying, it's 2013, these rules have not been
reviewed since 1994. In fact, when I looked back over the rules, they
had been reviewed twice in the 70's, another time in the 80's, another
time in the 90's. It's time to review them again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you for those comments. I don't know what the Senate had in mind,
I'm sure you do, but it seems to me like a study is very appropriate.
Given all the factors that you just mentioned, that's even more so a
reason to do a study and be thorough and approach this. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The Senate has agreed to talk to, we're all going to work together,
figure out, is this clear? It may be clear in the language it is. We
just need to talk about it some more. If it needs to be clearer we'll,
he said we're open to considering that. The point is here, that we want
these standards to be the standards that provide the women in North
Carolina the safety they need when they go in to have a surgical
procedure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The final Representative to speak, or to ask questions, is
Representative Fulgham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Question for Secretary Wos. The currently
licensed facilities in North Carolina for delivery, medical care, I
count among the surgical centers, mandatory surgical centers, hospitals
and the abortion clinics, 254 facilities. Are not all of those
technically licensed to do abortions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
If I may answer, Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Mr. Pratt
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The acute care centers that are licensed other than abortions, abortion
centers are certified, but the licensed facilities are licensed to do a
host of surgical procedures. Abortion clinics are only certified to do
abortions. So the answer, I guess, to your question is, there are other
facilities that can do abortions, but usually it's because of
complications with pregnancies and things like that. They don't hold
themselves out to advertise or bring in clients just to do abortions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up, Mr. Chairman. My question was premised on the basis of some
type of crisis occurring if bad places, unregulated in the sense that
not complying with regulations, or shut down, that is few and far
between. But this clinic in Durham for example, was just recently shut
down. It only had been open for less than six months. And your frequency
of inspections belies some of the rhetoric from some of the people I've
heard recently from the other side indicating abortion clinics were
inspected on an annual basis. This is not the case from what I can
understand. And so, what I'm asking is, the '94 recent, most recent
regulations involving the administrative code for abortion clinics, as
applied to the 16 clinics as they stand now, 9 of those clinics were in
existence prior to 1994. Are all the clinics in current compliance with
the regulations as of 1994, or are there some that have been
grandfathered in, for example, in regards to structural integrity with
the hallways, the usual kind of things that go along with a medical
facility delivering medical treatment, not the ambulatory surgical
standard, but the abortion clinic standard?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Mr. Pratt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. Chair. All of the clinics today are assumed to be in
compliance until we find otherwise, whether it's a routine inspection or
whether we get a complaint. We are assuming they are in compliance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
And one final comment, I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman...
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
That's fine, one final follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
...I just want to make this point.</p>

...the finding in Section 6C of the bill that says &quot;similar
standards&quot; is exactly what it means, then I'd discuss with some of
the sponsors. I'm satisfied if the current 94 standards were enforced,
they would be adequate and would cover. It doesn't address parking lots
and all that other kind of nonsense. We're just talking about basic safe
facilities. Separate recovery rooms. Separate operating rooms. Medical
procedures being outlined and recorded. Patient records being held and
having some sense of integrity in regards to that situation.
But Pennsylvania, Kansas and Virginia have come to the standard where
now abortion clinics are required to have the same exact standards as
ambulatory surgical centers and be subjected to unannounced inspections.
I don't think this bill suggests we go there. I don't think we need to
go there if the regulations are enforced as they are written. Thank you,
Mister Chairman.

the public. Secretary Wos, thank you to your staff for coming today and

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, we look forward to working with you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the public, we welcome your opinions. Thank
you for your patience and what I'm going to try to do is have three

please keep it to that time limit if possible. First person we'll hear

Preston, ACLU and Paige Johnson, Planned Parenthood. So if those two
would also be ready to present. When you come up to the microphone,
please identify yourself and the organization you represent. Miss
Buckley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My name is Sarah Buckley and I am the Executive
Director for NARAL Pro Choice North Carolina Foundation. We oppose House
Bill 695 and we urge you to do the same. I just want to be very clear,
this bill has nothing to do with women's health and safety. This bill
will only make it more difficult, if not impossible, for women in North
Carolina to have access to safe and legal abortion care. This bill
imposes numerous medically unnecessary and excessive requirements that
only apply to providers of abortion care. We already have 18 pages of
regulations that apply only to providers of abortion care. It's one of
the most highly regulated procedures in North Carolina.
This bill would require abortion providers to have transfer agreements
with local hospitals that may be difficult or impossible for them to
obtain. And all United States hospitals are required by federal law to
treat emergencies. Transfer agreements are simply unnecessary. Their
only purpose is to create another barrier to safe and legal reproductive
health care.
When legislation like this has been enacted in other states, it has
forced clinics to close their doors. In every single state. And that's
the point of this bill, and you don't have to take my word for it.
Representative Stam said so on Saturday on WRAL. This bill will not
reduce the need for abortion care. It will only make it less safe.
This bill is out of touch with more than three quarters of North
Carolinians who believe lawmakers have no place in a woman's personal
and private decisions. The vast majority of North Carolinians, thousands
of whom you have seen on Moral Monday, want you all to focus on jobs,
the economy and increasing access to health care. Not stripping away
women's choices. We urge you not to concur on this bill. Thank you.

Offered through state health insurance exchanges unnecessarily and
burden regular clinic that perform abortion, a safe a constitutional
protected procedure and interferes with the doctor patient relationship.
We know from experience in other states, that this legislation
particularly part six of this bill will in fact shut some clinics down.
This legislation will limit women access to safe constitutionally
protected health care services and North Carolina women should of had
the opportunity to weight in on this legislation on the Senates side. We
believe that women and the public should have been given the opportunity
and should be given the opportunity to weigh in fully and instead this
provision was tacked on to the end of a unrelated bill with no notice to
the public and no opportunity for meaningful input before the senate
floor vote the same day the bill was heard in committee. This bill has
serious consequences for the lives and health of women in the state. It
deserves serious debate and consideration and a open process with the
opportunity to run amendments , but instead the public was given no
opportunity to comment and amendments were shut down in the senate. Here
in the house the public may be getting some time to comment and we
certainly do appreciate that, but once again any concern or questions
raised could not be addressed since members of this body can not offer
amendment during a concurrent debate. One day of public comment in the
house does not make up for the rushed and premature vote on this bill.
Nor does it somehow correct the process this bill has gone through so
far. When dealing with the health and lives of North Carolinian women,
The North Carolina general assembly should do better and spend the time
necessary to make sure all the women in the state can access a full
range of reproductive health  care and that no woman's life is
jeopardized do the actions of this body. We will urge you to not concur
and to take the time necessary to really review this subject. Thank you
very much. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Paige Johnson with Planned Parenthood
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning I'm Paige Johnson Vice President of
Internal Affairs for Planned Parenthood of Central North Carolina.Thank
you for giving us the opportunity to speak. No one takes women health
and safety more seriously than Planned Parenthood. More than twenty-five
thousand North Carolinian's women, men and young people rely on us every
year for life saving cancer screenings, pap test, clinical breast exams,
annual exams, birth control, STD detection treatment and prevention and
yes high quality compassionate and safe abortion care. We understand how
deeply personal and often complex pregnancy decisions can be for a
woman. Which is why we cannot understand how law makers could pass
sweeping legislation like six ninety five without allowing a single
women's health expert to weigh in publicly, when the bill was still
eligible to be amended. Like all health care provider, doctors who
provide abortion care in North Carolina adhere to rigorous medical
standards and numerous regulations. Our doctors are licensed by the
North Carolina medical board and receive continuing medical education
annually. Our medical standards and guidelines are informed by the most
trusted medical knowledge as well as professional and scientific
organizations including the CDC,the FDA, and The American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists existing laws and regulations governing
abortion care in North Carolina work. This is why, exactly why providers
that did not comply with these intensive regulations were shut down.
House bill six ninety five as written will do nothing to improve women's
health or safety, it is simply another step towards eliminating access
to safe and legal abortion taken by those opposed to women right to make
deeply personal and private decisions under all circumstances. If the
intent truly is to make abortion care safer to protect women health and
safety, Planned Parenthood welcomes the opportunity to work with law
makers to improve. Amend house bill six ninety five we urge you to not
concur with the bill as written. Thank You  [SPEAKER CHANGES] We will
now hear from three people who are for the bill. We will start off with
Tammy Fitzgerald  from North Carolina Bayou Correlation.</p>

followed by John Russtin, Northland Family Policy Council, and then
Barbara Hotz, North Carolina Right to Life, Ms. Fitzgerald.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  There are 2 drugs commonly used for chemical
abortion, Mifeprex RU486 and Methotrexate.  Both drug regimens involve
substantial risk including excessive hemorrhaging and the possibility
that the pregnancy is not terminated, and a surgical abortion is
necessary.  Both drugs can also cause death.  The FDA approval letter
for RU486 states, Mifeprex should be prescribed only in a clinic,
medical office or hospital, by or under the supervision of a physician,
able to assess the gestational age of an embryo, and to diagnose atopic
pregnancies.  Physicians must also be to provide surgical interventions
in cases of incomplete abortion, or severe bleeding or have made plans
for such care to others, and be able to ensure patient access to medical
facilities equip for blood transfusions and resuscitation if necessary.
FDA protocol also requires 2 subsequent office visits with the
physician.  Methotrexate on the other hand, is approved only for cancer,
sclerosis, and hemorrhoid arthritis treatment.  Off label use if for
abortions.  Medical evidence shows that there are more complications
from chemical abortions than from surgical abortions.  The American
College of Gynecology reports that 1 out of every 100 women who undergo
chemical abortions will require emergency surgery for hemorrhage.  This
percentage does not include the additional women who need surgery for
incomplete abortion, continuing pregnancy, and other indications.  Women
who have chemical abortions typically endure significant pain and
bleeding.  These drugs are not like taking Motrin.  Abortion clinics in
North Carolina have had their share of problems, like the 2 in Charlotte
and in Durham that were shut down within the last 2 months.  State
officials called a preferred women's health care clinic in Charlotte an
imminent health and safety threat to women, and even found dead insects,
blood splatters and even dirty instruments inside the facility.  State
Health officials also found the facility was endangering women by
improperly administering chemical abortions, and improperly examining
post-abortive women before they were discharged before surgery.
According to an inspection report on April 20th, the clinic was found to
be improperly dispensing intravenous version of Methotrexate orally,
causing failed abortions that necessitated surgery.  According to the
Charlotte Observer, Dr. Mitchell Krinon, the Chairman of the University
of California at Davis, Department of OBGyn said that it is no different
than hearing that an Orthopedic surgeon had cut off the wrong leg.
Although this was the 2nd failed inspection of a preferred women's
health clinic, the clinic was allowed to re-open by the State 4 days
later.  State officials closed the Baker Clinic in Durham lat Friday
because it presents an imminent danger to the health, safety and welfare
of clients, that's their quote.  State officials found the facility
failed to perform quality controlled testing on 108 patients that
received RHD testing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Excuse me, the lady will conclude her comments, since
time has run.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Okay, thank you.  All of these problems will be cured
under Section 6, of House Bill 695.  Requiring doctors to be present for
abortions is not wild eyed and crazy.  It is what common sense requires,
and FDA protocol demands, it's what the drug manufacturers themselves
recommend, what Planned Parenthood even has on their website.  Requiring
abortion clinics, excuse me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The lady will please conclude.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I have 1 more minute.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]5 seconds.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Pretending abortion is not a serious medical procedure
jeopardizes the health, safety and very lives of women, just so the
abortion industry can produce more profits.  I urge you to vote for
concurrence.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Next is John Russtin, Northland Family Policy Council.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.  I'm
John Russtin, President of the Northland Family Policy Council.  I will
be brief with my comments, and Mr. Chairman if it would be possible, I
would like to defer the remainder of my time that I would have finished
to Ms. Fitzgerald for her comments.  I appreciate this opportunity to
speak in favor of House Bill 695.  As the House has already vetted and
approved the majority of provisions in this bill, I will focus my
comments on Section 6C, which directs the Department of Health and Human
Services to amend its rules to require abortion clinics to meet similar
standards to those of ambulatory surgical centers in North Carolina.
This is a common sense requirement designed to help</p>

Protect the health and well-being of women who seek abortion services in
our state. Particularly when those services involve an invasive and I
stress an invasive surgical procedure. As Senator Daniel has stated
already, the Senate was well justified in including this provision in
House Bill 695. Particularly in light of the atrocities that were
revealed throughout the murder trial of Philadelphia abortionist, Kermit
Gosnell. And if that were not enough, and you have had heard this stated
several times already, much closer to home, the North Carolina
Department of Health and Human Services has temporarily suspended the
operation of two abortion clinics in our state already this year. One in
Charlotte in May and one in Durham just last week. Due to conditions and
you’ve heard this before, but I think it is important to stress again.
Due to conditions in both clinics and I quote from the Department’s
Notice of Administrative Action issued in both circumstances,
&quot;Present an imminent danger to the health, safety, and welfare of
the clients.” The North Carolina Family Policy Council applauds the
Senate for taking decisive action on this matter, and we are extremely
grateful to the House for already acting on the other very important
provisions in this bill. We encourage you to concur with the Senate’s
changes to House Bill 695. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’ll hear from Barbara Holt, North Carolina Right to Life.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’m Barbara Holt, president of North Carolina
Right to Life.And I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you today.
North Carolina Right to Life supports the many pro-life provisions that
are in House Bill 695 and because the committee has heard from these
provisions discussed in previous committees and on the House floor, I’ll
limit my remarks to Webcam Abortions. But before I do, I would just like
to say that in all that's been said today, one of things that we have
failed to remember is that abortion is never safe for the unborn child.
In every abortion an unborn child dies. And so abortion is very
different in that one particular way from every surgical and chemical
procedure because we have the death of a living human being. In 2008,
Planned Parenthood began with plans to expand to other states, Webcam
Abortions. These internet abortions consists of a doctor in one city
dispensing chemical abortion drugs like the RU-486 to women sitting in
front of a monitor, at times many hundredths of miles away. Planned
Parenthood the largest single provider of abortions in our country has
plans to make dispensing abortion drugs like RU-486 a decision not
definitely, definitely not between a woman and her doctor. Through April
2011, the FDA reported 2,207 adverse events related to RU-486, including
14 deaths, 612 hospitalizations, 58 ectopic pregnancies, 339 blood
transfusions, and 256 cases of infections in the U.S. alone. Because of
the serious complications associated with RU-486,the physician should be
physically present when these drugs are administered and available
afterwards in case something goes terribly wrong. This preserves the
doctor-patient relationship and ensures a woman can see the doctor for
help if she needs it. There are 13 states with laws prohibiting Webcam
Abortions with Missouri on July 14th to be added to that list. I really
urge this committee and the full House to concur with House Bill 695 and
I ask you as you do to remember that you will be a voice for the
voiceless. Thank you.

Comments against the bill and there will go three comments for the bill
and we'll see how much time we have left in that point. The names are
being given are Beverly false, nen Emily Evert then Robin Allan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker I am Beverly Herrington false a
retired obstetrician gynecologist currently living in durum in North
Carolina. The first person I ever saw die was a 60 year old women who
have pregnancy induced hypertension also known as pre clamps here or
toxemia and for this reason it is H695 that needs to die. The best way
to protect women's health and safety is to provide universal access to
health care. The entire spectrum of health care. This decision must be
left to the woman because it is her decision that affects both her life
her family and the consequences of the outcome. I refer to you a 1994
article in title maternal morbid mortality related to induce abortion in
North Carolina a historical study after the row versus way 1973 decision
in the following 5 years maternal mortality dropped over 85% in North
Carolina due to access to safe legal elective choice. The maternal
mortality rate for North Carolina dropped in half as a consequence of
access to safe legal choice. I refer you to February 17 2012 article
morbidity and mortality weekly report published by Senates for disease
control. This article documents a for forth increase in depth from a
topic pregnancy. 13 women died in one year compare to 11 women in the
entire previous decade. Access to health care is what will ensure safety
for women of North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Emily Evert.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Hello my name is Emily Evert. I was raised on the
coasts of North Carolina but I moved ?? my husband who is in active duty
military member station at fort Bragg. I am here to speak against house
bill 695. I wanna tell my story. When I was 18 years old I was in a
relationship with a man that was emotionally abusive. I found out that I
was pregnant after six months into the relationship. I send all my
information from. I was scared to tell my family I was even more scared
to tell the man I was in a relationship with. I knew in my mind I
couldn't raise a child especially one with a man that can go sentence
without believing me. I decided that my best option was to choose
abortion. I saw a wall maker on TV and admit that his intention for
pushing house bill 695 was to eliminate access to save illegal abortion.
I am here to stand for the women who have made this deeply personal
decision like many women who have got illegal abortion in the state my
story has a happy ending. I married to a great man who stands for North
Carolina women and me. I have a beautiful three year old girl who is
bright and healthy i have been able to follow my dreams and education
all because I was able to plan and decide when I was ready to raise a
child. I ask you to stand with me and all women of North Carolina who
have the right to choose and plan their families in their own time.
Please vote no on house bill 695. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Robin Allan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My name is Robin Holmes Allan and I thank you for the
opportunity to speak. I think this bill is a travesty what this bill
will do is limit access on the making.</p>

To my way of thinking this has always been about access. History is
telling us that abortions were killing women when it was illegal. It is
my memory that doctors led the charge to help make abortions safe.
Doctors were alarmed about women’s suffering from botched abortions and
from the efforts of their own. In the early sixties when I was a very
early teen maybe even pre-teen, I heard family elder’s discussing an
abortion for my cousin. She was probably around fifteen. I knew what
abortion was and although I couldn’t hear the discussion I could hear
the angst in the room. They were taking her to New York. Abortion was
not legal and finding a safe abortionist must have been a grave
challenge. I have memories of volunteering at clinics to provide safe
passage. After Roe V Wade, the ideologues would line the sidewalks all
the way to the front door yelling hateful epithets and hurtful slogans.
It was a horrific challenge to escort women to the front door. Then we
got?? And the ideologues had to keep their distance. They still had
their constitutional right to protest and they did and they have never
stopped. Fast-forward to the early twenty-hundreds and I am volunteering
at a clinic that provides reproductive health care. Women could drive up
to behind the building or at least drive up to where they could park on
the side. They were still out there with their bullhorns chastising
women. When a police car arrived after a call about disturbing the peace
their bull horns would disappear. Over time I worried that my car would
be damaged. I worried that they knew my car and recognized me so I
didn’t trust that my car would be safe. I asked my husband to drive me
and pick me up. I tell you these stories for two reasons; it’s always
about access. Even when women have a constitutional right, they will do
everything they can to control women and their families. Those of you
who support this bill have brought the street action inside our house,
the house that belongs to the people. Women are watching. Women vote,
and so do the men who stand beside us. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK we will next
hear from three people who are for the bill. In order, they will be; Dr.
Marty McCaffrey, Dr. Greg Brannon and Wendy Banister [SPEAKER CHANGES]
thank you for the opportunity to speak. My name is DR. Marty McCaffrey.
I am a physician at the UNC school of medicine, I’m a neonatologist and
I’m here today as a supporter of HB695. I’d like to address five points,
five facts about abortion in North Carolina. Number one: abortion is a
surgical procedure in 75% of cases in North Carolina. Two: abortion is
one the most commonly performed surgeries in North Carolina. Three:
abortion can cause bleeding, infection and death. Four: abortion clinics
in North Carolina aren’t classified separately from all other clinics
performing outpatient surgical procedures. And lastly, serious
deficiencies have been reported in abortion clinics in North Carolina
including ‘ employees performing ultrasounds after following physicians
around to learn how to perform an ultrasound, medications provided
without the written order of a physician, clinic emergency kits with
expired medications, surgical instruments used on multiple patients
without being sterilized. Dried blood observed on exam lights in
procedure rooms, dead insects in windowsills and dirty ultrasound
equipment, a physician rarely inspecting the products of conception. I
once told an obstetrical colleague of mine that abortion is held to a
lesser standard than that applied to all other interventions. I stated
“we’ve placed abortions</p>

Person on a pedestals occupied by no other medical or surgical
procedure. She replied and that is how it should be. Abortion abdicates
and their zeal to support abortion have advance their caused by creating
an image of abortion that shields the public from reality of abortion
including its short and long term medical risk placing abortion in this
pedestals allow abortion providers to function with minimal Overside and
let's reduces resulting clinic environment center properly staffed
poorly equipped on senatorial dangerous. You lay on to back when streets
regulate themselves nor does any other area of medicine provide Overside
of its own operation. We are a society that takes steps in these
directions with good reason. Regularly ensuring compline with minimal
standards is today an expectation for health care organizations. Women
considering abortion deserves the same insurance of an abortion clinics
and hearance of basic medical standards as offered to a women undergoing
a breast lung packing. The reality is that the abortion clinic which may
be used by a women is not held to the same standard as the ambulatory
surgery clinic which might perform her lung packing. The requirement the
abortion clinic subjected to same ambulatory surgery centers
demonstrates a commitment to women's health. It is simply good policy
and I ask you to support HB695. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let's here from Dr. Grieg Brandon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman Dr. Brandon had to leave and deliver a
baby. So we were wondering if Vialka Alan who is also on your list could
have his spot. Sir surgical nurse.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's fine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Hi may name is Vialka Alan and I have 10 years’
operating women’s experience here in North Carolina at elements conque.
Reason no medical center duke ambulance surgery center and also in
California pacific medical centers in San Francisco. I currently work
with group of six general surgeon. Most miss carriages also turn miss
abortions require surgery. This is especially true the further along the
pregnancy is. When surgery is required and OBGYNO take their patient to
the OR weather at hospital or surgery center not his office. The surgeon
should be present and should be qualified enough to perform the
procedure correctly well trained support staff is vital anytime the
uterus is handled there is risk of perforating resulting in Moran base
of surgery. Any emergency in an office means any preformats to be called
to transfer the patient to a hospital using the precious time. An
anesthioligist should be present to manage the women and anesthetic
medications air way breathing an vital science. Risk of retained tissue
and poorly perform procedure can cause life for bleeding and infection.
The women should be monitor closely for post-operative bleeding. How
important is practicing sterol technique using a properly setup OR in a
negative pressure room using properly sterilized insurance. Any
procedure logically requires these step as well as the presence of
qualified surgeon. Good care does not end in the OR by continues by
proper follow up to promote the complete healing of the patient. The
standard of care should not be different for the end of a wanted or an
unwanted pregnancy. Women are not receiving the same standard of kid and
addition clinic as they would in a surgery center or hospital. Well we
do not condone abortion for any reason we recognize that while it is
still legal we must provide the same care for all expecting mothers.
The traffic and result is always the same which is the end of human
baby's life but that the least we should take the same precautions as in
missed abortion. I am asking you to please vote to conquer on each 695
that only because it will save precious unborn lives but because women
deserve better than shortcuts and substandard care. Thank you for
listening. God blesses.

thank you, Mister chair, representatives, my name is Vicki Boyer, this
past April. I had my sixtieth birthday, and subsequently I have realized
that I had been hearing this discussion all my life when I was a child
my family lives outside Washington, DC in the nineteen sixties, I was at
that time, able to your Congress debate whether or not women. American
women should have access to the birth control pill. the argument against
it. women might regret their decisions. you can imagine how stunned I
was just a few years ago, when Justice Kennedy wrote in the Supreme
Court decision that throughout third trimester abortions that women
might regret their decisions spoken as if no man ever suffered of regret
on this bill doesn't effectively take away a woman's right to abortion
in the state of North Carolina that has been the result in other states
that have followed this line of legal pursuits. I think that if you
really want women's health and safety the form is in your mind. then you
fully, finally, DHHS, so that they have the resources and personnel in
support system. they need to sort out all clinics that are not doing
well and shut that clinic down instead of shutting down every clinic. I
am apparent. I have had two doctors call it to live births. I had no
drugs if any of those births all natural childbirth on what they used to
call one tough cookie. this is my issue, and I will be following this
issue for a long time, but as a parent as many of you are. we all want
to raise our children to become positive, productive members of society
we want them to find their skill or talent and use it to support
themselves wisely. unless of course they are a woman you happens to be

Representative Stevens.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I wanted to agree along with Representative
Samuelson, I was part of this earlier meeting. I am a mother. I am a
woman. And I am a Republican. There’s not a war on us. We’re not having
a war on you. My job here is as a state Representative to do what I
think the people of my district want me to do. As a lawyer, I have the
ability to do that with the legal logical mind. We recognize abortion is
legal. We want to make sure it’s safe and healthy. We will try to work
with the Senate because if we can do something there to go ahead and
make it a concurrence as opposed to a non-concurrence and go to a
conference report, if we can work with them on something that we can
concur, it will certainly help expedite the process. It has been
important to have this discussion today. It is important to hear from
the Department of Health and Human Services. What I heard was that every
clinic out there has had a violation in the last five to ten years.
Maybe they’re not clear on the rules. That’s what the person from Durham
said when they closed down the clinic, I didn’t know I was supposed to
be testing this blood every day. The one in Charlotte breaking open a
vial of IV medicine and giving it orally. Clearly we’ve got some
problems and we need to set some standards and we need to be concerned
about the safety and health about the patients who go there. I’m hoping
we can continue to work and I’m certainly willing to do it.

Representative Insko, very briefly.
