  Said he’ll be here in a few minutes so if you wanna go in. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] We’ll go ahead. First of all I wanna thank everyone for coming
and delve into a subject that is confusing and convoluted and a lot of
us in the General Assembly are just learning about in the last couple of
sessions through some special study committees, myself included, as to
what CON is, certificate of deed, and how it impacts our healthcare in
the state of North Carolina. So first of all, like I said, welcome. I
appreciate you taking the time to come. I will be making some brief
remarks about what I saw as a need to get into this. I will introduce my
co-sponsors and have them explain what their interests are and what
their background has been in terms of driving their interest in CON and
I have some people who live in the real world with it and I feel like
we’ll learn quite a bit from talking to them and I guess I should
explain first off that this is going to be the beginning I hope of a
good conversation about CON. We had the legislation in a previous
session and it did not make it through committee where a lot of the
questions and concerns can get answered and discussed and resolved and I
look forward to that with everybody because I feel like the best
solution is on where everybody sits at the table, explains what their
concerns are and how it’s going to impact them and the objective for
everyone should be better, accessible, affordable healthcare for the
citizens of North Carolina and have each of us with whatever our
function is, as a provider, as a legislator, as a consumer, be at the
table in determining what that is going to look like. In CON I’ve served
on a couple of study committees, confused most of the time in the
beginning because it is such a complicated issue, but however I
understand the concept real well because I’ve actually been a patient in
the ambulatory surgery centers which I’m sure looking at most of the age
group in here, most of you’ve had your baseline colonoscopy so you know
where of I speak, but that’s the sort of issue that we’re talking about
because in 2005 the first adjustment I should say, or change to North
Carolina CON laws were made for the very purpose of the
gastrointestinal/endoscopy functions and has benefitted North Carolina
and its citizens from healthcare, prevention and diagnosis and treatment
of some severe issues, health issue quite well and the certificate of
need that I’m proposing changes is an incremental. I’ve heard and there
are indications that there are some more comprehensive changes being
looked at, however with the cautious nature that I have as a scientist
you know you only change one ingredient in your experiment at a time in
order to be able to determine if it works or not, which is why I’m
proposing and hope people recognize that a more deliberate and
incremental change will help us see what works and then if things don’t
work quite the way we want them to we don’t do a lot of damage before we
can undo it and make some adjustments. So moving too far too fast can
sometimes undermine the best intentions. And I’ve handed out quite a bit
of material. I’m starting to look somewhat like Representative Stam
who’s notorious for that, but I think it illustrates the driving force
of why we need to look at CON in North Carolina and that’s cost. You
have a handout that shows through the estimator here of several
different treatments and the cost differential between an ambulatory
surgery center and a hospital location and that points out I think more
than anything else the need for us to seriously look at this because in
anything that we’re looking at in the General Assembly in healthcare
from Medicaid reform to anything else, the driving issue is cost and we
have to understand where it is and where we can drive it out of the
system and how best to do that. There’s examples. I won’t take your time
because I wanna get

  But you can see that in particular, you can see, there’s the
bunionectomy prices go from $3,600 to over $13,000, from an ASC to a
hospital, and you have to understand too, in the triangle area, 70% of
that particular treatment are actually done in the hospital, high cost
setting. So it’s not that we want to eliminate the hospital’s ability to
do the procedures, we just feel like with the shift of some of the
population, we can begin to get a handle on the expense of health care
in North Carolina. Right now, certificate of need actually doesn’t make
or break a hospital system, simply because there’s 24 states throughout
the country that don’t require CON to open an ASC, and I think you can
see from the very illustrative chart there, how North Carolina ranks in
terms of just how restrictive we are through our certificate of need
process. It touches on just about every aspect of health care provisions
in the state, and we can begin in certain areas, just as we did in 2005
with endoscopy, moving into other areas, and make a gradual change and
improve the landscape for the state. There are a couple things that have
been – that have arisen as the biggest objections were the fact that,
one, we would cherry-pick and these facilities would end up serving a
clientele that was in my favorite terminology, on an unlevel playing
field with hospitals, simply because of federal regulations which
mandate hospitals serve anyone who comes to their facility. And I feel
like we’ve done a good job in what we have laid out in this particular
piece of legislation in addressing that concern, and that is we have a
charity care limit that we have put in, for 7%, and that is well above
the majority of charity care percentages which are illustrated on
another sheet which I’ve passed out, which are the reported charity care
levels of hospitals. So I feel like with that mandate, that they are to
meet that charity care level, the argument that the hospitals are going
to be stuck with unpaid, uninsured patients and things of that nature
has been taken care of. The other concern, and rightly so, a lot of our
rural hospitals, where the population may not be sufficient to support
two facilities, a hospital and an ASC, and in order to overcome that,
what we have put in place is a requirement that in counties of under
100,000 population, that there has to be an agreement between the
hospital and this facility before one would be able to locate there. So
I feel like we’ve been very cognizant of the concerns that the hospitals
have. There are two main concerns, which I feel like are well warranted,
and I believe we’ve taken care of those, and I know we’ll have
discussions continuing on this, and any of the issues which come up
legitimate, I feel like need to be given the time and energy
consideration in any adjustments that we move forward on. But as I said,
it should always be directed with the goal that each of us has as a
legislator, as a provider, as a consumer, and that is accessible,
affordable health care for the citizens of North Carolina. So this time
I’m going to thank and recognize a couple of my sponsors. Representative
Dan Bishop, who is also on the bill with us, was unable to join us, and
if you have a chance, to get in touch with him and find out what was his
motivation and why he is supportive of this. But I do have with me today
as moral and physical backup and support here, are a couple of my
sponsors, who I greatly appreciate in stepping forward with a
controversial issue and being willing to help me fight a good fight.
First of all I’d like to recognize Representative--

  Joe from the Durham area. And Mickey has a history quite a long history
with CON and I&#39;m going to ask him if he would explain that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My explanation thank you representative Brown is very simple. We want to
bring down the cost of medical care and health care in this state and
the way to do it is to put it on a competitive basis. CON&#39;s simply
just knock out that competitive basis and that&#39;s where we are. About
fifteen years I&#39;ve been trying to do that and I know I&#39;m gonna
get a lot of flack from a big hospital I&#39;ve got in my district but I
think eventually as they come around to seeing how things are it will
work. And then the other thing is that we&#39;ve got to make sure that
those areas not being served by those bigger units get some type of
service. And if you&#39;ve got to continuously apply for a certificate
of need take for instance in Belmont where the hospital gone completely
totally those people have to go forty five miles or more to get some
kind of service. If there were competition really sitting there and you
didn&#39;t have to have a certificate of need to set up like a ??
operation for instance or something like that then you wouldn&#39;t have
the problems a lot of the problems that exist. So my thing has been
making the thing more prevalent service and driving down the cost of
health care in the state and I think by and again here again this is not
a hatched approach this is a simple approach going across the board
doing it slowly slow but sure basis. Where you don&#39;t just axe
everything off and take it out but you move slowly but surely. And in
the end I think prices will be brought down. That&#39;s my whole thing
on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Also joining me is representative Jeff Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila obviously has done the yeoman&#39;s job as far as
work on this bill so I&#39;ll try to keep my comments brief. I was
fortunate enough to serve with her on the CON study committee we had I
guess it&#39;s been three years ago now where we had public hearings
around the state. Opened my eyes to a lot of things going on with CON. I
guess the thing that saddened me the most was when I saw how large the
body of legislation is. Made me think I was in Washington D.C. instead
of Raleigh. I have a bumper sticker that&#39;s under the glass on my
desk in the legislature in the house chamber that says limited
government free markets fiscal responsibility. That pretty well sums up
why I&#39;m part of this drive. The more we can make medical decisions
based on conversations between patients and doctors rather than
legislative fiat by people like me and rulings from bureaucrats who are
tasked with administering rules that we pass. And the less it can be
about turf wars based on the rules that we&#39;ve passed and lawsuits
between medical practitioners based on the lawsuits we&#39;ve passed the
happier I&#39;ll be. That&#39;s basically why I&#39;m part of this
movement. As representative Avila has stated where going slow and trying
to make sure we&#39;ve put safeguards in place I don&#39;t want my
hospital to suffer any more than I want any hospital in the state to
suffer. Again I&#39;ve tried personally to lower the cost to the state
of health care I&#39;ve never joined the state health plan I&#39;ve had
a health plan in place through my business it is a consumer based health
plan so I have quite a large deductible so I&#39;m sure when I go for my
next colonoscopy I&#39;ll be taking close attention to where I have that
done. But anyway this bill just follows very much in line with the
education I got from the CON committee and with just my basic philosophy
to start with. I&#39;d like to thank representative Avila for all the
hard work she&#39;s done on this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There is one addition to this bill that I&#39;d like to point out. Some
may have noticed it in terms of areas we&#39;re going to remove the CON
requirement. And that is our psychiatric beds. I don&#39;t think anybody
in the state who has listened to any of our mental health meetings and
discussions and committee presentations would not recognize the fact
that we are currently at a very large shortage of those beds so
we&#39;re hoping that because of the procedure which is so complex takes
such a long time and is expensive that we might remove at least one
obstacle to help encourage increasing the number of beds we&#39;d have
available for the people in the state. At this time I&#39;m going to ask
Dr. Matt

  He’s an ophthalmologist and a retinal expert, and lives in the real
world, and I think can probably illustrate much clearer what the
practical ramifications of the direction we’re taking will mean.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] First I wanted to thank Representative Avila for
having the courage and dedication of the patients of North Carolina, to
put forth this bill. A certificate of need law has historically been an
attempt to control health care costs, and to ensure health access. What
we have realized over time, is that it has simply failed in its efforts
to do so. In fact, in 2004, the Department of Justice and the FTC
released a consensus report stating, and I quote, “CON laws are not
successful in controlling health care costs, and pose significant
anti-competitive risks that usually outweigh their purported economic
benefit.” So unfortunately, North Carolina has headed in the wrong
direction in maintaining what you can clearly see is one of the most
restrictive CON laws in the country. Since the CON requirements from the
federal government was removed in the 1980s, we have 14 states in the
United States, that have completely abandoned them, and we have an
increasing number that are loosening them. So on a statewide basis,
there are real world consequences involved by maintaining the status
quo. One of them, looking from ten miles up, I would say, yes, many
people say the real world, but my family looks are me in North Carolina
and says you’re living in paradise, and I’d have to agree. But we see
from ten miles up, that we see a tremendous cost leveed on the taxpayers
of North Carolina for our Medicaid and Medicare costs. Then when we look
down at the individual North Carolinian which is where I spend my days,
in and out, sometimes in the middle of the night. What I see are
patients who look at the costs involved with receiving their care that
they need, and specifically I always think of one patient in particular,
who presented to me with being legally blind in both eyes, and I needed
to give the patient surgical care. That was the only way to correct the
problem. And unfortunately the patient looked at the costs involved, and
where I am, there is no ambulatory surgical center available that is
providing care at ambulatory surgical center costs. So this patient was
left with the potential for tremendous financial strain, and
unfortunately was left with limited to no transportation that would get
the patient to a nearby city that did have an ACS, or an ambulatory
surgical center operating at those costs. In the time that it took
fighting aggressively to get the help needed, the patient is now doing
better, but may very well have been left with vision that is not where
any of us wanted it to be. It’s impossible to know, but I can’t help but
think it. So I do not believe anyone in the health care
community—whether it be hospital, ambulatory surgical centers, or the
providers themselves, such as myself—want that type of outcome. And so
that is why I’m in support of this bill, in order to try and bring our
health care facility access, bring the costs down, increase our access,
and allow the patients to get the care they need in a more timely
manner, and in a more cost-effective manner, especially as we all see
what is happening in the health care community nationwide. This becomes
incredibly important to all of us. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] At this time I’d like to recognize Donald Bryson, who
is the North Carolina state director for Americans for Prosperity.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. I think this is a very important
issue for North Carolina, as well as just a national discussion. I don’t
have a lot to add that hasn’t already been said. I thought the three
bill sponsors really knocked it out of the park, but I think this is an
issue that spans across traditional political divides, from the far left
to the far right. Basically people in the political left, middle, and
right, want health care reform, and we basically want three things, it’s
just a matter of debate of how we get there. We want widely accessible,
low-cost, high-quality care. And certificate of need, these laws
restrict--

  <p id="20:00">
  two of those three things that restricts access and it probably keeps
cost overlay inflated. North Carolina remains among 36 states, along
with the District of Columbia, that continue to limit entry and
expansion of their respective healthcare markets through certificates of
need. On average, states with certificate of need programs, or CON
programs, regulate 14 different services. You can see this chart from
the Mercatus Center at George Mason University has North Carolina with
25, which is well above the national average. Throughout the United
States there are approximately 362 beds for 100,000. However, in states
such as North Carolina that regulate hospital beds through CON programs,
the Mercatus Center study found 131 fewer beds per 100,000 persons. With
North Carolina&#39;s population at 9.85 million, we can assume that
there are about 12,900 fewer hospital beds throughout the state as a
result of CON. I bring that up not because, I bring up the hospital beds
not necessarily because this legislation addresses that but as
Representative Avila put forth, this is the beginning of an incremental
conversation about North Carolina&#39;s certificate of need laws and in
a state where we are almost 13,000 beds short of what we probably need,
we need to have this discussion about what this law necessarily does to
us. With the special interests that consistently lobby to keep these
laws in place, the certificate of need laws in North Carolina are
approaching a state of regulatory capture, which is very dangerous. I
think that Representative Michaux&#39;s statements earlier pretty much
illustrate what we need to do is that we need to make this marketplace
more competitive, we need to drive down costs, and we need to provide
more access to people throughout the state. Thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Donald, thank you very much. Now I&#39;d like to recognize
Alex Johnson with Generation Opportunity for some comments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. We&#39;re going to represent a different perspective here
today. Generation Opportunity advocates on behalf of millenials
throughout the state of North Carolina and we the certificate need laws,
three problems with them, the main one being cost. Due to some federal
laws that have been passed regarding our healthcare system, millennials
are now paying the brunt of health insurance costs. Our premiums have
skyrocketed throughout the country, especially here in North Carolina.
You have millennials now at a 14% unemployment rate in North Carolina,
their living in their parent&#39;s basements and their unable to afford
healthcare. Now they&#39;re required to afford healthcare we think that
his reform package is a great way to bring down costs and allow young
people throughout the state to have more access to affordable healthcare
and just more access in general. The other point that I&#39;d like to
bring up is we have a record number of college graduates going to
medical school currently in North Carolina. The problem is they&#39;re
going to graduate from medical school and they&#39;re going to be
continuing down the same path they&#39;ve gone on. We at Generation
Opportunity like to, we believe our generation is one of the most
innovative generations this country has ever seen and certificate of
need laws stifle that innovation. They prevent those students that we
have now in medical school from graduating and creating new ways to
improve healthcare and improve treatments and just the general daily
life for patients. We believe these laws are very restrictive of those
medical students&#39; ability and future doctor&#39;s ability to provide
better, more affordable care for individuals. The main point is we have
a lot of, like Donald&#39;s point, we have a lack of hospital beds in
the state of North Carolina and with certificate of need reform laws it
will provide more access to beds. We&#39;re trying to lead the way in
innovation and lead the way in providing great care for individuals, not
just young people but older generations as well. So that&#39;s why
we&#39;re behind this bill 100% and we believe that it should be passed
as soon as possible. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Alex. Now I&#39;d like to recognize Kathy Erickson, she is
the Practice Manager with Eye Associates of Wilmington.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I&#39;m going to try not to be terribly redundant. I just
want to say some things from the physician&#39;s perspective. CON reform
is a very necessary step. Of course the issues, cost, access to care,
and then also, in ophthalmology we have a huge demand for increased
productivity. I&#39;m glad to hear that there are more

  people going into medical school because we need them to become
ophthalmologists. I&#39;m from south eastern North Carolina and my
doctors, I have five surgeons serve both the elderly and pediatric
populations. We have an enlarging population of retirees along the coast
and growing families serving their country in the Camp Lejeune area.
Right now seventy percent of our ophthalmic surgeries are patients of
Medicare age. Our practice has the only pediatric ophthalmologist in
eastern North Carolina and his practice is thirty nine percent Medicaid.
There are significant cost savings anywhere from seven hundred to
fifteen hundred dollars based on data from two years ago. Per procedure
from Medicaid and Medicare and out patients if they have the option of
obtaining the ophthalmic in a licences ambulatory surgery center.  I
also want to address the charitable care issue. Private practice does
provide charitable care we currently work with prevent blindness in
North Carolina as well as local organizations to provide ophthalmic care
to low income families. We will continue the charitable efforts with the
CON reform. Right now our ophthalmologists in the Willmington area
currently have limited access to hospital based operating rooms and the
request for additional block time or operating room time for established
surgeons and new surgeons goes unanswered or even denied. Right now I
have a surgeon who is booking out cases surgery procedures three months.
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right for our Medicare population or any
population to wait three months to have a needed surgery. Cataract
patients they have their first eye done and then their second eye they
may have to wait four to six weeks for the surgeon to have access. The
time to schedule that patient. Cataract surgery is the second most out
patient surgery in the U.S. Their is a shortfall in the number of
ophthalmologists compared to the demand for services due retiring
ophthalmologists fewer trainees and the increased demand for services.
To meet the needs of this ageing population our ophthalmologists need to
increase their productivity and without the CON reform law we will be
unable to do that. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I think we&#39;ve heard from several different perspectives. Why we
want to proceed with this even though at times it may get uncomfortable
and we&#39;re going to make enemies as well as friends but I think in
all good things that&#39;s the case. So at this time I&#39;d like to
open up for questions from the press or anyone that has any issues and
direct them to whomever you would like of the presenters this morning
and who, Rose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m just curious you said that loosening things up for ambulatory
surgical centers would result in more psychiatric beds how does that
happen?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In the bill where we&#39;ve stricken the need for getting a certificate
of need in order to provide services in addition to providing for
ambulatory surgery centers and diagnostic centers we&#39;ve also added
psychiatric beds. They would no longer have to go through the CON
procedure. Do you have a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Jason ?? Business Journal. So can you be a little more specific on the
seven percent charity care is that something that&#39;s required for
each one of these new ASC&#39;s to provide?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Who regulates that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It would now our getting into the specifics of the bill and I can get
you a copy of that too. But there&#39;s actually a definition of how you
would calculate that and that&#39;s something that&#39;s interesting too
when you see this list I gave charity care there&#39;s not a standard
procedure or formula people use it&#39;s calculated different ways but
we&#39;ve specifically laid out in the legislation how you would
determine and we&#39;re basing it on Medicare in terms of dollars. But
it&#39;s pretty much you would subtract from your revenue the percentage
that you gave to charity care and it needs to equal seven percent.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And so along those lines let&#39;s say someone reaches only five percent
you know a practice only reaches five percent in a fiscal year what do
they owe the remaining two percent to some sort of a fund that then let
me ask what happens to that fund.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And that&#39;s a good question because a lot of these types of issues
are going to happen because I&#39;m sure that in some areas you would
not meet that full requirement and we need to make sure that you know
we&#39;ve got all the procedures in place to accomplish what it is
we&#39;re trying to accomplish but at the same time not be unrealistic
in terms of expectations. An I&#39;ll, I can get

  get a little bit more specific.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And would that include bad debt put into the charity care calculation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s a good question. I was going back to section seven, it&#39;s
calculated to provide access to Medicaid and self-pay patients at 7% of
the total revenue and there are not any particular breakdowns in terms
of bad debt and things of that nature. There again, those are the sorts
of issues that will get into the nitty-gritty when particular questions
such as this come up and we&#39;ll work through those, because
that&#39;s a legitimate question. Bad debt can be an inability to pay or
a straight out unwillingness to pay, so do you punish a facility because
of people&#39;s inability or resistance to payment? We&#39;ll work those
out. We don&#39;t have 100% of the answers to 100% of the questions.
That&#39;s why, when I work on legislation, I like having all of the
people in the room, rather than talk to this group over here and this
group over here and then come back and try to make a decision. I like
everybody to explain what their concern is and what their issue is and
what they face. Those very sorts of issues are the types of things taht
will be on the table when we sit down with the people, as [??] talked
about, the real world or where we live in conducting our business.
I&#39;m going to go to Dan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
How big of an impact do you see this having on state expenditures for
Medicare and Medicaid because of a higher cost differential?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We will be asking for a fiscal note and whether or not that&#39;s going
to be something that can be actuarily determined. We have a lot of data
on what&#39;s happened in other areas where they have made this change
but that&#39;s something that&#39;s going to come out of a fiscal
evaluation of what we see happening when we put the law in to place. It
will affect state funding and therefore warrants a state fiscal note.
Yes, Jason?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This might be along the same lines there, but do you have any kind of an
estimate on how much this would reduce overall healthcare spending in
total? And again, that might be answered in the fiscal-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not in total, but I can give you an example, just simply because of the
way the rules are written, if you open an ASC, and I&#39;m pulling
numbers off the top of my head but I feel like they&#39;re fairly
accurate, when you open an ASC you can do it under Medicaid number for a
hospital or Medicaid number as an ASC. The price differential there is
just a straight out almost 40%, So just because of the type of facility
you are and the requirements for the pricing that&#39;s allowed under
federal regulations. I&#39;ll double check those to be sure but I know
in some of our committee work, if anybody else has a, say Amen to that
or has a correction, please let me know. Yes, Rose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And so then the bill would require ambulatory surgical centers to have
relationships with hospitals so that if there&#39;s a negative outcome
and folks need to be admitted, how would that end up working?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At no time, I don&#39;t think, a doctor would want to be in any position
where he would not have privileges at a hospital. So there would
definitely be agreements. I know locally we&#39;ve actually, Wake Med is
in partnership with an ASC here locally where they work with doctors. So
this does not preclude hospitals joining these organizations with
providers and setting up an ASC. It doesn&#39;t limit who can do it and
how they can do it, that sort of thing. We&#39;re just basically saying
in order to set them up, you&#39;re not going to have to go through this
months-long, thousands and thousands of dollar process in order to get
started. Yes, Jason?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a point of clarification, so this bill would remove from the [??]
requirements, the ASC&#39;s as well as the psych beds, so I guess we
would, on the big board they would go from 25 to 23?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Actually, diagnostic centers, we&#39;re taking three off of the list.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Along the same lines, real quick, the ASC&#39;s, that&#39;s across the
board, I know at some point there had been discussion that this bill, or
a bill, would include surgery centers that focus only on single
specialties.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But that&#39;s not the case here, this would be for-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The initial bill that was put out

  <p id="35:00">
  Previously did a special carve-out set aside for single, and it was a
lot of language and manipulation, and in further discussion and looking
at the benefits and everything, it was decided to make it a clean
elimination and allow a multi-specialty.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A surgical team would be multi-specialty or--
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The state can choose. Right, yeah. Originally it would
have been single-specialty only, but we’ve decided not to put that
restriction in.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Dan had a really good question a minute ago about the
cost of Medicaid, and I think that legislators, as well as the general
public, should view CON reform as an integral supplement to Medicaid
reform as we go forward with that discussion here. Because if we’re
going to try to control costs with Medicaid, and we have to control
costs with Medicaid, we can’t continue to have 300 or 400 million dollar
cost overruns. We have to find a way to, at a macro level, control costs
about health care overall, and that will in turn, help control Medicaid
costs at the state level. So keep that in mind as we go forward with
this, but I think that is a very exciting thing to help with the state
budget as we go forward with Medicaid reform.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So you’re saying you want to get everyone to the
table. Have you had everyone at the table, or do you want to get
everyone at the table? Considering his point, have you had the hospital
association at the table, and in terms of Medicaid reform, I mean, what,
a third of the states’ hospital are running in the red, so I would guess
that they would have some objections to this, and is there a bargaining
chip around Medicaid reform?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I haven’t really looked at it from that standpoint.
It’s highly likely. But as far as sitting down and beginning to iron out
issues that’ll start with our committee process, and when I’ve worked on
bills in the past, we’ve gotten to the point where I wanted to present
something to a committee, that I felt was going to be—any legislator
wants to go to committee or on the floor of the House and say, “This
group, this group, this group, this group is supportive of my bill,” and
everybody goes, “yay!” and they don’t have to think about whether or not
they’re going to vote or do any of this kind of agonizing. So the
objective with what I hope, with the framework that we’ve got stated
here, is to bring everybody to the table, and say, “what are your
legitimate arguments? Where can we help?” and is this something
unfortunately some people are just going to have to swallow what may be
a bitter pill, and take the next step. I’m not quite sure how that going
to work out, but that’s where I see it going in terms of conversation.
There’s a point that hasn’t been brought up, and I wanted to, the
concern for a lot of people is, “oh my goodness, you’re eliminating all
the control and oversight” and all this kind of stuff. That’s not the
case with this, because there’s still licensing procedures, and
oversight that’s going to be regulated through the accreditation
standards, through Medicare conditions, participation. Those type of
regulations and strings attached, will still apply in terms of the
quality we’re required without this entry-level applications, so to
speak. You had another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah. Sort of shifting here. At one point there was
some discussion about making sure that we define a procedure room,
what’s allowed to be done in a procedure room versus an operating room.
Does this bill address any of that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It doesn’t because that’s being undertaken in a
separate figure that would just kind of cloud the issue. It is a
significant issue and we felt like it was probably a stand-alone, and it
will be addressed in another piece of legislation or committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Some of the questions have been fine-tuning
definitions of things. Charity care, and whatnot, and others have been
as far as getting everyone to the table. I just wanted to mention, that
if I was listening correctly this morning, our bill got referred to
three committees, which I think, I don’t listen that well to all the
bill referrals, frankly, because that’s time when we could get other
things done in the House. I think that’s as many as any have been
referred to in this session. Certainly not a record, I was one of the
primary sponsors on the bill that got referred to six committees last
term, but I don’t think this is, I don’t is a statement by the Speaker
like that. I think was a statement by the Speaker. But we’ll have plenty
of time and plenty of committee hearings to vet this out, make sure that
all our definitions are tight as they need to be. Make sure that we have
time to discuss it with everybody who has an opinion on this. So I just
wanted to make that clear, we did get referred to three committees
today, so we will have very good--

  <p id="40:00">
  vett this with everyone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah and Jeff brings up a really good point cause there&#39;s a lot of
areas that impact legislation. And primarily of course we&#39;re going
to help where we&#39;re going to look at what this is going to do for
people and how we&#39;re going to guarantee the safety and quality that
we want to maintain for our citizens. But we&#39;re also going to
judiciary and that goes to the point of being to make sure that when we
put a word and a comma that it means what we want it to. And to clarify
if there are any questions about what a particular procedure is or like
you said a procedure room or operating room those types of things. So
the judiciary part of it will take care of that and of course we&#39;ll
go into appropriations because as Dan made reference to we&#39;re going
to have an impact on the states budget. And we&#39;ll be able to present
and bring that out as well. So I think we&#39;ve go pretty much all the
points covered in terms of the committees where people will be and more
than likely because we&#39;ve done this in committees in the past we
will allow at some point in time in one of the other of the committees
in time to comment. So that&#39;s where I want to open it up, have it
out there have everybody know what&#39;s going on and be a part of it.
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Why does this bill stand a better chance of passing than the one you
previously introduced?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think it&#39;s just like it is with a lot of legislation down here,
circumstances and time. Health care is becoming something actually I
think everybody is a little more aware of. It&#39;s been easy in the
past to buy an insurance policy. Go to the doctor make your payment go
home and the insurance company pays their part then they send you a bill
in the end of it and I think patients now are beginning to realize this
is a commodity. Similar to any purchase that we make and we have the
ability through the information line like with the estimator to look at
where we can get the same quality because everybody all of us in here
have to make our dollars go further. And this is just giving us an
opportunity to allow that to happen and give people the opportunity to
have choices. Which currently they don&#39;t have. Any other questions
or any of the presenters like to make any closing comments? Okay, if not
thank you all again so much for coming and I&#39;m available any time
you have a question pop up.
