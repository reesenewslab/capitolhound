[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let’s pray. Lord as we gather ourselves and pause, we give you thanks
for a completed and full week of legislation. I come to you specifically
today on behalf of these blessed brothers and sisters to my left and
right. I come to you Lord because you are the fountain of every
blessing. Because in you there is no variation of shadow, there is no
change. Your love for us, your people, is relentless and its unchanging.
You chose us before we could even respond to your gift, and Lord your
love intends to help rewire our entire life, our entire culture. We try
to bring ourselves before you, as if we had everything together. We try
to come before you fit and in shape, but you remind us, Jesus, that all
the fitness you require is to feel our need for thee. In Jesus’ unending
name, I pray. Amen.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate bill 444, UNC Cherokee language.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brock is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, mister President. Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, Senate
bill 444 would direct the board of, board of governors to require the
constitute all the institutions in the UNC system to develop a policy
that the Cherokee language is recognized. It currently is only taught at
UNC Chapel Hill and at Western Carolina, and only at those two
institutions would the proficiency exam count towards credit hours. So
instead of having, they can get a total of six hours for those, but at
the other schools they would be able to require where you can waive the
foreign language requirement, so instead of taking Latin or Spanish,
they, students that have taken Cherokee language training can use that
as, to satisfy that requirement. This idea came from middle school
students from Cherokee a few years ago, and in Cherokee currently
there's an emergent process of trying to teach students in Eastern ??
the Cherokee language. Apparently out of fifteen thousand members
there's only three hundred and fifty fluent Cherokee speakers right now
in this, in the Cherokee language, and I hope this will help add more
value to the language and hopefully that other institutions will take
this up and look at it, but currently it's only taught at Western and
Chapel Hill. I urge your support of the amendment, or the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Senate bill 473, healthcare cost reduction and transparency.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mister President. Members of the Senate, yesterday we
discussed the Senate bill 473, healthcare cost reduction and
transparency act in pretty good detail during the finance committee
meeting and also prior to that we had a meeting on healthcare. There has
been some significant improvements thanks to many members of the Senate
and also stakeholders. I'm going to very briefly try to explain to you
what this bill does, and then hopefully we can support it. What it does
for the first time is make cost information on various hospital
procedures available to the people who consume that healthcare.  The
cost will include a charge for someone who is uninsured, the average
negotiated payment of uninsured persons, the Medicaid rate, the Medicare
rate, the range of commercial payments by the state health plan. All of
this is very important when a consumer, that'd be the patient, and or
either the businesses of the individuals that buy health insurance are
making the decisions as to whether that's the particular plan or the
particular healthcare that they want to purchase. What it also does is
this information that is collected from the hospitals and the ambulatory
care facilities will also be, have a repository within DHHS which will
be a part of the medical care data act. This is important because what
it, the question came out as to who owns this information.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 132: Health Curriculum/Pre-term Birth
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President and members of the senate. Senate Bill 132
requires that school health education program include instruction on the
preventable causes of pre-term birth, including abortion. The child
fatality task force unanimously voted to support this legislation at
their December 2012 meeting. The association of induced abortion with
prematurity has been reported extensively in over 125 medical
publications. An analysis done by the Fiscal Research Division in 2008
reported that annually in North Carolina, induced abortion is associated
with 745 early pre-term births, 379 deliveries that resulted in death,
119 pre-term infant deaths and 32 cases of low birth weight, suffering
from cerebral palsy. In September 2012, the Fiscal Research Division
revised its report using inflationary data to update the fiscal impact.
For 2012, the cost/consequence contribution attributable to previous
induced abortion to initial neonatal hospital costs were estimated to be
98.8 million dollars. There's remarkable similarity between the level of
risk for pre-term birth associated with smoking and and the level of
risk for pre-term birth associated with induced abortion in a previous
pregnancy. North Carolina has made significant effort to support
programs that make mothers aware of the consequences of smoking in the
outcome of pregnancy. If there's a rationale for including the risk of
smoking in pre-conception education, then there's a rationale to include
the risks of previous induced abortion. Now, we did have a vigorous
discussion the Health Committee yesterday. Out of that discussion there
was some thought that while the Child Fatality Task Force in their
recommendation didn't list any additional factors, there are some that
should possibility be considered in the health care curriculum. So we
went back to our experts at UNC, Dr. Thorpe and Dr. McCaffery and we
asked them if you were going to include some additional risk factors and
causes of premature birth, what would those be. So at this time, Mr.
President, I'd like to submit an amendment to the bill which includes
those factors and it should be on the members' dashboard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Clerk will read
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Daniels moves to amend the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Daniels recognized. Explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank You, Mr. President. The simple language of this just expands the
things that will be taught to our young people and it reads
&quot;teaches about the preventable causes of pre-term birth in
subsequent pregnancies including induced abortion, smoking, alcohol
consumption, use of illicit drugs, and inadequate pre-natal care.&quot;
I did work with Senator Stein on this amendment and he has committed to
me that supports the amendment and will support the bill, so I recommend
the amendment and certainly would recommend the bill to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any discussion or debate? Before we vote, Senators, a leave of
absence has been granted for Senator Blue. Before the Senate is the
passage of Amendment 1. All in favor, vote Aye. Opposed will vote No.
Five seconds will be allowed for voting. Clerk will record the vote.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
46 having voted in the affirmative and 1 in the negative, Amendment 1 is

Senator Kinnaird ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd like to speak on the bill but actually about an amendment which I'd
like to just briefly run by Senator Daniels. I'd like to ask him about
it. If the bill is before us, I'd like to start with what I have to say
on an amendment before we discuss the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird do you want to speak to the bill or do you want to
offer an amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Both. I will start with speaking to the bill and that will introduce
what I want to do with the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird you have the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank You. Yesterday in the Health Committee, we did hear from two
experts and one of them was Dr. McCaffery and one of the things that I
know about Dr. McCaffery is he has the Paranatal Quality Collaboration
of North Caroline and I've been privileged and fortunate to be a citizen
member of that. One of the initiatives that they are trying to do to
prevent pre-term births is to</p>

that hospitals and doctors and patients, women who are pregnant, to
understand that if you have an elective choice, that is of whether
you're going to have your baby early because your doctor is on vacation
or you're going on vacation and you do not carry that pregnancy to full
term it puts the child in jeopardy. And so what I would just like to do,
in fact that's one of the major causes of pre-term births and so I have
spoken briefly, if we could just add that one sentence to the bill in
the section where the other elective, where the other amendment did,
which would just say including elective surgical procedures undergone
after evaluation by a medical doctor and the patient.  And as I
explained what this is is that very often they'll have a cesarean or an
induced early labor just because it's inconvenient for either the doctor
or the woman and so that's all I would like to do.  If it could be added
I would appreciate it. And I'm going to send forth the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, you can send forward your amendment. Clerk
will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Kinnaird moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Kinnaird, would you like to speak to the
amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair, Mr. President.  I believe I have
explained it.  As I said one of the McAfrees own parinatal quality
collaboration has listed this as one of the major problems with pre-term
birth is where it's just simply an elective that they're going to have
the baby early because it's more convenient and they have gone around
the State working with hospitals, working with doctors, trying to
convince them that all pregnancies should be carried to full-term which
is 38 to 42 weeks and not be changed or have an early delivery just
because of the convenience of the doctor or the patient. Thank you. I
commend this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator.  Senator Daniel is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President.  I'd like to speak on the
amendment.  Basically I appreciate Senator Kinnaird's sentiments but if
you look at this amendment procedurally basically it erases every cause
we've just inserted the bill and supplants it with this one cause that
she would like to see in the bill so I would ask members to defeat the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, may I speak a second time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Kinnaird has the floor to speak a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] On the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I drew this amendment up before I knew that the other
amendment was coming and what I would like to ask is I would object to a
third reading and then perhaps we could add this.  I do not mean and
it's true the way it's written it would wipe out all the others and
that's not my intention. My intention is simply to add this one part to
the others and then I feel I can support the bill.  And I would like to
object to the third reading at the proper time where we could work out a
better solution.  Thank you. Oh yes, I will withdraw my amendment and
see if we can work something out later.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Kinnaird withdraws Amendment 2 and the
original bill is back before the body.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant, I'm sorry, for what purpose do you
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Not Robertson today. I'm happy to be Robertson if that
helps.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose do you rise, Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd like to ask the bill sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Daniel, do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Daniel, my understanding is there are several
medical experts from like the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists, the Academy of Pediatrics, the Public Health
Association/organization that find no correlation between induced
abortion and pre-term deliveries.  So would it be also appropriate under
your bill that is that we're now considering that that information can
be conveyed as well or does the correlation between induced abortion and
pre-term birth have to be conveyed as well settled and accepted science
and medical opinion across the board.  Can the differences also be
conveyed under this bill?</p>
