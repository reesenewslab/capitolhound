There are only a few of us left that served with Joe during the time he
was in the House. Representative Daughtry, Representative Howard, I
think Representative Brawley, Representative Starnes, Representative
Michaux was here also and maybe one or two more. Joe was a true
gentleman and he was a man of this House, but Mister Speaker I would be
remiss if I did not mention his greatest asset and that was his wife, or
is his wife, Jane. She is one of the kindest, most caring and devoted
political spouses I have ever known. And as we all know, being a
political spouse is not an easy task. And I am so glad that Jane and the
rest of her family can be with us this afternoon to salute a true son of
Davidson County and a true citizen of Davidson, North Carolina. Mister
Speaker, with that I commend a resolution to the house and I yield the
floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Rayne Brown, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the resolution.

?? has recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mister Speaker. It is just such a pleasure. This is one of the
great things that we get to do as part of this body and that is to
recognize folks from our districts, from our counties and in our state
that have made such a great contribution and I want to salute the family
of Joe Hege just as much as I really want to salute him for all that he
did for us. I first started thinking about running for this seat and
this is Joe's seat. This was Joe's seat that I now have. I started
thinking about running in 2007 and the party told me, they said before
you decide you need to go and talk to two of the party elders. And one
of those party elders, one of those individuals was Joe Hage. And I
always, always so appreciated the advice that he gave me. He always gave
me his time and that was most appreciated. And something that doesn't
sound like such a big deal, he let me put my sign in his yard. Well if
you knew Representative Hege, he had very definite ideas on who was
going to put a sign in his yard and when we were going to put it in his
yard and where it was going to be placed. So when he told me that I
could, I was just thrilled. And every time that I would go by his house
on the way to mine, I would look out in his yard and there was Howard
Coble, his son in law who's here with us today, and my sign. And I never
took that for granted because he was endorsing me and that was a big
deal and it got my name out and in 2008 I needed all the help I could
get. So I really appreciated that. I didn't know Representative Hege
quite as well as I would've liked. I do know members of his family quite
well. His daughter Karen is a former member, well she's still a member
of the Republican Women. She was a former officer. She's also a longtime
educator and retired now, spending time with grandchildren and I'm just
a little, no a lot envious of that. Sam Watford, her husband, is a
county commissioner in Davidson county. I guess I know Sam better than I
know anybody, any member of the family. He's also a former chairman of
our Davidson County Board of Commissioners. And like Jerry said, I just
love Jane. And any time I want to see Jane, I'm gonna go to her church.
I was at her church Saturday night and got to see her. Pilgrim's Reform
has pretty much built their church on the backs of chickens. Chicken pie
and chicken and dumplings and in my part of the county, that's just what
you do. So when they have these dinners, you always go. And every time I
go, there's Jane running around like a sixteen year old and serving the
church she loves so much and I appreciate that. So I guess what I'm
trying to say and you heard Representative Hege's unbelievable resume.
Mine looks so bare in comparison. And so what I'm trying to say is these
are people of service but they're also people who have sacrificed so
much to have him here. And there's not a body in this room that doesn't
know what it's like to leave every Monday morning. And this man left not
every Monday morning for weeks and months and years. He left for 18
years. And we also know that if our families don't support us for what
we do in this place, we are either not here or we're not here very long.
And this was a family that supported to the fullest extent possible. His
service to our state and to our county. And I just want them to know how
much I appreciate all that they've meant to me, to Davidson county, to
this state. They continue to serve, they continue to sacrifice their
time.</p>

Representative: …how we needed to do it. The thing that I will always
remember about Joe Hagey, is his love for his wife, Jane Hagey. You
didn’t speak to Joe for a minute without him bringing up his family,
particularly his wife, and how supportive she was of him and had always
been, how much he cared for his children, church and neighbors. That is
the type of person that Joe Hagey was and I am a better person for just
having the opportunity of calling Joe Hagey a friend. For those of you
who never knew Joe, he did leave a legacy here that you can certainly
follow and follow proudly.

The Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the
conferees appointed to resolve the differences between the Senate and
the House of Representatives on Senate Bil 4, a bill to be entitled An
Act to Clarify the State's Intent Not to Operate a State Run or
Partnership Health Benefit Exchange and to Provide that Future Medicaid
Eligibility Determinations will be Made by the State Rather than the
Federally Facilitated Exchange and to Reject the Affordable Care Act's
Optional Medicaid Expansion. The conferees recommend that the Senate and
the House of Representatives adopt this report. Conferees for the
Senate: Senator Apodaca, chair; Senators Rucho, Hise and Brown.
Conferees for the House of Representatives: Representative Burr, chair;
Representative Dollar, Avila and Brisson.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Representative Burr, please state your purpose.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
To speak on the conference report.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
The gentleman is recognized for a motion and to speak on the conference
report.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you Mister Speaker. I move that we adopt the conference report
that is before us and would like to speak on that.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you Mister Speaker. What we have is, we had a debate a week before
last on Senate Bill 4 and the bill went back to the Senate. They did not
concur, as we found and had a few technical issues to work out with the
bill to make sure the language was correct and that we were properly
appropriating the funds for the NC FAST. Basically, the language
continues to make sure that as we  say no to the state base and the
partnership exchange and no to the Medicaid expansion that we're really
pressing the reset button to go back to how the funds were appropriated
for the Medicaid IT system and those types of things before the
Affordable Care Act as it's called was brought down and the department
started working on that.
So again, it is technical changes to the language which you can find at
the bottom of page 1 of the bill now and also on page 2, the first 3
lines there, along with lines 17 through 19 of page 2 for those of you
trying to see the difference of the bill. So simply making sure that we
have the appropriate language to make sure we can continue to develop
our NC FAST program so that it can do it's job and make sure that we are
able to provide
the Medicaid eligibility determination for those folks that may be
coming onto Medicaid through a federally based exchange. So with that,
Mister Speaker, I think that the debate really last week covered the
bill. We've been there and had that discussion and now this is just a
technical piece that I would ask for members to support. Thank you.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Representative Insko, please state your purpose.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
To speak on the motion.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
The lady is recognized to debate the motion.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you Mister Speaker. Members, we're voting today on a conference
report to approve a bill that leaves some critically important issues
unresolved. Most of our debate was on Medicaid expansion but the
Affordable Care Act provisions affect all of the health insurance plans,
both inside and outside the market. So the issues of the exchange are
also very important and how we, the fact that we. The bill that we're
passing, the conference report that we're passing, would really take a
hands off approach for the state of North Carolina. Let the feds do it
all.
Because our health insurance agents, our health insurance companies have
to turn in their reports for 2014 with their rates and their plans,
their report is due in the Department of Insurance in April Because
those provisions in the Affordable Care Act both affect the plans both
inside and outside the exchange, some issues have been left unresolved.
Let me just give an example of one, for example, is the Affordable Care
Act requires states to establish geographic rating areas. That's not
something you want to federal government to do. The state really needs
to take care of that. I have 3 pages of recommendations here that are
really highly technical but many of them are issues that the state
really should take responsibility for. Because we didn't resolve those
issues, here are some of the consequences. There may be a lack</p>

Have access and competition in certain regions of the state, especially
in the rural areas. We may have unaffordable premiums for certain
populations in certain markets. We may have discrepancies between the
exchange and the non-exchange market that could lead to adverse
selection or other intended consequences.
If we don’t have some controls, we may end up with all the sick people
in the exchange and all the well people outside the exchange. We should
really unbalance the rating system in the state. For those reasons, I’ll
be voting no on the conference report and I urge you to join me so we
can get these issues resolved.
[Speaker]: Representative Farmer Butterfield, please state your purpose.
[Representative Butterfield]: Speak on the conference report.
[Speaker]: Lady is recognized to debate the motion.
[Representative Butterfield]: Today we continue rushing to have no
Medicaid expansion and no State Health Exchange. There is certainly
nothing I can do about it. I do want to read my objections into the
record however, because future generations look at this legislature in
the harsh light of history, I want them to see that some of us stood up
and said what we are doing is wrong. It is wrong to accept this
conference report.
Now I know that some have been pointing to an audit and blaming the
Federal Government, but weeks before the Medicaid Audit was released,
even months, the expansion of Medicaid and acceptance of the state
Health Exchange, was already decided by many of my colleagues in this
room. Let’s stop pretending this was about policy. This is about
politics. What you’re doing today is wrong.
It is wrong because expanding Medicaid to 500, 000 newly eligible people
would save nearly 3000 lives every year. New England Journal of
Medicine. It is wrong because rejecting facts that the Institute of
Medicine has clearly provided to all of us, 100% of 3 years would be
Federal dollars and at least 93% Federal the following 3 years. In fact
I’ve heard ranges from 93 to 95 percent during these three years.
Only in the 7th year would it be 90% Federal funding. Keep in mind that
we can opt out of this expansion if we so desire at any point in time
along the way. It is wrong because 7 Republican Governors have agreed to
Medicaid expansion in their states. In fact the Governor of Ohio in
reminding his fellow GOP Legislators said he’s taking lessons from the
Bible in that the weak and the vulnerable should not be left behind.
The Governor of Florida, Rick Scott, a Republican who’s a former
hospital executive, campaigned against President Obama’s Affordable Care
Act, and he fought the law in court. He, however, is to be commended.
He’s had a change of heart. A quote, this is the countries greatest in
the world, he said and it’s the greatest largely because of how we value
the weakest among us.
The Governor of Ohio invoked his faith as well. He said, I can’t look at
the disabled. I can’t look at the poor I can’t look at the mentally ill.
I can’t look at the addicted and think we ought to ignore them. But
those that live in the shadows of life, those who are the least among us
I will not accept the fact that the most vulnerable in our state should
be ignored. We can help them. Governor of Ohio. Ladies and gentleman,
let’s do what is right. Let’s be co-workers with God. Vote no to the
conference call. Examine your conscious and vote no. Thank you.
[Speaker]: Representative Queen, please state your purpose.

[Speaker]: The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[Representative Queen]: I rise in the last two weeks as we’ve been
considering this Medicaid Expansion Bill, many of us have been informed
on it. We’ve been reading every day trying to get up on it as we make
this decision. But one thing I will point out to everybody in this body,
we are turning</p>

Around twenty three thousand new jobs in this, approving this conference
report. Those twenty three thousand workers who would be serving the
under-served, uninsured citizens of our state will pay more taxes to
this legislature with good jobs than the 10% spread that would be the
state share. So the jobs more than pay for the 10% in the years out. So
we have a net loss of revenue, a net loss of jobs and a net loss of our
citizens’ taxed dollars that left this state and go to Washington and
are being denied to come back. So again, I just restate the common sense
that we need to, to look to when we consider this Bill. I encourage you
to vote no on this and let’s continue to look at it and make this
possibility real for North Carolina. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blust, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr Speaker and members of the House, first of all it’s getting
a little tedious to hear this constant cacophony that we over here are
doing things not for good policy but for politics or that we’re doing
things from bad motives and we’re for the greedy over the needy. And
some of this stuff really should wait for your, I don't ’now, your
Jefferson Jack dinners or your, your
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? going on. The gentleman we all ??. Representative Brandon, please
state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Take the gentleman for ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blust, I understand what you said. I know it does get
tedious but my question to you during the conference report through your
offices, did you decide to come up with a plan for they have started not
to use the plan. Is there a plan? Is there a plan to discover?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. The alternative plan and I had read some articles when this was
before the floor earlier. If you’d read them, there are plans in there
but the plans are going to require some federal action. This is not
something the state can solve. This is not something that is a state
issue. We’re mixed up in a Bill, there’s a federalism issue here. We’ve
mixed up in a Bill that has been foisted upon this country and the Bill,
and I don’t want to get into that here because that’s a whole another
discussion but the Bill is fundamentally flawed and is not going to be
able to last because of simple arithmetic given incentives in the
perversion sentence created and the whole Bill is going to collapse on
itself, it’s already starting. If you’d read about things like the
lowest cost plan for a family it’s going to be twenty thousand dollars
plus the cost estimates go up almost by the day. The number of people
who’re going to be dumped from their private insurance is going up every
day. And nobody wants to try to deal with this in a thoughtful manner.
It’s just easier to say, ‘well, this is going to hurt the poor and
you’re for the greedy’ and leave it at that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I still have a question. Do you have a plan?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The plan is to stick to our ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The House will come to order. When a member is recognized to ask a
question, the member will ask the question. The member will yield until
the question is complete and then the member asking the question will
not raise a follow-up question until the member has responded to the
question. This is a gentleman of a follow-up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do have a follow-up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is the gentleman
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My question is that is there a Bill number or something that we can see
that there’s a concrete plan for the five hundred thousand people that
are not going to have health insurance because of this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh! Representative Brandon, no. The answer is no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And there’s no implication in that answer because your figures are
flawed. And that was another point I was going to make. You find these
figures and make these, these claims that have no basis in the reality
of what happens in the real world. Five hundred thousand, that’s one of
the biggest flaws behind those who are up, who want the expansion. Five
hundred thousand new people who aren’t covered now. And there’s been
studies and it’s hard to get an accurate count from the studies. I’m
sure there’ll be real world changes but the studies show are those five
hundred thousand, probably more than half. Some say 80% are already
covered by private insurance.</p>

<p id="45:00">
And they're just gonna simply be dumped onto Medicaid, a hundred percent
of the payment which will be borrowed from future generations, instead
of paid for as they are now, by employees or employers in the real
world. So it's not doing this great service to humanity by expanding the
roles of the uninsured. Those are inflated claims, designed, and I'll
try to be politically astute here and not say scam artists or something
like that, but they're designed to sell something that people wouldn't
buy if they could calmly reflect on the facts. The same with these
23,000 jobs, it's based on flawed, Keynesian modeling, the same type
that said the stimulus bill was gonna create all these jobs. So the
great benefits aren't gonna be there, but the cost is, the cost to
future generations is. It makes no sense to take people who are now
privately insured, dump them onto Medicaid, which has its own internal
problems, and borrow that money for future generations. Now one reason
Medicaid is not as good a deal is, and what's gonna happen here we all
know it, to fix Medicaid in the future, if we expand numbers on
Medicaid, we're gonna end up cutting the reimbursement to the providers.
That's gonna create an incentive on providers, some to drop out, from
seeing Medicaid patients entirely, that doesn't help the poor, that
doesn't comport with the Bible. They'll drop out of Medicaid, so the
choices to current Medicaid recipients will shrink, then they'll be
cost-shifting, cost-shifting was mentioned the other day. There's more
cost-shifting from Medicaid than there are from uninsured. In Ohio in
2010, hospitals lost 1.1 billion on the uninsured, they lost 1.3 billion
on Medicaid because the reimbursement rates are lower. So we're creating
this continual spiral of perverse incentives that's gonna collapse the
whole system, and it needs a rework. There's just a whole lot more
reasons, some philosophical, about taking debt and putting it on future
generations, but this is not a good idea, people who have expertise in
state budgets are saying, are warning us, that the Medicaid expansion,
the Medicaid we have now is on an unsustainable pace, we don't know how
to deal with this situation now, it's not free money. Everyone in here
knows, if you would admit it, that the federal government in the future,
on a deficit reduction plan, is gonna change the reimbursement. So the
idea this is free, federal manna from heaven is not, its not, its got no
basis in reality, so we ought not to be basing policy on that. And I'm
sorry, I'm not gonna apologize and I'm not gonna wear your tags and
agree that yeah, I'm doing this because I'm bad and it's bad policy and
I don't care about the poor. Care about the poor has done more to hurt
the poor than anything I can think of, and like I was saying at first,
some of this rhetoric needs to be left to your county conventions where
the true believers are gonna lap this up, that those awful Republicans
wanna help the rich, they, they wanna stick it to the poor, and we'll go
to our county conventions in Lincoln days and say, those Democrats, they
don't even understand the economy and they want all this to fail. And
our true believers will lap that up and it's so easy to preach to the
home crowd, but in here it does get tiring to get constantly accused of
ill will and bad motives, and it doesn't stand up to cold, calculated,
good analysis of what's going on because this expansion will not help
the poor, it's just gonna increase the day when the whole health care
system collapses. And I wonder if that's not the true aim of the whole
law is to get these insurance companies out of business, go to a single
payer. So there are good reasons to support this conference report and
to not expand the Medicaid, and I urge your support for the bill, the,
the conference report.
[Speaker Changes] Ladies and Gentlemen of the house, we began this

The gentleman's purpose was to turn off his light.  Representative
Collins, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Believe it or not, I do owe all of us in this house the favor, and I
think the courtesy of reading whenever you put on my desk.  So I read
this thing today called conscience vs. politics.  It's been referred to
already in this meeting.  But I notice that of those republican
governors who accepted this Federal money, as I read this a little more
closely, I found some other things other than just conscience in there.
Florida governor Rick Scott, who's already been quoted, had this to
say.&quot; With Federal funds covering the cost, I cannot in good
conscience deny Floridians that need it to access healthcare.&quot;
That's with Federal funds playing the cost.  I noticed Governor Jan
Brower, from Arizona, had a similar comment.  She said, with this move,
we will secure a Federal revenue stream.  Even the article's author
here, who I don't know, Dana Milbank, said states are deciding this deal
is simply too good to pass up.  It seems to me, the common thing among
these republican governors who have agreed to this is not that is
necessarily a great yet, but the body will confuse David Brooks with
Sean Hannity, or Rush Limbaugh, or anyone like that.  And this article
is called Americans sacrificed the future for the president.  And in
here, he went on to say that when Europeans first came to this land,
they were known for sacrificing the present for the future.  They would
put up with tough circumstances, and hew out their living
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lucas, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wonder if representative Collins would yield for question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will as soon as I finish.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentlemen will yield at the end of his comments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And it talked about how they would sacrifice the present for the future.
 And because of that, our government used to invest most of its money in
future-oriented things that had long range effects like railroads and
canals and things like that.  But today, Mr. Brooks says, and I quote,
today, Americans have inverted this way of thinking.  Americans now
sacrifice the future for the sake of the present.  Federal spending is
the most obvious example.  The Federal government is a machine that
takes money from future earners and spends it on health care for
retirees.  He goes on to say, and this is before Obamacare that for
current obligations, that the Federal government already has, we're not
talking about expanding anything, for the current obligations it already
has, and I quote, according to the International Monetary Fund, again
this is not some conservative think tank, young people will have to pay
35% more taxes and receive 35% fewer benefits.  Now, I also know that
when Medicare was first proposed, we were talking about the mid 1990s,
it would cost a total of five trillion dollars.  That cost wound up
being 90 trillion dollars.  Stay you take whatever Obamacare has been
projected to cost through the years and multiply by a factor of 18.  And
my question is, when does enough become enough?  When we tax our
grandchildren 50% more, for 50% fewer benefits?  When we tax them 75%
more for 75 fewer benefits?  When is it enough?  To me, it's already
enough.  To me, it's way too much, and as I'm going to support this
conference report, and I will answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lucas, the gentleman may state his question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Representive Collins, I listened to your
rhetoric there.  In light of your position, are you willing to lead the
charge to refuse any Federal funding for highway I-540?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lukas, I wish I could unentangle all the ways in which
the Federal government has got involved with our state, just like I wish
I could unentangle the way our state has gotten involved with private
enterprise.  I was on a CON committee, and the document was probably two
or three hundred pages, the laws that hospitals and providers have to go
through to meet our government demands.  If I could wave a magic wand,
and do away with every bit of that, yes I would be able to.  But
unfortunately, we've got to peck away and deal with one issue at a time,
and I wish we could do away with all Federal funding, but unfortunately
they take a lot of money from us, and sometimes we have to get some of
it back.  So, I can't do away with it all in one broad brush.  If I
could, I would be happy to do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Second question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentlemen yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are you willing to vote no on receiving any funds from funding I-540?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I really don't know because I don't know anything about that issue, at
this point.  I'll have to be educated on that.  I'm not sure if that's
come before us or not.  I don't like to form opinions on issues I don't
have any knowledge about, and I don't have the knowledge about that
issue.  Thank you.

Lucas?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Lucas.  I apologize.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

<p id="55:00">
you say. You are aware of course that Medicaid is an entitlement
program, and the funds that you are talking about in terms of
transportation funds or other education funds, those carry no
entitlement with them. Are you aware of that? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollar, I’m aware of that, but I’m also aware that all of
these funds come from the federal government, and I keep hearing that
the federal government is broke and that we shouldn’t take any and I
agree that they are 16 trillion dollars in hole, but I also hear that we
shouldn’t take certain phases, certain segments of this money, but we
ought to take others, and my contingent is that if we feel that way, we
ought not take any money if we want to get them out of the hole.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] So you are aware then that if you take on these additional
people, you are taking on, and unlike transportation funds, unlike
education and all these other funds that we receive from the federal
government, you are taking on an obligation for an entitlement that
means that whenever that individual comes into contact with a service of
some sort that is in your state plan, you are obligated to pay those
moneys and to pay those bills whether the state has the money or not and
whether the federal government is covering the full cost or not. You’re
aware of that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I am aware of that, and I also am aware
that we don’t have the state money to match any of the highway funds,
although I agree that we ought to be building those, but I place a
difference, to me there’s a difference between human lives and tangible
objects like highways. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the motion briefly, Mr.
Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Just three
quick points, one of them a new point that just came across the media a
few minutes ago. I appreciate Representative Jean Farmer-Butterfield’s
pointing out seven governors, but there’s now an eighth. Governor
Christie has just announced that he’ll become the latest governor to
accept the Medicaid money, changing and reversing his decision earlier.
Second point, Representative Blust is correct I think that about the 500
thousand, it’s really not 500 thousand; it’s 625 thousand over three
years, according to the Institute of Medicine, that would be covered.
Third point, the argument that the federal government may not keep the
money coming I think is a good one. I think this easily was addressed in
one of the amendments and the process we talked about, but to say that
we can’t cover someone in perpetuity is a reason not to cover them now I
think is not a valid argument, and finally, for me at least, the
continuing debate on the floor that attacks the Affordable Care Act
ideologically, or supports it as the greatest thing since sliced bread
[AUDIO CUTS OUT FROM 3:00 – 3:18] and I would hope that the majority is
true in its word that it is going to try to fix the ?? so that we can
come back to the real issue of covering these people and reconsider this
issue at a later date if it’s not able to be passed today. For all the
reasons that everyone else has spoken, I absolutely oppose the
conference report and think the wrong policy choice is being made, but
hope [AUDIO CUTS OUT FROM 3:49 – 4:02] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Just to speak briefly on the conference report. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House. I know we’ve
had this, and I’ve read some of the article. I don’t feel any better
about it today than I did then, but then I’ve read some of the articles
that have been put before us, and I think the one that impresses me the
most is the one that was presented by the [AUDIO SKIPS] … least of
these, you do it unto me. It reminds us of what the Bible says that if
you do it unto the least of these, you do it unto me. He reminds us of
that, that the weak and the vulnerable [AUDIO SKIPS] … from your
districts left behind, and I’m sure that many of you have had folk from
your district to come and talk to you as this bill has been passed out.</p>

&lt;h3&gt;and many of these providers were really counting on this
Medicaid expansion to not only help with new people but with the current
people that they serve. I was to help to support them that they some of
those, because they cannot continue to put forth the dollars to help the
support them that they too will go without insurance. So, again, I would
just remind us to have some compassion for people who don't have the
health insurance that you have. For the least of these. And take your
lessons from the bible, who teaches us to do the right thing. Vote

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the motion a 2nd time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Mainly what I want to do is to make a correction about the
issue whether these people are actually insured or uninsured. These
actually are currently uninsured people. There are studies done, the
national census data, the Kaiser family foundation, Families US, our own
institute of medicine established that number. I believe that the issue
that was raised before about how 80% of these people would be currently
insured people is just not, that is not, that is a reference to a
national study. I think if you've read it at all, the data from the
national study do not apply to North Carolina. You have to use North
Carolina data because of our, because Medicaid eligibility is so low.
People who will be covered under the expansion are currently not
enrolled. So we will be , those really are uninsured people who now need
our help. They need our compassion. And I hope that you will take the
time to make it right. Thank you.

him. this bill is is you recall how we pass this bill very early in the
session. it allows group times when the times being about individuals
were developmentally disabled or mentally ill to be able to access those
temporary funds that we recreated last year to get those facilities open
while we are working on a longer term solution to a number of issues
that are that are going on with our long-term care industry. in addition
what the Senate added was a piece that several people have asked about,
but that we were still working on wedding when it left the house and
that was taking care of what are called the special care units. those
are the Alzheimer's units in those instances, individuals were still
qualifying for the most part for the Medicaid optional services,
personal care services. however away the right structure was was  having
an impact on their financial situation of financial situation of these
the Alzheimer's unit special care units of the Senate. we worked on the
language the Senate added that language. so now we are dealing with the
we got a bill, but it addresses both of those issues through the end of
June and we hope to certainly have legislation following July first to

today. Couple of things I would remind you of. The ethics training that
occurs immediately after session today. Make every attempt to be there.

least one matter that we’re working on or at least have a skeleton
session so for now you should still plan on 1 pm but that will be
dependent upon other matters that we’re trying to sort out. Frankly it’s
probably more likely than not we will have to have one for other reasons
