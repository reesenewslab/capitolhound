  The House will come to order. Members please take your seats. Visitors
are asked to retire from the chamber. Sergeant in arms will close the
doors. Members and visitors, please silence all electronic devices.
Today&#39;s prayer is gonna be offered by Representative Grier Martin.
We ask all members and all of our guests visiting with us in the gallery
to please stand and to please remain standing for the pledge of
allegiance after the prayer. Representative Martin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, in one week, we will celebrate the 70th anniversary of the
American landings on the island of Iwo Jima. At the end of that five
week long battle, 6,000 American sailors and marines lay dead and 19,000
wounded. At the dedication of the fifth marine dedication cemetary on
Iwo Jima, Navy Lieutenant Chaplain Rolan B. Gittelsohn delivered a
sermon. I hope you&#39;ll permit me to quote one small portion from that
sermon. Chaplain Gittelsohn said, we dedicate ourselves first to live
together in peace the way they fought and are buried in war. Here lie
men who loved America because their ancestors generations ago helped in
her founding, and other men who loved her with equal passion because
they themselves or their fathers escaped from oppression to her blessed
shores. Here lie officers and privates, blacks and whites, rich and poor
together. Here are Protestants, Catholics, and Jews together. Here no
man prefers another because of his faith, or despises him because of his
color. Here there are no quotas for how many of each group are admitted
or allowed. Among these men there is no discrimination, no prejudice, no
hatred. Theirs is the highest and purest democracy. Please join me in
prayer. Dear God, we are your imperfect servants who have been entrusted
by your people to affect democracy here on Earth. Lead us to serve
others with humility, with love, and with devotion. Free us from hate,
from jealousy, and from anger. Be with us and guide us as we aspire to
create as high and pure a democracy as we can in a violent and chaotic
world. I offer this prayer, myself, in Jesus name in a great nation
where Christian, Jew, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, and all faiths worship
freely. For this and our many freedoms, I give thanks to you, God. Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to
the Republic, for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.
