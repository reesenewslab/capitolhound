has a master's in Scripture and Theology from St. Mary's Divinity

you for entrusting with us the responsibility of leading the people of
North Carolina. And we ask that you would restore within us the wisdom,
disernage, and integrity we need to serve them well. As we open the
session we ask that you would refresh up with hope, reinvigorate us with
endurance, and renew us with vision. Unify us Lord in purpose and grant
us the courage to become leaders who act justly, love mercifully, and
walk humbly. Teach us how to defend the weak, maintain the rights of the
poor, and proclaim liberty for the oppressed, until every woman, child,
and man has the opportunity to realize his or her full potential for
freedom. Open our eyes to see your image and those we serve as well as
in each other. Today we honor the faithfulness and protection you have
afforded to our state by praying as you taught us, Our Father who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy Name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on
earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. and forgive
us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead
us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. For thine is the
kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.[SPEAKER

Thank you Mr. speaker. and ladies and gentlemen of the house. its an

anniversary. We're a small county, but we have some big hearted people.
The town of Conway is located in north Hampton county,and can be traced
back to the 1700's. It was known as Kirby township. The name Kirby is
derived from Thomas Kirby Sr. who received a Patton for 1200 acres.
Conway was actually settled around 1835, and was known as martin
crossroads. a deed in north Hampton county court house records purchase
of land by john martin in 1742. The year 1888 brought a railroad to
martin cross roads. a small depot was built and the conductor of the
train decided that the depot should be called Conway. In the name of a
relative of a chief railroad official. In rural north Carolina that's
how a lot of names were just picked out of the air the town I live in

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Whereas more than a century ago, hunters, anglers,and trappers were
among the first conservationists who realized America’s natural
resources were in peril and could not sustain unregulated harvest and
habitat destruction. And whereas hunters, anglers, and trappers took it
upon themselves to support laws that stopped excessive harvest of fish
and wildlife and established game and fish agencies to protect fish,
wildlife in their habitats and supported special fishing and hunting
license fees to help fund the new agencies efforts to provide for
healthy natural resources for future generations. And whereas the
Members of the House of Representative then and now recognize the
primary authority to protect and manage fish and resident wildlife
within their borders resides in the State fish and wildlife agencies.
And whereas upon realizing that license fees alone were insufficient to
restore and sustain healthy fish and wildlife populations, hunters,
anglers and trappers supported excised taxes on firearms, ammunition,
archery equipment, hunting equipment, and fishing equipment to raise
additional funds to support restoration and enhancement efforts of the
state agencies. And whereas this user pay public benefit system became
known as the Wildlife and Sports Fish Restoration Program that began 75
years ago with the passage of the Federal Aid to Wildlife Restoration
Act in 1937, which was known as the Pittman Robinson Act after its
principle sponsors Senator Key Pittman of Nevada and Representative
Absalom Willis Robinson of Virginia. Whereas Pittman Robinson Act was
then fostered with the passage of the Federal Aid on Sports Fish
Restoration Act in 1950 and further expanded with the Wallop=Breaux
Amendment in the Sports Fish Restoration Act.</p>

1984, and whereas the combined contribution of wildlife and sport
fishing restoration programs to state fish and wildlife agencies exceeds
$13,000,000,000 since 1939, the first year that money was distributed
into the states, more than any other single conservation effort in
American history, which constitutes collectively the American System of
conservation funding.  And whereas, the manufacturers of firearms,
ammunition, hunting, fishing, boating equipment have collected excise
taxes on firearms, ammunition, archery equipment manufactured fishing
tackle, electric trolling motors, marine electronics and motor boat fuel
and distributed these funds to states through the United States fish and
wildlife service, and whereas the manufacturers of firearms, ammunition,
hunting, fishing and boating equipment have supported the wildlife and
sportfishing restoration programs, and continue to exhibit a  spirit of
cooperation with the state fish and wildlife agencies, and whereas the
cooperative partnership between industry, hunters, anglers, trappers,
boaters,  recreational shooters, United States fish and wildlife service
and state natural resources agency has resulted in the most successful
model of fish and wildlife management in the world, restoring
populations from coast to coast in Alaska and in Hawaii.  Now therefore,
be resolved by the house of representatives, section one, the house of
representatives honors the memory of United States senator Key Pittman,
of Nevada, and representative Absalom Williams Robertson of Virginia,
and expresses its appreciation for the public service they rendered.
Section two.  The house of representatives recognizes America's hunters,
anglers, trappers, boaters, recreational shooters, industry state fish
and wildlife agencies, and United States fish and wildlife service for
their leading role in restoring healthy populations of fish, wildlife
and other natural resources, both game and non game, to the abundance we
see today through the wildlife exports, fish restoration programs in
this, the 75th anniversary year of America's greatest conservation
story, supported by the American System of conservation funding.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Members of the body, a little over two years
ago, when I was fortunate enough to be elected to the general assembly,
I was walking around the building on the first floor here, trying to
find my office, much like Leo Daughtry mentioned when we recognized the
50th anniversary this building some time ago.  And, while I was looking
for my office, a senior member of the body ask me if I hunted or I
fished.  I said, well I fish.  And he said, congratulations, you're now
the house chair of the sportsmen's caucus.  So be careful the questions
that you ask, because you're not exactly sure what the outcome of that's
going to be.  Having been a lifelong fishermen, and also the father of
three sons, I can tell you that hunting and fishing are woven into the
DNA of not only my family, but just about every citizen of our great
state.  In 2011 alone, the hunting and angling and trapping sports
contributed over $2.3 billion to our state's economy.  That's equivalent
to $6.3 million per day, wages of $1.2 billion, Federal taxes of
280,000,000, state and local taxes of 249,000,000, for an overall $3.7
billion contribution to our economy.  So on behalf of the congressional
sportsmen's foundation, the national assembly of sportsmen's caucus is,
the North Carolina sportsmen's caucus, the North Carolina wildlife
commission, as well as nearly two million hunters, anglers and trappers
in our state, I commend the resolution to you.

possible.  And I know at least we were kindred spirits.  As somebody

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Whereas the town of Salem, who was established in 1766
by members of the Moravian Church to administer their colony in North
Carolina called Wachovia and the town became an important center for
business and commerce in Northwest North Carolina and was incorporated
by the Act of the North Carolina General Assembly in 1857. Whereas the
town of Winston was established immediate north of Salem to serve as the
county seat upon the formation of Forsythe County in 1849, was
incorporated by Act of the North Carolina General Assembly in 1859, and
experienced remarkable growth during the latter half of the 19th
century. And Whereas, following decades of cooperation in civic affairs,
the citizens of Winston and Salem voted to consolidate their municipal
governments as the City of Winston-Salem by an Act of the North Carolina
General Assembly, this consolidation took effect May 9th, 1913. And
Whereas, the new town was led by Mayor Oscar B. Eaton and Aldermen E.D.
Vaughn, C.M. Teen, G.E. Webb, P.S. Bailey, N.D. Dowdy, G.W. Edwards,
H.F. Chaffner, and F.A. Foil, and has since been led by a succession of
able elected officials. And Whereas, Winston-Salem was North Carolina's
leading city during the 1920's and gave rise to such national
corporations as R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Wachovia Bank and Trust
Company, Hanes Knitting, Hanes Dye and Finishing, and Piedmont Airlines.
And Whereas, Winston-Salem served as a model for other cities during the
civil rights era by establishing the North Carolina's first integrated
fire house in 1951, peacefully desegregating the schools in 1957 and
providing the first North Carolina victory of the sit-in movement in
1960. And Whereas, Winston-Salem has long been nationally recognized for
leadership in the arts, having established the nation's first arts
council in 1949. And service as home to the University of North Carolina

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lambeth is recognized to debate the
resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. North Carolina is knitted together from our
many small towns to our large, urban cities. From our mountains to our
coast. This is what makes North Carolina great. One hundred years ago,
the leaders from two prominent industrial towns, Winston and the town of
Salem came together and through their visionary leadership formed a new
innovative and vibrant city, Winston-Salem. Winston-Salem thrived in the
20's as home to national corporations such as R.J. Reynolds, Wachovia
Bank, Hanes and Piedmont Airlines. Winston-Salem grew as a leader in
education with seven institutions of higher learning. As time has gone
by, Winston-Salem has grown into a leader in healthcare, medical
research and biotechnology. Winston-Salem is widely recognized as a
leader in the arts with numerous museums, galleries and festivals, while
establishing the nation's first arts council. Winston-Salem was
recognized as one of America's top 10 digital cities, most livable
cities, places to retire, and a top 25 location for biotechnology.
Winston-Salem blends a diverse community with its Moravian heritage to
form a great place to work and live. Thanks to the leadership of capable
elected officials today and in the past. As a token of appreciation for
the work of this House, the leadership of the city debated on whether
they should bring Crispy Creme donuts or Dewey's sugar cookies. And I
hope you recognize and have received by now your Dewey's cookies as a
token of appreciation for all your efforts for what you're doing for the
State of North Carolina. I commend the resolution for your approval.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lambeth, I think the Chair and many
members have a point of order. Where are the cookies?

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brawley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I may offer the body a point of information.
They're on a table right next to the coffee and when you go to get your
cup of coffee you will be able to get a nice can of cookies and having
already opened them I will testify to the quality of these cookies.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Chair understands you have had two cans already.
Representative Terry, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, very much, Mr. Speaker. As you have heard,
we are celebrating Winston-Salem's centennial and I stand before you as
a proud member of the Winston-Salem's Centennial Commission. And
everything that the resolution says is true. It's wonderful. We are
very, very proud of our city. But I stand here as one of the persons who

Dr. Brown’s work in education help move us along as a state, as a
nation, and her legacy along with so many other women, both across this
state and this nation made an indelible impression on our world.  And,
so this month’s celebration hopefully will continue to uplift and
reinforce our children, to the men and to the young women in particular
to study the history, and to learn of the many significant contributions
that women have made, and to recognize that many of the rights that we
enjoy today were born out of struggle and sacrifice, of so many people
who came before us.  I’m pleased that members of the house to recommend
the resolution to you.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Representative Michaux pleas state your purpose.
SPEAKER CHANGES
To speak on the resolution.
SPEAKER CHANGES
The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentleman of the house, during my lifetime
women have had a profound effect on what has happened to me in the past
and hopefully in the future.  My mother who was a school teacher, had me
reading from Grimm’s fairy tales and Aesop’s fables by the time I was
four years old, and not only did she me to read but she taught me to
understand what I was reading.  And then, my wife a few years has put up
with my shenanigans over the time including how I get up at three
o’clock in the morning to figure out what devilment that I can bring to
this body to keep you all on your toes.  And then there is my daughter
who has a son here today who’s my grandson as a Paige.  All of these
people have had a profound influence on my life, and I want to pay
particular- my wife really has had to put up with something much as
which as you all have had to put up with.
The person that I want to talk about a bit is the honoraree in this
resolution.  My seatmate was right I knew Dr. Brown personally.  In
1943, my mother and father decided I needed to be sent somewhere where I
can broaden my horizons other than staying in Durham.  And they decided
to send me to Palmer Memorial Institute in Sedalia, North Carolina.  And
I gladly accepted it, and I really took a loss but when I got to the
camp the first person I met was Dr. Brown.
Now, in describing her; Ernie Barnes who was an artist has a portrait of
a little ol’ African American woman standing at a bus stop with a bag of
groceries in her arms, and she does not have the figure of a Venus de
Milo nor, the smile of a Mona Lisa; but you can see in that person how
she could become what we call the “Rock of Ages”, and that’s the way Dr.
Brown was.  She was short, dark, hair wasn’t straightest in the world,
but, and she wasn’t the most beautiful woman in the world, but there was
something about her that made you either like or dislike what you were
about to get into.  Well, you have to understand also that she had a
resolve about her that indicated that she knew that you had the
potential to achieve what you really wanted to achieve in life.
And so I began my journey and my tutelage under Dr. Brown.  Now, you
have to understand that what she did was that she- everything at that
school was done by the students.  We ate in the dining hall family
style, we had tables about eight to a table; the students waited on
those tables, the students cleaned the building, they was the janitorial
force, and many of us who were doing those jobs were paid a grand sum of
five dollars a month.  One of the things that happened to me was I got
to be the headwaiter in the dining hall.  I really wanted it because it
paid ten dollars a month and it gave me the opportunity to wait on Dr.
Brown’s table whenever she came to the dining hall.
There are many, many stories, but one of the things that that school
did, is it opened my eyes to many, many things.  One of the two
languages that was taught at that school was Latin and I took two years
of Latin and one thing out of Latin was one of the things all of us
learned was that Latin was a dead language….</p>

Speaker 1:  xx had killed Robinson and now it is killing me. That was
what we learnt, the Illyad and the Odyssey. But Dr. Brown could wheedle
money out of you like nobody else could because he had to do it to keep
that school open. But all in all she taught us that we were somebody.
Despite of all the vicissitudes we xx during that time John Crowe and
all were there that we had an opportunity to succeed, where no others
had succeeded before. One of the things that I learnt when I got what we
call the palm of creed and it has remained with me all these years. It
was something like this, I have to live with myself and so I want myself
xxx to know . I want to be able as the days go by always to look myself
straight in the eye .I don’t want to stand with the setting sun and hate
myself for the things I have done. I don’t want to keep xx a lot of
secrets about myself. To myself as I come and go as nobody else should
know the kind of person I really am, I don’t want to dress up myself in
sham. As    others may never see, no, I know others may never know. So
whatever happens I want to be self- respecting and conscience free. That
was what Dr. Brown taught me that would be the energy that she gave me,
that was what kept me going, through all problems before. I commend the
resolution to you.

Speaker changes: Thank you Mr. Speaker just to add a little bit more to
the extraordinary history of North Carolina during Women’s History
Month, the only states in the country that has three different women as
Chief Justice of our Supreme Court. And as a matter of fact, Suzy Shroff
who is elected Chief Justice by 94 percent of the vote in 1974 was the
first female elected to be chief justice of the supreme court in the
United States. Since that we had Rhonda Williams chief justice of the
Supreme court for a short period of time and currently we have Sarah
Parker who is chief justice of our supreme court and that’s just a
little bit more of the history of some extraordinary women in North
Carolina and I commend the resolution to you.

there and all my life I would pass by this place Sarah Hawkins Brown
and we were like, Oh! God, we don’t have to go there. And I didn’t know
what it was. I don’t know what it was and last year my aunt Kay told me
that she had been to school and she wanted me to . Still I did not know
what she was talking about when she said Palmer Institute that was not
on the plan. I did not know that was where I was going. And XX I asked
her what it was, she was like, ‘you don’t know, about the Palm
Institute, you don’t know. About Sarah Hawkins Brown had never heard of
it and immediately she made an appointment, the very next day for me to
go visit the school, and to learn about this lady named Sarah Hawkins
Brown .And I am so glad that I went because I think that I was scheduled
to be there for an hour, I spend all day there because I thought that
like I had a connection with this lady named Sarah Hawkins Brown.Up here
she was in the midst of the 1930s and the

gentlemen is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen this is a very straight forward bill.
In 2006, the town of Grifton was dealing with one piece of property on
the outside of Grifton. The owner of the property went to the town of
Grifton, to ask for annexation because the property was looking to hold
a daycare center on that particular piece of property. In order to be
able to house a daycare center the health code said that it had to be
tied into a municipal sewer system. Unfortunately that daycare center
never came into fruition. The property was never tied into the municipal
sewer system. And therefore, the owner went back to the town of Grifton
in September of last year asking to be de-annex. The town board voted on
it, and it passed unanimously. And the town board, the town manager
actually brought this to me to provide this de-annexation. I ask for
your support with this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion,
further debate. If not, the question before the house is the passage of
house bill 191 on its second reading. All those in favor will vote aye,
all those oppose will vote no. Clerk will open the vote. Clerk will lock

To do the new tax but we would like to allow them to use their existing
tax for those same two purposes.  There are no new taxes on this bill.
There is no new revenue, state or local.  There are just two new options
for the Charlotte city council, who’s joined us here today to consider.
One of those options would be to consider funding for some improvements
to a stadium that is named Bank of America Stadium, otherwise known as
Panther Stadium. And secondly, to allow them to use some funding for
amateur sports. Once again, there’s no new taxes, there’s no new

on this. Once in Government and once in Finance and my side didn’t
prevail in either place so I can read votes.  But I will say this. I
think this is corporate welfare. This is welfare for the Carolina
Panthers at a time when we cannot afford as a General Assembly to be
doing this sort of thing.  Now some would say, and my friend
Representative Samuelson said, well it’s not really a tax increase
because we’re just shifting around the uses of the Occupancy Tax. But
the fact of the matter is, if there weren’t an Occupancy Tax in place,
in order to help the Panthers there would have to be a new tax. So
there’s just a supplanting of money that otherwise would go to the
convention center, is now being shifted to the Panthers. The second
thing that I think is problematic, besides the fact that I don’t think
this state can afford to do what the bill does.  Is that you’re taking
away the authority, if you look on page 2, it take away the authority of
the Visitors Bureau.  And I can tell you from my years on the Finance
Committee as the Chair of Finance Committee that the Occupancy Taxes
have been requested by Visitor Bureaus in order to promote the town or
promote a particular action in the town, in the city. And as I
understand it as far back as 1989, the Charlotte Visitor’s Bureau asked
for an Occupancy Tax to build a convention center. Now, it’s being
shifted over tot eh Panthers and the question is being raised in Finance
Committee, well what if the convention center needs money?  And I don’t
really know that there was a clear answer to that because the convention
center, the Visitors Bureau is basically out of the loop. If you read
the bill, it’s the city of Charlotte that’s now controlling the
Occupancy Tax. That’s not what occupancy taxes are supposed to be for.
So, for all those reasons, I think it’s welfare for a very profitable
outfit and I am going to vote against it and hopefully you will join me.
Thank you.

So I'll be voting no on this bill today, and would ask you to consider
my position.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cunningham please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I offer an amendment Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized as setting forth an amendment the Clerk will read
it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cunningham moves to amend the bill on page 1 line 14 by
adding the following at the end of the line.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you will look on your desk I passed out two pieces of literature to
support what I was referencing to on yesterday. If you flip on the
backside where it says American Association of Nurse Anesthetists and
you come down to the second, to the first paragraph at the end. It says
eleven researchers also stated that there is no evidence in the
scientific literature to suggest that anesthesia care is safer when a
nurse anesthetist is supervised by a physician. This study was done, and
also pointed out that people living in rural and other areas of the
United States where anesthesiologists often choose not to practice for
economic reasons. The safe and cost effective anesthesiology care
provided by nurse anesthetists has been a mainstay in these areas for
more than a hundred years, ensuring millions of patients have access to
surgical, obstetrical, trauma stabilization, and diagnostic procedures.
Now, what I was looking to do with the amendment was to exempt out rural
hospitals. What we reference to as CHX's which are critical access
hospitals and it is 23 total in the state of North Carolina. Possibly
anesthesiologists may not be in that area to supervise and in some cases
doctors do not want to supervise in these low areas where there's not a
high need for anesthesiologists or that service. Now there is not a
physical note in the general assembly. On that second document if you
look at table seven and it says delivery model and it says average
billed amount and it says the anesthesiologist only a thousand dollars?
And if you come down to the bottom. If you look and it says CNA only
that's a thousand dollars. It's not a significant difference in it, but
there are different models. Different models that you operate and you
would see a significant cost elevated for the physicians supervised. So
there is a cost even though there is not a physical note. I ask you to
please support the amendment. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker I would ask the chair to rule the amendment out of order as
being not being germane to the bill, and ask to be heard as to the basis
of that motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker if you read the amendment to this bill what you have to look
at what the current bill does. The current bill does is codify existing
law. What this proposed amendment would do would be to change existing
law which goes beyond the scope of the bill, frankly, I would think
almost really a title change would be in order to do this, but
regardless I would ask that Mr. Speaker the amendment be ruled out or
order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

I withdraw the motion with the understanding that the member is going to

At this current time I wish to withdraw the amendment at this moment for
us to look at it further. Thank you.

hearten insurance to enforce certain provisions of the Public Health
Service Act by requiring insurance companies to comply with those
provisions within this state. The General Assembly of North Carolina
enacts. [speaker changes]
Representative Brawley, please state your purpose [speaker changes]
To speak on the bill. [speaker changes]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill [speaker changes]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen. House bill 170 deals with
the Public Health Service Act, which we all know is the Affordable
Healthcare Act. It is federal law. We're going to be obeying it whether
we pass the bill or not. The issue in the bill is by passing this bill,
we put the North Carolina Department of Insurance in control of settling
claims, settling issues and disputes on the laws in the Affordable Care
Act. If we don't pass the bill, then the Secretary of the Federal
Department of Health and Human Services will enforce the provisions in
the state and there's on your desk, there are four states they've
already sent the folks in to set up regulations in addition to their own
Department of Insurance, handling any issues dealing with the Affordable
Care Act.  I encourage your support for the bill. We said we'd obey the
Constitution. This simply puts us obeying the Constitution and enforcing
the laws in North Carolina rather than letting the federal government
come in and do it for us. Thank you. [speaker changes]
Further discussion, further debate. If not, the question before the

its third reading. it will be sent to the Senate.  Senate bill 20. The
clerk will read it .[speaker changes]
House Committee substitute for Senate bill 20, a bill entitled An Act to
provide limited immunity from prosecution for certain drug related
offenses committed by an individual who seeks medical assistance for a
person experiencing a drug-related overdose and certain drug-related
offenses committed by an individual experiencing drug-related overdose
and in need of medical assistance and to provide immunity to civil and
criminal liability for practitioners who prescribe an opiate antagonist
to certain third parties and to certain individuals who administer an
opiate antagonist to persons experiencing a drug-related overdose.  The
General Assembly of North Carolina enacts. [speaker changes]
Representative Murray,. please state your purpose [speaker changes]
To debate the bill [speaker changes]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill [speaker changes] `
Thank you Mr. Speaker. This bill addresses a situation to allow certain
situations when there's an overdose of a person. It allows them to get
administered Naloxone. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist. So we're
talking about drugs that when you overdose on things like Oxycotin,
Oxycodone, Vicotin, Hydrocodone, those opioids, taking Nalaxone
instantly bumps those opioids off their opioid receptors, and can save
the patient's life.  We've also added in this legislation if in a
situation a couple kids, one of them overdoses, the other kid picks the
kid up and runs him to the emergency room, and they happen to have drugs
on their person, it allows them to not get prosecuted for bringing their
friend and trying to save their life - in limited amounts. It just
basically encourages kids to help their friends get access to care
instead of letting them stop breathing and die of opioid overdose.
that's the intent of the legislation. Hence the Good Samaritan language.
I believe Representative Pricey Harrison has an amendment, which I have
no problem with the amendment. I'll let her explain it, but I'd
appreciate your support and I'll gladly answer any questions about
opioid antagonists. [speaker changes]

and gentlemen of the house, as Representative Murry mentioned, This
amendment would add similar immunity for under-age individuals where one
person might be involved in alcohol poisoning and a companion or friend
wants to bring that individual in for medical treatment. This will just
give immunity to that individual who might not otherwise be subjected to
our alcohol laws relating to consumption and possession under the age of
21. It does, unfortunately, change the title because it includes this
provision on alcohol-related emergencies. But I'm not aware of any
opposition, and I would appreciate your support. Thank you. [SPEAKER

the question before the house is the passage of the amendment sent forth

&quot;No&quot;. The Clerk will open the vote. All members wishing to

please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I was in the
chamber but did not get back in my seat in time for House bill 181. I'd
like to be recorded as a &quot;No&quot; vote on that, please. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman will be recorded as having voted &quot;No&quot;.
Representative Brandon, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ask
the bill's sponsor a question, please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Murry, does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Representative Murry, I just wanted make clear because I have not had a
chance to read the whole bill. But, when you clarify, is this for just
folks that, now that we've made the amendment, that are on opiates and
alcohol, or is this all drug-related offenses? I'm confused on what's
allowable and not what's allowable. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly. In
Section 1 of the legislation, the limited immunity applies to
misdemeanor drugs, misdemeanor possession as defined in the general
statutes, felony - There's definitions of possession of less than one
gram of cocaine, less than one gram of heroin, and various subsections.
So, within the general statutes, we define what limits you can possess
to have a max min type crime situation. And so this would allow immunity
for people with that minor small amounts of possession who happen to
bring someone in in an overdose situation to be immune from prosecution.
And it's defined in Section 1. It's less than a gram of cocaine, less
than a gram of heroine, and various other, I think it's based on the
number of pills that they might have in their possession. It's not what
you would consider a dealer coming in with a backpack full of heroin or
a backpack full of cocaine. It's a much smaller possession. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] ?? I got that. ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Faircloth,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to send forth an

Faircloth moves to amend the bill on page 1, lines 22 and 23 by removing
the following. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate
the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This bill
originally was filed by Senator Bingham. The North Carolina Chiefs
Association had a problem with the language on line 21 if you happen to
have the bill in front of you. It reads, &quot;A person acting in good
faith who seeks medical assistance or and individual experiencing a
drug-related overdose and who did not physically supply the</p>

<p id="095:00">
...to the person experiencing the drug related overdose, to not be
prosecuted, etcetera. That's the protection for the person who is, let's
says, two students are in a dorm room and they indulge in some small
amount of drugs and one of them gets too much and it becomes an overdose
and they begin to have symptoms and the other one chooses to call for
help for them, which could certainly save their life, then that person
calling for help will not be prosecuted for the small amount of drugs,
less than a gram. Again, as I said before, if it were a backpack, that
would change the whole thing. The chief felt that that wording should be
changed and the part that said “and who did not physically supply the
drugs to the person experiencing the drug related overdose” was added in
there at the request of the Chief Association. Now, in talking to the
chief yesterday, and talking with Senator Bingham and talking with
others who are concerned about this real problem of overdose being so
dangerous, the chiefs then agreed to remove that piece that was put in
there for them. What my amendment does is move the language back to what
it originally was and it will now read “a person acting in good faith
who seeks medical assistance for an individual experiencing a drug
related overdose, shall not be prosecuted, etcetera.  It takes out that
language that was put in there that would have held that student in that
room who made that call, responsible if he was found with a small amount
of drugs. It's more important to save lives than it is to worry about
arresting someone for a minor amount of drugs. I encourage you to
support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on the amendment.
Representative Murray, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would just ask that you support the amendment
offered by Representative Faircloth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on the amendment?
If not, the question before the House is the passage of the amendment
sent forth by Representative Faircloth to the House Committee Substitute
for Senate Bill 20. All those in favor vote aye. All oppose, vote no.
The clerk will open the vote.  All members wishing to record, please do
so at this time. The clerk will lock machine and record the vote. 117
having voted the affirmative and 1 in the negative. The amendment

purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ask the bill sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Murray, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I certainly yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Could you please tell me if either law
enforcement or the district attorneys weighed in on this as far as favor
or disfavor on the bill, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  They have weighed in. This is a Senate bill that came
over so there were a couple of committee hearings all through the
process and through J committee and I know they worked with
Representative Faircloth on certain issues as well so there's has been
plenty of input.  This is, by the way,  this legislation, I forgot to
mention, and this might help to answer your question as well, this is
one of the recommendations from the child fatality task force. This is a
recommended legislation that came out of there and it's part of their
Lazarus project to help address opiate overdoses. This has been
relatively vetted over during the interim so there has been plenty of
input from the stake holders on this legislation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.

Lucas, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Murray, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Murray.  I support the
concept but I need to ask a question.  Are we, in fact, condoning an
illegal activity when we support this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would say we are condoning saving lives by
encouraging people to seek treatment when it's available instead of
being fearful of criminal prosecution in limited circumstances. We want
to make that sure that instead of instilling a culture of fear in this
situation, we want to instill a culture of saving lives.</p>

and so without fear of prosecution. I think that's the ultimate goal of
the bill. We don't want to reward bad behavior and encourage people to
get overdoses, but at the same time if you're in an overdose situation
and we can save that kid's life and I think we should do that without
fear of criminal prosecution for limited possession amounts. And I can
tell you, prescription drug abuse is a big issue for students, and Rep.
Hamilton and I are sponsoring a study on prescription drug abuse, and I
think it's something we really need to look  at in a broader context.
But in the short time, if we can help save lives with this legislation,
then I think that's what we should focus on.

factors before denying licenses to applicants with criminal records as
required by the Joint Legislative/Administrative Procedural Oversight
Committee.&quot; The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Stevens, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] As the title suggested, this came to us from the
adminis --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This came to us from the
Legislative Oversight Committee on Administrative Procedures, and what
it does is say that the fact that you have a criminal record will not
automatically be grounds to bar you from getting a license to practice
various professions. It can be a factor, but there are like seven things
set out that board should consider. There is a  provision that in the
event there are certain crimes or we can't have criminals in certain
professions, we'll put that within their licensing statute. But for the
overall purpose, just because you have a criminal record doesn't mean
that you can't be licensed. They're to consider the age at which the
offense occurred, what you've done since that time, how it affects your
ability to perform this particular job, and the length of time. So
they'll simply consider those things. We'd ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Stevens, the Chair understands you may an
amendment? Is that amendment withdrawn?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We need to send forth an amendment. I believe
amendment has to do with an effective date.
