Registration and voting curbside as well as registered voters who have a
religious objection to being photographed in a few minutes he will go
into detail on that, but any voter who complies with subsection A, that
is he has a photo id, will be permitted to vote a normal ballot. Those
who do not comply with this section would be permitted to vote a
provisional ballot which would be counted in accordance to the
procedures outlined here in. Definition of photo identification. We'll
run through these pretty quickly for you. If you weren't in one of the
other two committees or missed all of our hearings. Photo ID would
include any identification card that bears either an expiration date or
a date of issuance and is not more than ten years beyond the expiration
date or date of issuance, whichever is later, issued by a branch,
department, agency, or entity of the United States. This state or any
other state such as any of the following types of items. A North
Carolina drivers license,  a special North Carolina ID card, a U.S.
Passport, an employee identification card, a United States military ID,
an ID issued by the University of North Carolina or its constituent
institutions, an identification card issued by North Carolina community
colleges, an ID state issued to a fireman, ems, hospital employer, or
law enforcement officer, an ID issued by a unit of local government,
public authority or special district as defined in general statue
159-7., an id card issued for public assistance. Also accepted would be
a veteran's identification card issued by the United States Department
of Veteran Affairs and used at veteran administration medical facilities
or an identification card that bears the date of expiration that was not
expired on the day that the voter reached the age of 70, issued by a
branch, department, agency or entity of the United States this state or
any other state.
I'm going to skip over to page 13, section 17.  Since this is
appropriations we'll talk about where the money would go. Section 17
refers to the education and publicity requirements and how were going to
educate the public on the  photo id requirement. Counties can use their
regular process to notify voters of assignments and reassignments to
districts for election to the various offices. Counties can send new
voter registration cards to voters as a result of new registrations,
changes of address. Counties can also maintain a Board of Elections'
website. Notice of elections appointed by the county's Boards of
Elections under these statues for the 2014 primary and general elections
will include a brief statement that photo identification will be
required to vote in person beginning in 2016. The SPOE shall include on
its website information about the provisions of part two. Counties will
post at their polls and early voting sites beginning with the 2014
primary elections informations about provision two of this act. The
Voter Information Verification Advisory Board, is required by part one
of this act. Shall provide education and assistance to voters and newly
registered voters information about the provisions of part two. The
state board of elections shall distribute information about the photo
identification requirements to groups and organizations serving persons
with disabilities or the elderly. and would also publish a voter guide
that includes the voter identification procedures and requirements set
forth in part two.  As I said earlier, the VIVA program will include
field operatives that will work hand in hand with registered political
parties in the various counties and the party chairmen of those
respective political parties, and with core groups of volunteers to do
community outreaches for education and registration of voters to
socialize this idea. Also, if you look at section 22. We'll drop down
their; item 5. This will be a phase in operation beginning on January
1st, 2014 and applying to every primary and election held thereafter.
Voters will be asked when they appear to vote if they have a photo id,
they will not be required to have one to...</p>

that we asked if they would like the one side for assistance to get one
that information will be shared with Aviva Couric feel group and with
party chairs and the the outreach would begin to target those folks
specifically let indicated they do not have an ID and that will make an
effort to get them one and will be at approximate 24 months to make that
happen Back of the section 20 going forward this bill instructs the
state board of elections to begin to research and study the concept of
going digital for him the voting process that is to incorporate an
electronic program creating a statewide database of digital photos so
that we will have is another leg or another method available to the
voter something as simple as walking up stating your name they can type
in your name and up pops your picture The the information which is
simply confirm that they will report back to the city report back to the
joint legislative elections oversight committee by April 1, 2014 so we
get moving on this and having Teradata returned to representative Tom

you still have to be a citizen he still has to have residence in our

can present yourself to vote that present a photo ID Persepolis
legislations is one point automatic additional you think they are going
digital thief is crucial from an appropriations perspective for
something that will have a significant savings of time and efficiency
for our precinct officials if you'll go back to page 3 in section 5 is a
new statute that that deals with evaluation of determination of
non-reasonable resemblance of photo identification and these section
this section deals with what happens if the election official determines
that the photo does not bear a reasonable resemblance in any case this
section will be construed in a light most favorable favorable to the
voter and so that's that's that section 5 does moving on to section 6 if
an individual has a religious objection to being photographed this
section details the process that individual can go through in order to a
register that objection with the County Board of elections moving on to
section 9 you look at this details her sideloading hand on if an
individual has a physical disability that prevents them from being able
to physically walk into the polling location we will allow them to

on page 6 this details the counting of provisional ballots if an
individual resents himself without a photo ID that will be offered the
opportunity cast a provisional ballot in this details what what that
individual has to do in order to get that that vote counted after the
provisional ballot is counted that section 11 section 12 deals with the
existing law on how individuals are challenged any any registered voter

<p id="10:00">
I get to pick up on page 7 part 3, where it talks about implementation.
the big issue on implementation had been if you're going to start
requiring a photo id for people, how do they go about getting one if
they don't have one. so we put in place the system by which you can get
a photo id if you do not have one. the portion that &quot;representative
warren&quot; described about viva is a way for us to help people know
that they're going to need the ids and we're going to help them obtain
it. what this does is go through and talk about how we go about helping
them obtain it and what qualifications do they need to have to get it
free. Accentually if you look on section 13, items 1 and 2 accentually
all of the first four items already exist in some form. If somebody
needs a non operator id card and they go to the board or to the DMV, to
get it, if they are legally blind, if they’re over 70 years old, number
3 was in there in a different form. But basically if they have it and
expired driver license and for some reason can’t get a new drivers
license, they can use the expired drivers license to help them get a non
operator id card. that’s on 3 and not pay a charge for it.  On 4 if
they’re homeless and have documentation that they’re homeless and then
the new portion is 5 which said that, if they come to the DMV to get a
non operator card, and they state that they’re getting it for the
purpose of voting, that they do not have any alternatives and they sign
an affidavit to that affect, then we will give them the card for free.
Then on 6, this was something that on the next page on page 8, item 6
was added in the last committee and what this does is broaden that even
more. Lets say the person through viva heard about the need for voter id
card and to register, but they realized they are not yet a register
voter, but they’re going to need the id card anyway. Rather than having
to make them make two trips. Under 6, since the DMV is already doing
registering people to vote when they come get a drivers license. What
this will allow for them to also qualify for the free card if they’re
registering and getting the id card for the purpose of voting. So that
was added in the last committee. Then when you go to, lets see, then
section 14, starts to deal with how we’re going to reimburse the clerks
and registrars for the background information. So, we’re going to
reimburse the DMV if the person has signed this affidavit saying that
they need the free card for the purpose of voting. But lets say in order
to get that card, they had to go to the clerk to get a copy of their
birth certificate or their marriage certificate. And they also are
getting that only for the purpose of voting, then when they go to the
clerk they can sign a form that saids, I’m getting this for the purpose
of voting. The clerk will then take that, verify it either online or by
phone however they need to or the person can present their registration
card to verify that they’re getting this and for their registered voter
and they’re getting this for the purpose of voting and they sign that
and the clerk will use that form to get reimbursed by the board of
elections. So there were some concerns that the free cards would
detrimentally be sort of an unfunded mandate. And so we made sure, that
anybody who's issuing this and doing this for free, would be reimbursed.
So those are those sections. Then if you skip ahead, to page 11, section
16, it’s the method for requesting an absentee ballet. What I just
skipped over, was the part on how they create the ballet itself. You can
read the details on that. But one thing we did change was, the method of
requesting an absentee ballet. There will be a form like this. There’s a
version of it, that already online, but we’re going to tweek it
somewhat. But there will be a form like this, that you’ll need to fill
out, if you want to request and absentee ballet. You can get that form
online, you can call or go to  the board of elections and ask for it, or
you can write and ask them to send that form to you. But the form will
have to be filled out. The things that we’re adding to that form, which
will be part or your identity, is that you will need a drivers license
and or the last four digits of your social security number, your birth
date, residence name. It does allow for instance the mother of kids that
use to be in college. It does allow a verifiable legal guardian to
request that information on behalf of someone else. And once you fill
out that information, it also, if you look on the next page on page 12,
it goes through all those items, but on line 10, it also saids that in
addition to that, we like for you to produce one of the have it
documents, since you’re not producing a photo id.  So once the board of
elections gets this form they….</p>

<p id="15:00">
We’ll then verify that you are a registered voter. One of the questions
that came up was, well sometimes depending on when you registered to
vote, you might have provided the last four digits of your Social
Security Number, or you might have provided your driver’s license
number. This also allows the DMV to update their records because you are
signing that this is you and that this is your real information. If you
happen to provide your driver’s license one time and your social
security the other time, they will update their records so that they
have both of them for you for in the future. That’s what that is. The
verification. Then if you’ll go down to line 28, the procedure for an
absentee ballot.
I don’t know how many of ya’ll have voted absentee before but it comes,
and your ballot is supposed to be secret so it goes inside an envelope,
and all of your documentations on the outside of that envelope. Now
remember you’ve already provided it one time to request the form.
So then we go back through and on the outside of the envelope you are to
sign it. The one thing that is substantially new on that is you have to
have two people witness that you signed it. That you’re the person who
filled it out, and that you’re the person who signed it and put it in
there. Two people have to witness it. They also have to put their
address on there so if we need to verify who they are we have both their
name and address.
Then if you’ll go to page thirteen, line nineteen which is Section 16.
Verifiable legal guardian. In most cases a legal guardian is a relative,
friend, trustee, something like that, but there are cases where people
may be in institutions where the verifiable legal guardian is not one
individual that they have regular contact with. So in those cases
normally the verifiable legal guardian had to be somebody that they were
seeing on a regular basis.
In those cases what we added here was if you’re in one of those
situations where the verifiable legal guardian is technical, technically
the Execute Director of a large organization, that that Executive
Director who is the legal guardian may appoint up to ten people and
record those people with the state Board of Elections so we know who
they are, and those people can then sign as the verifiable legal
guardian if they needed on any of these other absentee pieces.
I think that’s my last one but I will check. If you go to page fourteen,
Sections 18 and 19 just talk about the fact that we are going to
reimburse them through the Division of Motor Vehicles which is why we’re
here in appropriations and that all of the forms and such, and all the
instructions will have to be posted both online and other ways. They
will also have to post prominently what happens if you sign and do this
fraudulently that you are committing a crime. I believe that is the end
of the presentation and we’re now available for questions and or
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We will move into amendments at this time. The first amendment that we
have that has been passed out is amendment number 12. Representative
Fulghum you are recognized to introduce your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. If I might defer initially to Representative
McNeil he had some language that he wanted also to put in this
amendment. If I might ask him to address his first part on page two line
27. Mr. Chairman is that possible?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fulghum is the substance of what Mr. McNeil is going to
speak about your amendment 12?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is part of it and I was asked to add this particular word change. I
can speak to that as well if you’d like me to do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’ll recognize Mr. McNeil to speak to the amendment then we’ll take the
amendment up. This number 12 up. Representative McNeil.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. On page two, line 27 my concern was that the language in the
bill as it was written, it just says every individual, and I didn’t
think in keeping with the purpose of this bill that every individual
properly documented what the intent of this bill was. My original
thoughts in changing the word individual here was to put for every US
Citizen voting in person. However, it was explained to me that</p>

<p id="20:00">
Had to be a US citizen to register to vote anyway. So a compromise
language with Mr. Fulghum and Mr. Warren was to add this language in.
And I believe it clarifies what individual in this context means.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, I’ll be glad to remark upon the portion
that I had in my amendment, if I may. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is that before
us? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Briefly. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] On page 5, lines 33 through 44, this is the section involving
curbside voting. This part from number 3 on seems to me unnecessary in
regards to the requirement for curbside voting identification. The first
2 parts would remain under B1 and 2, photo ID or a copy of a ??
document. The remainder of the bill contains language on page 7,
referencing the desire to get voter ID or photo ID for homeless,
disabled, aged and so-forth. So I thought this was a redundant portion
of the bill and unnecessary and I wanted to remove that. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Bill sponsors wish to comment? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We
appreciate the amendment sponsors working together, so we only had to
have one on this and working with this on the language and we commend
the amendment to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further questions from the
committee members on this amendment? If not, all those in favor of the
amendment signify by saying aye. All opposed, no. The ayes have it and
the amendment is adopted. The next amendment we will take up is
Amendment number 14, offered by Representative Hager. It’ll be AST47
version 1. AST47, version 1. Sponsored by Representative Hager. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. My microphone’s not working. ?? over
here to your left. Move my papers over here. This amendment allows the
recognition of the Department of Interior authorized tribal, federally
issued tribal ID for the Cherokee Indians. This ID is issued with a
picture, it’s got a date of issue, a birth date, signature of the
enrollment officer, enrollment number, and the tribal blood degree. You
can use this ID for cashing checks, revenue bank account, all major
airports for boarding airplanes, getting a passport, all the things you
would usually use your state license ID for. So the amendment basically
recognizes this as an ID by which you could vote with. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Bill sponsors with to comment on the amendment? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
think the amendment sponsor explained it well. We support this
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further comments or questions?
Representative Corbett. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. A
question of the amendment sponsor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, there’s no mention of a photo ID. I support the
amendment, but I just wondered would there be a need for adding mention
of a photo ID? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative, might as well be. Mr.
Cohen is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If you look back on page 2, line
48 which precedes all those numbers. Page 2, line 48. All those
documents on that list, which 4 is being added, must contain a
photograph. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank you Mr.
Cohen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Michaux. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does
this, you say federally recognized tribe. Even if that card does not
have a photo on it, is it still recognized? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Chairman. Just real quick, as far as this amendment is concerned, this
amendment does as Mr. Cohen says, does contain a photo ID so it would be
under that ??</p>

I'll let Mr. Cohen answer the other question, but I just wanted to make
sure that everyone understand that this is under the Photo ID section.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Then any other tribe that is not federally recognized would have to
follow through on what we've got in the bill itself. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager, can you answer that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As far as I know, and Mr. Cohen is shaking his head, that is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Harrison.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Representative ?? brought up my question. I was
looking through the NCSL analysis of other state requirements. I didn't
know that any of those other tribal ID opportunities were limited to
federal, and I'm just wondering why we are not going to allow such as
the Lumbee Indian tribal photo ID or other tribes in North Carolina that
may not be federally recognized. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe there may be some work going on figuring out a way to make
that happen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Graham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just wanted to reiterate what was said. We are
trying to work on some language that would give state recognized tribes
the same opportunity. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further comments, questions for members of the committee?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Pittman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't know how serious to take this, but I'm noticing a lot of
typographical errors. There's one, I think, in this amendment as it's
given where it says &quot;the date OR expiration&quot;. It should be
&quot;the date OF expiration&quot;. I found some in the bill that's been
given to us, and I just want to make sure that we thoroughly go through
and make sure that's taken care of.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We'll let the staff take care of that. That'll be taken care of. Thank
you for that. Other comments, questions regarding the amendment? If not,
all those who favor the amendment, please signify by saying aye. All
opposed no. The ayes have it, and the amendment is adopted.
Representative Hall, we have an amendment from you, AST 31 Version 2,
that I understand that you want to withdraw that amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr. Chairman. If I could, I would like to send forth…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We'll get to that one later. AST 46 Version 2. Representative Speciale.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Actually, it should be Version 3.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It should be Version 3, I've been advised by the staff. Let me mention
something while you are finding Representative Speciale's amendment at
your place. We, of course, have to be out of here at 9:50 in this room,
so we will be taking a vote at 9:45. If we do not get to your amendment
by that time, then certainly you are free to offer those, propose those
amendments for the floor. We'll certainly try to dispose of as many
amendments between now and 9:45 as we can, but we will be taking a vote
on the bill. Representative Speciale, if you would present your
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Basically, what this amendment does is it
removes all of those identification cards except for four. Four pieces
of identification: a North Carolina driver's license, a North Carolina
ID card, a U.S. Military identification card, or a passport. Too many of
those other items are easily made on the computers. Every college kid or
high school kid has got someone he can go to get fake IDs so he can go
out, change his date, his age, so he can go out and drink. They're just
too easy to make. The other change on it is…  The idea is, if you come
in and you don't have one of those IDs, you would provide a fingerprint.
They have little fingerprint kits like the one I have in my hand here
that cost $6. Doesn't leave ink stain on you. You just put your
fingerprint on your ballot, and then you vote. It's not a provisional,
it's a ballot. You're done, you're done voting, you don't have to come
back, everything's good to go. At some later date, if something happens
and you're accused of fraud, somebody says, &quot;Hey, I saw this guy
come in four times&quot;, they can match those documents together and
show that you voted, and we've got the evidence we need for conviction.
Basically, that's what we're looking at.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Bill's sponsor want to comment
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The bill's sponsors let me, I'll talk the second half first. The bill's
sponsor looked at a number of these data recognition opportunities. We
think they're close to being usable. They're not quite</p>

area and so there's a study in the bill that asks the B O E to study and
put together things like this and how might they work and how we would
implement them so we appreciate and recognize that part of it but it is
not ready yet for prime time. We've done a lot of looking into it
because it could have save us money, potentially on the I D. But it's
not ready yet. In terms of limiting the number of I D's we've got to
remember this is not the registration process, this is simply showing
you are who you say you are. And we need to recognize that people go
through a tougher process when they are registering than when they come
and they just are proving they are who they say they are so let's be
careful not to confuse the two. We think the list that we have makes it
as easy as possible for people who are qualified voters to come in and
show their I D and be able to vote. And so we would ask you to not
support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Other comments? Representative Warren, do you wish to comment on the
amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Also some of the I D's proposes to eliminate were passed on house bill
three fifty one, the last session. Bill sponsors ask you respectfully to
vote no on the amendment.

Others wishing to comment on the amendment?

Mister chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Floyd.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm in agreement with the sponsor because I had a similar bill that I
was told that section twenty of this bill was not ready at that
particular point in time but in the future it would. So I'm in agreement
to support the bill sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further comments? On the amendment. Hearing none, all those in favor of
the amendment please signify by saying aye. All those opposed signify by
saying no. The amendment fails.
The next amendment is AST 32 version 2. Representative Glazier.

May I proceed, mister chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier, proceed please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much mister chair. Members this is in pretty simple
language that says in those cases were the registered voter forgot or ??
doesn't have his photo I D but an election worker with board
independently confirms their identity from personal knowledge, they know
them, they're neighbors, they're cousins, whatever it may be, the voter
would not be required to provide the photo I D. The idea behind photo I
D's is to eliminate any fraud. There is no possibility of fraud where
the election workers knows someone who's been voting at the polls for
twenty or thirty or forty years and it makes it much harder for this
person to vote while serving absolutely no governmental interest where
everybody at that precinct knows this is who they say they are. So to
try balance out pragmatic concerns with still maintaing the goals of the
legislation, I would ask for your support on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. The bill sponsors considered this option when we went through
debate and decided that we could not support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Iler.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. I support the bill sponsors and this is part
of the problem not part of the solution. So, I lend my vote to the
sponsors.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further comment on the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lucas.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chair. Inquirty. Is there any reason or rationale that
this would not be considered since the election officials- I imagine
that their credibility should be viable.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In most areas of the state, people move around a lot. We don't have
people staying forever. I know I change precincts every couple of years
so the idea that the precinct workers would be able to do so is not as
certain as it use to be. And we're bending over backwards to make sure
everybody has the opportunity to have an I D so there shouldn't be</p>

Problems with someone not having an ID. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Hager ? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I think this creates a
two tier system it’s that ok my neighbors have to go through one lower
threshold that I may or may not know but everybody else has to go
through a higher threshold which I think we should put everybody through
the same threshold. no matter if you know him or you think you know him
or you might know him or your cousin knows him or whatever  I think
everybody should go through he same threshold so I’d ask everybody to
vote no on this amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further comment? If not,
all those in favor of the amendment signify by saying aye [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES]All those opposed signify by saying no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The no’s have it and the amendment is not agreed to. The next amendment
is AST 33 version 3 Representative Adams is recognized to present her
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you me chair basically this amendment
will allow students who are attending private colleges to have the same
rights as other students who attend our public universities to be able
to vote we have 36 private colleges in north Carolina enrolling
approximately 89,000 students. I just heard one of the members talk
about a two tiered system. What we have now in this bill discriminates
against those students who attend private colleges and so what this
amendment does is give the same right and privilege to students
attending private universities to be able to use their identification
issued by their schools as a way for them to vote. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuels?
The bill sponsors also debated this in another committee in the interest
of time I won’t go into all the details but we do oppose this. The
students all have the same right they can get a government issued ID
card. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam
I opposed the amendment. I love our private colleges or universities but
the term accredited really means very little if you know a lot about
accreditation and the problem is that this is not the government we
can’t hold the private universities accountable in the same ways we can
hold the public universities. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Harrison.
Thank you Mr. chair I just want to speak in favor of the amendment and
reviewing the sixteen states that allow student ID to qualify for the
photo ID requirement it’s not clear that any of them make a distinction
between private and a public university just that the college needed to
be located in the state. I would support the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Further comments on the amendment? Representative Queen?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Mr. Chairman again in our state we have thirty some private colleges
that educate over 80,000young people each year this is an incredible
asset to our state and toe engage these citizens these young folks early
in the civic activities of this state to bond them to this state because
I think a number of them come from outside the state become citizens and
the whole asset of having these wonderful private universities is to
bring the finest and best from everywhere including north Carolina
citizens to become North Carolina citizens so I think this is just a way
to engage our young people in becoming active citizens as early as
possible and I thinks a very good amendment and I support it. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Adams? Thank you Mr. Chairman I'd speak a second
time you know our private colleges do make an investment in the state as
a matter of fact  if these 89,000 students try to enroll in our public
universities we wouldn’t have room for them we also provide in our
budget support for student who attend these colleges in a way of tuition
and I just think it’s just a shame for us to discriminate against these
student and we're making provisions for other student in the same bill
so I would appreciate of you would support this amendment it is the
right thing to do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further comments. Seeming none, all
those in favor of the amendment please signify by saying aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Aye.All those opposed signify by saying no. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
No. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And the amendment is not agreed to. The next

Amendment AST38.version3, representative Glazier. Wait a minute, I think
that's - strike that one, strike that one. AST39 version 2,
representative Glazier. That's not out yet? Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, skip that. AST31 version 3, representative
Fisher, you should have that one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Fisher is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I am right over here. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Ladies
and gentlemen of the committee, this amendment just adds one additional
exception to the photo identification requirement on page two at lines
36 and 37, and it allows for a registered voter who is a victim of a
national disaster who is without an ID to be able to vote without that
photo identification if they have completed a form that is supplied by
the board of elections or by the state board of elections. And before
when we ran this amendment it was that the form would have to be
supplied. This just actually makes this one fo the exception in case of
a national disaster that's declared by either the President or by the
Governor of the state, to allow for this person to go ahead and vote if
they have completed a form and have no photo ID currently. And that's up
to 60 days before the election. I move adoption of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If you look on page six, line 35, we already have a
provision if there's been a natural disaster. I'm not frankly exactly
sure what the difference in yours is except maybe you're not allowing
them to vote provision, but we do have provisions for natural disasters.
They don't happen very often and so we would request that you not
support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Comments, questions? Seeing none all those in favor of
the amendment please signify by saying aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed nay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The nay's have it and the amendment is not agreed to.
Amendment AST39 version 2, representative Glazier is recognized. You
should have it representative Glazier. I think it is being passed out.
We'll be at ease for a moment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair I've got 38 was passed out, 39 I don't have,
38, AST38 version 3 I've got.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well let's take up that one representative Glazier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We'll do that one?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Proceed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] AST38 version 3, this is a carry on to the one we did
but with a little more specificity. This is based on the exact provision
that exists in Alabama's law and pulled it off of the Alabama law
yesterday. And what Alabama law says is that a registered voter who
doesn't have their photo ID but has two election officials at the
precinct or in their early vote who personally identify the person, and
all three individuals, that is the voter and the two elections officials
sign a declaration of identity.</p>

<p id="45:00">
Then the voter is allowed to vote. And again, I go back to we want to
try to eliminate fraud, but in doing that, it doesn't mean we should
eliminate our common sense at the polls. If in fact everybody at that
precinct knows this person, and for one reason or another as a human
being they forgot their voter ID, they have Alzheimers, they have
dementia, they have been sick, whatever it may be, it seems to me we
don't want to continue to make it harder for someone we know absolutely
certainly, 100% is the person they say they are. That's the reason
Alabama passed this rule, and if it's good enough for Alabama, it ought
to be good enough for North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just remind the members that you have to take these qualifications in
the larger context of the full initiative. I don't have the full
initiative in Alabama to go through that, but we have bent over
backwards in this bill to make sure people know they need their ID, that
they have plenty of time to get their ID, and that we will frankly
provide it to them free. So we would ask you not to support the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions or comments on the amendment? Representative Torbett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Question of the amendment sponsor please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are fully aware that Alabama is in the SCC and not the ACC, is that
correct, Representative?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's not, the question is out of order. Further, further, further
questions or comments on the amendment?

That's better than me looking down.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you brother.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. To me this makes just a whole lot of sense and I probably
should have commented a bit ago when we had the one poll worker. He used
to come through, and yes, Representative Samuelson, I know folks do move
around a bit, but I want to tell you out in the country they don't, and
out in the country we know exactly who our poll workers are and they
know exactly who we are, and this makes a lot of sense to me and I
support it. And I thank you for looking upward, mister Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further comments, Representative Speciale.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In a perfect world, our judges would be, would be fair and impartial,
but in the real world, a lot of them are partisan, so this is not a good
idea. And I would recommend that we don't pass it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Wilkins, you are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I speak a second time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Again, I remind you these are your friends and neighbors. There's
nothing devious about these people. I've been a voter for a long, long
time, and the poll workers I know, I know to be good reputable folks.
They're very sincere about doing a job that's thankless and brings very
little compensation. I do support this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further comments. Seeing none, all those in favor of the amendment,
please signify by saying aye. All those opposed signify by saying no.
The nos have it and the amendment is not agreed to. The next one is AST
34 version 2. Representative Harrison.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Speaker. For those of you in election ??, I've run this
amendment before. This simply allows for the use of an ID issued by a
public high school in the state. I did a little research and it seems
that several states that require photo ID allow for the use of a public
high school ID. And I did a little bit more research and it seems like
it will affect about 30,000 voters. These kids may not have drivers
licenses or likely not passports, so I would appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would this, mister chairman, would this apply to the 43 accredited high
schools thatJudge Manning found were committing academic genocide?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that a, is that question directed at someone or was it rhetorical?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rhetorical.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Fine. Representative Steven, excuse me, Representative Samuelson.
Further, any comment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This did come up in election. It was new to us. We said at the time we
didn't have serious problems with it. We've done some more looking. We
have more concerns about it. So at this point we would urge you, we
voted it down in election. We heard from some people as to why, and so
we would urge you to vote against it.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Adams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d like to ask Representative Samuelson a question. What are the
concerns that you have about it?  Can you share it with us?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That it gets harder to actually verify that with the high schools that
they don’t actually do much verification for who’s who.  It’s not
something we have strong feelings about which is why on one committee we
said we were O.K., but if you ask our opinion now, our opinion now is
that we prefer not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For the comment, Representative Harrison.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  I just wanted to point out that it looks like it
would be covered anyway, because it’s any I.D. issued by the State.  So,
this is a government-issued I.D.  So, I think it would be covered.  It
just would be nice to have it listed in a specifically enumerated list
of valid I.D.s.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Pittman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr. Chairman.  I’d like to ask a question to either Ms. Samuelson
or Representative Harrison or whoever.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’ve got to designate who you want to ask the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
O.K.  I’ll ask Ruth.  She probably knows. Do any of these ID’s, high
school, college, whatever, have the student’s home address on them?  Or
some do, some don’t, or what?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We don’t know that and Representative Harrison was correct that it may
actually be covered if it has a photo and a date of issuance or
expiration on it, then it might actually sort of already be covered in
the Bill which is why we were O.K. with it before.  Remember, that this
is not the card that they’re using to register. This is simply a card
that says they are who they say they are.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.  My comment would be, I wouldn’t personally want to accept
any ID for someone coming to vote that does not have their home address
on it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  A question for the Bill sponsors.
Representative Samuelson would be fine.  Representative Samuelson, the
ALA’s [?] I guess, the high schools that will be issuing these high
schools ID’s, would they be State under ALA[?] or would that be a County
issue?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They are considered State.  So, they issue under the State ID.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions, comments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hall.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Call for a division, Mr. Chair.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.  Mr. Chairman.  Right in front of you.  Representative
Michaux.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux.  You’re.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I did have a statement to make.  Representative Samuelson said that
these photo ID’s were not used for registration, you know, but something
to the effect.  But they are used for voting.  And that’s the clear
difference between what this is.  This is a matter of voting and not of
registration.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The vote has been called for.  All those in favor of the Harrison
Amendment, please signify by saying Aye.

All those opposed, please signify by saying No.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Noes clearly have it.  The Noes have it and the amendment is not

Glazier is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.  This is an amendment taken from the
Voter ID Law, in truly our sister state, South Carolina.  I apologize to
Representative Torbett, I can’t seem to get out of the SEC, but.  In
this case what the provision in South Carolina does is state that any
voter who has a reasonable impediment to obtaining the photo I.D., can
vote a provisional ballot after showing their voter registration card
that they received and signing a declaration stating why they were
unable to get the photo I.D.  The reasonable impediment has to be
credible and the statute lists four possible reasons as determined by
the County Board of Elections.  So, they may say that it’s not credible,
but if the voter can show something that is reasonably impaired their
ability, created an obstacle to getting a photo I.D., such as a
prolonged disability or illness, lack of transportation to get the photo
I.D., lack of a birth certificate or of family responsibilities caring
for a sick or infirm spouse or dependent.  Those are the ones that are
listed.  And if the Board finds those to be true and to be credible, it
would allow the voter to vote without the voter I.D.  Now this is, as I
said, straight out of South Carolina’s voter I.D. law.  Again, we don’t
want to continue to make it harder to vote for citizens who are trying
to do it the right way, but are unable for some legitimate, credible
reason</p>

Unable to get that ID for this particular election, and I move adoption
of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Murray is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. The reason why South Carolina
adopted this is because they were overly aggressive in trying to
implement their voter ID law and the department of justice forced them
to include this provision. It's my understanding. And so I would ask
members to oppose the amendment because we have a longer lead time with
a much more robust process than South Carolina tried to implement in
their voter ID law, to help get everyone a photo ID. And so I would ask
members to oppose this, in my opinion this really guts the South
Carolina photo ID and now South Carolina doesn't have a photo ID law
because of provisions similar to this. And so I would ask members to
oppose it. We have a much more robust process to help folks get the
photo ID. We're already 97% there for voters that voted in 2012 and so
we're going to take the next two years to help the other 3% get their
ID's.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The no's have it and the amendment is not agreed to.
The next amendment, I believe the last amendment that we have is AST36
version 2, representative Hall is recognized, Dwayne Hall.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. This is an amendment that I
think most of the members will recognize, it's one that I introduced
last week at elections and it passed almost unanimously I believe but
before it passed there was some small change, it changed the word shall
to may. Shall provide a voters guide to may provide a voters guide. I
think everyone here that understands the English language knows how
drastically that change is, that's the equivalent of your parents or
teacher saying that you may do your homework if you like to, or your
employer saying you may come to work if you would like to. We spent a
lot of time on this and I commend the leadership for the public
hearings, letting people speak, but the reality is once election day
comes more than 99% of the public won't have had the choice to attend
these hearings and spend as much time as we have on this.
A lot of the members I noticed when they introduced their bills they
like to start - I'm not really sure why, maybe to try and slip it
through without anyone noticing, saying this is just a simple bill. Well
this, regardless of how you feel about this bill it's clearly not a
simple bill, it's one that affects our most basic constitutional right,
our right to vote. So I feel extremely strongly that the least we can do
was make every effort to ensure that the public completely understands
all these changes that we worked so hard on and I commend the amendment
to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Warren.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, changing the word may to shall directs the
state board of elections to have to use all of these different media and
we would prefer to let them decide where the money is best spent in
reaching the electorate on this, they have the autonomy to use all of
these things but we don't want to direct that they have to use all of
them. Again it's a cost effective measure, as Representative Hall said
we had a similar amendment from him last time and I strongly encourage
you to vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Question of the amendment
sponsor. I don't see any type of end date for this, is this a perpetual
publication forever? Because it looks like we reach a point where it
would be unnecessary but with this worded the way it is this goes on
indefinitely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] representative Hall is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is one that goes on, it's modeled after the
Florida guide where they print one 30 days before the one stop begins
and it's much in the same way we already provide a voters guide for
judicial elections. I think there are an enormous amount of changes here
and this is something that people should be aware of.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Ensco.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A question for the bill's sponsor. Could you let us
know what are the current requirements for the state board of elections
to notify voters about their registration? What is...</p>

requirement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff wish to answer that?  Mr. Cowan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There is a requirement in the statutes that at least
10 or 20 days before registration closes each county publishes a legal
notice or whatever process legal notices are explaining the deadlines
for registration and when the election is and what offices you are to be
voted on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Followup.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Followup.  Sir I just want to clarify that that is the
date of the election.  Could you say those three things again?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A legal notice is currently have a number of
requirements, I think the date of the election, the date that
registration ends and a general description of which offices are to be
voted on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Final comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The current requirements for the state board of
elections or the local board of elections is very limited.  I mean, a
lot of people may not have any way of knowing this complicated
requirements that are in this bill. So I urge people to support this
amendment.

have about five.  Representative G. Graham is recognized to comment on
the bill.  We have about 3 or 4 minutes before we'll take a vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much sir Mr. Chair.  I had a question,
two questions really, I want to ask.  Are we going to be adopting
electronic voting machines is it going to be statewide.  We will all
have the same system and how do we propose to purchase or pay for the
voting machine without the ?? unfunded mandate at the county level?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Murry is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Graham both of those subject matters
are beyond the scope of this legislation. I expect you will see
additional election reform efforts but both of those issues are beyond
the scope of this legislation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.  I'm advised that the clock I'm looking at
up there is probably about 5 minutes slow so with that in mind we're
approaching 9:50.  The clerk will call the role on the adoption of the
motion by Representative Murry which if you will restate it.
