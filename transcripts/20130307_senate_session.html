<p id="05:00">
The committee we had in the interim where we're looking at how do we
move forward into the 21st century with going from a school environment
being taught that to an individual learning platform for every single
student. What the digital learning competencies looks at is we need to
have teachers who not just understand how to work a piece of technology
but how to integrate that effectively into the classroom and so what
this is doing is urging our teacher certification for new teachers,
existing teachers and principals as they get their certification or
renew it to have a degree of training so that they can properly
implement not just the technology but the entire learning environment.
This is it passed overwhelming through the house and no controversy or
no opposition and I urge your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any
further discussion or debate? Hearing none the question for the senate
is the passing of the senate committee substitute of house bill 23 on
it's second reading. All in favor will vote &quot;aye&quot;, opposed
vote &quot;no&quot; five seconds will be allowed for the voting. The
clerk will record the vote. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Nesbitt &quot;aye&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Fifty having voted in the affirmative and zero in the
negative senate committee to substitute to house bill 23 passes the
second reading without objection will be read a third time. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] North Carolina general assembly ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any
further discussion or debate? Hearing none all in favor of the passage
of the senate committee substitute to house bill 23 on it's third
reading will say &quot;aye&quot; opposed &quot;no.&quot; The
&quot;ayes&quot; have it senate committee substitute to house bill 23
passes it's third reading will be sent to the house for concurrence in
the senate committee substitute. House bill 44 clerk will read. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] House bill 44 transition to digital learning in schools.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Soucek is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. This goes along with one of
the things we discovered through the committee is that this isn't
something you impose on a school system in ?? we saw this tremendous
lift from a school system having somewhere past the 100th in rank in
North Carolina in graduation to top five. I think one of the greatest
attributors to this was there transition to this type of environment and
the key factors we saw were leadership and instruction. We saw buy in
from the superintendent, from the principal, from teachers and probably
most important from the community so what this bill is doing here is a
statement from the general assembly of our intent to move in this
direction because so much of this of what we are trying to accomplish
here is going to be through the vision of the future and what is does do
is indicate our intentions to move forward with textbooks moving to a
digital environment not just instead of being paper being on a computer
but having information transformed in a much more innovative way in
which it is going to be communicated. I urge your support. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Any further discussion or debate? Senator Rucho for what
purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I applaud Senator Soucek and the
house members for bringing this forward. I did have the opportunity to
visit the Mooresville for school and I will tell you, you sit in their
classes and you see these children all hovered around their computers.
It isn't about going from hardback paper books to digital devices. It
was a reforming of the entire educational system and if you ever get the
chance you need to go pay a visit over there and there are other schools
in Watauga county and the like but the bottom line is this is going to
revolutionize education and utilize the internet in a way we that we
have not even begun to imagine. It's already started in Mooresville and
they transformed a mediocre to a high excellence school and we should be
moving this across the entire state so that every one of our children
will be prepared for the global jobs of the future. I urge you to
support this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator. Senator
McKissick for what purpose do you rise. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ask Senator
Soucek a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Soucek do you yield for a
question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Soucek I
certainly applaud the efforts to move us from traditional textbooks to
digital learning and I think that is an excellent move for the state of
North Carolina of course one thing that is included in this bill is
saying that we will increase far greater funding for the digital
technology to be available. The only thing that I would also like to ask
a question about is those low wealth areas of our state and for those
individuals that don't have access to laptops and desktops in their
homes. How are we looking at as a state providing access for those
individuals that otherwise won't have it as we make this progression
from traditional textbooks to digital technology because that has to be
an integral part so that you don't have this technology gap.</p>

<p id="10:00">
[Speaker changes.]  Absolutely, I think that's a great question.  First,
let me comment on the question...one of the things that was most
exciting about this entire program is that we saw learning across the
board from all students, from the high privileged and high challenged.
Everyone seeing a significant amount of increase in value of their
education but the lower ends of poverty, of lower education, of higher
challenges, we saw a greater percentage increase so we saw that's one of
the reasons why we wanted to do this. And we're going a little...the
details in that are a little beyond where we are right now because we're
still kind of in the structure but we are aware of that and that is
something we are planning on addressing specifically because it is one
of the most critical areas of this entire concept is the low wealth, the
greater challenged students have the greatest advantage and the greatest
need for this and part of that is and the bill we're walking through is
evaluating those exact things around the state so we can address those
issues.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you. Only comment I'd like to make...I think
it's an excellent direction for us to move in...I think if we can
overcome that digital divide and equalize access to educational tools
and resources, that it's a great thing for us to do. Guess I just wanna
make sure that that second component is the way we proceed in this
????????
[Speaker changes.] Any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the
question before the Senate is the passage of House Bill 44 on its second
reading. All in favor will vote aye. Opposed will vote no. Five seconds
will be allowed for the voting.  Clerk'll record the vote. 50 having
voted in the affirmative and 0 in the negative. House Bill 44 passes its
second reading without objection, will be read a third time.
[Speaker changes.] North Carolina General Assembly enacts.
[Speaker changes.] Any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, all
in faovr of the passage of House Bill 44 on its third reading will say
aye. (Ayes.) Opposed no. The ayes have it. House Bill 44 passes its
third reading and will be enrolled and sent to the Governor.
[Speaker changes.] House Bill 10. Clerk will read.
[Speaker changes.] House Bill 10, Remove Route Restriction for NC540
Loop.
[Speaker changes.] Mister President?
[Speaker changes.] Senator Rabin/Rabon???, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister President...to send forward an
amendment.
[Speaker changes.] Senator, do the members have copies?
[Speaker changes.] Yes, they do.
[Speaker changes.] You can send forward your amendment.
[Speaker changes.] Clerk'll read.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Rabin/Rabon???? moves to amend the bill.
[Speaker changes.] Mister President?
[Speaker changes.] Senator Rabin/Rabon???? is recognized to explain the
amendment.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister President.  Members of the Senate,
this is a clean up of the amendment that we did yesterday, and I want to
thank Senator Nesbitt for bringing a couple of items to my attention.
What this amendment does is it does absolutely nothing to the first part
of the bill, which has to do with 540....??? that yesterday, that will
go forward in tact, I mean as it was ...but what this amendment does is
it removes those three projects from the turnpike authority. It adds
that prior to bond issue or going to local government for bonds and
financing, that the legislature be given 180 days notice and it puts or
requires that these projects be either put in the Mobility Fund or meet
the requirements of the Mobility Fund and/or the prioritization that
we've been trying to do for the last two years, which we passed in the
last session and put them in the TIP program. Now, just so you will
know, any project can qualify for the Mobility Fund at the request of
local MPO's or RPO's, ok? This is a policy decision that we've been
moving forward.  It does not kill any project. Please listen, it does
not kill any project. It puts ???? TIP to stand on their own merits and,
if they choose to do so, their local MPO's or RPO's can request that
this project be put into the Mobility Fund. Good projects will be driven
by data. That seems to be the desire of this body and is certainly the
desire of the Transportation Committee and I request your support on
this amendment. Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] Any further discussion or debate?
[Speaker changes.] Mister President?
[Speaker changes.] Senator Clodfelter, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker changes.] Would the gentleman yield for a question?
[Speaker changes.] Senator Rabin/Rabon?????, do you yield for a
question?
[Speaker changes.] I yield.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Rabin/Rabon??????, it's a...probably a
technical question.  I've got two copies of the amendment, they both
have exactly the same version number on them but they have different
language?</p>

And one of them, one page one line thirty one, the substance requires
prior consultation with the general assembly, and on the other one, the
language on line 31 requires prior consultation with the joint
legislative commission on governmental operations, and they both have
the same version.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Look the first one over, please, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I did not, but I think everybody in the chamber wants
to know they got the one with the language you intend
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? Senator Rabin, what ?? do you rights? Do you make a
request, please?
[Speaker changes] Senator, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, if we could please, I request that this be
displaced for a moment or two so the staff makes the proper ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, do you want to withdraw this amendment right
now, and then resubmit it when its corrected? We want to take a few
minutes to do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let’s stand as esse then for a few moments and we’ll
see if we can get this amendment taken care of and we’ll come back to
order. OK thank you. Let’s come back to order. Senators, as you make
your way to your seats here, I think we got this worked out. Senator
Rabin’s gonna offer the amendment, now on your desk, you have copies, on
your desk. They say Amendment 1 right now, but this is Amendment 2. So
Senator Rabin is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I mean Mr. President. All I
wanted to finish saying was somehow both amendments ended up with the
same barcode, and the problem has been corrected and so the members
should have the proper one in front of them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator. You can send forth your amendment.
The members have copies, and the clerk will read Amendment Two.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rabin moves to amend the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Is there any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jenkins, what ?? your [??]?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I ask Senator Rabin a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rabin, you’re up for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I can hear it, yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rabin, reading this amendment, it appears that
what’s been done in the ?? section is that there are three probjects
that have been struck from the Turnpike Authority: the Gardenparkway,
the ?? Skyway,  and the ?? Country Bridge. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I, also, this amendment, the previous amendment that
this replaced transferred 63 million dollars out of the turnpike
authority back to DOT to be used for mobility fund. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The original amendment did, yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So now, it would lead--
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, senator, do you have a third question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You must approach the chair with each additional
question
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I did not as far…a question then.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rabin, do you yield for a third question?
Senator Rabin?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I reyield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, Senator Rabin, then the math would be that this
63 million dollars left in the Turnpike Authority, which is not
designated to any projects. Following your comments earlier today about
the mobility fund and other projects standing on their own then with
this 63 million dollars be available for other candidates for the
turnpike projects?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I can’t …I can’t answer that, and be sure that I’m
giving you the correct answer as to whether that will be available to
those projects at this time. The two projects that remain are bonded, I
would assume it would need it to take it as obligations …already been
taken care of. It is available at least until it is handeled and dealt
with in the appropriations of the proper time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion or debate? ?? the passage of
Amendment Two, all those in favor vote aye, opposed vote no.  Five
seconds will be allowed for the voting. The clerk will record the vote.</p>

36 having voted in the affirmative, and 14 in the negative, Amendment 2
is adopted.  Now the bill is back before us.  Is there any further
discussion or debate.  Senator Nesbitt, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. President, to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator, you have the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to send out a
word of thanks.  I think it was 2 days ago when I was standing on this
floor, and saying when are we going to begin to listen to listen to one
another, and we did.  I got a sheet here, I still can't figure out how
much money we're talking about, but according to this information, we
thought we're talking about $60 million, $35 million of it was for 40
years, and $28 million of it was for 50 years.  $2.8 billion.  And I
kind of point that up to you because by the end of this session, no more
money than we've got in transportation.  That's real money.  And we need
to make those decisions when we can all get in the room, and we can all
talk about transportation, and figure out what to do.  I went home last
night and pulled up the mobility fund, and you all may want to pull that
up.  They actually have a schedule of what they're fixing to spend this
money on.  And It's my understanding talking to people, that as a
general rule we created the mobility fund to do major projects that
would overwhelm the local area.  For instance, the Atkins River bridge.
It's probably $100 million, $200 million, $300 million project up there,
that $300 million would have killed that.  It would have taken every bit
of money that they have 10 years up there if you did it that way.  And
clearly it doesn't benefit that local area nearly as much as it does the
state, and it gave us a way to accumulate money to do those kinds of
projects.  If you look now what they're planning to do, it's little
projects.  It's things like HOV lanes on I-77, and the bus on the median
here in Wake County, and little things.  And I'm telling you, I've been
around this stuff for a long time, and transportation just ends up being
this way.  And the question is, who's going to decide?  And I highly
recommend to you that you not give up the ability to decide over here,
because if you do, you'll never have any input.  DOT's about more
powerful than we are.  It has a lot of power flowing to it, because all
of us want roads.  But anyhow, I commend you on that.  I would say that
I;m concerned about striking the projects.  When we put something in a
bill up here, and say we're going to do it, it gives people reason to
believe there's some certainty to it.  And it's my understanding, I
don't know if Senator Clodfelter is going to speak, or others are going
to speak in here, but the Garden Parkway project kind of has something
to do, as I understand it, with one of these terminals that we're trying
to create around the state, where you drop stuff off, and then it goes
to the court, those kinds of terminals.  The Mid-Currituck bridge was
done to resolve the problems down on the coast as best you could resolve
them.  And the whole intent of it was, well, everybody coming from up
North will use it, and we'll charge them tolls, and get back as much
money as we can get from them, and get them off of the other roads, and
the ferries and the things the local people use.  And that way they'd at
least have better access to their transportation.  But you're going to
find it very difficult over time to tell everybody down East that it
just costs too much to move you.  And that's kind of what we do to them.
 You all know that.  We've told ferries.  Well, they've got ferries
because they don't have a road, and they don't have a bridge.  If you
didn't have a road, a bridge, or something in your area, you'd want us
to try to get you from one side of the creek to the other, without
charging them an extra thing to get there.  So, there's a reason to all
this stuff.  It's not a boondoggle, and it's not somebody just using
power, it's decisions we make up here that are usually driven by people
in influential positions, but</p>

There are areas of this state that will never be served if it’s left to
one power center in Wake County.  And if you’re new here and haven’t
learned it, it won’t take you long to figure that one out. So I object
to taking things out I told Senator Rabin this morning I said, I
understand how the game is played and rest assured when we take it back
we’ll take all yours out.  But that still don’t make it right and so I’m
very defensive to these projects and hope that before the end of the
session we can see the wisdom and perhaps doing toll roads in these
areas so they don’t get in here and gobble up all the money.

School from Surry County there with us today.  If we have any students

announcement?  Any notices or announcements? Senator Daniel, for what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Short moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Senators, on your desk I’ve placed a little
historical sketch of Thomas Burke, the founder of Burke County is named
after. There’s a portrait if you haven’t seen it over in the right hand
side of the chamber so I hope you’ll stop and look at that. There’s only
one known drawing of Governor Burke and its located in the North
Carolina Archives and from that Burke County History Museum commissioned
a portrait which you see on the right hand side of the chamber over
there which is on loan from the Burke County History Museum temporarily.
 I think it will be displayed in the third floor gazebo or whatever
that’s called by an architect and then will be returned to the Burke
County History Museum so I hope you’ll take an opportunity to look at
that and I think one of the notable things that I thought about Governor
Burke’s history was probably the only Governor that was captured by the
British imprisoned and escaped to return to his duties as Governor.  So
I think that’s an interesting part of his history.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator.  We’ll call that the atrium, instead of the gazebo.
Any other notices or announcements? Senator Gunn, for what purpose do
you rise?  I’m sorry, Senator Goolsby, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Moment of personal privilege, just to make another comment on Thomas
Burke.  I noticed Senator did not make a comment about what his training
was.  He was both a practitioner of medicine and law and ?? the end that
he passed away at age 36. I think I know why.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other notices or announcements? Is there any further business to
come before the Senate? If not the Chair recognizes Senator Berger for a
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  I move that the Senate do now adjourn subject
to the introduction of bills and resolutions, the receipt, referral and
re-referral of Committee Reports, and the receipt of messages from the
House and the Governor. To reconvene on Monday, March 11, 2013 at 7 p.m.

Motion to the Senate do now adjourn subject to the stipulations stated
by senator Berger. To reconvene on March 11th, at 7 p.m. seconded by
