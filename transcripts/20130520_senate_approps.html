Please take your seats and we will get our senate subcommittee on health
and human services started. I have a couple of announcements to make
before we get started. First of all, our senate sergeants at arms are
here to help us. Steve Wilson Robert Young and Ken Kerbey and we thank
the se gentlemen for their help on a daily basis when they’re up here
and we appreciate it so much.  Near the end of the hour we are going to
devote 30 minutes to public comments and a list is being made and if you
would like to offer comments those of you who are from the public we
would be glad to hear from you. We will impose a 2-minute limit and if
you stick to that limit, and I ask that you do, we’ll be able to hear
from 10 different speakers.  That will be toward the end of that time
and we do intend to get out of here. This will be our sub committee
meeting and we will end at 6:00 so that we can go to session at 7
tonight.  Let me go over the ground rules that have been established for
appropriations.  There will be no amendments or votes taken in our sub
committee this afternoon but tomorrow when the full appropriations base
budget committee meets there will an opportunity for people to submit
amendments and here are the rules that must be met in order to make the
amendment met for consideration.  Money can only be transferred only
among items within the same sub committee section.  Amendments where
money is being transferred among items within a sub committee must
clearly identify the items or programs that are being increased and
decreased.  Non-recurring reductions cannot be made to fund recurring
renditions. Amendments that spend reversions are not allowed.
Amendments that increase or create new management flexibility reserves
are not allowed. Amendments that increase spending in the sub committee
budgets are not allowed.  Amendments are not allowed where funding for
an item comes from statewide reserves.  Since this is a meeting for full
appropriations amendments that address finance portions of the bill will
not be heard. Amendments must be in writing the originally signed with
75 copies for distribution. To be considered a proposed amendments must
be logged in by the city clerk in room 643 by 10 am on Tuesday may 21st
2013.  Now having said all that the proposed senate HHS budget should’ve
been received by all the members of the committee and this time I would
like to turn proceedings over to co chairman senator Ralph Hise.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you MR chairman. Committee members to the public. I would be
greatly amiss if I did not begin this process by thanking our staff.
Susan Jacobs has put together an incredible team and they have done a
great job to what I think has been a very difficult task in the Medicaid
budget and in an ever changing and growing environments in Medicaid from
me and the chairman and other committee e members I would like to say
thanks. As I begin this overview and I will begin with the money report.
And I’m gonna go through several items in this step by step and
eventually we will go thru it more chronologically but I do want to
begin for those on the money report page G13, I’m gonna begin with what
was the April surprise of this year coming forward.</p>

Areas that we were previously funding. Moving on, G3, number 10 and 11.
We have transferred the funding for 2500 Pre-K slots in the first year
and 5000 slots in the second year to the child care subsidy program, in
which we will fund 2600 students the first year and 5200 students the
second year. It is out belief that there is a stronger focus in the
community looking at development birth through five than only looking at
four year olds which is where the subsidies come into play. And we think
we can do better things in our community by moving those funds
accordingly. We also, I will say there is also some subsidy funds moving
in that tends to come across in various block grants. So the total funds
have also in overall net increase in the next item number 12, a 9.8
million.
Moving on, G4. Federal funds for county child welfare services, the feds
are cutting out, a significant amount of these funds they're actually
changing the formulation as I understand it Typically the state covers
31% of those funds. we actually with this budget fund we cover 33% of
those funds to continue providing for child welfare services. Line 17
also under child welfare, we provide funding to support an additional
100 form of foster care youth and adopted children after age 12 for
scholarships, for their funding at the community college and university
levels.
G5, number 25, project care. This was a program started in a handful of
counties all across the state as a pilot program. The governor sought to
continue the pilot program as it moved forward we have maken [??] the
decision to instead expand this program statewide. This is a program
that provides respite services for families for caring for a person with
dementia at home. So that individuals in that sense can have them stay
at facilities for time periods to provide respites for the family.
Number 27, we have decided to close four of the sixteen child
development service agencies in the state. We are prioritizing those
closures on the basis of services that are currently available in those
communities outside of those service centers. So the department will
make the decisions on closing those centers. The CSA's that have the
highest case loads of children who reside in rural or medically under
served areas of the state. We did this for a savings recurring of 10
million dollars in the second year and non-recurring savings of 8
million in the first year.
G6, number 28, the adapt [??] drug purchasing program. The governor in
his budget placed an 8 million dollar cut in these funds in both years
because that is what the program had reverted in the previous year for
unspent funds. There is a lot of confusion as to the amount of funding
that program will need to continue to operate to provide the medications
that are necessary. There is also a lot of change coming in the next
year and we're beginning to assess what individuals will be able to
receive those drugs when they're on an exchange in the state and have
insurance on the exchange so have questions about how to continue to
fund it. So while we have continued the 8 million dollar recurring cut
for both years, we have put a 6 million dollar non-recurring funds back
into that we think will keep the...</p>

on hold for both years as we begin to make some of these assessments
moving forward.
Items 30 and 31, under Oral Health.  We provided for 39 dental
hygienists, 2 dental technicians and 7 other administrative positions in
the state that can work with the school systems to identify dental
problems but could not by their position and ?? provide services for
those dental problems.  We have instead taken the funding available for
those dental hygienist positions and and moved it to the local health
departments who have clinics so that they can actually provide services
but in doing so we have eliminated much of the state oversight that was
required and is listed in those positions that you see there for
individuals who were identifying problems in the community.  Now that
will fall under the health department who already have dental clinics
and will provide these funds for the provision of actual services within
those areas.
G7 36.  The ?? Centers.  The alcohol, drug abuse treatment centers.  We
are closing the three state operated ?? centers effective July 1.  These
centers, residential treatment programs, have shown no evidence that
they provide better outcomes than community based treatments, however,
their cost for operating these centers averages to $158,000 a bed for a
year, 240 beds.  We have instead taken a portion of those funds that
would be roughly equivalent to serving those individuals, we rounded it
up, roughly equivalent to serving those individuals in community
settings what we pay for individuals in community settings, and have
transferred a portion of those savings, $10,000,000 and $20,000,000 in
those years to provide those services within their community.
We have also made the decision in number 39 to close the ?? ?? which is
a 24 bed residential school for children with mental health or behavior
disorders.  This service operates at $112,500 a bed and is not a full
time program.  These are students who are there for part of the week
that is moving forward.
We have a need, as with both of these, we have a need to provide these
services, we just don't believe the centers in which are providing them
do so in a cost effective manner.
G8 Statewide Telepsychiatry Program.  In order to reduce the issues that
we have in hospitals all over this state with mental health patients and
getting a diagnosis and getting them placed, we are establishing a
statewide telepsychiatry program and are funding $2,000,000 in each year
to get that program up and going as hospitals participate all over the
state, individuals can be evaluated and diagnosed and assigned more
quickly to treatment centers all across the state, ultimately something
we believe will be a cost saving for the state and particularly for our
hospitals and community centers.  We also provide funding for opening
the new ?? Hospital, 43.  Compared to the Governor's budget we do adjust
these figures to more accurately reflect when the anticipated opening of
the hospital is but we provide $11.5 million and $16.5 million the
second year to fund equipment purchases and prepare for the opening of
that hospital.
G9 Mental Health Drug Management.  We are now beginning a process of
pre-authorizing mental health drugs in this state.  Our conversations
that we've had with psychologists and psychiatrists all over the state
tell us that we still have an issue</p>

<p id="020:00">
With these prescriptions being over prescribed and prescribed for off
label use  particularly not in conjunction with counseling and other
treatments other exterias and particularly involve with the prescription
of these drugs  to children.  We believe that this pre-authorization can
 address that issue in the State.  Moving forward and we will  save the
State tremendous money and medications that we are providing for
individuals that are not consistent with their plan of treatment.   Item
48,  the hospital provider says consistent with what was in originally
in the transparency bill, we have increased the State's retention of
that assessment by 7 million dollars from 43 to 50 million dollars.
However, we have now changed that there is a percentage.  So, 15.6%  of
assessments will be retained to the State  rather than a flat fee amount
that we've worked with for the last  2 years, this is a change that can
reflects lot of different areas kinda, if we move through the budget but
coming forward so you will see that in the second year that would
increase, our estimate is 7.1  million additional fund returned. Items
49 and 50  we felt were for transparency  purposes we want it to
backyard at this point and show the State and State match expenditures
for CCNC, what portion goes to its  services and what portion goes to
position payments.  This is a part of the, there is a, you will see this
slider under Child Health Insurance as well. so to get the overall
picture there is some summing together of couple of areas but under
medicated area, the budget this is how you see what we were spending on
CCNC and what they spend on permitive ?? assessments.   51, now to play
HT10 Hospital base rates. We are now creating  a regional system for
hospital base rates across the State. What you will see the effect of
this is   we look at hospital spend on medicate patients even
considering for diagnosis  of the individual that are going to the
hospital will.  There is no economies of stale in hospital care.  The
larger the hospital you go to, the more it will cost across the State.
This services the fact and we also have an issue which are spoken by
many   times in which rural health care exists in the State   because of
the good will of urban areas which were the profits are and as they
balance up, that's what they send funds back to padying ?? services.
This begins to move the playing field to raise base rates to a more even
level   within our region so that larger hospitals are not holding a
much higher base rate than the rural hospitals are. This is was in
within each region. It is not a net money move, but it is a significant
policy dredge.  52 Medicate co-payments.  This  one of the government,
following the government  recommendation this move medicate co-payments
to the maximum amount allowed under Federal Law, I think it's a movement
from 3 dollars and 3 dollars and 90 cent for the co-payment for
individuals on medicate. Item 54  that was in the Governor's budget, we
did reduce hospital out-patient payments  from 80% to 70% of cost.
Number 55, we have also began to implement a shared savings plan in
which we will with-hold 4% of provider payments on medicate with the
exception of primary care because under the  Affordable Care Act, you
can do that until 25th end. We are with-holding a portion of those
payments  and CCNC along with    the department that will develop the
measures that will show the cost reductions and efficiencies that exist
and we can begin to pay those back to providers  in performance based
measures as we move forward. It is our hope that not only moving forward
that we will send to see those payments  will come back in addition to
cost saving measures that come to the State as a result of rewarding
those providers.</p>

Kind of moving forward, so. 64 we do allow additional personal care
services for qualified individuals, this is particularly individuals
with diagnosis of Alzheimer’s, or dementia. This was the result of the
cutback last year to 80's on the comparability measure, we now are
expanding that back to 130 hours for those individuals, but we are
adjusting rates overall to accommodate for that, reducing rates overall
to accommodate for that I mean. Make sure that words in. We have gone
over G13, really extensively. We'll go to G14. We are doing a study of
community care North Carolina. We're matching the 100,000 we're putting
up with 100,000 that's available funding that is coming up to do an
actuarial in a model of the money saved in improved healthcare, how it
comes with CCNC. The remainder of these budgets are items that you have
for the most part seen elsewhere in the budget, but these are how they
apply to the health choice section instead of the Medicaid section as
they're budget separately. You'll see again the mental health drug
management, the rate freeze' for automatic increases, shared savings
plan, prescription drug on invoice cost. Again you see the CCNC funds
that are ?? under the health choice plan. An additional rebase that is
necessary for health choice, and the changes to the hospital cost
settlement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Why don't we see if we have any questions on the money report before we
go into the provisions? Members of the committee do you have any
questions thus far? Senator Robinson. Senator McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I probably wanna be recognized for a series of questions. I'm not
quite sure where to begin except early on in the report if that's
appropriate Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That'll be fine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Give me a minute to flip back to the early pages. We'll just
kind of take em in the order in which you covered them in the money
report. Let's start out with item number three here which talks about
the funding which is for NC Fast. I noticed you got $864,000 in year two
I did not see this appropriation in year one. And of course I'm sure
this is only some partial appropriation coming into this particular
segment of the budget, that there are other ways this efforts being
financed. But could you speak to why there's nothing here under 13, 14.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is a division over and above what's considered in a rebase.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Moving forward in the funds that are coming forward. This was a
Governor's item in his budget as the department has said they will need
to additional funds to match the federal funds moving forward in the
year in which they need it, so.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK. Now let me ask you this, let's move to item number six, the
competitive program for the non-profits. I understand that we have quite
a few non-profits that historically been funded under this particular
section of the budget. But many of them are reliant upon funding that
comes in from the state of North Carolina for the work that they do. It
would seem to me that if we were establishing some type of a block grant
program for a, considering applications that it would be quite a
logistical pass to organize that to establish some type of merit based
system for analyzing who the individual applicants are, and for doing
this in an expedient matter that would ensure that those that are
deserving meritorious non-profits would be able to get funds which they
need in a timely way. With that said what's in vision about how this
would operate? And what do we know about the department in terms of
their capacity to take this task on? I don't see any kind of companion
piece unless there's maybe a special provision that provides for
additional staffing, and resources that we needed to carry out the task
which would be contemplated and necessary through item number six.</p>

Mrs. Thomas
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
senator McKissick those, the child, those 16 agencies are operated under
the early intervention branch in public heath and for the pass several
years. That branch has been running a lot of vacancies in those
divisions and that was the source of a lot of the money, as you can see
17 million each year. That have been transferred over to medication shot
falls. So obviously those program were not operating currently at
capacity. If it were left up to the department, this agencies would not
have to close until July first 2014. And  it would be left up to the
department to determine which of those sixteen will close and they will
report that to the LME in the interim.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you so they are kind of like underutilized resources that we were
using as resources to cover Medicaid short falls.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thats basically what's been happening the last couple of years. And as
the department, you'll see a provision that follows this money. That
directs the department to ensure that they keep open those CDSAs that
have been serving a lot of the rural areas or medically under-served
areas.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
That is good to know. Let me ask this when it come to number 30, 31
dealing with oral heath section. It looks like there were previously 48
old time positions. Founded to the tantamount 1. excuse me 2.8 million
dollars or so closer to 2.9. we are shifting it to the local health
departments. Where we get them 1.6 million. Who are we gonna serve the
same population the same need base when we are cutting them short by 1.2
million dollars. Because I think oral health is being one of those
things that is obsoletely imperative. We need to do and I think of this
organization of this day. That ?? a lot of free services. And I see
those clinics operated and the lines are around the block with people
trying to get in so knowing that this is only going to ?? our budget
with Medicaid. How are we going to do this. How can we reduce it by 1.2
million and serve the same population.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Most of the difference is between 30 and 31, 1.2 million, is the
position that are listed and eliminated here. As well as the
administrated positions and others. The funding for what was going to
dental hygienist position. While you can transfer individuals form state
to county. The funding we paid for those individuals is now moving to
the counties.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Is it anticipated that that would be sufficient to move the same demands
levels. The same patient levels.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
It is anticipating that it would be able to serve 39 additional
hygienist in those areas.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Perhaps staff can share
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
yes senator McKissick. That which you don't see here. This is just a
general fund portion. The money that is going to the counties. This
position had also Medicaid match coming in. so is anticipated that those
county health department would get some Medicaid match for those dentals
positions and their dental clinics.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you. Number 36 we are closing the alcohol and drug  treatment
centers this residential programs. Do we have a assurances that the
counties and other organization can go out there and provide the same
type of need, the same type of services. Cos I would assume that this.
They might have been operating at cost that we should control and
contain far more effectively than we have in the past. If some people
that really do need residential programs ?? out patience facilities. So
how do we get that population serve that we really need to be taken of
the streets, and put in a place were is a controlled environment to help
then overcome their alcohol and drug abuse problems.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
First of all so that this services are not provided by the county they
are provided by the LME, MCOs that we currently are on a regional basis
and not coming over. I'll also say that three ADACs centers in the
state, are not providing state wide residential services for  every one
that needed it. Its not unusual to see people in areas in the state that
would be two or three hours away from one of this facilities. They do
serve individuals who are close then they do individuals that are
further away, form their services within there populations. What I
looked at, what my researches looked at as saying. That</p>

best courses of treatment.  Now there aren't--there are no magic bullets
that are coming in.  Provide treatments that involve an individual's
primary care physician, that are ongoing treatments that also allow them
to adjust to their new life in their current environment; versus taking
someone out, putting them in a separate environment, getting them off
the cycle and then sending them to another environment later thereafter.
 I mean, there are services that are, at times, seem to be more
effective when they're provided closer to an individual's residency.
And we believe--I believe that the community areas can do this. It's not
that I don't think there aren't--we don't--we believe that there are
individuals who have been well-served by this; there are individuals who
have been well-served by services in their community.  [??] moving
forward--we just feel that we can--in this time--that when you have to
bring these down to dollars and cents, we believe we can provide the
services to the state in a better manner and fewer funds by not having
three highly expensive residential treatments centers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, move on to number 39, the Wright School.  I see we're closing it
in its entirety, and that I find deeply concerning because I know I've
visited that facility on a number of occasions.  And, I've just heard
amazing testimonials from the families that have had students that
were--attended this facility, and I find it deeply distressing and
concerning that we would be closing a facility that can have such a
great need and demand, and I don't know where those individuals now are
going to be served within our system.  I mean, what are the thoughts
about that population?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, first of all, this is not a new position for the Senate.  This has
been in the previous Senate budgets that have come across and looked at
this costing and I say that it is quite--when you look at what we're
spending on [??]estate, and what we're putting into the Medicaid program
and other areas--services in the state as a whole--and the needs we have
out there, and we continue to say that we're going to at $112,500 a bed,
fund a part-time residential facility.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I--I would hope you guys would give greater thought and reflection to
it.  I know the cost is, perhaps, high; but when I've seen people who
wrote me the transitions that their students had made that attended that
facility, and I remember being there one day with Representative Dollar,
and he heard and saw the same things.  I mean, I would just hope that
you would re-think that as a part of your considerations moving forward.
 Let me ask you about number 59; it's exchange premiums, with elective
Medicaid eligibles.  I'm skipping over quite a few other things in the
interest of time.  It looks to me as if, while we will be paying for
these individuals who will be Medicaid eligibles, [??] part of a
--getting insurance on a health benefits exchange that, simply by
helping them get insurance, doesn't help them pay the deductibles or
help them cover other expenses relating to their coverage.  But you
speak to that issue because it would seem to me that they would still,
at that point in time, be [??] change the benefits they would receive
today.  And, you know, how--how it is anticipated--you know--it will be
identified which, by the policy they will get, what the scope of
services will be, what--I mean, they're going to have out-of-pocket
expenses now to pay in connection with this in terms of going in and
receiving services.  But could you speak to that, somewhat?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will.  The Affordable Care Act, in--as it was passed and moving
forward in its determining in the exchanges, I will say, reduces the
co-pay and out-of-mocket [sic] paximums [sic] relative to an
individual's poverty level, as well as to the percentage of their
income, they would be charged each month for those services.  We are
picking up the--they will have lower co-pays, they will have lower
out-of-pocket maximums, depending on where they're at on the scale.  The
exchange scale goes all the way from 100 to 400 in putting that in; but
there's some variations that come across that--that adjust that for
individuals of what--in their determination--and what an individual at
150% of poverty would be able to pay, moving forward.  So, we're taking
those recommendations and applying them to this system here for what the
feds have kind of come up with in their wisdom.  And I also think it's
very important to know an individual's care, particularly in this case,

...women's healthcare. We offered them a program that was available
while they're pregnant and as soon as that was over we'll just drop you
and now you have nothing to continue up for because once you're not a
pregnant female, you don't qualify at 185% of federal poverty anymore,
so we were providing a temporary patch plan that had some better
services in it. I don't deny the fact that there's savings with doing
this that's coming forward. But we take that individual and we say,
well, the federal standards have set that a person at this would be able
to pay these amounts on theirs. We pay their portion of the premium for
them, which is an additional savings for that time period and they have
something moving forward, particularly in a pregnancy, where they would
have met the out of pocket maximum where potentially the co-pays moving
forward. And after the program would now have deductibles and after the
program, would now have an insurance plan that continues for them when
during that annual period they would have already met a lot of those
costs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What are you basically, and correct me if I'm mistaken
because the way I'm seeing it we're paying that premium that's covering
these people that are between 133% and 185% of the federal poverty line,
but they're going to have needs separate and apart from say in your
instance, example, the pregnancy where they would in fact end up. Are
you saying that we're still going to pay whatever co-pays are going to
be required or anything else that would...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, we pay their premium for the insurance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The premium, that's what I thought. So I can imagine
there will be a number of...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The exchange itself will reduce their out of pocket
costs, their premiums and others, depending on their income level.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So you're saying the policy will take that into
consideration based upon this case.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The federal policy that develops the exchange takes
those into consideration.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. And I understand that, too, I'm just awful afraid
that some of these people are going to end up with the short of the
stick financially. That's why I raise that concern. And I see underneath
there the companion item, we're now going to be limiting adults to 10
visits a year to a doctor. Do we have some idea of how many individuals
might be impacted by this? I mean I understand there's some exemption
here for chronic conditions but I don't know how many people will
utilize these types of physician office services actually go that
frequently. I mean somebody's going to have to be pretty sick to be
going more than 10 times a year. So it actually doesn't seem like an
unreasonable limitation, but do we know how many people might be
impacted by this change? What percentage and when I say the number, I'm
not looking for an absolute number. About what percentage?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let's ask Mr. Stevo and Nat, answer that. Help you
with that, Senator McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick, I actually do have the numbers, but
not with me. I'll be happy to get those to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That would be appreciated, if you could. I'm sure
there are other members of the committee that have other concerns
separate and apart from my own, but on this particular, what were your
presentation, can you go back into these costs and break out the
imbedded costs that are attributed to the shortfall we have right now,
compared to what it is in terms of growth that we anticipate? And I know
when Madam Secretary was here and the speech, they talked about
monitoring our costs all more closely moving forward, but can you
disaggregated what we're looking at here in terms of these figures for
year 1 and year 2 of this budget? Because one's at 434 million and then
the other is 607. Can you help me out with this a bit?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let's ask Ms. Susan Jacobs to respond, Senator
McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, Senator McKissick. The Governor's original
budget that he submitted included a current year shortfall of $100
million. So his original rebases for Medicaid was based on that $100
million shortfall, which was very early in the fiscal year. The most
recent information we had was a current year estimate of approximately
$248 million in the current year. So of this rebase amount, at one point
it would have been $248 million based on the most recent information we
had from the Office of State Budget and the department. The high end of
the range being projected by the Department of Health and Human
Services, the Division of Medicaid, right now for the current year is
$283 million. That's what's in the current House bill for the current
year shortfall. And the $283 million is being anticipated in this budget
as a recurring...</p>

Or fall, so of the 434 million dollars you see, 283 million dollars is
because there is a structural short fall to 83.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you Susan. Obviously this whole issue related to Medicare is
something that is a big concern to all of us. We obviously have to do
something to get us beyond this continuing deficits. I see on this next
page here, you talked about community care North Carolina study. What is
that study gonna accomplished and what is it that we hope to see
accomplished with that. And ?? a lot of discussion with the secretary's
office by moving to a manicure model. I'm trying to see where all of
this pieces fit together in this jigsaw puzzles, interns of what we are
going to be doing moving forward. There's a, I'm sure you heard the same
thoughts, concerns and  reservations raise by many in the health care
community. Particularly among hospitals about the manicure model. And
how is proposed that we are going to deal with that, with tree or four
entities out there now. Competing and being assigned different persons
some of which may end up with some high risk individuals, suddenly end
up with lower risk ones. Can you help me with what we are planing to do
here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I'm get to the provisions on page 171. This are following up on the
particularly on the auditors report they coma out earlier this year.
That would require to engage medical research for me, scientific ??
study by on actual data, to determine whether CCNC model saves money and
improves health outcome. That is coming forward. I would assume that
that would also be an actuarial involvement. ?? what we were intending
what we would like to see, is that particular programs and others at
CCNC is put out. What is been there effectiveness. What is been their
call savings as well as there model as a whole. Moving forward I think
that this is a babel information, as you move forward in developing what
would be the future of the Medicaid system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Last two   question and that is there were 57 private duty nursing
limitations. I'm trying to see how that ties into the actual numbers of
hour a day that people actually require, need typically private duty
nursing services. If you were capping out that cost. Then secondly this
hospital base rates that we are moving to the new regional system. We
certainly wanted to make sure that our rural hospital are adequately
compensated. But I also don't want to see our urban hospital short
change in some respects. How are we gonna approach this with this new
methodology to make sure that there is this equitable balance, interns
of compensation levels for appropriate types of patients.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Brunstetter. I think  we have kind of a breakdown that we can
get to you at a latter point for each hospital in the system. What the
impact would be of moving the base rate in coming forward. It is not, I
would not care ?? this point. There is a large shift. But when you look
at the profitably, of hospitals across the state the expandability I
guess when you are talking abut the non profits, profitability is a
little different number. There is not problems in our urban areas. There
ability to move forward and bring on new practices. While there unbans
are running deficits each year. Is not hard to look at your urban
hospital to see what they're sending to rural areas already. Moving
forward, we just doing that in the base rates. Your first part again,
real quick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
That was the private duty nursing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Private duty nursing. That is equivalent in the, the governor had
separate recommendation that was dealing with the, changing the rates
for  LPNs and RENs down to the OPN rates. As well a twelve hour maximum.
We took funding that was equivalent at the RENs level for the twelve
hours, and set it as a daily maximum. That was coming forward. We didn't
love it. We chose not to lower it to the OPN rates cos of the way there
structure is kind of set up. And we did it a daily maximum, so if they

lower rate for whatever different reasons they could access more hours
so that amount is considered at the RN level at 12 hours, what that
amount is that's now capped out at it's daily maximum and they're free
as they have flexibility whatever flexibility they have to move around
that they are free to utilize. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Robinson did you have a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
have several. Senator McKissick, thank you mr. chair, Senator McKissick
has said some and I'll try not to duplicate those but some I need some
additional information on. I'll start from where he stopped in the back
so it won't be so difficult Senator Hise to follow back to the hospital
rate number 61, freezing those services, are you taking into account the
larger hospitals to the smaller ones any overhead costs and is this
going to threaten the collaboration cause a lot of the larger hospitals
are the reason a lot of those smaller hospitals have been able to
provide those services is because of that collaboration so when you do a
base rate are you taking into account the overhead costs of those larger
hospitals? [SPEAKER CHANGES] What we are looking at is specifically on
61 we're freezing the automatic increases which are sometimes
inflationary or sometimes others that come into a program outside of
anything else we are doing we're putting a freeze on those as we do for
a lot of things kind of across the budget moving forward when you're
bringing in revenues is where it's going for those base rates and
others, I think our healthcare survives on those partnerships I think it
would be I would say let me say personally it would be a grave mistake
for the urban hospitals to begin to believe that they are going to step
out of their partnerships while their funding remains intact in this
state and they are going to abandon that process but I think there is a
lot of opportunities that we are looking to make those rural hospitals
more stable on their own without the need for those requirements.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ok, another question but just a comment on that I
think the fact that we are also expecting hospitals to absorb a lot of
the emergency room visits not by having medicaid that we don't, we
really shouldn't be threatening those relationships we need to depend on
them and not kind of what I put what I said penalize them more. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I would see no indication that urban rates have higher
uninsured than rural areas do. Matter of fact I would think the
relationship you would see would be quite the opposite. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Well I know, I know but that relationship is going to have to
be stronger because there's going to be more codependence is my point.
To number 59 about, you referenced that as a specific for a pregnant
woman and my questions are too that a lot of those women are in
pregnancy care management programs so does this affect the funding for
pregnancy care management programs in our state and when you mentioned
services after the woman has given birth which is important because
currently women don't have any they don't have the health services after
that how long will those services continue? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
question is to whether how long the services would continue depends on
we pick the time period that they would have been on medicaid, we pay
the premium for them, depending on the case 22 dollars a month 25
dollars a month, as long as they continue to pay that premium moving
forward they would continue to have that service as everyone else who's
on the exchange at 133, 135 percent of poverty would have that option.
Whether or not the services would be available to those or how they
would fund medicare is currently they are accepting medicare as a
provider and do not accept private insurance in that then I would
suggest that they either that those programs would adapt and be able to
accept private insurance moving forward and as you would find with most
providers in the state the private insurance rates they would receive
for services would be significantly higher than the medicaid rates they
currently receive. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up Mr. Chair on that
particular one. I'm talking about the pregnancy care management programs
are really funded through medicaid to the state am I right and that my
question is am I wrong and if I'm wrong correct me and if this would
effect the funding...</p>

individuals off. Individuals, I believe from my Smart Start Program for
individuals who are enrolled in school and students, children of those
second, and then move to individuals who are not prioritized. Moving
forward, I don't know if anyone has any more information on what the
enrollment criteria are for subsidies. I can get you ?? coming across,
so I can get that as quickly as it comes through.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
OK.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
And we prioritize the distribution now to higher star facilities, 4 or 5
stars.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
OK. Just a follow up to that, Mr. Chair, while they are looking. Do I
understand that some of the Smart Start programs won't be funded, or
will all of them be funded the way they are funded now? Or you're going
to leave, or the DSS is, will that change in terms of how the Smart
Starts are funded through the DSS, or which ones will get so many slots,
etcetera.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The administration of the funds, so if you look at the funds as whole,
where they were being placed are now placed in DSS. The money is moving,
but that money was required to go out to individuals, kind of to begin
with. To go out to centers and others to slot the numbers. You have ??
coming on, you have several things going on in DSS. You have, in certain
counties, three different agencies deciding who's on what. This is an
attempt to consolidate that and make sure DSS is doing that, kind of
across the state. That they have the funds to administer it and keep it
up. I'm moving forward as a provision coming later, very significantly
more funding in this budget for individuals from birth to 5 to receive
services within the subsidy system than there has been previously.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
OK. Just a clarification. So basically, how the funds are administered
changes, but not necessarily slots to different counties? In terms of
funding or allocations to different counties.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
There will be more slots to each of the counties based on their funding
formula with a hold harm- There was a cut in previous years that said no
county could go below this, there's a continued hold harmless so that we
don’t continue to take them below that, even if their population
changed. But predominately, this is making sure that we are providing
more slots out there in the Child Subsidy Program.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Why don't we go to provisions at this time and if time allows, if
there's still any further questions about the money report we'll come
back to it. Senator Hise, you need a drink of water?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I might grab one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
You can turn in your provisions document to page 116. That's the
beginning of the Department of Health and Human Services.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Beginning on 116, this is a provision that comes from the Department as
to, that allows them to reorganize relative positions, operating costs
that they can show cost efficiencies with. Moving forward, these are all
subject to OSBM approval and include the identification of up to 32
existing positions. It allows them to get some flexibility in moving
positions around, and others to run the department better. The next
provision beginning on 117 follows the money item. This is the layout
for the competitive process, which I'm sure we'll have a lot of
individuals looking through, but it deals with the programs for autism,
deals with brain injury, deals with substance abuse and addiction, deals
with individuals of intellectual developmental disabilities, as all
those different areas did. And moving forward, and we come down and we
have 13 of them that are laid out here that’s coming forward in this
provision for the different areas to be funded by the department. The

processes and those kind of things but cannot submit the application
until they receive General Assembly approval. There is no way in the
three weeks we kinda had in this that we can get through all the details
of a Medicaid reform package and what needs to be done so that is why
we're putting that process...we are not stopping the ball, we are
allowing it to move forward but we are clearly putting in a process of
General Assembly approval into that. This is in conjunction with the
Governor so we'll begin that development and we will take that look at
the full plan when we have it in front of us.
[Speaker changes.]159 to 161 is the insurance premiums for pregnant
women. 162-163 has the additional personal care services for qualified
individuals. 165 to 166, this is a significant change dealing with
administrative hearings, particularly when we identify over payments or,
I guess I would say, fraudulent activities in the system.  We, as a
state, are in an interesting situation where we find them for the entire
clock starts, if we have not recovered any funds within a year, we have
to make the payment back to the federal government for their 2/3 share
whether or not we've recovered any yet or not. Then we wind up in a
position where they could file bankruptcy and you could never...file
bankruptcy's a little different but they could fade out, they could
disappear...there's all kinds of things that would make them
unrecoverable that means by identifying it...or identifying an
over-payment, you could just be costing us a 2/3 payment to the federal
government. What we begin to do is take a portion of that payment from
future payments of the provider during the hearing period over that
process to make sure they're laid out, and that over a year period, we
could recoup most of the...99% of those funds, kinda moving forward and
make sure that we would be whole at the time we hafta make the payment
back to the federal government.  169-170 is the shared savings plan with
providers. 170, the assessment to a percentage. 171-172...171 is the
community care outcome study and reporting.  171-172, we're setting per
member, per month instead of being a flat...we're looking to set per
member per month instead of being a flat per member, per month. We're
doing it in a ????????????? that says for providers that are doing a
better job, that are implementing more, we will set forth...we also say
that CCNC will not provide a permanent...there will be a zero payment
for prime member per month...per member per month for providers who do
not, do nothing in conjunction...right now, CCNC...all of their
treatments and others are recommendations and there is no requirement
that the providers follow any of those. So we're trying to clearly put
in place that you actually hafta not just sign up to receive the per

Ms. Thomas says. In the effort of full disclosure I want to mention to
you that I work for the North Carolina Division of Aging Adult Services
that administers both of these programs for 30 years, worked in both of
these programs. Certainly item 25 I recognize and understand the
frustration of the members of the General Assembly about project care
which is a program to support family caregivers a persons with
Alzheimer's and not having this program state wide. I also was a family
member for my mother who required round the clock care for 8 years who
had Alzheimer's - we could not get this program for our family either
because it was not offered in our county. Now having said that I am
familiar with conversations right now to make this program state wide
with the existing resources. 500 thousand dollars is needed to take care
of the federal funding that is going away however. Now having said that
though let me move to the home and community care block grant. The home
and community care block grant is, as Ms. Thomas says, does allow
counties flexibility in what they fund. There are 16 services that can
be funded included respite care which serves a lot of persons with
Alzheimer's. This program is targeted at people 60+ and most of them
have incomes less that 200% of poverty and they are not eligible for
medicaid so these are a lot of folks that fall through the cracks. Now
this program has been around for a long time, however in the last 10
years there's 7,000 less people being served now than there were 10
years ago and the simple reason for that is because of the increase of
cost of providing services and I have the data if you'd like to see
this. Now 2 of the biggest services that are offered through this are
in-home services and home delivered meals. They have huge waiting lists
in North Carolina. Now the double whammy on this is that North Carolina
is receiving 2 billion dollars, I'm sorry, 2 million dollars less in
home and community care block grants the federal money that's coming in
due to the sequester. We take another 2.9 million dollar reduction on
top of the 2 million dollar reduction they're getting through sequester.
This is really going to be an awful awful burden for these local
agencies to be able to try to address the genuine need that's out there.
I'll be glad to share data I have and to provide any other information
should you have questions. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mrs.
Bethel. Our next speaker is Adam Linker from North Carolina Justice
Center. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Adam Linker from the North Carolina Justice
Center, thank you Senators Pate and Hise. Setting aside some of the
other concerns I wanted to speak very specifically about the provision
of shifting pregnant women who we are covering into the exchange. I
understand the desire to put some populations into the exchange but I'd
be especially concerned about doing it now with pregnant women who we
currently provide medicaid for. First the way the special provision was
written it wasn't clear whether we intended to pay the full premium but
it sounds like we are intending to pay the full premium. If a pregnant
woman has used tobacco products of course we want to get them into a
smoking cessation program but federal subsidies don't cover the portion
of the premium that increases due to smoking so I want to make sure
hopefully we are paying the full premium for pregnant women both who
have used tobacco products and for those who have not. Second  of all, I
think there's just a lot of concerns about shifting people from medicaid
to private insurance especially a vulnerable population like this. For
example would a pregnant woman be able to lose insurance, lose her
private insurance policy? That's a question. Second of all in medicaid a
pregnant woman is not denied coverage or service because she doesn't
have the copay amount. The copays are higher in private insurance so
could they be turned away from service because they don't have the copay
amount if they go into private coverage. There's just a lot of policy
protections we provide for people in medicaid that are not there in the
private insurance market. So I just hope we can take a closer look at
that and make sure that we are not burdening pregnant woman because
again North Carolina used to have one of the highest infant mortality
rates in the nation. We've made tremendous steps in that by expanding
medicaid up the 185% of federal poverty level and I just want to make
sure that we don't regress in that. Thank you very much. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Linker</p>

Been asked to be sure that anyone who has a comment from the public
would be given the opportunity to speak. So if you have any information
you'd like to relay on to the members of the subcommittee, I'd ask you
to please come forward at this time. Senator Hise, I think you've
answered everyone's questions. I don't see any. Are there any other
committee members who have questions? Senator Robinson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. It gives me a chance to finish
up a little bit. Senator Hise, back to your explanations on, I want to
ask you to reiterate what you said about after six months, if we have
the system in place then, or recite that in terms of the waiver for
Medicaid expansion. Go over that process. I wanna make sure I heard you
clearly. I'm hoping I did.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Basically what this provision does, is it allows the
department to go ahead, move forward, and the executive branch to go
ahead and move forward on developing the waiver of, the 1115 waiver for
the state of North Carolina. The demonstration waiver, as it's called
here. However, that application and policy in its whole will require
general assembly approval before it is submitted to the federal
government. So what will happen, I would actually anticipate that we
will see somewhere in that time period a special session called for us
to be able to deal with this issue, particularly, in able to acquire
passage of both houses.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, another question, Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I want to go back to the CDSAs because I did not ask
that question about closing the four. Where will those services be
provided when those CDSAs close, if you're gonna close four. Where,
where would services be provided. And, and will we sell loss of services
to some of the children served under CDSAs?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms. Thomas.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson, we don't believe that services would
necessarily be lost, because given the high amount of lapsed salaries,
those services aren't being provided right now. So, but I think that's
why the chairs did want to give the department a year to come up with a
plan and determine those four so that it would minimize any impact on
service loss.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Other questions? Senator McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Two quick ones. I noticed that in the special
provisions, page 149, it says we're gonna eliminate a comprehensive
report on medication related errors in nursing homes. It seems like we
would want to know all about these medicated related errors in nursing
homes. If we could find out, why are we eliminating this special report?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick instead i'll verify this. My
understanding is that the federal funds that provided for that report
and brought it out have expired. And that therefore, barring coming up
with some significant additional funding, the continual federal program,
the program ends because the funding is expired.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The funding expired. I see. And quick follow-up. How
much money did we have for that? Anybody? Maybe the staff might know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe Debra Landry might have the answer to that,
Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The previous funding was funded at $850,000 for that
report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Thank you. And a quick follow-up, if I could? It
seems like something that would be good to know. I don't know how long
that had been ongoing or what type of quality information we received
from it. I just ask you chairs to give that some thought. I know we,
it's always tight. I noticed on the partnership for children we're
increasing their percentages again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Give us a reference please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] On page 133. And the thing I wanted to make an inquiry
of the chairs about, I know we increased their percentages last year, in
terms of their local contributions they needed to come up with, is there
a goal of ??</p>
