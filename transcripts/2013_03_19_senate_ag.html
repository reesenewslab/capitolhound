...We'll get started here. I'd like to recognize our Sargent of Arms. We
have: Charles Harper. Charles, where you at? There you are, ok. And
we've got Leslie Wright. And we've got Ernie Sherrill with his mouth
full. Glad to have y'all with us and our pages this morning is: Addison
Starnes from Morgantan, Senator Daniel, glad to have you with us,
Addison; Anisa Zach from Fuqua-Varina, Senator Rucho, glad to have you
with us also. Thank you. At this time we only have one bill before us.
Senator Walters would you like to come and present please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. The Senate Bill 205 is a very simple bill. It is
an act to eliminate unnecessary soil testing requirements in the animal
waste management plans and basically what it does is it strikes out at
least the word annually and once every three years. I would be glad to
ask..answer any questions, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Senator Cook.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I move for a favorable report on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, hold that just this moment. Senator Bryant. Yes ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have questions. I was just able to get some information about this
article. Is this testing at any cost to the farmer?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Walters.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At this point in time we are assessing it annually and what it would
need to take it out and do it on a three year time frame. And what we
found out ??? and the Department of Agriculture they recommended this ok
as we move forward in global positioning in farming, new techniques in
farming, we have a back log as you heard this committee sometimes as
much as 6 to 9 weeks for soil sampling so this preemptive on the part of
the Department of Agriculture ???
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up. I was just wanting to clarify whether it was any costs
involved? Is it cost involved to the state? To the agriculture
operation? How is this paid? How is this testing paid for?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead, Senator Walters.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant, what this would do is actually eliminate some costs to
the farmers. The Department of Agriculture has...I can let the staff
address that. This soil testing is provided by the Department of
Agriculture. It would eliminate some costs to farmers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ok. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is anyone from the environmental groups here to comment on this, and
have you worked with them on this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead, Senator Walters. And I will ask: is there anyone in the
audience who would like to speak? If you would, let us know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird, I vetted this with the Department of Agriculture and
the Department of ??? I haven't heard from anybody from the
environmental community.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK. Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr. Chair, if there is somebody here I would like them to talk,
comment on this. Would be willing to comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Anyone here who wants to speak on that? If not, Senator Austin. Allran.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir, this bill sounds good, it sounds good to me. My question
is: it was one year so now we are switching it to three. I would just
like to know the scientific background of this to make sure that we're
safe. You don't just pull these out of the air, I don't think, so it
used to be one and now it is three. How do we arrive at what makes
things safe? Scientifically.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Walters.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have some emails, Senator Allran, from folks at ??? in the state. Once
the Ph levels high, these animal wastes spray fields. It's not gonna
change. And I'd be glad to share that with anyone with the committee
that would like to read those.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm from a small town...not...from a small city, not from an agriculture
background so I don't really understand all that. I just want somebody
to give some type of assurance that going from one year to three years
is scientifically safe. If that's what the Department of Agriculture
says I'll accept that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Walters, can I jump in here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Allran, typically, in past history, everybody soil samples once
every three years. Due to the livestock waste they changed it from one
year many years back, but now they've realized that once every three
years is sufficient to have this done. Senator Bryant.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on ...</p>

<p id="05:00">
With Senator Allran.  Just because of the area that I represent, and
I've talked to some of the, like from the Tar River, the Tar-Penlico
River keeper, just before this meeting, and they had just found out
about this.  And we're trying to them, if sales to determine if 1 year
to 3 years is going to make a big difference.  The concern is going to 1
year, because of the phosphorous levels, I think, and some of the levels
that have been found in our soils, and I'm just concerned, and like
Senator Allran, I'm happy to support it, if we can get some sense that
there's zinc and copper won't damage going to our streams in 3 years, if
for some reason it was higher.  If we don't catch it in 3 years, if it
got high in 1 and a half years, and we don't catch it till 1 and a half
years later.  as long as somebody can say who does this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Let me inject this.  And I'm going to sort of turn this
back around on Senator Allran and Senator Bryant.  What kind of
information would you want, and who would you want to present?  We've
got Deaner, that says we don't have a problem with this, and we have the
Department of Ags who?  Whom do we need to hear from?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I'm sorry, I didn't know it.  Did Deaner and the
Department of Ag, maybe some of them, somebody out in the audience can
answer the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]We have Joy Hicks, from the Department of Ag.  Joy,
would you like to take a stab at this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Hi, I'm Joy Hicks from Legislative Liaison for the
Department of Agriculture.  We did work with both our soil and water
division, and our agronomist in our agronomic's division, and posed this
question to them about how  would it affect not just our soil testing
lab and the numbers coming in there, which the question was asked
earlier, How do you pay for it?  We pay for it.  Soil samples are not
charged, but lime tax and fertilizer tax in your general fund goes to
that.  But jumping back, we do have Pat Harris here, from our soil and
water division, who was there whenever the bill was negotiated that
required this 1 year soil sample to take place.  Even at that point in
time, we tried to negotiate a different rate.  Now granted, soil and
water was Ed Deaner at that time, but everybody we talked to from our
agronomists, who a lot of them are soil scientists, to our soil and
water division have said that this is not necessary.  It doesn't change
that much every year, from year to year, and so we'd be happy to have,
you might want to hear from our division director, Ms. Harris, but we've
submitted information from our agronomists to Senator Walters.  Again,
the agronomists are the guys who go out, and they work with farmers to
look at what the full situation is, to figure out what additives need to
happen.  If they have a crop issue, they go out and try to help them
determine what's going on.  So, our folks really care about the soil,
and they really care about the land, so they would not make a
recommendation to Senator Walters that they didn't fully believe.  And
so with that, Mr. Chairman, that is the overall answer, but you may want
to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Okay, that's fine, Joy.  Thank you very much.  Senator
Wade.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Senator Walters, would it be
safe to say that since it's been in place, and they've been testing
every year, that the agriculture department now believes it's not
necessary because they've been looking at the soil samples, so they
should know whether it's necessary or not.  and my other question would
be, is there a safe guard in place, like a complaint driven issue, if
you think there might be a problem, there's still that site safeguard in
place, right?  Where someone can phone in.  I mean, you might just
mention that, and that would probably take care of our discussion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Walters?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Senator Wade.  I think that is correct.  You
know the historical data shows that it's not necessary to soil sample
annually, and there are some safeguards in place.  If there is a
complaint, we'd be able to address that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator, 1 second.  I've just been informed by staff
that Deaner was told about this bill many times, and had been requested
to be here.  Apparently they have no issue with it, or they would be
here.  Senator Kinnaird?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.  As I recall in this issue, the problem, and
I'd like to further find out about whether it does affect steams and
ground water, as I understand it, the build up of zinc and copper leads
to sterile soils, that you just simply can't grow anything on it.  So it
would be more of a soil than a water issue.  But that, I'd like
clarification on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Walter, do you want to</p>

<p id="10:00">
Senator Kinnaird, I think we're losing our focus here. Farmers who own
these farms and these spray fields have a vested financial obligation to
make sure they take care of their property and their joint properties,
and there's been historical data with the, with agriculture department
as well as DENR that no one has a problem with taking this one or three
years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. There's no other questions at this time, we have a favorable
report from Senator Cook. All those in favor, let me know by saying aye.
All opposed light the sign. The ayes have it. This meeting is adjourned.
Thank you.</p>
