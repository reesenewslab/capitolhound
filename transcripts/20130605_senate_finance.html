I would like to welcome everyone to the Finance Committee today. Our
Serjeant-at-Arms staff, thank you for the good job that you do. Ernie
Shell, Canton Lewis, Donna Blake, Steve McClug, and Ed Kestler – Ed’s
the big guy. Pages today are Lily Kenny from Reidsville (Senator
Berger); Holly Webb, Summerfield (Senator Berger). Welcome. Amelia
Mangun, Granite Falls (Senator Soucek); Mary Katherine Starns, Hickory
(Senator Suchack); Max Toney, Reidsville (Senator Berger); Kevin
Treachey, Oxford (Senator McKissick); and Will Finch from Reidsville
(Senator Berger). Senator Berger must have a lot of filing he wants done
this week.
OK. Welcome. I hope you learn a lot. It’s a shame that you could not be
in House Committee this morning, you could have seen the legislative
process at work.
We’re going to … we have rather a large schedule today. We’ll try to get
through it quickly and painlessly. We’re going to dance around a little
bit to get the easy ones out of the way in a hurry, and then hold any
that might be controversial ?? take ?? time toward the end. We’ll ask
for public comment when the property time comes. I’ll explain the ground
rules when we get to that point.
We have an addition today which is House Bill 439. Does everyone have a
copy of that, please? Do the members have copies of the package that has
been passed out? It has not. So while we hear the first bill, the
Sargent-at-Arms will be passing that one out.
We’re going to start with House Bill 200, require certain general
reappraisals – Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
And this is an original, this is not a PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
That is correct. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I’m joined with Jeff Tarte, who is not Trish Cotham. House Bill 200…
[crosstalk]
[laughter].
This has been an odd-enough day already.
[laughter]
Senator Tarte and I worked together with the Mecklenburg County Board of
Commissioners to fix the re-evaluation problem in Mecklenburg County. We
introduced companion bills in both the House and the Senate. You very
expeditiously moved the Senate Bill over to the House.
We continued to talk with Mecklenburg County and they brought some
changes which were incorporated in the House version and moved forward
there. We had been told that if both of us…if we crossed our bills over,
we might have a bill that was useful for another reason. I’m not sure
why anybody would tell us that.
But as we have discussed the issues, we have changes that we want to
make to the Machinery Act or create a study to do so. Senator Tarte and
I discussed which bill to run. In deference, we would have run the
Senate bill first after making the changes in the House, but he agreed
it would be more expeditious to PCS his bill in the House for our other
uses and go ahead and run the House bill.
[crosstalk].
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
What in the world are we talking about here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Well, we’re going to get…
[crosstalk]
…bring in the House bill after you passed the Senate bill and it’s not
an insult because we have done that to you before, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Well, we’re used to it in the Assembly. May I, Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
You may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Thank you. Is it virtually the same bill we passed out of here before?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
That being said, they’re dressed alike. I would like to move for
favorable report.
[laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Thank you. Thank you.
Which one of you men were born first. Which of the twins?
[laughter]
We have a motion before us. Is there any discussion or debate on the
motion? If not, we will vote on the motion from Senator Apodaca to
accept House Bill 100.
All those in favor please say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Oppose, no.
Motion carried. Thank you.
Representative Brawley, don’t go anywhere, please. You have House Bill
817 and House Bill 817 is a PCS.
Do I have a motion, please, to subrep the PCS from Senator Brunstetter?
All in favor, please say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Motion carried.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Senator Harrington joined me by carrying the whole weight today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
It’s up for you and Senator Harrington, but you may start.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
OK</p>

<p id="05:00">
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
This bill is the one that passed out of the House, it's already been
through Senate transportation. There are a couple of minor changes of a
technical nature, and I don't have the marked copy, but essentially this
is the Governor's transportation modification plan. It currently breaks
the state funding down into three categories, statewide, regional, and
division. Statewide is the interstate highways, the larger routes, it is
100% data driven decision making, and it will encompass the high end of
the projects. Regional, which would also be 30% of the finance, or the
expenditures, would be broken down 70% data, 30% local input, divisional
funding would be 50% data 50% local input.
The reason behind this are 2 unfortunate realities we're facing in North
Carolina: The first is our current sources of funding for transportation
are declining, so over the next 10 years our shortfall of the previous
10 will be $ 1.7 billion in funding. During the same time period, we
will have 1.3 additional people living in North Carolina. With declining
revenues and increasing needs, the only thing we can do to respond is be
more efficient and effective in the use of the funds. The current
operational plan that we use dates from 1989, and the technology both
for measuring the efficacy of road construction has improved
significantly since that time, it was a great plan in 1989, it's a
little dated now, so the Governor's and other transportation folks have
come forward with this. It came out of the House with 102 votes in
favor, strong bipartisan support. I'd like to take any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Sen. Cook.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can you tell my how this bill will effect the east? Will we have more or
less money for our roads?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What you will have is money for the roads that evaluate well, and
Senator, a politically powerful person like yourself who would probably
be able to dominate more than his fair share would not be able to do so,
but you'd get your fair share.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I may,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
as I understand is this going to hurt the east and my folks are not real
happy with this. I wonder if you could give me some?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I can give you a lot. First of all, everybody assumes it's going to hurt
them. So that I haven't had anybody say that we're going to get more,
but the second thing is the actual criteria, the final criteria that'll
be used for allocating the money, is still being designed, it will come
back to the joint transportation oversight committee in August for a
first report, again in October, and again the following year. So we will
approve the allocation formulas. There is a shift away from everything
local as in the past, the funding's going more to a state level. For
example, in the area of the east, one of the examples of a statewide
project which would not currently be well funded is the idea of a major
highway in the northeast that would feed into Hampton roads, for
example.
Okay, let me defer to the Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Harrington?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? before the Senate I say that this is virtually identical to what is
already in the Senate version of the budget which passed a week and a
half or so ago.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. And Sen. Cook, we have the numbers division if you would like
to see those, we can certainly make them available to you and all
members of the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can you tell me what hap- Sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
I was talking to some folk who express some concern that alternatives
such as passenger rail would not- and transit, and local transit
services would not be allowed to compete at the state level. The sort of
sort of successful experiment is Raleigh to Charlotte train, the
passenger train which is clearly statewide. Would funding for that be
limited to at the division</p>

<p id="10:00">
Because youd cross through 4 or 5 divisions. Freight rail on which most
of the inner city passenger trail also does go at a state level and was
completely evaluated. Passenger rail was not seen as light rail and
passenger rail service was seen like something like the red route for
mcnberg to ?? county or the durham research triangle raleigh connector
that has been at the division level and the sentate version and the
statewide proejct for inner city passenger rail such as the amtrakc
would be dual use and would carry freight. Those tracks would be
eligible for state funding.
I forgot what we named them... the carolinian and the piedmont.. that
service would still compete at the state wide level.
YEs sir
But primarily the underlying infrastructure would compete at the freight
component . Rather than the passenger aspec tof it. You cant take the
freight out of it when you are evaluating it because that whole track
what you put on the track is easy but the track is the hard part and
thats where the funding is.
Youre saying if you creatively contortionist you couldmake it fit so
that you could find passenger service from raleigh to charlotte. THank
you.
Thats my opinion.
Senator
Folloow up on that question. And maybe its for senator harringotn. I
dont know why we would take public transit out of a regiion
consideration or statewide for the same matter as senator did. We want
public transit from out of a regiional ocnsideration. We want communter
rail for goldsboro to raleigh, durham to chapel hill, we want expansion
out of ??? why would we rule out at least the possibility for fudning to
expand this rail.
WEll at the moment it would qualify on the division level. WE had talked
about it on the regional level. I am of the opinion that the locals in
that division would have a better understanding of what is needed.
Follow up
Would that be somethign we could have a follow up conversation with? I
agree most public transit take place on a division level but this goes
across several divisions.And to preclude it from consideration when..
its a numerical driven process supposedily.. and through the analysis
comes out on top at a regional level why we would preclude it from
regional consideration doesnot make sense to me.
Senator ???
And I guess my concerns are about some of the things you talked about in
term of mass transit. Mass transit trying to make certain when these
projects come about they need the ability to compete at the regional and
statewide level becuase they deserve to have more than one opporrunity
for a hearing and a weighing of the facts and variables that impact
their ability to be funded. It sounds like the hosue is treating it one
way and the senate differently, this is the bill we are moving forward
with at this time. How is it embodied here and is there a consensus
between you and senator ?? in dept about what it is we are doing in
relation to that issue. For the major urban areas the way it is set up
now is they are getting massive money, salem durham county, or for
repairs or for etc. etc. all those funds are being considered and
subtracted out...</p>

<p id="15:00">
And those are things that are impacting the entire  state, not just our
district or even our region. A rock slide 200 miles away or an accident
150 miles away blocking traffic but if these types of projects are
making things are state wide in character are being subtracted out and
attributed to the funding we get on a district wise basis. It's not
really quite fair and can shortchange many of the urbanries in the
state, the triangle, the ??, charlotte metro area, so if you could
address those two issues.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, the idea of state wide projects, it's not just the size of the
road but it's whole connectivity issue that is involved. One of the
examples that i I use is 73 which have a few sections that are really
great and a few sections that aren't and if you ask I85 on the I73 south
to head for Asheboro, your drive about 5 miles and you get to the county
line and you are on a two lane country road. A state wide project would
need to address the whole connectivity issue because a great road for a
little while in a major city which does not connect to the rural areas
around doesn't open up areas.
Two specific examples are ?? county of Mecklenburg, we have highway 74
which is a signalized four lane that goes to Union in Anson county and
then we have Highway 24 which is a signalized four lane which to Stanley
county. These are the heading two counties that have a very high rate of
unemployment. They need jobs and they are losing population because
people are moving away. The distances are such that with a good road
heading east for Union in Anson county, people in Wadesboro could work
at Charlotte area and go home at night. That whole road and connectivity
would benefit both the metropolitan area and the rural area through
which it connects. If that road continues all the way to Wilmington it
becomes a major cord and there are sections of Highway 74 which that are
of inter state quality and sections of highway 74 of quality difficult
to use for describing the condition of the road. That road being good
for me is the is the kind of thing that state wide projects are desired
to do, not to suck money out of urban areas but to connect urban and
rural areas into a network.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Quick follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me. We got to move on, Senator Cook. One more time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I may, thanks to your vast and extensive knowledge of all the
highways and byways in this lovely state. I was wondering if you could
shed some light on one road for me. Route 12, do you have any idea how
this bill will affect that road, that's the road ?? that runs the length
of the outer banks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I don't know Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's an in-sea route and it would follow the criteria for all of our
in-sea routes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I think we have got to this in the budget, we
have done the transportation part so I'd like to go ahead and move for a
favorable report on the PCS, unfavorable the original bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Sir.
Senator Apdaco. Did we have anyone signed up to speak on this? If not we
have the motion before us unfavorable to original, favorable to the PCS.
All in favor say Aye, opposed No. Motion carried, Thank you.
Representative Brawley, you have the ?? of the afternoon at all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are welcome. Next we have house bill 248, Taxpayer debt. Thank you
ma'am if you could come forward please and this is an original bill and
I believe there is an amendment.
Welcome, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. This bill, Taxpayer Debt Information Act has one purpose and
that to provide more transparent ?? for the citizens regarding bond
referendum. I for one does stay call the meeting of all the groups that
are interested before we drafted this bill that would include
representative of the Treasury department, Bond counselors from the
treasury department, county finance directors, the municipality and the
county commissioner organization, they are all in support of the bill.

[speaker changes]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and committee. This bill, I think, most of you
heard in the Senate Commerce.  Tillman - ought to refer to Senator
Tillman. He did such a great job forming. This bill will allow more
expansion of cell service and mobile service in rural and both urban
areas. It's a good bill and I'll answer any questions. Everybody's got

Representative Howard--
[speaker changes]
Thank you
[speaker changes]
You have control over the senate.
[speaker changes]
Mr. Chairman. Let me catch my breath an we'll be ready to go here.  This
is the bill that we knew that we would need that's a follow up bill from
the UI bill that we passed early House Bill 4, early in the session. And
we knew that there were gonna be some tweaks that we needed to make and
basically, that's what this bill does. One of the things that we learned
that we needed to change the effective date from July 1 to June 30 and
that was one of the most important things that's in this bill. But,
there's about twelve items and I will tell you they are sorely
technical. Nothing of any policy change.
[speaker changes]
We have a motion from Senator Apodaca for favorable report. PCS
unfavorable to the original. Is there any discussion or debate? Hearing
none, all those in favor of the motion please say aye. Opposed no. The
motion carried. Thank you . One more. House Bill 439 Economic
Development Job Sites Program. Representative Howard.
[speaker changes]
Thank you. Thank you again Mr. Chairman and this is truly a jobs bill.
This was brought to us from the economic developers across the state and
what it does is it just changed the way we are taxing. We have a
deferred tax that represents a lien on the property but folks can bank
contiguous acreage and allow certain development within that acreage
which would be water, sewer, all of the environmental impacts, gas and
all of the improvements. They would not be taxed for those improvements
until a later date. It's an excellent--</p>

Rabin? [SPEAKER CHANGES] In putting together a bill, some of the

together. I just ask for your concurrence on the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Chairman Rabin. Would Senator Rabin - would Colonel Rabin -
yield for a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I've got a couple. Looking at the list here, Colonel, we covered your
awards, I guess a while back when you were in the military, but I'm
trying to figure out which of these tags you don't qualify for.
[LAUGHTER] And how many cars do you own? [SPEAKER CHANGES] If I had
enough cars... [SPEAKER CHANGES] I found one, Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] retired Senator. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He doesn't qualify for the
US Navy submarine veteran. Senator Brunstetter. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I can't afford enough cars on the salary I'm
making for all of the stuff I'd need to put on it. So, it doesn't
matter. But it is a good amendment. The way I look at it and the real
reason behind forwarding the bill originally was that I couldn't see
having folks pay that have already paid the price for the license plate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. Senator Brunstetter. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chairman, just some clarification. These are all existing tags that were
inadvertently left out of the bill? Is that what I understand? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] No, sir. If we'll have staff clarify this, please. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Heather. [SPEAKER CHANGES] These are all existing plates. As
you know, each special plate has a $10 unless it's excepted from the $10
fee. So, this excepts the military plates from the $10 fee. So, it
doesn't create any new plates. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright. Follow-up,
please? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there going to
be then a fiscal impact to the state because this is a very large
universe of people, particularly when you start saying military
veterans. Is there going to be a fiscal impact to the state? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I believe there will be. I don't know if we have that number. I
will clarify that they will pay the $28 for the tag. This eliminates the
$10 fee for the special plate. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, I'm just
going to say that, from an appropriations standpoint, I would need to
see a fiscal note on this before we let it go on the floor. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Okay. Then, would you like to. Do you have a fiscal note?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I've got one here that zeroes it out. Fiscal note,
senate bill 571. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, I believe that's
Senator Brock's fiscal note. It does not apply to your amendment. Could
we ask please that you hold that amendment until we've got a fiscal note
and we can possibly handle this on the floor if it does not have an
impact on the budget? Would that be okay? Okay. Then, the amendment is
withdrawn. We're back to the original. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. The only thing I would say, Senator Goolsby, that the only
plate that Colonel Rabin doesn't qualify for actually doesn't get a free
pass on is the Battle of King's Mountain, which you'd still have to pay
for that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He was there. He was there. He was there.</p>

Thank  you Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. This is a local
bill that creates a referendum on incorporating a town around the lake
in my district, Lake James. What the PCS does, primarily it removes a
section of the original incorporation boundary from which there was  I
guess a lack of support for incorporation, so the bulk of the support in
my district would come from the remaining area. I'll be glad to answer
any questions from the committee, the referendum if it passes the House
and the Senate would be this November and the voters of the district
would decide whether the town would be incorporated.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, it's a local bill, and I'll certainly support it, but I've
heard it from everywhere from Knoxville, TN to Paris Island, SC on this
bill and I just wanted to ask our good Senator here from that area, what
in the world are they upset about, Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well first of all, Senator, I'd- Mr. Chairman?
I don't represent anyone from Knoxville, TN or South Carolina, well, and
I'd say that the opposition is based on a variety of differing opinions.
When this petition was originally circulated, 63 approximately percent
of the registered voters were certified from the area in favor of the
incorporation. Obviously there's been some influx in and out since the
petition was done, and that's in large part why we changed it from just
a straight incorporation which the legislature does most often to a
referendum on incorporation.
But I think there's folks here  that want to speak for or against it, so
I think you'll hear some of those arguments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, I believe we have two members that have signed up to speak
from the public, we will ask you to approach the podium in the back now,
turn on the mic, you'll have 2 minutes each to state your case and first
I believe is Mr. Jim Powers, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. Thank you Mr. Chairman, thank you committee. This is a bill
that started out initially 5 years ago,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can you get closer to your mic please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
in front of the joint legislative commission. The joint commission
determined that the boundaries were non-contiguous, and gave it a
negative recommendation. It failed in the Senate that year also, 2009,
and again in 2011 in the House. The problems with a referendum is just
like the problem with the initial vote. Of the 954 properties, only 270
have addresses within the village. So only 28% have a voice at all. 78%
don't have a voice in this at all. I would think a particular interest
to finance committee is the budget is 5 years old, prepared prior to a
property reevaluation, and all the changes that have gone in since that
time, the current bill as 312, doesn't really provide for any services
like the general statutes require. So, it's hard to tell what's going to
be provided there, but again only 28% of the folks there would have a
voice in the referendum. And- is that it?
My time is up apparently.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir.</p>

We’d appreciate it. Ms. Dorenda Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ll be quick. I’m Dorneda Pellstein. I’m a registered voter in the
proposed village. Yes I’m Dorenda Pellstein. I’m a member of the task
force for the formation of Lake James. Howard Morgan the chair of this
committee is unable to be here as he is serving on jury duty. My husband
and I have owned our property at the lake for 12 years and have been
permanent residents. Yes, Mr. Powers is correct. This is an area that
was first developed and property submitted for purchase a number of
years ago by Duke and Crescent. There are many pieces of property like
in many other areas that are still waiting to be developed. Why am I
here? I represent as Sen. Daniel said, a majority of the registered
voters who signed a legal petition. I also represent many other property
owners from North Carolina and other states. Why are we requesting
incorporation? We want services. Mr. Powers is incorrect. We have over
the past years, since 2007, requested from Burke County additional
police protection and EMS services. They are unable to provide these
services at this time and so we are incorporating and asking to
incorporate to do it. Our services are laid out and have been laid out
in accordance with what is required for incorporation. How can this
village benefit Burke County and the state of North Carolina? The
village will add over 230,000 more revenue for the economy of Burke
County. It far outweighs the 44,000 in sales tax that will be
reallocated to the village. Most of this area are people who are
retirees. They don’t have children in school. They don’t use Burke
County social services. This is a win, not only for Burke County. It is
an area that is part of Burke County’s development plan to be grown. It
provides construction. It provides jobs. It is also a win for the state
of North Carolina. My husband and I have defined benefit pension plans.
That is income tax every year that comes in. Are there additional
benefits? Yes. We’ll apply for grants. There are many special provisions
that are in this bill that I would draw your attention to that protect
people outside the village areas. No involuntary annexation, no eminent
domain and we also are not permitted to - prohibited from restricting
access to the lake. Increased taxation. It’s unique. It provides a cap
on taxation at 7.5% unless improved by a local bill. We want to control
our destiny. We want to make sure that government is limited to what is
necessary. It’s a bill tailored to the needs of our area not to the
creation of redundant government. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you ma’am. Sen. Newton.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, and if I could ask Sen. Daniel - I just want to
make sure as I understand it, this bill essentially just sets a
referendum for these folks that live in this area to decide whether or
not they’re going to have a city formed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You may answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Sen. Newton. The registered voters within the incorporation
boundary would vote presumably this November if it passes the House and
Senate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up please. Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In light of that, in light of the comments and what I’ve heard about
this, this sounds exactly consistent with the efforts of this
legislature has already made as it related to de-annexation reform. This
is a situation where we’re allowing the people who live there to make
the decision about whether or not they want to be part of the city, and
part of the services and so forth. It’s a local bill and so therefore
I’d move for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. In just a second. I think Sen. Tennessee Tillman moved
for that earlier on - I’m not sure, but, Sen. Tarte -
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No I didn’t move for that I said I was in favor of it, mainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir - then Sen. Tarte.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess my only question would be, normally you would say the voters are
the property owners but are we a little bit of an anomaly here by that
because three quarters of the property owners are not voters and how do
we address the property owners having a say?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Daniel can address that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Tarte frankly I think that the number that the gentleman expressed
is now significantly reduced based on the property area that we’ve taken
out in the PCS. I don’t know what that number would be, but obviously
our state Supreme Court has ruled that you vote where you live, so these
people that live there have determined that this is the place that they
want to lay their head every night, and I think it’s important to them
to be able to determine the future of their own community. That’s why
it’s a referendum.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was curious as to why there were</p>

Certain limitations being put on the ability of this community if they
would had vote in favor of annexation to exercise powers that would
normally be traditional. For example, there would, there would be a
prohibition if, on anybody I guess over McDowell County coming forth
with a voluntary annexation or for that matter involuntary one. They
could never put up for a vote whether there'd be malt beverages or
fortified wines, and there would be a prohibition on extraterritorial
jurisdiction. Was there some reason for wanting to limit those powers in
the event they do decide to establish this incorporated municipality? I
would think they might want the powers to do what any other city can do
within the limits of our, of our state typically. I don't have a problem
with the bill, but it seems to me probably that perhaps they should have
some of those things, rights and privileges that other towns would have.
So I was wondering why, why these carve outs were present.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Chairman, I think Senator McKissick essentially, over the course
of, of developing the bill, we just tried to address some concerns that
various people had about what a proposed town might, might be able to do
or not do, so that's why we put some of those provisions in.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. Okay members, we have a motion from Senator Newton
unfavorable to the original favorable, to the proposed committee
substitute. All those in favor of the motion please say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed, no. Motion carries. Thank you staff, sergeants in arm, and
pages for today. Meeting adjourned.</p>
