Good morning. Good morning. If our members will please take their seats
and we can have order. We have a long agenda and we have a guest with us
that’s on a tight time frame so we’d like to get started.
Representative Setzer, sir you are recognized for approval of the
minutes from the July 24th meeting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So moved.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members will please take their seats and we can start. We have a motion
for approval of the minutes for our July 24. All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed say no. I believe that’s unanimous. This morning we’re going
to alternate a little bit on the agenda. House Bill 1224, Local Sales
Tax Options and Economic Development Changes will be the first bill on
the calendar. Members of the Finance Committee, this is a conference
report and again this is for the purpose of discussion with this
committee. At the end of the discussion there will be a motion to concur
or not to concur that will go to the floor of the House later this
afternoon. We have the privilege of having the Department of Commerce
Secretary, Madam Sharon Decker. Ms. Decker if you would like to come
forward and be available as we start the process. Go ahead with the bill
first. Somebody want to go over the bill first? Sandy? Ms. Decker, you
can take a chair if you’d like to. We’re going to ask staff to go
through the provisions of the bill first and we’ll have Ms. Decker up.
Trina Griffin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
When this bill left the House, it had the only provisions in it were
some economic development provisions related to jmac and the Senate
added some sections to it. In particular, part one of the bill creates
some local sales tax options. It’s helpful, if you want to...in your
packet, behind your summary, there is a chart that sets out the current
rates and what the options would be under this bill that’s sort of
helpful. I’ll just give a brief overview. Under current law there are 94
counties that can levy a total local sales tax of up to 2.5%. There are
six counties that have the ability to 2.75%. Two of those six counties,
Durham and Orange, are currently levying that rate. What this bill does
is cap the overall rate at 2.5% and grandfather’s Durham and Orange
because they’re already at 2.75%. The other thing it does in addition to
this cap is create some flexibility for the counties to use to levy this
half cent. All counties currently levy at least 2% and with that
additional half percent, this bill creates a new tax that can be used
only for education. It makes some modifications to the tax that
currently exists for public transportation and then it makes some
changes to the article that is currently at a quarter cent that may be
used for general purposed. Under all three of these, a county would have
the ability to levy the tax in quarter cent increments up to half
percent, and that of course depends on want their current rate is. There
will always be the overall cap at 2.5%, but counties could mix and match
those options, again, up to the cap. The new tax for education, as you
can see on your summary, it can be used for school construction, for
salaries for classroom teachers or teacher assistants as well as teacher
supplements and it can also be used for community colleges. That’s the
overall gist of the tax piece and I’m happy to answer any questions or
go over the options on the chart if there are any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee, are there any questions on part one?
Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair. My question, Miss Griffin, would be then...</p>

And it came back zero, and I would like somebody from Fiscal to explain
how something that’s supposed to cost 12 million dollars has a fiscal
note of zero. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aubrey. Yes ma’am, please. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] My name’s Aubrey Incorvaia with the Fiscal Research Division.
This PCS increases the liability cap for JMAC awards; it does not
require the Commerce, the Department of Commerce to actually use that
authority. That’s why officially it is zero, but if they act upon that
authority, it will use 12 million dollars, which I understand is their
intent, to provide to a particular company over the course of the next
six years at 2 million dollars per year. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, sir, do you have a follow-up? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I just… This may be the least objectionable part of the whole bill,
but that will be 12 million less we have to spend on other stuff. Just
so as long as people realize that that money won’t be there in future
years. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I remind the committee that the Secretary of
Commerce is at your disposal if you have questions for Madam Secretary.
Representative Hager. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chairman. Just
for a comment. This piece has passed the House and passed the Senate, if
you remember, very soundly, and it is for one of our areas, more poor
areas of the state in western North Carolina, and I’d just like to
comment, this is a piece of the… We placed this amendment back into
technical corrections. This is a piece that I believe Senator Rucho
removed out of technical corrections, so this is what we do see here,
and it would be nice to have it, and we may see it later on in other
bills. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee, are there other
questions? Representative Luebke. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes ma’am. Madam
Chair, thank you. I’m wondering whether… is the job catalyst fund in
this bill directed to just – [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke,
that’s part 3. That’s the next part we will be addressing, so… [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. Members of the committee,
questions on section 2, the LJMAC modifications? Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Evidently I came from further out in the country or
something. I still don’t understand; how do you authorize spending an
additional 12 million dollars and not spend it and say there’s no fiscal
note? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aubrey, you want to tackle that one? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] So a little background – Aubrey Incorvaia from the Fiscal
Research Division. The original JMAC authority is for 67 million
dollars. Or is it 69 down? I’m sorry. 69. What Commerce did is they made
promises for 67 million dollars for Domtar, Firestone and Goodyear.
Those are to be paid out in future years, so there is 2 million dollars
available capacity in the existing authority of JMAD statutes. This
increases it by 10 million, leaving 1 million that could potentially go
out to a new company, and that is the intent that Commerce has, it to
use that total of 12 million capacity over the next six years. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Brawley, follow-up, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If I
understood what you said, we’ve already spent or committed 2 million and
will be spending the 10 million. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No sir, I don’t
believe that’s what she said. You want to repeat that Aubrey? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] We have 2 million dollars worth of capacity that is not yet
committed, and we will commit it along with the additional 10 million
that this statute or that this modification would allow. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Which gives us a new capacity of 12 million dollars. Is that
correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes ma’am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
Representative Brawley? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a comment. Our
Constitution requires a balanced budget, and generally, if you go back
and check history, that is meant when we make a commitment to spend
money, we make provisions for it in the current budget where we also
make the commitment to spend the money, and it sounds to me like we’re
violating that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, I have a question. If I’m reading the bill analysis right
and the bill analysis is accurate, it looks like to me we’re taking JMAC
from a grant – we’re expanding it from a grant program, I thought – and
again, I’m not real up on all these grant programs – to increase
employment to something which now you can get also for cleaning up your
plant. So it doesn’t seem to me to be entirely related to employment
necessarily. It looks to me like we’re expanding the purposes for which
we’re going to give money away. Is that… am I reading that correctly?</p>

<p id="020:00">
I have about four questions, can I do them one at a time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] First one is...and this would be to the secretary, I
guess. We debated a business facility development program in government
about a month ago and a real objection to the fact in tier three areas
were included like Lake County, Mecklenburg.  All the sponsors are from
Lake and Mecklenburg. Why are we doing this for tier three areas?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Secretary, would you like to...?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll save us time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll save us time. Representative Stam, we're doing it
for all three areas because we don't think we should exclude them for
the opportunity for growth. This fund is specifically targeted towards
large manufacturing, heavy capital investment as well as large numbers
of employment and it would not seem appropriate to me to exclude an area
in the state for that potential. Now the numbers are higher and the
investment requirement greater. The way this is established, which I
think is appropriate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Second question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And my questions are short. So for example, tier three
has got to be 1200 full time workers. I assume most of the money is
going to tier three because that's where most of this money usually goes
anyway. What would be wrong with two different companies doing 600 full
time workers and investing ten million each. What's about one company
that's twice as big and two companies?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think the objective here where we are finding that
we are not competitive is in large capital intensive, large numbers of
employee projects. We have tools that allow us to be very competitive
with most projects but where we are missing the boat and where we are
not competitive are with the larger projects. I would suggest that this
money will not go as a necessarily go as a priority to tier three
because a lot of the large manufacturing via in aviation. We're seeing
our legacy industries in textiles and furniture. Resurgents again. When
we look at automotive, there is the opportunity to attract some of these
into tier two and perhaps even tier one counties.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Third question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And I only have three.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're good.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. On the bottom of page 12 is this recapture
prevision?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And I think about Dill and we didn't recapture
everything. Even though they took off. And the reason they didn't is
because we didn’t have no security. I offered an amendment and I'm
wondering if you'd be amenable to this if we go to conference that all
of this money we're giving these companies be secured by a deed of trust
even though it might be the third or fourth or fifth deed of trust. So
that when the company goes in bankruptcy, we are not an unsecured
creditor fighting with the bankruptcy trustee but we have some priority.
 Would you be amenable to some kind of real claw back that's actually
enforceable?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm open to that conversation for sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam, I believe our staff can lend a
little bit of help with this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright, I guess I'll just add that there's a slight
difference with the original bill ??, excuse me, with the Dill
incentives because the Dill incentives ?? had provisions that
specifically disallowed certain claw backs and this would be a
positive...the current provision is a positive requirement for the
recapture of those funds from the new job catalyst fund.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a follow up on that. I'm not debating whether the
claw back is required. I'm questioning whether there's any security for
the claw back. I mostly real estate finance. If don't have security, you
got nothing and I’m just asking to consider whether you'd be willing to
have something to go back on if you ever have to do it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative committee on section 3. Representative
Brawley...Bill Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Just a quick question, not to be used for
semi-professional sports teams or clubs. How about fully professional
sports teams or clubs?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think the intention is that it's not for sports. The
intent of this fund is specifically large capital investment, large
employment manufacturing that has significant multipliers. We've had the
opportunity to actually catch the totals and join us and some that did.
North Carolina's had a real challenge in getting...moving quickly and
getting answers around major projects and so part of the drive here is
to get a framework...</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES].
just a quick comment real quick I think that part of the theirs a few
things that bother me about this is that were allowing the money to flow
to areas that already have very good job economic expansion such as tier
3 areas as you know you and I come from the same county you know the
devastation that we've seen in the eastern part and western part of the
state so that would be one thing that I would like to see changed in
this to go conference to see changes to the tier 3 areas taken out of it

Representative Hamilton ma'am
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
thank you madam chairman this is an incentives bill correct okay just
making sure we were all speaking the same language here thank you.  Two
years ago and I know you weren't here madam secretary but two years ago
we tried this very same thing to recruit Continetal Tire to Brunswick
county and we were told very plainly by House and Senate leadership that
we weren't in the business of doing this kind of job catalyst fund this
very similar program was announced don't want to get into those details
but my question to you is is philosophically  has this administration
and the leadership in the house and senate changed their position on
incentive programs?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
madam secretary
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I would like to speak directly to that and say that were about job
growth and job development and in my short tenure I've seen very clearly
that there is the need for investment tools is how I like to look at
them where we get return which is in job growth and development there's
been great progress made in tax reform and I am very grateful to this
body for making that happen and that's been a really positive tool there
need for some additional tools to support job growth and we've tried to
be very careful and I appreciate the Senate's leadership in getting this
to the table that very specific goals and the jobs plan is you will see
which this administration produced with the leadership of a lot of
business folks from around the state included a provision for a number
of tools to help generate job growth this is one of them
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
follow up
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Hamilton
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
you mentioned earlier in section 3 of the bill and I don't want to get
into specifics of that but just to repeat language that you used the
JMac portion is a retention tool so my question is if were picking
winners and losers there are existing credits on the books today like
historic preservation and other credits that have contributed a
tremendous amount to the states economy why are we abandoning those
existing tools and creating new programs for jobs that don't exist yet?
I'm concerned about retention of the thousands of jobs in this state
that are going to be adversely affected by the elimination of certain
tax credits while were creating incentive programs for jobs that don't
exist in North Carolina yet
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Hamilton if you would allow the chair we'd like to stay
on this bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
thank you very much yes ma'am
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Holley
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
thank you madam chair I just have a quick question and my question is
about the job creation piece I get a little concerned when we say were
going to create 500  jobs and were going into some of these tier
counties that need jobs and that they bring jobs with them but they also
bring the employees for the job excuse me I cant hear myself talking
thank you gentlemen. Gentlemen and ladies. Ladies and gentlemen please I
cant hear myself talking
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
members of the committee there is a lot of chatter coming back feeding
back this way so Representative Holley you have the floor ma'am
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
thank you I'm going to repeat what I was saying my concern is is that a
lot of times we're identifying these jobs and then half these jobs are
brought into the community and not coming from the existing community is
there any stipulation in the rules and regulations of this job creation?</p>

<p id="035:00">
That so many of these jobs must come, like if you got 500 jobs how many
of these jobs must come from the immediate area? And are there
stipulations that you must run the gamut from the lowest paying to the
high and just not the little worker bees? [speaker changes] Yes ma’am.
[speaker changes] There are no stipulations in this bill, to specify
that I think that would be very difficult to get companies to agree to a
specific percentage. What we do know is that based on the facts when
companies are recruited to North Carolina we get a combination of new
jobs that are for local people, and we get some folks who move with it.
And both of those are important as we grow this economy and they need to
bring folks and recruit folks locally across the whole bandwidth. From
those who are employed at entry-level positions to those that are at
senior level management. I think if we looks at the breadth of companies
that have been recruited to the state as well as those that are growing
in the state there is some of both of those things happening. And we
need to do that to be healthy. North Carolina is an in-migration state,
that’s a plus and a positive but we need to be growing jobs from within
as well. So we’re trying to address both retention and job growth both
in-migration and hiring of those already within the state. Trying to
manage that both from an education and workforce development standpoint
as well as the types of companies we recruit. [speaker changes] Follow
Representative Holley ?? You’re good Representative Meyer. [speaker
changes] So I understand that this is designed to help in the closing
stages of negotiations. But I wonder if it actually ends up helping,
because if I’m negotiating with the state and I’ve got a deal 95% worked
out and I know that you’ve got this $20 million fund in reserve, I might
just wait until the end and say “That’s great, thanks for all your work
on this, and now I need another $2 million out of your closing fund.”
And then I’ve got the state of North Carolina and its people over a
barrel for $2 million. How do you turn that down when you get to that
place? [speaker changes] Representative Meyer, I think that that’s my
job as the chief negotiator in this process and I think that’s what you
have to be mindful for. We’re continuously running evaluations to return
on investment before we put any of these tools to the table. You may be
aware we have begun meeting weekly in a funder’s forum, both with all of
the grants making programs that Commerce is responsibility for and the
Golden Leaf Foundation, on a weekly basis looking at all the projects
that are about in the state of North Carolina. It’s a lot, it’s a big
commitment to the team to do that. We’re trying to make better decisions
about how the monies are spent, and that not every program goes to every
project and we just keep layering it on but that we make appropriate
investments to get a return to the state in a reasonable period of time.
So I think that’s a challenge that you place in the Secretary of
Commerce and the funding committees that are responsible for approvals
of these grants, and we have to be very mindful that we are stewards of
every bit of this money, and only to use it in places that we must use
it in order to obtain the jobs. We don’t have a good track record in
North Carolina from many years of attracting these large
transformational investment projects. And as I have accessed, tried to
access with great support from our team, what’s been the missing link
this is one of them. [speaker changes] Representative Meyer are you good
sir? Representative Luebke. [speaker changes] Thank you Madam Chair and
Madam Secretary, just an observation which other members have made. For
20 years going back to the 1990’s when I was and Representative Howard
were part of the Bill Lee Act discussions, the very first of this kind
of legislation. We’ve had the problem of Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, and my
feeling looking at this is that the way the bill is structured too much
of the investment is going to go to the counties that there’s just not
enough safe-guards to insure that the money is going to go to Tier 1 and
Tier 2 counties. And just make that as an observation that I don’t think
you’ve protected Tier 1 and Tier 2 enough the way the bill is
structured. My question for you is this, you’ve got $20 million that’s
in the budget as we’ve heard, and how will you or how will you and
others make the decisions to how much to give to each project? How will
you decide is this a $6 million project or is this a $2 million project?
[speaker changes] Each scenario will be unique and that will be looking
at the capital investment, we’ll be looking at the number of employees
generated from the project. We’ll been looking at what the state has
already committed at what Golden Leaf has committed, what has the county
and local community committed, because as you’ve heard me say a hundred
times all economic development</p>

Is local, and so, this is going to have to be a partnership. This does
require a match from the locals. It's not a one to one match, but does
require the locals be involved in this catalyst fund as well for it to
be available. So we'll have to look at the total investment that's being
made and not exceed a fair return. And so it'll just have to be the
process of evaluation. Tremendous amount of conversation. Evaluation of
what the risks are and what the investment is worth in North Carolina.
In some cases, it will come down to what our competitive state's doing,
and what is the value of our adding to that in order to get the jobs in
North Carolina.
That's the edge, that's the leverage we have not had historically to be
able to play at this game. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up Representative
Luki. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Secretary, it's my concern is that you've
20 million dollars, how do you bet on one project as opposed to another.
How do you have any real notion as to whether you're gonna run out of
money. So is this one maybe ideally a five million dollar project, but
we're running out of money, so we can only give a million? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] There will be some of that evaluation. There's no question as
we move through this process. I would hope that over time, very early
over time, we would have some type of frame work for the decision making
like we do with J Digg. It's very, it's statistically, evaluated. And it
is done in a measurable way so that we can track what we're giving so
that's it's comparable for comparable projects.
We'll have to develop that as we get into this. Some of it will be based
on, is in your businesses, what you got at the end of the day to get the
deal and to get the jobs in North Carolina. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stone. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Miss. Chair. Thank
you Madam Secretary. I have questions related to the talk about jobs
coming into North Carolina. One of the primary problems we have in tier
1 and 2 counties is we're always competing against tier 3 counties. And
what we fill like we end up doing is just sweeping in a pot. So when we
talk about the definition of a job, is it merely 600 jobs transferring
from the eastern part of the state that's getting enhanced to got to a
tier 3 county, or is it 600 new jobs. I mean that definition of job what
we really need because as we hear these job reports coming out, a lot of
the times, it's just companies moving within the state. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]
This is not about moving companies within the state. This is net job
growth in these numbers. This is about new job generation. So these
types of projects are new investment for most companies. It's a company
that, for example, be it aviation or automotive, where their production
demand is up and they don't have the capacity. So they're building
significant additional capacities and these are net new jobs. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stone. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So is there anything in here
that prevents us from actually competing against each other within the
state? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I hope the way we will prevent that is what we do in the early stages of
getting companies to the very best locations for their particular needs.
I think our team is very focused now on sight development. Understanding
the sites across the state, with a very high priority on rural
communities. One thing that I do know, Representative Stone, and I
wanted to make this comment around the other questions, the world is
urbanizing. And so a lot of times, when companies come to us, they want
to be in an urban center. And convincing them otherwise, is not
possible. These are the types of projects that find more rural oriented
communities very attractive.
Now I'm going to be honest with you. They might choose to go to a whim
of a tier 3 county because they've got access to workers. But if you
look at North Carolina's map where that's the case, they would be within
easy commuting distance of a number of tier 1 and 2 counties. And so
we're going to have to start looking at it in a regional kind of way
around where a massive plant like this locates. Where can they get
commuting employment within a thirty minute to forty minute commute
time. So even if they maybe, I would be concerned about taking tier 3
out of it because they might choose the whim of a tier 3 area where some
of our larger sites are available, quite honestly. But you've got
commuting distance in the others. It's our responsibility in commerce to
show them the sites all over North Carolina.
And we have an accountability for doing that with a very high priority
on rural jobs. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One last follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Nowhere in the bill did I see that we will,
are looking at unemployment as a factor of the incentive. So in other
words when we look at a tier 3 counties that are having the lowest
unemployment in the state, there's no incentive for them to take the one
or two tier counties over the tier three county, which obviously we know
tier one and two are really hit hard right now with unemployment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We didn't specifically, Representative Stone, because
the tier designation is in part a factor of the unemployment rate. So it
factors it in their. There would be a higher priority for those tier one
and two counties because their rates would be higher. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Secretary Decker. A very question, I
want to drill down into your statement about this particular scenario
and some of our neighbors from our neighboring states, what have...what
has been the outcome or is there any data that you can gather or give us
about the success, the outcomes about such a program that you say
discretionary funds with either the Secretary of Commerce or the
Governor. I want to understand more about how that process works and I
want to understand what are the other states doing, especially those,
our neighbors and how they’ve been successful or what have been their
successes or mistakes. Outcomes that are good or bad with this process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Secretary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me give you a couple of anecdotal responses to that and we can give
you more full data and I’ll be happy to provide the specifics on the
funds from other states. South Carolina in 2014 appropriated $37 million
to their, they call it the Deal Closing Fund, is what they call it.
Fancy name. And they used...that was UT tire. That was a specific place
where that fund was very helpful to them. they looked at North Carolina
and that would have been helpful to us. There was a bigger issue, single
tax factor apportionment was a bigger to that company in North Carolina,
South Carolina, as you know, provides for that. That would be one place,
one example, where that fund would be used. Clearly this type of fund
has been used in states that have been successful in attracting
automotive plants so that at the end of the final negotiation, they had
the ability to move quickly to make a final close. That would be a good
example.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Carney.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Madam Secretary for being here today
and answering all these questions for us. I just want to follow up a
little on Representative Luebke’s question about determining which
project. Madam Chair, if you’ll bear with me, I might make a few
comments before I ask my question. This bill, this omnibus bill we have
here, also has in there the sales tax issue of a cap. You were, and I
applaud your comment about the world is urbanizing and looking at the
urban cores with the rims out there. I think we’ve looked at the
demographics in this state for several years and we are moving in that
direction. Having said that, and keeping in mind, the capping of the
sales tax, part of that is a push back, I think somewhat on transit, but
our intermodal bill that we passed a few years ago, five to be exact,
offered for all counties a quarter cent or a half cent sales tax for
transit. Transit isn’t just a train and for these rim areas, they could
use that money to draw down federal dollars that they chose to draw by
referendum and get that money to develop a commuter vans to get people
to those jobs in the tier three areas. Having said that, what if a tier
one county, when choosing the projects, they want the project. They
don’t have the ability to raise money, maybe a little bit of sales tax,
except raise their property taxes and these tier one counties have kind
of pushed up to the brink on just about everything and I sympathize with
that. How, if they are the best suited for that project, but that can’t
get the matching money, what happens?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s the beauty of what’s begun to happen in commerce by looking
collectively at all of our resources. The job development investment
grant creates a utility fund. Every time a JD grant is made, about 25%
of that and the experts can give the specific numbers, goes to a utility
fund. I’ll show you some numbers when we get to that particular
provision in the bill that shows that fund could grow exponentially. We
could use that fund in an instance like that to help a tier one or tier
two county with infrastructure development for this type of project. We
are also working very closely with the Golden Leaf Fund. For those
counties where those funds are available, there’s a significant
opportunity for investment in infrastructure should this type of project
be interested, and we’re going to try to get them interested in a tier
one or tier two location.</p>

Do you stand?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I support the  motion and this is less than one minute. I'd like to do a
major compliment to the North Carolina Senate on its tax reform work
last year, getting rid of dozens and dozens of targeted tax
expenditures.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The, I have one second sentence. The functional equivalent of a targeted
tax expenditure is a discretionary targeted grant program. There is no
difference.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chair. I support the motion not to concur but I think
for different reasons. I think there's tremendous pressure being put on
counties to raise the sales tax for education, and many counties really
can't afford to raise enough money by that sales tax plus, as we've
talked about many times the sales tax is a regressive tax, and this is
happening, this push on the counties to have to, to recommend a sales, a
regressive sales tax to their citizens is because of a decision of this
general assembly since 2013 to cut back on appropriations for education,
actually going back to 2011. So I think we need to recognize that public
education is a state function to be funded by the state overwhelmingly,
and not to cut back on those appropriations for public education and
then push to the counties that they have to raise sales tax even while
people here are saying oh we didn't raise taxes, but you're pushing on
the counties. I just think that's very, very important to consider the,
the origins of the bill, or the consequences of the bill because of
cutbacks in public education between 2011 and now. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Members of the committee, chair, I ask for an apology. There
is one more section of the bill  which is part five, the crowd funding.
I believe this bill passed the House unanimously out of respect to the
sponsor of that section. Are there any questions with respect to that
part of the bill? If not, I'm going to accept the motion, Representative
Jones has made a motion that the finance committee recommend that we not
concur on the floor of the house and we go to conference. All in favor
will say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed no. Thank you madam secretary, thank you for being here.
Gonna jump back up to the top of our calendar. House bill, House bill
366, North Carolina Farm Act. The, again, this is a motion to recommend
concurrence, or non concurrence, there is a provision on a feed that's
been included in this report. So staff, if you would take it from there.
Representative Dickson, welcome to the committee sir, we'll let staff
run through it if, first if you have no objections.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chair. Chris Honors, Research Division. Would you like
me to run only through the finance related pieces or the entire bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, how about let's take it all the way down? You're in the finance
committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right. Section one of the bill would provide the complaints to the
Department of Environment and Natural Resources concerning an
agricultural operation and all records accumulated in conjunction with
the investigation are confidential and may be released by court order,
but if DENR determines that a violation has occurred, the complaint and
all records accumulated in conjunction with that investigation will
become public records. This section would also allow DENR to request
additional information from the complainant, a complainant, and allow
the department to decide whether or not to investigate a complaint
further if the initial investigation of the complaint leads to a finding
that the complaint is frivolous or was filed in bad faith. It would also
allow direct DENR to adopt rules to develop a formal system for
receiving and investigating environmental complaints about agricultural
operations. Section two would prevent ?? counties from adopting
ordinances regulating the use, sale, distribution, storage et cetera of
fertilizer. This section would not limit the authority of DENR or the
EMC to enforce water quality standards. Cities and counties would be
permitted to adopt ordinances to regulate fertilizers to protect water
quality provided that the ordinances have been approved by the EMC or

[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Chris thank you very much.  Members of the committee

finance related but it’s in one of the portions that he went over may I
ask that question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Yes mam, you certainly may.

federal storm water programs that they've allocated to us?  I can never

terrible way for the Senate to try to get something through and I
express my concern to Representative Dixon on this.  Everything that,
every piece of investigation I’ve done on this piece.  I can't
understand why this landscape contractor piece keeps coming up.  If it
wasn't from the government protection program and that's really what it
is.  If you look on page 3, on lines 41, take 40 and 41,  it sets out
any persons who for compensation of the considerations does any, to make
sure I understand it, you hear that any of the following:  first one
says, basically if you prepare a contract, you have to have a license
and it says prepare a contract for including installing, planning,
repairing and managing gardens, lawns, shrubs, vines and trees.  If you
prepare a contract to do that for over thirty thousand dollars a year
for one contract.  A Walmart ?? stone has an example of that.  For
Walmart you have to have a license.  And Representative Dixon knows that
I hate what they've done to his deal hear and he know my concern with
this it just is deeply concerned with this issue of a government a

the way our young men and women should go get into this business, not
closing it down.

question for clarification on section 11, on page 15, line 9, when we

operate an all-terrain vehicle on his or her property owes the person
the same duty of care that you owes the trespasser.  Are we saying the</p>

Change speaker: I'm Jim Barnett, I'm director of the macabre part by
culture and consumer services, structural pest control and pesticides,
and Chris is right. the definition of private pesticide applicator is an
individual who uses a restricted use pesticide to produce an
agricultural commodity restricted use pesticides are those which are not
available to the general public. see you buying a pesticide at Lowe's or
Home Depot or Ace Hardware and applying would not be required to be
certified as private as site applicator
Change speaker:
and questions from the committee. everybody exempted fluky
chair.
Change speaker: I just wanted to draw the committee 's attention nation
endeavors and Dixon. I have all already had a conversation about in the
agricultural committee that is the denial of public records with respect
in section one of the bill to deny the public to know about complaints
that are filed against agricultural operations. what the bill does is
take away the public record,public access that exists in virtually every
other activity in the state and says that in this specific area of the
complaints are confidential to the public and not find out about this
complaint until after the department made a decision, and that decision
has to be that there was a that there was a violation and without
violated. finding a violation of public will never find out that there
has been a complaint filed against the operation. I have a serious
problem with that. I think that's that's really not right, it's, it's
very bad policy and notwithstanding a good person will have a real
problem with it him him him( respected by know and I'm really saying
that's a nightmarish addiction can reply to and maybe make a
counterpoint to my
Change speaker: vacating the consumer
Change speaker: fragment and chaired not represented legates in fact, it
can be released by court of competent jurisdiction, the complaint scan
the second four years as languages, Barb item from the language that we
use in the ethics legislation concerning complaints against us. this
language is exactly verbatim from that the attempt here. this may sound
trite, but it didn't .it's important once the veil is run again unring
the bell. and just because somebody makes a complaint doesn't mean this
has an invalidity. they led their needs. it goes on to say that once
that complaint is issued and is investigated and then if it has validity
than it is public record. it's trying to avoid the many opportunities
where certain groups mistakenly
consider a policy knowledge from the error as turkey or chicken liver,
which is happen. I think the same.
Change speaker:thank you, Madam chair, and I hate to beat a dead horse,
but on page four, linesforty eight specifically makes his contract about
the general contractor license versus the landscape contractor license
and so whether you Dixon or a believe they are members of theaudience
might be able to explain where those two overlap so that we understand
it's important because if we're taught where acting as they were
creating a whole new licensing forpeople who don't have to be licensed
and I think they'll explain it to some degree they are having to be
licensed and so if we could just have the next him provisions they are
ready overlap to be helpful

that we were not able to build plants have been less than eight miles

don't feel like as a landscape contractor that I should be required to
have a general contractor 's license to engage in landscape construction
work planting projects, things of that nature is going to build houses,
Representative Hager, or engage in certain structural things absolutely.
there should be a requirement for general contractor 's license. we as a
scheduling right now and withdrawn. the statute requires us to have a
general contractor 's license, not a landscape contractor 's license to
engage in projects over thirty thousand dollars. we are not creating a
new licensing board where morphing the registration board into a
licensing board on the chair of that board. right now our staff. the
current board and all of our funds transfer over to this new board it,
it gets us out of having to have a general contractor 's license, which
is expensive. we have to qualify with a lot of financial audits if folks
that are engaged in landscape lighting projects is a barrier to entry.
I'd like to also point out all forms of landscape maintenance your
Walmart project. for instance, that includes knowing trimming of hedges
installing batch installer are wiser. all of that maintenance work is
completely exempt in this legislation, you can engage in five million

Just to make sure everybody understands that, that the Building Code
Council and building code which I have been a licensed contractor
before, does not require that if you’re doing landscaping.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager, you’re correct, however this isn’t about building
code….
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sorry Madam Chair, I’m new to this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. Representative, I have Lewis, Moffitt, Stone and Moore are the
others. Okay, I’ll just remind the committee that we have to adjourn at
quarter session, so before session, and then we will come back and
continue as we are doing now. Representative Moffitt sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair. Just for a little background for the committee,
I am a co-chair of the Joint Legislative Administrative Procedures
Oversight Committee, and we had actually taken up this issue during the
interim as we were reviewing all of our occupational boards and we did
determine that the requirement that these landscapers face regarding
projects that exceed $30,000 become general contractors, is a true
barrier to entry of the way that we’re setup and the way that we operate
currently. We also determined that the quickest way to remedy this was
to allow an evolution, if you will, of taking their registration board
and converting it to a licensing board and that would at least provide
them the opportunity to actually do work that exceeds 30,000 and the way
that the law is currently presented in this particular bill, does not
create a barrier to entry for people that are looking to get involved in
landscaping. The barrier to entry is the requirement that they become
general contractors to do certain work, not the establishment of this
particular board.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Moffitt. Representative Stone, sir?
Representative Moore. Tim Moore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair. This is a question to either Representative
Dixon or whoever wants to answer it, and I apologize, I’ve been having
to step out and dealing with some other things for session today, but my
question is, how does this differ with respect to the licensure piece
about the landscape architects to other legislation that has been
introduced in the past? Is it the same, is it different? I’ve just had a
couple folks both pro and con who’ve contacted me and I just wonder what
the difference is between them. I don’t know that we’ve passed it
before, I don’t know what’s happened. I  just don’t know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dixon, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, I’m only familiar with what has happened in the
last couple of weeks. I’m totally unaware of how this particular piece
has been treated in the past. However, I believe that the most exact
information appropriate to our feelings on this bill were just expressed
by Representative Moffitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, and maybe this is just…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Maybe the staff...can staff...there was other legislation on this. Is
it...how different was it and where did go? Was it acted upon?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, I believe this legislation has been around in some
form or fashion for several years. The last time that I was able to find
it was from, I believe 2011. It was largely identical to this. The
exemption number five used to be for landscaping work with a price of
all contracts over a 12 month period was $25,000, it’s been increased to
$30,000, but otherwise it’s identical and the legislation did not pass
in previous years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, do you have a follow up sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not right now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Dixon, on that question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Along the lines of what staff has just said, I think where the real
kicker started out, and I’ve discussed this with the landscape folk, it
was originally $7500 which would have been a true barrier. It’s moved
all the way from $7500 to making it equal with the general contractors
thing putting in 30 and 30.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lewis. Representative Stam sir. Representative B.
Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair. I keep hearing talk on both sides of this. But
we’re talking about converting a registration board to a licensing
board. I want somebody to say definitely that there will be no
landscaping activity open to an individual today….</p>

??. The forestry laws are folks that the state fair can enforce the
agriculture laws. Both can enforce crimes that occur on the property in
front of them. What we would like to do is be able to efficiently use
all those law enforcement officers to enforce any agricultural laws,
either forestry or agriculture that occur and need to be investigation.
This is a matter of efficiency allowing us to let them use that
jurisdiction anything underneath our laws. We have worked with the
Sheriff’s Association and they have also agreed and signed off on this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollar, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a quick...so is that just making sure that the two groups that you
currently have are able to cross pollinate or does it in anyway expand
what either of those groups would have beyond just being able cross
pollinate between the two current responsibilities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair and Representative Dollar, the language that you see in
front of you is the language that is currently in statute, but if we
were to hire any additional law enforcement officers, then that would
have to go through OSP. State fair’s completely receipt support it. The
North Carolina forest service is general funds, so we would not be able
to create additional positions if that’s what you’re asking. You’re
right that we are wanting to be able to use those efficiently if we
have, for example an agriculture investigation in the western part of
the state. We would like to send our most closest officer. Currently we
would have to send someone from Raleigh to work with the local sheriff’s
office because they're the only ones that have the jurisdiction to look
at agriculture laws.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair, I apologize, I wasn’t clear with my question. It’s not
additional jurisdiction over and above what either one would have
currently.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair, Representative Dollar, correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
