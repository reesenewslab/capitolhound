Folks, the meeting will come to order. We’re running a little behind
schedule. Let’s get things rolling here. We’re going to try to clear the
calendar before we get of here today. Housekeeping first. We have our
pages. Harrison Idle from High Point. Jake Sacks from Raleigh. Zach
Miller Wacksaw. Troy Billing, Ashborough. Ryan Barrett, Raleigh. Andrew
Smith, Raleigh. Good thing school’s out, or there wouldn’t be anybody in
school today. Chase Crawfield, High Point. Taylor Gaines, Wilmington.
Michael, you need to work on your writing a little bit, I can’t read
your last name from Littleton. Welcome. Glad to have everyone here. We
want to thank our Sergeant in Arms staff, Ken Kirby, Kyle Roach, Charles
Hoffa, and Anderson Meadows. Thank you all for what you do. We’d like to
start with house bill 1067 today. Murphy de-annexation. None of the
bills we had today for PCS’s are all straight up I believe. Rep. West,
welcome to the east.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. This bill de-annexes about 6 ½ acres in the town
of Murphy. It was requested in the town of Murphy. No opposition to the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. Rep. West, we have a motion for a favorable report.
Senator Tillman, any discussion from the committee? Hearing none. All
those in favor say aye, opposed no. Motion carried. Thank you very much.
Who’s going to run this on the floor? Senator Davis. Thank you. House
bill 366 NC (inaudible)-2014. Rep. Senator Jackson, I believe. Members,
we will be discussing only the financial aspects of these bills since
this is the committee on finance. If you will hold your questions and
comments to the financial portions of the bill today as we discussed. I
do appreciate it. Thank you. Senator Jackson?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Members, this bill, this part in here today only
deals with Section 3. Basically what it amounts to is we are creating,
allowing the industry to create their own commission and they will be
charging fees to a voluntary organization. And, I would ask for your
favorable support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee. Any? Just Senator Brock?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. This is a wonderful bill. I think I would like
to move for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Any further discussions on the bill? Hearing none. Motion has been
made. All those in favor of a favorable report say aye, opposed no.
Motion carried. Bill passes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank you members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Senator Clark? No, Senator Wade? The veterinarian practice act
fees. Thank you no. While you’re coming forward I would like to say we
have a host of members of the veterinarians here today in support of
this bill. Welcome to all of my brothers and members and (inaudible).
Mr. Chairman, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Before veterinarian Dr. Wade gets started, didn’t I meet some of your
veterinarian friends today at the table?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You did, but you did not buy them lunch. They remember. You did ask them
to take you to go fishing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just one comment. I asked them to go fishing with them next Sunday. I
understand they fish for money, and I fish for pleasure and eating. I
don’t know if we’ll work it out or not. I don’t want them to leave
before the day’s over.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Will do. Thank you sir. Bless them again. Senator Wade, you have the
floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Basically, what this does it allows the
veterinarian medical board to increase fees not more than 15% in one
calendar year for license and for inspections at veterinarian hospitals.
As far as I know, I’ve practiced over 30 years, and I’ve never seen them
have a few increase. I don’t know about you Mr. Chairman, since you’re a
veterinarian also. Have you seen an increase in fees in the last…?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I haven’t. We’ve been getting our money’s worth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We certainly have. They’ve asked for these increases. I think they’re a
lot more veterinary hospitals now than there were when I started my
practice.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Too many.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right. I would agree with that too Mr. Chair (laughter).
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They were right behind it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you members of the committee.</p>

Sen. Warren?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank  you Mr. Chairman, Sen. Wade. So would this allow them to increase
15% year after year after year or is there some- I haven't read the
details of the bill, but...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Until- Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You certainly may speak.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Until the maximum reached in them all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further questions or comments from the committee? We have a motion
for a favorable report by Sen. Ron Rabin,  all those in favor please say
&quot;aye?&quot;

Aye.

Opposed, &quot;no&quot;? Motion carried. Thank you, Senator, for

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman and committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House bill 1052 - May I back up, do any members of the veterinary
community, would any members of the veterinary community care to speak
after the fact? Post mortem, we might say in the business? Okay, good.
House bill 1052, Rep. Hager, [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I knew I'd be in the presence of Sen. Clark and
Sen. Ford today so I tried to step up my dress so thank you for the
inspiration guys. This bill ammends the regulatory fees paid to the
utility commission over the last 20 years. The utility commision and due
to some legislation from this body and the House has gotten out of the
regulating certain telecom industry. As we have deregulated, finished
that deregulation, the fees are going away that used to accompany that
deregulation. And the agreement is in this bill that other regulated
utilities- the gas companies, the other utility companies, will make up
the difference. So it would really be no degradation to the fees paid to
the utility commission. And with that Mr. Chairman, I'll be happy to
answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman, we have heard this same bill on the Senate side and
debated it already. It just kind of crossed over from the House before
we got ours over so I move for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This bill is nonappropriated capital projects for the UNC system. These
are projects that are not academic, not part of what we fund in the
university system but that are necessary to the conduct of a university.
It will include things like dormitories, cafeterias, in the case of NC
state it is some upfits to Reynolds Colliseum. In no case is any state
money, any taxpayer money used to pay for these bonds. This wll also
build facilities that are completely out of student fees or meal costs
or room rentals charged to the students. There will be no state liablity
for maintenance, for staffing, we will not be asking the state to pay
for the soap the janitor uses for cleaning the floors. I have Jonathan
Prewitt, who is a senior associate vice president of finance for the UNC
general administration, Mr. Prewitt would you please stand up and state
for the record there'll be no costs accruing to the taxpayers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I apologize Senator, I am so anxious to satisfy the questions of this
body that I just cannot restrain myself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. [??], I'm so anxious to see you satisfied I'm going to allow the
gentleman to speak.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I appreciate it sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you would please state your name.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. I'm-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please state your name and etc.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My name is Jonathan Prewitt, senior associate VP for finance
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is your mic on sir? Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Jonathan Prewitt, University of North Carolina general administration.
The answer is correct, there will be no additional costs to the state of
North Carolina for the maintenance or operations of these facilitites,
these are nonappropriated projects, and their operations will be funded
from non state resources.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. Do you have a question for him Sen. Tillman, or-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir, I do not have a question for him, I have a comment about this
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright sir, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Brawley, we believed you to start with. These are projects that the
UNC system does that are funded out of their own self-generated receipt.
Had they not or did they not do this over the years, guess where they'd
be coming to for the money. They'd be coming here for taxpayer money.
Although some people may quibble about the project, I don't care what
they build, they build it with their money, their self generated funds,
and these are all board of governor projects that they have picked as
necessary for their needs, and I don't care to micromange the list or
question anything on it</p>

<p id="10:00">
I move for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. We have a few more comments. Senator Rucho?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Senator Tillman, I don’t think there is anyone
questioning the projects. What we’re questioning is making sure that
there is no long term liability for the state of North Carolina. You
know, too many of the times we get buildings built, and all of the
sudden we find out that there is some appropriations that are required
to staff buildings and the like. What we’re trying to do is be totally
sure that these kind of projects require no future appropriations. It
does us no good. It does us no good to wait and find a building built
and then we get sent the bill. My question, Mr. Chairman, if I may?
There is no misunderstanding. You will not come to us on this projects
or with any other projects dealing with this non-appropriated capital
project list that requires any state money for operating or insuring or
doing anything for these buildings that you are requesting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s correct sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. We have Senator Jenkins is next.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This question is for the bill best for Rep. Rawling. Many years I have
heard of former Senator John Call would run this bill. He explained the
source of revenue as the kind money that comes out of the drink box or
the add machine. Is that basically what we’re talking about here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, some it does. Unfortunately, Senator, some of this, particularly
the projects for UNCC, is coming out of the back pocket of the bill’s
sponsor. But, it is not state money. If you’re student is living in the
dorm, they’ll pay for it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any follow up? Senator Hise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just give me a sense of…there is a new fee that’s here. I was looking
particularly at east carolina’s. This $425? Is that just in addition to
each student’s fee for the year in order to pay for a student union?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, I appreciate the question. Actually, they have a fee that’s
expiring this year. They’re putting in a starting fee that I believe is
$132. Then it will increase again the following year and the following
year. It reaches the maximum you describe. That, interestingly enough,
is just about the middle of the fees that are charged students in the
university system. There are actually several of the universities that
have higher fees. This, I’m going to ask the east carolina people to
correct me on this. If memory serves correctly, there was a student
referendum over these new student centers where the students voted and
the fee was disclosed in the ballot referendum and it passed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that correct? That’s correct. Thank you. Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. Just for clarification, and I know there are several fees on
here. When the fees go up in an institution, what is our impact on our
financial aid pool in the state? Is someone who receives full financial
aid, are we going to cover that fee and reduce the scholarship funds,
those type of things we have available in the state?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe that would happen sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Anything else, Senator Hise? Okay. Senator Wade?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I also have a question on the fees. After the capital improvements are
made, or whatever buildings built, do the fees go back down?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They do? You revert them back? This $425, sorry Mr. Chair, follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This $425, and you said it was going to increase?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, ma’am. The $425 is the maximum that it will be. That will phase in
over 3 years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up? So, when the building is finished, or capital improvements,
so that, it will revert back to what?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Unless a new fee for another project comes in, when that building is
paid off, it goes to zero.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If we may, Mart Mundy, from fiscal can weigh in here. Mart?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. Senator Wade. This is a debt service fee. This will be used to
pay for the cost of servicing the debt related to this project. So, once
that debt service is paid off, which I believe is usually a maximum of
30 years, then that fee would go away. So, depending on the term of the
debt, how many years it would be, it would be how many years would that
fee would be in place.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma’am. I tell you in the absence of Senator McKissick today…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh my, good gravy, Senator McKissick, I’m sorry, I wouldn’t have talked
about you if I’d known you were in the room!
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative…</p>

<p id="15:00">
If so...
[speaker changes]
[laughter]
[speaker changes]
... if there's, other capital improvements, will the fee increase?
[speaker changes]
The fee will increase if this body allows it. The part of the reason
that it's here today is these projects, even though they do not have a
state obligation, the universities do not have the authority to
implement these projects without legislative approval. And that's really
all this bill does, is give us the chance to make sure they're acting
responsibly. I will tell you that I spent quite a bit of time in my
office grilling people to the point that I was afraid I had perhaps been
rude to the representatives of east Carolina, but the answers I got were
full and complete, and I'm confident that I can represent this to you as
a good project for us to approve and not regret having said that to you.
[speaker changes]
Thank you. Senator Hunt?
[speaker changes]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Representative Brawley, in my reading of this
bill, it appears that these projects can borrow 95% of the costs, is
that a correct reading?
[speaker changes]
I'm gonna defer that to staff, please, because...
[speaker changes]
Who needs to answer that?  ??  Thank you.
[speaker changes]
Yes, sir. It's not 95% of the costs, it depends on the project. So each
project, for example, east Carolina project looked at using a portion of
their cash reserves to finance that, I believe, up to about $11 million.
But each project can borrow 100% plus and they can add, they have the
ability to borrow up to, I think, 5% additional to that, to cover
necessary costs, such as law and council fees and that sort of item, but
also, I think, probably to give 'em some leeway just in case what
happens in this bill and what happens in the future's cost increase.
[speaker changes]
I have a follow-up.
[speaker changes]
Yes, sir.
[speaker changes]
Well, I see it's even worse than I thought [cough]. As an old real
estate developer, I can tell you ?? money, I don't care what the source
of revenue is, is a risky proposition. And I'd love to see that
loan-to-value ratio, loan-to-cost ratio reduced. I mean, using reserves
is absolutely appropriate as opposed to borrowing money. So that's my
two cents worth.
[speaker changes]
Thank you, sir. Senator Curtis?
[speaker changes]
One of the major drivers of increasing the costs of getting an education
at U.N.C. is increasing room and board and fees. Will this continue that
trend of room and board and fees continuing to increase for students?
[speaker changes]
Yes, sir. Senator Curtis, the increases to room and board and fees do
play into the financing of these projects, particularly the housing
projects, but they're part of the campus' master plan for student
housing and they have planned within their revenue streams, over many
years, to accommodate the construction of these facilities.
[speaker changes]
Thank you.
[speaker changes]
If Senator Curtis would be willing, I'd be more than happy to run a bill
with him next year where we begin to use taxpayer money to build these
dorms and cut the costs to the students.
[speaker changes]
?? Senator McKissick.
[speaker changes]
This question might be best answered by somebody with the university
system, but I was wondering to what extent there was a larger list that
this group of projects came from, and what the system was for
prioritizing which of the projects within our university system would
actually move forward as I ponder this particular bill, because I think
we got six different campuses and many more constituent institutions
with a great deal of needs, so I'm trying to understand what the
priorities system was and what they went through to identify which ones
would be included.
[speaker changes]
Thank you, Senator.
[speaker changes]
Thank you, Senator. The constituent institutions made their applications
to the Board of Governors for their projects, there was one other
institution, Winston-Salem State, that had put in a request. Their bond
rating counsel advised them that that would harm their credit status,
and Winston-Salem State withdrew their request. So, that, these were
actually, these came out of the individual institutions and were
submitted to the General Administration.
[speaker changes]
Follow-up.
[speaker changes]
Follow-up, sir?
[speaker changes]
Yeah. So, obviously, there's only a certain amount of capacity out
there, so among all the requests that came in, it looks like six of them
were honored and I don't see any of the other, any H.B.C.U.s
represented, any of the historically black colleges and universities,
and I was wondering other</p>

<p id="20:00">
The one from Winston Salem State. Were there any other requests that
were somehow deemed for one reason or another, that they would not be
meritorious enough to be included in this particular bill? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator, Mr. Pruitt was shaking his head. Mr. Chairman if Mr.
Pruitt could address that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Pruitt, would you care
to answer that for us please? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. The Winston
Salem State University projects were the only projects that did not move
forward for legislative approval this year. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
sir. Do you have a follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes and I take it that
was as a result of bond council, is that what I’m hearing? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, it was based on an evaluation of the impact of the
additional debt on their credit rating, their campus credit rating.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re welcome. Senator
Blue. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is frankly a
modest list and since time immemorial these self-liquidating projects
have pretty much taken care of themselves in a responsible way. These
are our university campuses and we’re going to have to support them or
either decide that they can go into dilapidation. Look at the UNC
project, there’s $32 million for chill water plant, yet we decided a
long time ago that we were going to air condition buildings on these
campuses. And if they can pay for that, through fees or other kinds of
offset from direct appropriations, it makes sense to me. And I check all
of the other projects on this list including the East Carolina project,
which is the biggest one. They’ve got to have parking, got 25, 26
thousand students down there. And again, it’s our campuses so even if at
some point, if these buildings are essential to their meeting their core
mission, that is education students, kids and others, then we have to
have some sense of supporting them in that regard. I think that we’re
fortunate that they’ve got the credit capacity and they have identified
ways to pay for these facilities or these projects. But I want us to
keep in mind that if we’re going to have campuses that serve the needs
of the people of this state, we’ve got to figure out a way to pay for it
and we ought to be glad that they’ve identified these. This is a great
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Senator Rucho. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Senator Blue, yes we’re all concerned about
it but we do need to understand what we’re voting on, and I think that’s
an important part of educating the members of the finance committee. Mr.
Brawley, you did state the fact that the 425 was a cap, and when the
project is built out you say the fee will drop back to its zero level
but if it does, how do you maintain and operate your facility without
any revenue stream? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The revenue streams on most of
these buildings they also generate revenue from their operations, from
food service, in a student center a lot of times there may be game
rentals. For UNC Charlotte I know a big generator is the candy counter,
which I spent quite a bit of money as an undergraduate, and my daughter
as an undergraduate continues that tradition. So they do have sources of
funds. I believe that responsible management if the fee can’t go to zero
and maintain the buildings, that they would not request a cut to zero,
because they know they can’t use any state money to maintain these
buildings or operate. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And or repair them. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Or repair them. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Mr. ?? do you need
to add to that at anywhere, please? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
Representative Brawley’s correct for example for the East Carolina
project, the new student union. With the closure of the existing student
union which is primarily supported by things such as cafeteria receipts
or the parking garage which is supported by parking receipts, those will
be used to support the operation and maintenance of those facilities.
Normally with respect to repair and renovation of buildings, in order to
be eligible for funds appropriated to the reserve for repair and
renovations the General Assembly makes, the building must be constructed
and supported by the general fund. So for example, most of these
projects would probably not be allowed to draw down from that. The one
exception is each and every year the General Assembly allows for the
purpose of fire sprinklers, that dormitories can draw from that fund to
sprinkle their buildings. A new building obviously would have fire
sprinklers in it but an older building might be eligible for those
sources of funds. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Senator Brock. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And this may be a question for Mr.
Pruitt. Mr. Pruitt, could you give us the current list of or just a
total figure of how much we need to repair and renovations for our
university system? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, and this may be a ballpark</p>

[Speaker Changes]
For state appropriated buildings I believe it’s around 2.3 billion
dollars 2.4 billions dollars. Mr. Bondo I may have a more accurate
figure.
[Speaker Changes]
Going to follow up there?
[Speaker Changes]
I was just going to say if we’re looking at trying to keep education as
low cost as possible and senator Heiss brought it up, when you’re saying
whose paying for it, a lot of people think moms and dads out there are
sacrificing to try to pay for college. I think they need to keep in mind
about trying to keep college cost affordable to state, our state
students and you know we do have a big price tag on repair renovations
over 2 billion dollars so.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you, senator Ron Raven.
[Speaker Changes]
It’s not that I didn’t position anything in the bill but I got to
thinking about we just spend a lot of time talking about colash is it
proper inside this build to make comment in regard to that parking lot
and began looking at that, I hate to look at matrix solutions or things
that pan together. Wouldn’t it be proper for us to say there somewhere
inside…
[Speaker Changes]
Senator I don’t know if ??, but we respect you so much we’ll let you
make comment.
[Speaker Changes]
Well it’s a comment or a question, but it in the bill at least
investigate and probably we ought’ve be doing that in a lot of bills.
[Speaker Changes]
Senator Bobby will you please address that
[Speaker Changes]
Senator as you may recall, I was the primary sponsor of HBH17 which was
the strategic transportations investments bill. We’re actually
discussing now how do we encourage the use of the colash or concrete
products pavement products as part of that going forward. So I think
that’s something appropriate to address, but we’re not going to do that
in a short session because the technical problems might mess it up. And
I would respectfully request that we let this bill go forward as it is
and try to address that not only for the projects here, but projects of
an even broader scope.
[Speaker Changes]
I don’t disagree that’s why I made the comment. To me, I could fall of
saying in here, but in our future processes, that including both kinds
of things that make us look like we’re integrating solutions really
costing the taxpayers money if you don’t do it.
[Speaker Changes]
Senator Wayne
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. You mentioned, representative, that sometimes
the students are allowed to vote on whether these buildings appearance.
Can you elaborate on that? If it’s alright I’m going to let the
university respond to that.
[Speaker Changes]
Yes Mr.Chairman, as part of the committee, the University’s tuition and
fee setting process beginning with the campus and students and faculty
and staff in the fall of a year these projects and fees associated with
them goes through a student approval process and there is a student
referendum in many cases for approving fees and that was the case with
the east Carolina debt service fee.
[Speaker Changes]
That’s only for East Carolina or do other universities also allow that?
[Speaker Changes]
Other universities allow that as well and follow that process.
[Speaker Changes]
Ladies and gentlemen will you have comments please?
