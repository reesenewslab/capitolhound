Let us pray. Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you so much for this
beautiful day you've given us. Lord, I pray that you'll give us the time
today and every day, Lord, to just stop and look at the mighty work of
your hand in all creation. Lord, we're so thankful that you are our
creator, you are our sustainer. And Lord, I pray that you will allow us
to just stand in reverential awe of who you are. Lord, I pray that as
meetings continue here in this place, Lord, that you will give the
members a time to reflect on who you are, in all their work. Lord, I
pray that when they find themselves with difficult decisions to make,
Lord, I pray that they will stop and seek your guidance and your help.
Lord, we need you in all things, Lord. And, Lord, I just pray that
you'll be with these members each and every day. Lord, I pray that
you'll be with their families at home. Lord, we thank you for these
families and what they sacrifice for these members to be here. Lord, I
pray that your will will be done here on Earth as it is in Heaven. Lord,
we pray all these things in Jesus Christ's name, Amen.
