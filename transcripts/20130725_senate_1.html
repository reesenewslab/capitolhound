[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Almighty God, thank you for this place.  Lord, you have been our
dwelling place here and in all generations.  Before the mountains were
brought forth. Forever you have formed us. From everlasting to
everlasting, you are God. You return us dust, and ?? return of children
of man. For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when its
past.  Or as a watch in the night. So as we pause right now and pray, we
ask you to perform another miracle by opening up our eyes to see that
you are good. And we ask you to puncture our hearts, quicken us to see
how your endurance lasts through the night. Give us that type of
endurance. In Christ’s name we pray. Amen.

  <p>But I, there, one part was fixed, and Senator Hise has worked before the
conference committee, hard to work on that. There’s still one part that
I do not agree with and that is that the burden of proof when you, when
a person who is disabled or receiving benefits is removed, by an agency,
that person has to show why they shouldn’t be. It should be the agency.
And I think that is a very serious concern. I will vote for it because
it does have some things in it that we worked on and that are needed,
but first of all as I say I object to the process, and secondly of all I
do have that serious really doubt that this is, this is going to be a
burden on people who are disabled. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion
or debate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
McKissick, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if
Senator Hise would yield for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise,
do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise,
you mention in your remarks, has provisions in here dealing with the
provider assessment paid by hospitals. Could you elaborate a little bit
further on that because I have large hospitals in my district as well as
very small ones? So I’d be concerned to make certain that these are
being addressed in a way the Hospitals Association is supportive of, so
if you could elaborate further, sir? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will. Actually
this request comes, this change comes at the request of the Hospital
Association. There was agreements made for how the first 43 million that
was already in statute was divided among the hospitals. The budget has
changed that to a percentage of the overall. This provision goes back
and says that the overall amount will still apply for that above 43
million but the original 43 million will be assessed on the basis of
what was in previous law. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Excellent. Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the
question before the body is the adoption of the conference report for
Senate Bill 553 on its second reading. All those in favor will vote aye.
Opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. The
clerk will record the vote. [PAUSE]Senator Stein, Aye. Senator Blue,
Aye. Anybody else? Senator Curtis, Aye. Does that get it? 40 voting in
the favorable, 2 in the negative. Conference report for Senate Bill 553
is adopted. The House will be notified. No, excuse me, it will remain on
the calendar for third reading. Conference report for House Bill 74.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] House Bill 74, regulatory reform act of 2013. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Jackson’s recognized to explain the report. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Members, there’s as you well know
from last week, there’s a lot of stuff in this bill. There’s still a lot
more stuff been added to this bill but only four provisions that the
Senate has not seen or voted on before. But before I do that, I really
want to thank our staff again, and our team for working on this, because
this has been a difficult bill with a lot of moving pieces and they have
just been fantastic to work with, and so I just want to give them a big
thank you. But if you’ll look at section, I’ll go over the four sections
that this body has not seen before. Section 5A and B is one that you
have not seen before. Prohibits the late enforcement of local
ordinances, a county has a 10-year statute of limitations to bring
action against a violation that has been terminated from its grandfather
clause dealing with zoning or unified development ordinances. In other
words after ten years, it’s over with. They cannot bring any more suits
or so forth action against it. Section number 6C gives any student
enrolled in a constituent institution who is accused of a violation of
the disciplinary or conduct rules of the institution, has the right to
be represented by a licensed attorney or a non-attorney advocate who may
fully participate during the disciplinary procedures. Section 11.1 deals
with the professional employment organizations, PEO, this language
requires an applicant for licensure to file with the Commissioner of
Insurance a surety bond and an audited GAAP financial statement. And
then lastly the item that you have not seen before is section number 6

  <p>Which does two things in regards to the Industrial Commission, first it
makes the Deputy Commissioners subject to at will employment beginning
and the second thing is beginning of July 1st 2015 we&#39;ve asked to
give a, this was a compromise and we have given them two years to
implement this at will employment and Mr. President at this time
I&#39;ll be happy to entertain any questions or attempt to answer them
and I would appreciate your support on this concurrence. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Hise, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Senator Jackson a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jackson, do
you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jackson, in
going through your description there, I served several years as a hall
director and did a lot of student disciplinary cases in that time
period. Do I read that correctly as you&#39;re saying this provision now
would require that an attorney be allowed into an educational process?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, it&#39;s not required, but they have the right
to have an attorney if they so choose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise,
follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. So the procedures, you have a
student in for marking up and they&#39;re going to be required to write
a 20 page paper, that hall director now or others would be required to
have that student bring their attorney in, to allow this student in when
their parents are not allowed in that process or others on the outside?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jackson, would. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. President. Senator Hise, you continue to use the word required. That
they could bring a licensed attorney is could, not required, could bring
a licensed attorney or a non-attorney advocate which could mean a
parent. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Kinnaird for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the conference report. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator has the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We also have discovered a
problem in that same section, but relating to a different thing. If you
will look at section 6a, subsection k on page 7, that allows
fraternities and sororities, and we have an our town a problem in some
ways with fraternities and sororities that are sort of fictional, and
what happens in this situation is that anybody can if it&#39;s
designated by the National Accrediting Agency, that&#39;s one thing, but
a bunch of students can get together and say we&#39;re having a
fraternity formed, the Bacchus Fraternity, the drinking fraternity, and
they will then have, the town will not be able to zone, and actually
we&#39;re working right now with Representative Insko in the House
trying to find a vehicle for how we can fix that for the town of Chapel
Hill, and one of the things I talked about process a minute ago, but
this process I think has failed because we had no notice of this and it
just popped up. So we&#39;re trying to fix it and I&#39;m sorry that
this popped up here without any input from a college town that is as
severely impacted as Senator Hise said in his statement, and we&#39;re
hoping that we can find someplace that we can tuck it in before the end
of the day at 1 o&#39;clock this morning. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Brunstetter, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;d
like to move the rules be suspended so that staff can join Senator
Jackson on the floor to deal with this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Without
objection, so ordered. Senator Bryant, I see your light on. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. I was wanting to ask Senator Jackson
a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jackson, do you yield? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] In the, my question is based, the
jist of my question is some concern about and wanting information about
the thinking of exempting Deputy Commissioners who hear worker&#39;s
compensation cases from the personnel act and I was wondering how did
any discussion come up of consideration of the fact that you have this
hearing officer hearing a worker&#39;s injury claim and that officer has
to worry about their job when the lawyer representing the worker could
be any one of us, the company they work for could be a powerful
political supporter of the governor or any one of us, that how can that
worker get, and in some, to some extent maybe even the employer get a
fair hearing in that kind of politicized environment when you don&#39;t
know what factors may be pulling the strings of or

  <p>In the decision making of this hearing officer just hearing, you know,
what you get, you know, whether you had an injury and how and what the
facts are and what you&#39;re entitled to as a result. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Senator
Bryant, I would agree with you, but this was a compromise. The House
wanted to do it immediately, and we were able to negotiate down to this
2 year implementation before it brings in their. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;d like to speak. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant, you have the
floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, I just,
having done that job for 4 or 5 years in the past, it&#39;s extremely
political even without being exempted from the personnel act, and to
have them have to decide all those cases and look over your shoulder in
every case thinking about who you might upset and then who might then
put pressure on the Administrator or the Chief Deputy Commissioner to
dismiss you from your job, it makes it an impossible job to do in any
way that would be fair to the parties, and so I just encourage, I&#39;m
happy that we have some time before it takes effect, but I surely
encourage you to look at fighting harder to eliminate that provision. It
is no way people can get a fair, our citizens of this state can get a
fair hearing in that environment. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Goolsby, for what purpose do you
rise. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
has the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. I heard
Senator Hise&#39;s concerns earlier stated to Senator Jackson, and
I&#39;m actually from a college town also, although I&#39;ve never been
a member of a fraternity much less a sorority. I went to a military
school. I have represented a fraternity before on campus, and to say
that the rights of the student are not protected is to very much
downplay exactly how it works. I sat in a hearing with students whose
fraternity was being looked at to be kicked off campus. They did not
have right to counsel. There was a lawyer in the room representing the
University. There was no one in the room representing the students and
the fraternity and I was told I could not say anything. All I could do
was advise the student, when he wanted to listen to me, who was arguing
for the fraternity. I am very much in support of this law. I have worked
with others who tried to put this together to see to it that it does not
start putting lawyers into all of these things, it does not mandate
legal counsel, it does not start turning these things into little
private trial, but what it does do is it makes sure that our students
when they have rights that need to be protected are protected by
attorneys if they so desire or someone else to come in and to help
advise them, and I would just encourage you to please, I&#39;ve seen the
worst and I think that this goes a long way to helping make sure that
our students&#39; rights are protected, fraternities and otherwise, and
I would just ask you to consider this reasonable change that does not
open this up to all sorts of litigiousness, but does give our students
the ability to actually be represented by lawyers to where it would
protect their rights. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise, to what
purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the report. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator has the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
President, members. I&#39;m actually going to ask that you not support
this conference report. Having served in the positions I have and
working with student development and housing groups all over this state
through their association, this is basically a process where you are
saying to the hall directors at ?? member judicial on campus that have
it that if you have a student coming in for a noise violation that you
may be dealing with their attorney. This is an educational process. This
is actually in most cases an alternative for students versus going to
law enforcement and saying we&#39;re going to legally trespass you from
campus, we&#39;re going to legally charge you with underage consumption
of alcohol, something that the student would have a record for for the
rest of their life, we allow it to be held in an educational manner. Our
outcomes are that we hope that in all educational atmospheres, the
students learn from it, they do not fine students, they do not take
students&#39; property for them, but they do make sure students are
aware there are consequences to their actions and are not trained legal
professionals that are looking to stand up as a judge in front of
attorneys and argue motions. this is something where the outcomes are
different, this is not a proof

  <p>[Speaker changes.] under reasonable doubt, these are merely
preponderance of evidence for what is most likely to occurred and I
think it is a huge mistake for our education system to start putting
these type of legal and attorneys into that situation and I hope that we
can get this worked out so that the rest of this bill can move forward
and I believe we have time to do so I&#39;d ask that you not...mmm...
[Speaker changes.] Mister President...(???two speakers overlap, i
think???)
[Speaker changes.] Senator Robinson, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker changes.] To ask Senator Jackson a question.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Jackson, do you yield.
[Speaker changes.] Yes, sir.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Jackson, in that same section, does this
apply to fraternities and sororities only or to students in general.
That section is that specific to fraternities, sororities?
[Speaker changes.] Well, this applies...uh...Senator Robinson to all
students but it also...uh...exempts the honor courts...and we sorta
heard some of Senator ???? concern from other folks and so what we done
is put a...if you&#39;ll look on page seven, Section 6D, it says each
constituent institution shall track the number and type of disciplinary
proceedings impacted by this section.  In other words, they&#39;re
sposta keep up with what is happening...they&#39;re sposta report back
to the General Assembly...uh....I believe it&#39;s May first, 2014, to
let us know exactly how many cases they have had coming forward.
[Speaker changes.] Speak on the bill.  Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] Senator has the floor.
[Speaker changes.] I concur with Senator ????.  Sometimes we don&#39;t
really agree on alot but (laughter).  Having been a part of the Board of
Governors and looked at a lot of student issues, I do know that the
students themselves help to develop the procedural handbooks.  It&#39;s
not something that University officials or college officials do by
themselves.  They are part of the whole process in terms of setting up
their student councils, in terms of the review boards, the judicial
hearings, etc. They do have a process by which those students can come
before those boards and offer their cases and be heard by their peers.
And this is a peer setting, which is the right place to hear
that...before it moves any further...and there are appeal processes so I
think bringing attorneys into that kind of setting, where the students
themselves have been able to talk about the issues and then be heard by
a jury of their peers, offers some kind of a concern for me, in terms of
a process by which we&#39;ve allowed them their own particular
procedures so I think that particular piece does cause a problem.  For
years, we&#39;ve been trying to...we&#39;ve had student representatives
on the Board of Governors.  All the students come down and they&#39;re
heard and I believe they are listened to by their trustee boards as
well, where they are represented...and they feel that they are really
involved in this.  So I think this will take some of their authority
away in terms of being able to set up procedures...ah to hear their
peers.
[Speaker changes.] Mister President?
[Speaker changes.] Mmm hmmm...I believe I had Senator Bryant first and
then we&#39;ll...Senator Bryant, do you have...
[Speaker changes.] Mister President, a question for Senator Jackson...
[Speaker changes.] Senator Jackson, do you yield?
[Speaker changes.] Yes, sir.
[Speaker changes.] This is in regards to the same section which I just
looked at more closely myself and I noticed you have an exception for
student honor courts that are fully staffed by students and I&#39;m
wondering if that would include an honor court that also had faculty
involvement in it.  ???? What does that mean and are all our honor
courts fully staffed by students?  I&#39;m just not sure.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Bryant, thank you for the question.  I
thought I&#39;d never live long enough to say that but thank you, that
is a good question.  (Laughs.) Actually, this is for a student court
???? all students, it will apply.  I think the point we&#39;re missing
here folks in this is that this section allows parents to be in
attendance.  Currently, they cannot.  They don&#39;t have to be an
attorney.  They can be parents as well.  And it plainly says
non-advocate is the...can be there as well, I mean non-attorney,
&#39;scuse me...can be there to advocate for the student.  So I would
ask again that you concur with this conference report.
[Speaker changes.] Follow up, Mister President?
[Speaker changes.] Follow up...
[Speaker changes.] I still wanna find out is if faculty are
involved...and  staff are involved along with students in this honor
court setup, would they be included or not in this exception? Would that
knock &#39;em out?
[Speaker changes.] Mister President...
[Speaker changes.] Senator Bryant, to my...
COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHETHER THEY WERE SAY CORPS OR COURTS!?@#  Please
double check!  THANX

  <p>Let’s start with this. This would only apply to an all student honor
core.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Graham, do you have?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. And, I agree with Sen. Hise as well. I work at
Johnson C. Smith University Special Assistant to the President. My
daughter is the attorney general for the student and government
association at (??) State. And, it’s a good program in reference to
teaching students life lessons without the legal system at times. I just
agree with Sen. Hise and wanted to say that for the record.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brock, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It seems like there’s so much of a derailment of trying to base the
entire Reg Reform bill of this session on an option that college
students can have. That is interesting. I thought about this as when
were going through the conference report. At Western Carolina we had an
incident. By the time the board of trustees met the next day where I sat
as student body president. An incident the night before had turned into
a racial incident. Let me give you a background on the story. One of my
friends who was biracial, hit another  one of my friend who was
Hispanic. The next person that got in who was another friend of mine,
who was Asian. That wasn’t the story. The whole thing was over a girl.
But, you’re looking at some having some type of meeting where you have
some ramifications that will effect these students. Get them kicked out
of a university. They don’t get to have legal council there on
something. It’s not going to be over a traffic ticket or something like
that. This would just allow the option of having a parent or an attorney
in there if they need be. I just think it’s just an option. But, looking
at the rest of the reform bill. This will help North Carolina in so many
different ways. With our companies, our businesses. Those that are here
now and those that want to move to North Carolina. We’re looking at Reg
Reform. This continues our focus on bringing jobs in to North Carolina.
Building existing companies here. It’s interesting when we had the
committee that went around the state to talk to businesses. What can we
do in North Carolina? I think we were, well some of us were surprised.
Some of us knew about the excessive regulations and those that did not
make any sense at all. And, it’s taken us, this is year number three
we’re working on it. We’re not there yet. To make sure we put in simple
common sense solutions to the issues in North Carolina. This is a Reg
Reform bill of 2013. This is all about jobs and how we can get North
Carolina moving again. I urge your adoption of the report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. I think the key piece of this, and we can
debate this and I think many of us have concerns about this. I think the
key piece of this is the section, section 6-D. The reporting requirement
that’s involved with this piece that I think we have that some problem
with. I think the cause of the reporting piece, if there is a problem,
and something we need to take care of. We’ll at least have a report on
how this thing is played out in the next year or so and we can always
come back and fix this piece. This reporting piece was added just at the
end so we could judge this thing and see if we could create a problem
that we really don’t want to create with this. If you look at the report
as a whole I think we address many of the concerns that Senator Brock
just touched on. It’s a heck of a piece of legislation as far as Reg
Reform goes. I think we covered the piece that most are concerned with
with Section 6-d. And, I would ask that we adopt that motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would agree that this conference report goes far beyond just the issue
that has been discussed recently and that was raised by Senator Hise. As
it relates to that particular issue, I would really probably concur with
Senator Goolsby’s observation and Senator Brock. Students should have
that opportunity to have an attorney. At the same time, there are
beacons in this bill that are have more reaching implications that I
think should give us pause in terms of reflection. Language here that
basically says when it comes to cities and counties…

  <p>you cannot have environmental regulations that are more stringent that
state regulations.
There are places on our coast, there are places in our mountains that
might need to have more stringent regulations within a one-size-fits-all
type solution.  There&#39;s language here relating to local ordinances
dealing with billboards.  That&#39;s something we could review.
That&#39;s something we could be concerned about in terms of the reach
that it may have.  Certainly in a community like Durham where we&#39;ve
had regulations that go back basically two decades.  There&#39;s a host
of things here that we should be deeply concerned about in terms of the
far-reaching scope of what this reform bill provides us with.
One thing I&#39;d like to ask Senator Jackson about... I was reviewing
this bill, if you would yield for a question, sir.
[Speaker Switches]: Senator Jackson, do you yield?
[Speaker Switches]: Yes Sir.
[Speaker Switches]: Senator McKissick, go ahead.
[Speaker Switches]: Senator Jackson, when we last reviewed this bill
there was language in there that would even prohibit liveable wage
ordinaces enacted by cities or counties.  I was going through it, you
know it&#39;s a very lengthy bill, I didn&#39;t see that provision but I
may have overlooked it.  Is that still in the bill or has that been
tweaked as we have moved forward?
[Speaker Switches]: Senator McKissick, I believe it&#39;s still in
there.
[Speaker Switches]: It is still there?  OK.
[Speaker Switches]: Yes sir, now hold on a second.  I&#39;ll find it for
you.  I&#39;m still trying to figure out what acutal liveable wages is.
I understand what you&#39;re saying.  I still contend though that is
very argumentative at best and debateable.  But it&#39;s in the bill.
[Speaker Switches]: It is still in the bill?
[Speaker Switches]: Yes sir.
[Speaker Switches]: Again, those type of provisions which some cities,
some counties have adopted, basically say that when they issue public
contracts, in fact other contracts other than contracts that are entered
into by the city and the county that they want to pay liveable wages,
they want to make sure that the person they hire.. that contract
provides liveable wages for their employers.  Of course the city, the
county, might be paying and additional amount in consideration of that
fact.  I think there&#39;s a host of reasons that would give me concern
and pause for not supporting the conference support but it wouldn&#39;t
be based upon the issue raised by Senator Hise.
[Speaker Switches]: Let the record show Senator Rabon from Brunswick is
back in the chamber.  Senator Gunn, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Switches]: To speak to the conference report.
[Speaker Switches]: Senator has the floor.
[Speaker Switches]: I agreee with Senator Brown that this is a good
deal.  A lot of hard work has gone into it.  I don&#39;t know if
it&#39;s a perfect bill.  I&#39;m not sure that in the past several
decades we&#39;ve ever had the perfect bill but there&#39;s a whole lot
more good than bad and I would suggest you support it.
[Speaker Switches]: Any further discussion or debate?  Hear ye none.
Question for the body this conference report on House Bill 74... all in
favor will vote &quot;aye,&quot; all opposed will vote &quot;nay.&quot;
Five seconds will be allowed for the voting and the clerk will record

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think we&#39;d moved Senate bill 315 to the end of this calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Very good, we did. Ready to go on it?
Sen. McKissick, where are you?
Ready?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I&#39;ll have my hearing aids out by the time he gets
there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
Without objection, so ordered.
Senate bill 315 for concurrence, second reading.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate bill 315, municipal services
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. McKissick to explain the concurrence.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. It&#39;s a pretty straightforward bill, it&#39;s ?? bill for Durham
to build new police headquarters, we also had a separate bill for the
county of Durham to build a waste water treatment facility, they got
combined in this bill, there was also an issue that came up over Durham
which many of you have heard about now, known as the 751 project which
went before city council in terms of a vote as whether to extend water
sewer services to the project. Council on a 3 4 vote voted no t to do
so, there was an amendment made over in the House by Rep. Tim Moore to
add provisions in this bill that would allow the city of Durham to do
so. I work with Rep. Moore, we came up with terms and conditions, which
I think are fair, reasonable, very straightforward. In the House it got
a strong positive vote, 76-33, a bipartisan vote. To tell you a little
bit about the project, it&#39;s 171 acres, mixed use project providing
for residential development as well as commercial development

  <p>It&#39;s projected that during construction we&#39;ll produce about 3700
jobs. About a 166 Million dollar overall impact. After
construction&#39;s over, projected to create about 2980 jobs, 154
million ongoing impact and about 452 million dollars to tax base.
Developers agree to provide about 9 million dollars of infrastructure
above and beyond that would be required for the project. Also agree to
provide a fire station for the site, provide affordable housing as part
of the development project, two school sites, a sheriff substation. In
addition to committing to a host of committed elements. The committed
elements include fully complying with the existing Jordan Lake rules
even if those Jordan Lake rules might happen to be suspended or appealed
at some point in the future. Having said that, the mayor of the city of
Durham supports this particular bill, this codifies  a bill that he had
negotiated with the developer, it is structured in a way while being a
statewide bill this probably only went one entity, that being a
particular person an entity who came before the city of Durham with this
request that would apply to that said we would request your support. So
you see it&#39;s supported by the Chamber of Commerce, supported by a
host of local organizations, supported by the mayor as I said, and was
recommended by the city manager when it came forward.
[Speaker Changes]
Any further questions today? I heard Senator Kinnaird first. Senator
Kinnaird has the floor!
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr. President. I&#39;m going to tell you quite a different
story. This has been pending for six or more years. And it has gone
through technical gyrations that got it to this point. The city did not
want this particular development. Chatham County, which I represent, did
not want this development. It is very close to the lake through a
passageway that gets into the lake. The city tried and the county tried
to stop this for six years and with developers going around one little
corner and another little corner eventually we got to where we are. But
I can tell you that this is going to further impair Jordan Lake. And
they&#39;re talking about how they are going to comply with the Jordan
Lake rules, the developer, but on the other hand if you put development
in the watershed and along the lake, you are further impairing a already
impaired lake, in fact I got the report from Diener and this lake is
very close to the tipping point. Putting one more development there does
not keep it from going over the tipping point, it pushes it. We know
that Chatham County is very concerned, we also know that a great deal of
Wake County ought to be very concerned because it serves three hundred
thousand people in Wake County with their drinking water. And, there is
no way, despite what people say, putting all sorts of things in the lake
that you can clean up a lake that is going to be polluted this severely.
So this wasn&#39;t a nice little straight path that everybody thought
was just going along and would be this happy development creating all
these jobs. To the contrary, this was a circuitous route with tricks
along the way that ended us here. And now we can put lipstick on this
pig all we want to. We can say that the Chamber of Commerce loves it but
for all those Chamber of Commerce folks who don&#39;t love it there are
all the people who are drinking the water, the environmentalists who
know that we are facing an impaired body of water and this is just going
to make it worse. So I am intending to vote against this concurrence.
[Speaker Changes]
Senator Blue, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker changes]
Senate rule 29 send forth an excused absence.
[Speaker changes]
Yes, send him forward please
[Speaker changes}
Senator Wood, what purpose do you rise?

Speak to the bill
[Speaker changes]
Senator has the floor
[Speaker changes]
Thank you Mr. President. As the primary sponsor of this bill and on
behalf of the remainder of the Durham delegation, I urge you to vote
&quot;No&quot; on concurrence. I am glad Senator McKissick thinks this
is a very simple straightforward bill cause as many of you know I served
on the Durham city council for the seven previous years and this was an
important issue for six of the seven years that I served on the City
Council and it&#39;s far from simple and it&#39;s far from
straightforward. This bill comes down to three things

  <p>The project, you&#39;ve heard a little bit about the project. Some of
you have met with the developer and his team of lobbyists and attorneys,
you&#39;ve heard from different community groups in favor and opposed to
this. Let&#39;s be clear on one thing, this developer has other options
with this property. This isn&#39;t and either or, there&#39;s a full
range of options on this property. This development team has locked into
one plan, and many of you have seen the pretty pictures of that plan,
but this is not an either or proposition. They&#39;ve suggested to you
that there will be over 3,000 jobs with this project, but they can&#39;t
tell us much about these jobs, so it&#39;s really the promise of jobs
versus the illusion of jobs. They commissioned an economic analysis,
cited in the Chamber of Commerce letter to you, but they really
don&#39;t give you much detail in that. Are these new jobs or is this
going to be a commercial development that&#39;s going to be out trolling
for other jobs when leases are up throughout the Durham office market.
Now there was another pair of labor economists who looked at this
project and said the number was something about half of that. Now
remember, when you&#39;ve got other options for this, let&#39;s call
them options b and c, you can look at this a little more closely than
just accepting the developer&#39;s report. You can look at the other
economists, labor economist&#39;s report who said it&#39;s not quite
there. And again, will they be recruiting from other parts of town? Will
they be recruiting other jobs, or are these new jobs? We&#39;d love to
think they are new jobs, but we don&#39;t get a straightforward answer
on that. You also need to consider the business environment that this
project, remember 13,000 housing units, 600,000 square feet of office
and retail space, pretty intense project on 157 acres, so think about
the business environment this project is moving into. Think about the
offices that are opening, the third office building at the Durham Bulls
Athletic Park in the Dpack. Two blocks north of that in Downtown Durham,
we&#39;re getting ready to begin construction on a 28 story office
building. I know those of you in Charlotte don&#39;t think that&#39;s
very big, but for Durham, that&#39;s skyline changing. How many jobs are
we going to try to put into that office building? Those of you in the
Triangle area are very well aware that the Research Triangle Park
recently released it&#39;s master plan and over the next 20 years will
double the number of employees in Research Triangle Park just 7.5 miles
from this site. Where are all these jobs going to go? I&#39;d love to
say that we could fill them all, but with this project being 8, 10, 12
years out, they&#39;re entering a very, very competitive environment. So
how will this project attract 3,000 jobs, new or current, and how are
they competing, trying to track these jobs down to the rural area on the
Chatham County line? If you were moving your business to the area or
relocating some of your workers, would you rather be downtown or at a
prominent address on Research Triangle Park or down the Chatham County
Line? It&#39;s going to be very, very competitive. Now you may say,
well, you know, I didn&#39;t know about these other projects. I
didn&#39;t know about the competition. Well, of course you didn&#39;t.
You don&#39;t live nearby. You didn&#39;t, you&#39;re being asked to
evaluate this developer&#39;s claims based on information that
you&#39;re getting. So why are we debating this? Really, folks,
isn&#39;t that what we have city councils for? Shouldn&#39;t they be the
ones kicking the tires on this project and asking these questions?
Aren&#39;t they the ones who have this knowledge that we don&#39;t have
sitting in this building? The developers have asserted that the project
will have no or minimal impact on Jordan Lake because, as they have
suggested, the mile is a site, the site is a mile away from the lake.
There was a map circulating that I think it confused some of you all
about this. You should walk the property sometime and see the marshy
area. I&#39;ve done it about 6 or 7 times. You can take canoes right up
in these areas when it&#39;s wet within 100 or a couple hundred feet of
the site of this property. And if you look

  <p>Carefully you will see on the map it was passed out within about 250
feet some of these intermitten streams and some of these ?? Now the
developer has, to his credit, agreed to comply with the Jordan Lake
rules. Whatever version comes out of here. Over the next couple of
years. Well, in order to do that, he&#39;s gonna have to either mitigate
on site or use, somewhere in the neighborhood of 30,000 nitrogen credits
in the nitrogen bank. Well, right now the nitrogen bank has 25,000
credits in it. Those of you concerned with upstream development, in this
watershed and those of you who support the Jordan Lake rules are be very
careful, about this project. Because your developers upstream will be
forced to either add to the bank or litigate on site. That&#39;s going
to be a fiscal challenge for those folks. There are other concerns that
have been raised as well. About this site, providing services, as
representative Howard has said when this bill was moving through the
house, this is an upside down project. It&#39;s going to cost the city
of Durham money to support this project. When it comes online, now they
have worked on that with annexation and moving that out, but you&#39;re
going to have a challenge providing fire and ?? service there.
Developers have provided a site, but it&#39;s a site that won&#39;t
perk. And where is the 3 million dollars to build the fire station
there? Fire and ?? response times in this quarter if you&#39;ve been
down there in the South Point Mall, have been degraded to 8 minutes, the
standard response time in this area should be about 8. School capacity
has already stretched in South Durham County. The  elementary school
where 1300 housing units where young people are going to be going to
school, soutwest elementary already 1/2 of their students are in
trailers. Where are the classrooms, where are the buildings going to be?
For these students? It&#39;s going to cost, money. And if you think of
the track records of the developers, this is a very important point,
that past performance predicts the future, results, the last residential
project, they built a mile and a half away from there was challenged.
The president of the Homeowner&#39;s Association spoke with me a few
weeks ago again in my district, both as a city council member and now as
a senator, these developers left their homeowners in their residential
project just about a mile and a half from this site, $280,000 in debt,
and two ponds that the homeowner&#39;s association is going to have to
mitigate on their own at a cost of $50-60,000. Again, the last day of
our session, we&#39;re here debating the merits of a local project. Why
are we doing that? It&#39;s a darn good question. This is what we rely
on City council and county commisioners to do. Which gets me to the
principal position of this bill. The role of local governments in making
decisions about the land use in their jurisdictions. I share with you,
just a few of the dozens and dozens of questions that have emerged abuot
this project over 6 years. Which group of the elected officials is in
the best position to ask these questions to understand the research that
needs to go into it and have the questions answered. Is it us? Is it the
120 collegues across the lobby? Or is it the 7 people city council that
was elected by the residents of Durham? Now I look around this chamber
and I see former majors and former city council members former county
commisioners. Put yourself in your former elected role for a minute, I
know for some of you that&#39;s going to be a few years back. But if you
can do that for a while. What if instead of Durham, this city had your
town or county, in the language.  How would you feel about this then?
What would your position be? Imagine the scenario and this is going to
scare the life out of some of you. With those of us on the back row in a
few years move to the front row.

  <p>So Senator Nesbitt asked me to sit in chair number two and be the rules
chair, and I get a call from an old college friend of mine who&#39;s a
lawyer and he said can you help my developer buddy out? Well, let me see
if I can. Is it in your town? No. Is it in my town? Nope. It&#39;s 150
miles on the other corner of the state. That&#39;s how this bill got
here. That&#39;s how this bill got here. Some of you remember it from
last year, from my freshman colleagues, the Senate discussed this bill
about a year ago on this very last day of the short session. How would
you feel if this was your community and you were that local elected
official? What if your mayor called you and said that rules chairman has
got essentially gone to our head and says that he&#39;s going to run
this bill if we don&#39;t vote in favor of it? How you would feel?
You&#39;ve heard the mayor supports it. The mayor was given little
choice as he was a year ago. Now there&#39;ve been two votes on this,
Senator McKissick is correct. A 4-3 vote against this annexation in
early June, a 7-0 vote on this annexation a year and a half ago. It was
only after the vote 18 months ago when this bill emerged here in the
General Assembly. And then what about the principle of a local vote? I
had a conversation with one of my colleagues here last week about this.
Here&#39;s another principle for you to consider. This colleague said
what do the local voters want on this bill? And the proponents have told
you that the Board of County Commissioners voted for this project.
That&#39;s right, they did, but that was the previous board. Since that
vote, since this project, there have been 3 elections. Two city council
elections in 09 and 11 and a county commissioner&#39;s election in 12,
and in all 3 cases the majority of elected officials, city council or
county commissioners who were opposed to this, who were skeptical about
it, either voted, they were either elected or re-elected. You&#39;ve
been contacted by the leaders of two prominent political action groups,
one in favor, one against, and, but the voters, 3 elections, and in all
3 elections elected, the majorities were either elected or re-elected.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, the precedent. Before you cast your vote
in a few minutes on this, please consider the precedent a yes vote will
be setting. We&#39;re going to be opening up a Pandora&#39;s box. If you
want to become the Planning Commission, the Zoning Committee, the Board
of Adjustment for the whole state of North Carolina, vote for this,
because every disgruntled developer who has a tough time with the city
council or county commissioners is going to come right here and ask for
relief. Is going to call his college buddy who&#39;e going to make them
run a bill, and we&#39;ll be sitting here debating the merits of
development projects on and on and on. We can just hang a sign right out
here on Jones Street, Planning Department, because that&#39;s what
we&#39;re going to become. The Planning Commission for 100 counties and
500 municipalities if you vote for this and we start this precedent.
Project, principle, precedent. When you consider all three, I&#39;m sure
you will join with me, my former colleagues on the Durham City Council
and the remainder of the Durham Delegation to vote no on concurrence.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
speak a second time on the conference report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
has the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I think we heard a very lengthy
oratory statement relating to Senator Woodard&#39;s observations about
this bill, many of the facts which I would not agree with. For one
thing, let&#39;s talk about Jordan Lake rules first. This particular
developer has committed in all of the documents that are related to this
particular project to fully comply with the existing Jordan Lake rules
notwithstanding what may happen to these rules in the future. The only
way that can change is if he goes back to city council or county
commissioners, so that is a factual inaccuracy.

  <p>The accounting commissioners voted in favor of this project. And they
did it in a substantial and significant way. So I mean the county
commissioners have favored it. It did come up once before city council
at that point in time it was after the county commissioners have
approved the project but there were certain neighborhood groups that
wanted to challenge that in court. And while the developer requested
that the project be annexed the city council said in that point in time
litigation is pending so we don&#39;t want to consider it. So they voted
it down came back up recently it was a three four vote. The mayor as I
say supports the bill as it is he basically negotiated the terms with
the developer. We have attempted to codify it and to strengthen it.
Representative Moore I saw him in the chamber a few minutes ago worked
diligently to try to address each and every concern. If you talk about
jobs, jobs, jobs. This is a program that will provide jobs and provide
support for the local economy. There was a letter that circulated to
each of your members here each of the members from the Durham Chamber of
Commerce and I&#39;ll read just a quick paragraph from it. And this is
from Missus Tracey Steinbacker president and CEO says &#39; According to
an economic impact analysis completed by the economic research
associates, the construction phase for seven fifty one project has the
potential to create ten thousand seven hundred fifty two cumulative jobs
and labor income of one hundred and sixty six point nine million
dollars. Ongoing operations with the project has the potential to create
twenty nine hundred and eighty permanent jobs with an annual payroll of
a hundred and fifty four point two million quite differently the project
has the potential to reduce current unemployment significantly in our
community and it goes on to recite other factors if we want...I think
most persons in many districts would be envious to have this type of
project being considered to be constructed within their boundaries. I
simply ask for your support as I say ?? manicure supports it our mayor
had support it I support this. It is what Representative Moore and I
have worked out and agreed upon and I believe will be beneficial to our
community.

SPEAKER CHANGES:
Senator Mckissic normally you talk me out of something when you keep
talking but I&#39;m gon&#39; ask the Lord to forgive me. I&#39;m voting
with you twice this week. (laughs)
And the reason I say that we would all probably kill to have a project
like this. Now I know you have your local squabbles over whether you
want it or don&#39;t want it and whose for it and whose against it.
Seems like it to me it&#39;s a good economic development project. It
seems like it to me that&#39;s a Republican idea and if you want to buy
into it you&#39;re welcome. But I&#39;m gon&#39; support the bill I
think it&#39;s jobs to economic development.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Now I ask the rest of you to vote for it.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Mister President. Senator Wood we&#39;ll let you go. For what purpose do
you rise?
SPEAKER CHANGES:
To speak a second time.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Briefly. Carry on.
SPEAKER CHANGES:

Mister President. ??

SPEAKER CHANGES:
Yes sir Senator Nesbitt. I remind the president that you need to keep
the proper decor.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you Senator. (laughs)
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Mister president you may carry on sir.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Again Senator Mckissic has countered some of the things I said and I do
think they need to be addressed. Number one remember the Chamber of
Commerce letter written by the vice president of the Chamber who was the
developers attorney at the time the letter was drafted. The economic
development report has been challenged by another pair of labor
economists. Pick your expert here. But the numbers...they&#39;re plenty
of folks including the city council believe the city council are
overstated. The city managers support for this. This is the vote the
city manager provided the Durham city council last year. His
recommendation...there is a slight recommendation in here. In order to
find it Senator Mckissic will have to get a pair of tweezers and pluck
it out of this book. And there is a conditional if you read the
recommendation it&#39;s if if if if if and these go on and that&#39;s
what&#39;s in this book of the things that would need to be in place
before you can recommend it. Given the weight of the city managers
research the weight of his report it was a seven to zero vote which
included the mayor. The mayor was against it before he was forced into
negotiating with Representative Moore. So there&#39;s the city
manager&#39;s recommendation conditional to...

  <p>tune of about three inches. There are plenty of other options for this
project. Nobody is turning their backs on jobs. Nobody is turning their
back on a good project. What they&#39;re turning their back on is this
project. Don&#39;t forget, ladies and gentlemen, this project.
There&#39;s a whole range of other options that this developer has
available to him, has had available to him. He&#39;s wed to this one.
And, ladies and gentlemen, do we want to sit here and continue to debate
this? You may feel certain ways about projects, but I would remind you:
Principle and precident. Don&#39;t forget those two things when you cast
your vote. If you go against the principle of city and county
governments, determining what their land use is, this has become a
dangerous day. And, if you want to become the planning commission for
the state, that&#39;s what we&#39;re heading for if we allow these
developers to come, bring their projectsin the door every time they get
an unfavorable vote. I ask you again to vote no on concurrence.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Suchack, for what purpose do you rise? And then, Senator
Meridith.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
See if Senator Olrand will yield to a quick question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Olrand, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
This should be good.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Oh, thank you. In all your years since reconstruction, have you ever
seen a freshman member get an ?? three times?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I never have.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Meridith.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. President. I had a question if Senator McKissick would
yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator McKissick, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you. Senator McKissick, I remember very vividly, as a freshman,
that you were very much against this bill when it came to the floor.
Would you mind explaining to me what has changed your mind? They
actually came to my office and spoke specifically to me about this bill
and I&#39;d just like to know what changed your mind from last year.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Well, I can easily address that. Last year, we had a completely
different bill. The bill last year was a bill that looked at basically
the geographic areas that surrounding cities. The urban growth
boundaries. Many cities in North Carolina have urban growth boundaries
outside their city limits. What that bill last year would&#39;ve done,
would&#39;ve basically said that all cities in North Carolina that have
properties outside of their urban growth boundaries would&#39;ve been
required to extend water and sewage to those particular properties,
notwithstanding whether they had water to sewer capacity or not. This
particular bill is extraordinarily narrowly drawn. It only applies for a
60 day window of time after its passage. And it only applies to those
particular appplicants who may, in fact, apply to a city who have had a
prior request for annexation and a water and sewer service agreement
denied. Once it is submitted, within that 60 day period, they would be
bound to all the provisions within that water and sewer extension
agreement. That is, in fact, the agreement that was negotiated between
the city of Durham, the mayor, and the developer in this particular
case. And, in each and every committed element that was a part of any
other approval they received, in this case the approval that was granted
by the county commissioners. It is very narrowly drawn, it is targeted,
it is specific. Is water and sewer capacity available? This is not a
global bill that has far-reaching implications for many municipalities
and towns within North Carolina, it is narrow and specifically drawn
based upon the circumstances, facts, ?? in this particular present case,
so the potential for overreach does not exist.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I&#39;d like to ask Senator Woodard a question if I may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Woodard, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Senator. I did have one question about the other options. Did
they ever come before the city counsel and were voted on, or were they
not ever?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
No, they&#39;ve never been presented.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Alright, thank you. Thank you, Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Any further discussion or debate? Rather, Senator Raven. Saw him first,
there talking.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
For what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. President. I will try not to be as long winded as Senator
McKissick. And, like Senator Tillman, I have searched high and low to
find times that I can agree with Senator McKissick, and this is one time
that I do. This project will create, or, I have read and looked into, it
will create around 3,000 jobs and bring about $450,000,000 to the tax
base. Now, it&#39;s hard for me to believe, when we look at something
that&#39;s going to come in, doesn&#39;t want incentives, wants to come
into this state and do something and create that number of jobs, put
that much money in the tax base, $9 million into the infrastructure,
donate a spot for the school, donate a fire station, and do these other
things

  <p>[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that normally, our colleagues ask us to do, its very difficult for me
to be against it. And as Senator Tillman said, this sounds more like a
Republican Bill than a Democrat Bill and I encourage you to concur.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tucker what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ask Senator Woodard a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Woodard, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, I just need some clarity. You mention the three P&#39;s and one
of those was precepent. You also mention in your comments there is a
twenty eight story building going up in the inner city, or within the
downtown of Durham which is going to create a competitive atmosphere for
office space. Are you suggesting, through their vote, on the city
council which you were a member, that because there is a competitive
arena in the market place that this developer should not build office
space?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir. I certainly wasn&#39;t suggesting that. I think you need to, we,
as a city council and if you all are going to be deciding projects like
this, you need to see if, can these three thousand jobs be sourced.
Where are those three thousand alleged jobs coming from. Remember,
another pair of economist looked at this and said they weren&#39;t three
thousand jobs and that&#39;s the reason why. One of the reasons why.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis, what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Senator McKissick a question please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, if I was on the town council of Durham, I would vote
for this project based on the information that I have. However the real
problem that I have is the, the Senate being asked to override local
government. I&#39;m willing to do that only when there is a compelling
reason to do so. Could you tell me what that compelling reason is in
this case?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure, in fact there was going to be a vote of the city council which
occurred. There was a three four vote. It was three four in opposition
when it should of been three four in favor. The individual who decided
specifically to vote against whether in favor said he basically wanted
the State to tell him what to do. We want to fulfill his wish . To tell
them what to do. He asked for that. So we now have that opportunity. And
its beholden upon us, if we believe its in the best interest of state of
North Carolina to provide these jobs and opportunities when it comes to
construction. When it comes to tax based to have a positive spillover
impact and perhaps that&#39;s a reason that we could do so because they
wanted to be told what to do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Mr. President if I could speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. I, I&#39;m troubled by some of the comments
from Senator Woodard. It appears I got the same impression that Senator
Tucker did that the town council according to my understanding what he
said was getting involved in  the competitive environment. Whether or
not this was a, going to supply the jobs or going to be in competition
with another developer and the opportunity to choose sides there, kind
of troubles me. Also he mentioned that this particular developer was,
had left previous development with about a quarter of a million dollars
worth of liability with some, with some ponz. It appears to me that this
bill is not a remedy for that. The legal system is the proper remedy for
that particular problem. But the overriding concern for me in spite of
the jobs and stuff that the, that will be supposedly be, be created in
this is overriding the vote of the town council. And it appears to me
the remedy for that is for the people that vote these people into
office. And as a long time county commissioner , I would resent greatly
having the legislature come in and tell me what to do when the people
that put me into that office expect me to use my judgment. So for that
reason, I just can&#39;t accept this. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I, I have a basic point and it is really the same point of Senator
Davis.My fellow members of the State Senate, and note that I addressed
you all as the fellow members of the State Senate. I didn&#39;t call you
all the fellow members of the Durham city council. With all due respect,
Senator Woodard and Mckissick, non of us have served there for the
simple reason that the citizens, the people of Durham have never elected
us to be their city council. We are not the city council of Durham. The,
I remember last session, ya&#39;ll came in, all fired up about
annexation reform. Concept...

  <p>Annexation reform was. My goodness, you can’t have people in a city,
through their elected representatives, encroach on people outside that
jurisdiction, without those people having the right to vote, to express
their will as to whether they want that. And you all correct me if I’m
wrong, but I don’t recall there being an exception to that right to have
a referendum because it’s economic development. Because it’s going to
create a lot of jobs. As I recall, there’s a lot of principled arguments
made that we cannot overcome the will of local people. Whether or not
you think this project is a good idea, we are not the Durham City
Council. The people of Durham elect who their representatives are. We
should not take their position. I ask you to ask yourself what are your
principles? And then vote those principles. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Kinnear to what purpose do you
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
Senator has the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I wanted to remind two things
in addition to these points that have made. And the first one is that it
was a circuitous route. It started about whether they were going to
issue water or sewer to a development they didn’t want. And the mayor
may say today that he’s in favor of this, because he’s had his arm
twisted to prevent something worse from happening. I think even anybody
who has heard this circuitous route from the very beginning will realize
this is not what anybody in Durham wants. It’s what the developer wants,
who came to a House member who lives 150 miles away, who only did this
because his buddy that he went to law school was the lawyer for the
developer. This is not a straightforward, this is a wonderful
development with a lot of jobs. And there’s another thing that you’ve
got to keep in mind and that is this is going to further impair the
Jordan Lake, which serves 300,000 people with their drinking water. And
any further development down in Chatham County is going to be further
disadvantaged because of this. Because of the drinking water situation.
And what we have here is not a willing city council or a willing mayor
but a mayor who’s had his arm twisted behind his back because the
developer works through circuitous, I won’t put another word with it but
let’s just say dubious route, to get what he wanted. And I’m thinking of
those people in Chatham County that I represent, who are trying
desperately to protect their water, so that they can develop. So that
Wake County, which is now working its way into Chatham County, can still
have clean water. And we are really jeopardizing all of the development
that comes later, for one developer who’s twisted the arms of the mayor
and gotten our body here to do his will. I urge you to vote not to
concur. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion or debate? Hearing
none, the question before the Senate is concurrence in the House
Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 315. All in favor will vote aye.
All opposed will vote no. There’ll be five seconds allowed for voting.
The clerk will record the vote. [PAUSE] 35 voting in favor, 10 in the
negative, Senate concurs in the Committee House Substitute for Senate
Bill 315. It will remain on the calendar. That brings up Senator Rucho.
Get ready. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Pate, what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To announce conferees.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Senator has the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. President. Senator Berger appoints for Senate Bill 236 Judge
can perform marriage to the following conferees: Senator Apodaca, chair.
Senator Newton and Senator Brunstetter. And for House Bill 417, modify
internal audits, Senator Brock, chair. Senator Tillman, Senator Sucheck

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, the ?? committee has met and decided
that we have way too long to go today to give this award up that easily.
So, Sen.Woodard, I think that we&#39;re going to hang onto it for right
now. I did feel like we the ?? county delegation meeting had broken out
there for a minute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator.

minutes? I think we’re still waiting on an amendment, a tweak to the

vote.

what?
[PAUSE]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] 36 in favor, nine in the negative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Who else do I have? Sen. Nesbitt ?? --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, I was just going to suggest that if
it&#39;s going to be more than around 15 minutes, why don&#39;t we take
enough time so that we can go somewhere and come back? Mr. President,
I&#39;m about had it back here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, why don&#39;t we have mercy on the
Minority Leader and recess till 3:00.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If we have to, so ordered. We recess with stipulations
stated earlier -- reporting messages from the House, conference reports,
bills, anything else --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President --

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Republicans will caucus immediately upon recess.
