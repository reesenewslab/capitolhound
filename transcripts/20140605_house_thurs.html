[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The House will come to order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, I want to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, members of the House, I
want to take a moment just as we begin this session today to remind you
that in 24 hours from now, and actually in 7 hours from now and 70 years
D-Day began.  Seven hours from now it’ll be about 10, 11 o’clock
tonight, and a group of American paratroopers boarded a C-47 and headed
to Normandy. Group known then as the Filthy 13. They later became famous
as the Dirty Dozen. Led by a fella named Jake McNiece, also known as
Jake McNasty. Jake’s still around, I’m happy to say. Not doing so hot.
Most of his comrades are not around. This past week we lost, in fact,
two huge personalities. Last Sunday we lost Mary Soames, Winston
Churchill’s last surviving child. Mary was in uniform in World War II.
In company, not only was she a battery commander for an anti-aircraft
battery, she was also, accompanied her father on his many trips around
the world, trying to bring peace to this world. And last night, I’m
told, Chester Nez went home to God. Chester was the last surviving
original Navajo code talker. Got to know Chester over the last few
years. Quite a character. He loved the Boston Red Socks. Loved baseball.
But loved this nation with every fiber of his body. So, over the next 24
hours, I hope you take a minute now and then to think about all those
guys jumping out of airplanes, or coming over the side of the Higgins
boats as they hit the beaches of Normandy, Utah, Omaha, Sword, Juno,
Gold. Lots of guys, and thank God for them, ‘cause that’s how we’re here
today.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to make a motion
that we concur with Senate Committee Substitute for House Bill 230.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to state his motion and to
debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, you have before you a
concurrence from the Senate related to the Read to Achieve bill passed
last year. Read to Achieve has had broad bi-partisan support. Governors
like former Governor Hunt, Governor Jeb Bush and others, was passed just
requiring what we know to be good for students to be able to read by the
end of third grade. In the implementation of that process, there are
always needed RTA changes.</p>

<p id="010:00">
Some of which have happened in other states. Some of which you see
before you. This implementation is always imperfect. I imagine that many
of you have received emails like I have and let me run through very
briefly some of the clarifying changes that this bill makes. First is
provides flexibility for local LEAs. It actually allows LEAs to use some
of their own assessments. It also provides with respect to the summer
reading camps many of you have received emails or heard from your
superintendents that the time window for the reading camps was not
ideal. It actually provides that the 72 hours can be integrated as the
LEAs see fit as long as it’s over a three week period. At least a three
week period. It can be longer than that. It also provides for
alternative for student reading portfolios to allow for broader reading
portfolios than presently allowed. It also creates broader exemptions
for students with IEPs which has been probably a number of you have
received emails from parents concerned about their IEPs. Lastly the
proposed substitute proposed concurrence provides for a recalculation of
the A through F performance grades from a ten point scale to a fifteen
point scale. There are a lot of technical issues in the amendments that
you see before you.  I’ve sat and talked with folks about a number of
scenarios. You may have questions and Mr. Speaker in that regard I’d ask
to have staff available with me for questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff will be available.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the motion
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much Mr. Speaker. And so I feel a little bit like Paul
Harvey used to say and now for the rest of the story. I agree with
exactly what Representative Bryan said. I think actually the bill is the
starting point to do a good job or starting job of dealing with a rushed
provision that was in budget last year that has caused enormous problems
in the school system for third graders, third grade parents, third grade
teachers and I think so I don’t disagree with anything that’s in the
bill. The problem is that is does very little to deal with the clear
problems that we got all the phone calls on and all the messages on.
All we’re going to do is get them from the next set of parents if we
concur because there’s some things we can do that doesn’t change the
program and actually still keeps the program whether we agree with it or
disagree with it that if we didn’t concur in conference that we might
could get in.  So while this does some things of moving from six weeks
to three on the camp and creates a better definition for EC kids with
regard extend to now that extend to was no longer available. I agree
with that. Here’s what it doesn’t do. So for the portfolio for all those
kids who are in under the portfolio with regard to the number of
assessments all of you know that there are 12 standards. It requires
three tests to pass so you essentially have this 36 tests mode going. So
one thing could be simply to reduce that students only have to pass from
3 to 2. That would reduce the number of tests that were available. A
second thing we could do would say if a student gets an 80 or a 90 out
of a 100 on one of those assessments for a standard maybe what we ought
to do is say they don’t need to take the other test. They passed the
standard and let’s move on. Instead of saying you can get a 100 or 90 or
80 on that first assessment but you still got to take if you’re doing
that portfolio the second and the third so you know the standard. That
doesn’t make any sense to me. We don’t do that in any other part of
their schooling and why do we want to do that here so there’s ways to
reduce the testing regime that might be available. Third, a big
communications problem. So last year parents weren’t informed about what
was really required. As you know from your email and my email districts
were doing different things and saying different things. No consistent
message was being put out. This has a provision in it that principals
shall communicate what’s going on in the regime to their parents. That’s
great but it doesn’t say when. We ought to tell them that at least
within the first</p>

<p id="015:00">
The first thirty or forty-five days of school, you got to do this, so
parents know what’s coming. You can’t be telling them in January or
February what’s happening. So it’s a minor change, but it’s a big change
in terms of making sure we get the info out and get the complaints
handled early rather than have what happened this past year. Fourth,
let’s assume that you have a student who isn’t. The teacher knows, the
parents know, and sadly the child knows, they’re not going to pass this
assessment, these standards. They, they can’t. It’s just, they’re not
going to. This bill doesn’t change the fact that the system is still
required to put him through the test. Put him through the standards. And
so, instead, why not have a provision in there that says, you know, at
some point the teacher’s judgment and consultation with the parents
would be, if they are not going to pass it, why hurt the child, deflate
the child even more by making them try the test and standards. Let the
teacher and the parents combined allow them to exempt out and go
straight to the reading camps. We know that’s what’s going to happen
anyway, and that way we are not hurting the kid. It seems to me, doesn’t
change the program but is an easy fix that could be in there, and there
are several others that I think that people could talk about including
what the parental responsibility is here. All of those could be fixed in
a conference committee pretty quickly assuming there is an agreement to
do it. At a minimum, we ought to talk about it. And I guess my last
point is, it’s pretty substantive issue. Never this comeback, this
provision, this whole bill is on the calendar. It hasn’t gone back to
education. We’d never talked about it. There’s been no discussion of it.
That’s not fair to the parents. That’s not fair to the kids. It’s not
fair to what’s happening because this is a pretty big issue, and I would
suggest at a minimum we ought to have at least heard this in education.
Maybe we could’ve worked some of this out. I think we at least owe it to
ourselves to conference until next week. There is some exigency to the
bill, I know, with regarding the reading camps, but it isn’t going to
change over the weekend, and Lord knows we are doing everything else
over the weekend. So it would strike me that we should not concur
conference and come back in next week with a conference report. So I
would oppose the motion. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Lucas, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the
motion.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Speaker. I, too, feel that we should not
concur on this motion. The reason is that we all agree that students
ought to read proficiently and efficiently by third grade, and we can
get this done. We just simply need to do it very carefully and with
deliberate speed. We do have conference imminently approaching us. There
are some tweaks in place here that will make this a much more efficient
bill. The notice to parents ought to be specific. Parents ought to know
early on in the school year. You can’t wait until it’s too late to
rectify the deficiencies if you really want to make a difference as to
whether the students pass or fail. So that’s easy for us to put into the
legislation as I see it. So why not? Let’s not concur. Let’s place this
in conference and get it right. I urge us not to concur at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Myer, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I arise to speak on the motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, before
joining you for this short session, I spent my last sixteen years
working  in the public schools, and my wife is, in fact, today, spending
her day at her elementary school working on assessment of third graders
as part of this program. I would like to speak against the motion
because I believe that this bill is based on legislation that hasn’t
been fully debated by this House and deserves to be heard in full and
committee before we make a decision on what to do. There are important
changes that are introduced in the legislation before us today, but they
don’t address three fundamental problems with the Read to Achieve Law.
The first is the retention of third graders. We all know that students
who don’t read by the time they get to the end of third grade are more
likely to drop out of high school, but what you may not know is that
students who are retained once have a fifty percent chance fifty percent
chance of dropping out later on, and students who have been retained
once in elementary school are more likely to be retained a second time
later in their educational career. If you’re retained twice, you have a
ninety percent chance likelihood of dropping out. In elementary school
there are many alternative ways to helping students learn to read
besides putting the punishment of retention on them. The second
fundamental problem is that</p>

<p id="020:00">
I mean it's not really a partnership if we are-- if there are-- I hear
representative, her concerns,  why is it $250,000?
[change of speaker] That's excellent question. The requirement that came
out of the edge committee was actually a ten million dollar threshold
before the contract got entered into. That's a high bar for-- really no
knowledge of whether it's going to actually get achieved in a timely
fashion to be effective. And so what we did, before contract could get
entered into, they have to raise a quarter million dollars.  There is an
annual fundraiser requirement in the first year, that quarter million
plus a million, and then annual fundraiser requirements of 1.25 million
dollars a year over a five year contract period. And so the fundraiser
requirement is basically going to be spread out over a fiver period,
instead of a ten million dollars before you ever enter into the
contract, its 6 million dollars over a five year period, which is more
reproducible. And from a public funds perspective, I think that this
entity is going to operate so efficiently, that I think that there's
going to be less public fund obligation, an this is my personal opinion
and this is based on conversations with the secretary, but-- just
because the Department of Commerce gets funded at a certain level today,
doesn't mean that entire amount of funding is going to be passed through
to the public-private partnership. That's the goal, is to de-obligate
the state from public funds and we're allowing this partnership to do
things in a more efficient way without having additional public funds
extended.
[change of speaker] The question before the house is the passage of the
House Committee Substitute to  House Bill 1031, as amended on its second
reading.  All in favor vote I, all opposed vote no, the court will open
the vote.
The court a-lot machine record the vote 73 having voted the in the
affirmative, 41 in the negative. The House Committee substitute to House
Bill 1031 as amended is past its second reading and without objection.
[change of speaker] Objection
[change of speaker] Objection having been raised, the bill will be
ordered and grossed and place on the calender for June 10.
Representative Warren, please state your purpose.
[change of speaker] Mr. speaker sometimes it takes me a few minutes  to
process things like amendments, and after having given it some thought
I'd like to have my vote changed on the Glacier amendment 2 and I.
[change of speaker] The gentlemen will be recorded as having voted I on
the Glazier Amendment.  Ladies and gentlemen for your planning purposes
next week Monday will be a no-vote session--skeleton session at four PM.
Tuesday we anticipate session being at four PM, and we do anticipate a
calender to dispose of.  Wednesday we will come in at eight AM but
purely to gavel and to recess so that we can do re-referral of bills, I
believe at that time we will have to do referral from appropriations to
finance and back. And then on Thursday is everybody's favorite day, it's
the day that we take up the budget, we will begin at noon. And for your
planning purposes just give this thought, depending upon how long that
process goes, it normally goes eight or nine hours, we will determine
whether or not we would prefer to stay over since its a two day bill and
vote on midnight so that you can move on early on Friday morning, or
come back early in the morning for the vote. And we will discuss that
sometime on Thursday as the debate goes on. So again, four on Monday,
no-vote, four on Tuesday, there will be votes, eight AM on Tuesday,
there will be no votes when we gavel and it will come later in the day,
if at all, and then 12 noon on Thursday. Notices and announcements,
Representative Holloway please state your purpose.
[change of speaker] For point of personal privilege.
[change of speaker] The gentleman has [??] the House for a point of
personal privilege, the House has come to order.
[change of speaker] Thank you Mr. Speaker, I'm wanting to extend some
birthday wishes to an individual that I come into the legislature with
back in 2005. I've got a lot of respect for this individual and have
always considered him a mentor. And after that ag-affair thing I thought
about being a little bit mean to him, but then I realized that usually
pay-back is threefold so I decided I better just stay nice. But you will

Created the largest exodus of talented teachers in the history of our
state. We should vote not to concur. We should vote no on this motion to
occur, go back to conference committee, and begin to have an honest
discussion at that level. We need to begin to set our goals based on the
reality that we know exists. We can do this and we need to take a stand.
We need to risk taking a stand on this. Please vote no on this motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brandon, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the bill sponsor a question, please. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Does Representative Bryant?  [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bryant, I
have a question about how we're funding this. It seems from what I'm
reading that either the parent can be assessed the fee or the local LEA
can charge a fee. Is that what I'm understanding that, that we are not
providing any money to provide for the summer camps. Is that what I'm
understanding or am I not understanding that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No,
that's not correct. That is just with respect to students who actually
do not qualify for the summer reading camp by actually not passing the
test. The summer reading camp is paid for for students who do not pass.
They go to summer reading camp, paid for with GA moneys. The students
who would like to go to summer reading camp but who have actually passed
the test, maybe they were not very far above the pass and feel like the
summer reading would be helpful to their child, the LEA can charge a fee
for those students. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does
the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Are
you saying that a kindergartener or a first grader who might be
deficient but does not qualify in the third grade may enter into a
summer reading camp even though they're not at the third grade level but
we understand they are not being proficient at first grade. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] It's only for third graders. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That's all.
That's my question, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Ellmore,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Speaker. I urge you to vote to concur for this. And let me
explain why. I have twin sons. Carter and Campbell, and they're in the
third grade and they've been through the bombardment of the assessments.
And really this is not an argument of the bill, this is an argument on
slight technical changes to make things easier as we move forward. I'm a
big believer in local control. These switches allow the locals to have
more flexibility to be able to implement this program. Because you
cannot go to any third grade teacher and ask them do you think that the
children should not be able to read after they get out of the third
grade? They'll say no, they need to be able to read. To my curriculum
coordinator in Alleghany County, one of the smallest counties in the
state. They're going to have 15 kids that qualify for the summer reading
camp. It snows a lot in Allegheny County. So their calendar's running
late. They have the exemption so they have to start school early. These
children will be out of school for approximately three to four days and
then will have to go through the summer camp because we tried dictating
how teachers should teach through this. These corrections, technical
corrections give the flexibility to our local systems to be able to do
what they need to do. If we don't, it's going to be very troublesome for
many of your districts according to their size, according to the number
of kids that don't qualify, so there is urgency to the bill. I
appreciate the arguments of my colleagues on the other side, I really do
because I understand where you're coming from. Right now with this piece
of legislation, this is not the time or place to argue it. That's
something down the road because if we don't do something now, we're
going to have major problems happening in about three weeks. So I urge
you to vote to concur. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the motion a second
time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. And I recognize the
arguments that are being made but I think one has to look at a couple
points. First the bill does have a few good things in, I agree with
that. But Representative Jeter's comment that takes 70% because then I
understand that if it were. But in fact the bill solves about 20% of the
problem. It's about 80% that's still a problem. And so that's the first
point. The second, this idea that there's no guarantee and I fully
understand the comments made by my colleagues who deal more than I do
with their colleagues on the senate side, and their concern. Except that
everyone knows where the signature program is here. We are not leaving
this session in all of the</p>

Should know that, without it some fixed to portions of this bill.
Because there's already a commitment on the senate side to do that. And
we know the blow back that's going to happen yet again if we don't do
some things. I think at some point we owe it to ourselves to send it
back and try to conference. And the worse case scenario is by the middle
of next week they won't sit conferees. They won't get any further, but
this body at least gets to say, we've tried. We  set out the problems.
We've tried to identify the solutions. We've done the best we can. We
can't say that right now. We really can't. We haven't had an education
committee meeting on it. We've haven't tried to send it back. We never
got a full say in this bill to begin with. But that philosophic decision
is done. My concern is over fixing some of the huge testing problems
that exist in the bill and I can't for the life of me see why 5 or 6
days of trying to fix a few more things hurts anyone in this body
anymore. We may end up in exactly the same place, but I am very
confident that the worst that could happen is we end up with this same
bill, we reconsider our decision and pass it. The best that could happen
is that we might actually help parents and kids a little bit more on
some of these testing issues and I again would encourage us not to
concur and to actually try to fix this for a few more days. Thank you.
[SPEAKER] Representative Fulghum, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER] A question for Representative Bryan.
[SPEAKER] Representative Bryan, do you yield?
[SPEAKER] I yield.
[SPEAKER] He yields.
[SPEAKER] Representative Bryan, I would like a clarification. I'm
confused on line 26, section 2 in regards to single piece of evidence
may show mastery of up to 2 standards, while in the next sentence it
says for each benchmark there shall be 3 examples. Is the benchmark and
a standard the same thing or are we talking about different approaches
here. And why would one be tested 3 times on the same subject if the
previous sentence said a single piece of evidence would be sufficient?
[SPEAKER] Thank you Representative Fulghum. The standard is a broader
measure than the benchmark and I think that is, the benchmarks are not
related to actual testing. I think those are just evidentiary pieces
that are below, that relate to the standards.
[SPEAKER] Follow up Mr. Chairman
[SPEAKER] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER] I yield.
[SPEAKER] He yields.
[SPEAKER] I'm still confused, but I do agree with the remarks of some of
the other speakers that it seems reasonable to have someone that's
tested high on a standard or on a benchmark or whatever we're talking
about. I think kids probably know when they're doing well and when
they're not doing well, to then be given credit and move onto the next
subject. This series of words here confuse the issue and it seems
difficult here to make sense out of it. Thank you.
[SPEAKER] Further discussion? Further debate? Representative Bryan,
Please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER] To speak to the motion.
[SPEAKER] The gentleman is recognized to speak to the motion a second
time.
[SPEAKER] Thank you. Members I just want to re-iterate where we are in
this process. Read-to-Achieve is the existing law right now. The senate
passed this concurrence with these changes back to us after going
through their process and some amendments were run which did not pass.
This is where they ended up. We've had conversations with folks on this
senate side about where we are. I think there are in addition to the
time sensitive issues, which are very serious. I spent time on the phone
this morning with the legal counsel at Charlotte‑Mecklenburg, I've
talked with them. They are OK with these changes. From their
prospective, this fixes the bulk of their immediate problems. And what
we have to realize with the immediate Summer camps coming up and as
another representative stated in a very short period of time. And again
there's additional flexibilities provided to the LEAs for testing and a
load of other things in here. So I would have to disagree with
Representative Glazier when he states that only about 20% of the issues
are fixed. For the bulk of students that need this, and when I taught in
inner city Los Angeles for 2 years, a lot of the kids I had from low
income families had very little Summer opportunity to get the reading
they needed. A lot of these kids they need these reading camps. They
need them now and there are.</p>

<p id="035:00">
There are on the margins there are number of kids who fall into various
exemption categories. This bill does not perfectly fix all of those
exemption categories, but it fixes a large number of them, and I think
from the LEA's perspective they consider it a very big improvement from
where we were. There is a time sensitive nature, and we have to get it
passed. If we want we can have a motion to withdraw and have a house,
house education meeting today, but I would recommend we move forward and
vote to approve the motion.
[speaker changes]
Representative Brandon please state your purpose.
[speaker changes]

[speaker changes]
representative Bryan do you yield
[speaker changes]
I yield
[speaker changes]
He yields
[Speaker changes]
I understand it's a time sensitive measure but, if by not going through
the education committee we spent, probably an hour talking about
religion, and schools which probably really doesn't have a comprehensive
factor on education ? maybe because it's clarifying language, but it
seems odd to me that we have such policy that we could really deal with
why is it tomorrow that we have to have this bill done is it gonna
affect the LEA's by tomorrow or next week. I just want to understand why
did this didn't go through the proper process of going through education
committee and letting us vet out some of the things we need. I feel like
there were probably everything that has to take place usually takes
place after July first with the fiscal year. I feel like that if we have
one committee meeting that all the LEA's could adjust by July first ?
July Thirteenth. I may be wrong but I just don't understand why the time
sensitive nature is so quick like by next week.
[speaker changes]
Mr. Speaker you've got the floor, yes sir.
[speaker changes]
I would just say that, I mean summer reading camps are starting as soon
as June eleventh, today is the fifth I mean were on a very tight time
frame for getting this word out to LEA's with respect to the schedule
and with respect to letting various parents who have summer plans know
whether or not their child fits within these exemptions. So I think it
is time sensitive and we need to adopt, move to adopt the resolution.

Of North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard is
recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker
and members of the house. We heard this bill yesterday in the finance
committee and I think there was good debate. There was, we have actually
about five different sections of the bill and I'll try to go through
them each one. We are first of all clarifying the confidentiality clause
of what can be disclosed in the public arena and what cannot. Currently
we do have a lawsuit in the Wake County courts and there is a
preliminary injunction in place that we need to get that clarified just
as quickly as we can in order to be in compliance with the US department
of labor. Section 2, there is the provision that authorizes the division
of motor vehicles to disclose the social security numbers of the
division of employment security in order for them to have the records
that coordinate and they're able to gather the information. The third
provision authorizes the garnishment ?? for the credit card receipts
when there is a current judgment in place, and that is a collection ??
of other entities in state government we're just adding the division of
employment security. It eliminates the available rates of the amount of
weekly benefits, we are changing that. Rephrase that, it does not
eliminate it, we're changing that. In the original bill if you remember,
we had a net minimum number of weeks and maximum number of weeks. It
simply doesn't work the way the original bill was written. It is not a
harmful provision whatsoever but it's just something that needs to be
corrected. And the last piece of information is the correction that the
photo ID is required before benefits are received. And with that, Mr.
Speaker, I would ask for support of the bill and I'll be glad to answer
any questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Waddell, please state
your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To send forth an amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to send forth his amendment. The
clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Waddell moves to amend
the bill on page 7, line 3 through 13 by rewriting the lines to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman of the
house. This amendment is basically geared towards the real unemployment
figures that we have if you look as it says on page 7 lines 7 through
13, you'll see the adjusted rate for 5.5% through 9% and essentially
what this amendment does is compresses that into 1% increments. If you
will look at line 10, more than, there's 17 counties in North Carolina
that have unemployment rates greater than 7.5%. And I'm certainly in one
of those counties in Columbus, Robinson and Blayton. If you will look on
line 10, if you were using the 7.5%, you would be entitled to 17 weeks
of unemployment. The amendment goes back to where we are now at 6.2% and
you would actually be entitled statewide to 13 weeks but this ?? to 17
weeks. Folks, I walk around and talk to people all over the rural areas.
Especially in Southeastern North Carolina. There are not jobs out there.
There are just not jobs out there. We are waiting on the Carolina
comeback in the Southeast. It's not made it here yet. I'm hoping it will
get there, but in the meantime these folks are hurting. They really are.
Think about all those small businesses out there that depend on income
from this unemployment benefit. And I'm sure I have lots of my
colleagues in the house that live in those rural areas.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  The Lady has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I regret having to stand
and speak against my friend's Amendment, but let me tell you what the
consequences of this simple Amendment would really mean in reality. That
will extend the debt for another full year, which puts our FUTA tax back
in jeopardy and it also means the the surtax would continue to be paid
by your employers. If you remember, when we originally had this Bill, we
set a pace for the repayment of the 2.7 billion dollar debt, and that
debt will be retired next July, and also we  will have the money in our
fund to pay the benefits. So we will never be in the crisis that we've
been in. I respect the efforts of Representative Waddell, but I would
ask you to please vote no against this Amendment.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Representative Luebke, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: To speak on the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: The Gentleman is recognized to speak on the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, this
Bill, first of all, there was an  attempt to improve it by my colleague
Representative Waddell. He knows from his constituency, from his
district, the seriousness of unemployment there. Many of you know also
in your district how bad the unemployment is, and the logic of this bill
is wrong in that it requires workers in the areas in which there are few
jobs to use a number that is based on the statewide rate, thereby
keeping their unemployment compensation low. Too low. That is a major
problem in the Bill that could have been addressed, and I regret that it
has not. The other point about the Bill is that it continues to hurt the
unemployed of the state in the way that House bill 4 did last February.
It reduces for the unemployed across the state the number of weeks for
which they can collect unemployment. Regardless of their situation,
regardless of their efforts to find work, from 26 weeks to 20, and as
Representative Waddell just pointed out that can drop all the way to 12.
This is a situation . . .</p>

…That leads to the working people of the State taking a serious it. So,
the concern many of us had a year ago and I give you just one example
this data from the US Department of Labor, last year before this bill
took effect the typical worker received $301 in a week. Now, last month
that has dropped to $227. Friends you are heard the working people of
the State by dropping their income from $301 to $227, you are also heard
the local economy because when people have $227 instead of $301 per
week, they have less to expand___[00:53] to help your local economy. The
bill was not a good bill from the standpoint making no improvements for
the working people of the state and I urge you to vote ‘No’.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Warne please state your purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would like my colleagues to know that when we passed and work on this
bill a year ago the average weekly benefit was $290 and when we pass the
bill we actually tapped and set the new maximum weekly benefit to $350 a
week which would make it the third highest weekly benefit in the South
East. Prior to that the maximum weekly benefit was $535 and about 16% of
the people receiving unemployment at that time formation of the bill
were receiving between $350 and $535 maximum. So, when you look at the
bill taking effect after July 1st and the cap been set at $350 naturally
the average weekly benefit will drop. It’s not reflection of anything
else than that. Also, the number of weeks of benefits will reduce to 21
weeks maximum but it didn’t when it was 26 weeks it didn’t mean any
applicant got 26 weeks. The number of weeks of benefits you received was
based on the individual claim as well as the amount of benefit that they
were receive so it’s a natural evolution right now of the program that
the weekly benefit will drop to $225 when the cap is now $350. It was a
good bill then and it’s a good bill now and I support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hall please state your purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and friends I will just ask that you look at what
we have done to our workers and people we have applied for and this
unemployment benefits or benefits obviously you receive after you pay at
some period of employment. So, these are people we know wanted to work,
had worked and have earned right to these benefits as we setup the
requirements for you to earn those rights. So, we have done several
things over the last few years and we have made it more difficult for
people to qualify, we have reduced the amount they can receive and also
changed the way we count numbers so that it appears that we have less
people out of work, when in fact we know that we haven’t increase jobs
sufficient to cover the number of people who go to work, who are
applying for work and we still have so many people who are trying to
find jobs that aren’t available right now. So, I would ask that you vote
against this bill right now for that reason, if we have changed the
computation that we use, we have reduced the benefits they are gonna
have and it’s not is if the funding that these people receive, these
unemployed receive goes somewhere offshore, these are dollars that get
spent in the community, this support small business, this support
families that are barely hanging on, we know we have a mortgage crises,
we know we have a credit crises, we know we have an unemployment crises
despite some popular ___[04:20] of the contrary. And we need to have
some compassion and try to make some efforts better than this for the
unemployed in our state. So, I would ask that you vote against this
bill, let’s try to come back and do better, there were some suggestions
made today to help not just those in the rural areas of our state but
the unemployed across the state and again there are people who have
proven they want to work, they have worked that’s why they would have
been qualified for the unemployment. So, this myth about, these are
peoples who do not want to work, I think is false and we do a disservice
to our citizens to continue to treat them their way in fact…

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Members of the House. I wasn't going to say
anything, but I think some of the members are using this bill as an
opportunity to rehash last year's House Bill Four. And I would just
point out a few things.  That bill only applied prospectively to newly
unemployed, after last July 1st. It did not change the benefits for
people who were unemployed prior to July 1st of last year. When the bill
passed, if you'll remember, the unemployment rate was around ten
percent. It is now down approaching six percent. There have been tens of
thousands of new jobs. North Carolina is one of the leading states in
the nation for job creation. So, the approach that the majority has
taken would appear to be working. I think you've always gotta be careful
talkin' about cause and effects of employment, but we hope that's gonna
be the case that people will be able to find jobs. Now, the alternative
to have done nothing was, if you'll remember, we had run up a debt of
2.5 billion to the federal government. I'm told that's now down around
just one billion. It's got to be paid back or the FUTA rate on North
Carolina's businesses would go up until that money was repaid. The
federal government was gonna come in with a strong hand and take that
money by taxing employment. It was gonna increase the cost to every
business of hiring someone. Now if you want additional unemployment and
new people to be unemployed and face those harsh realities that some of
you have rightfully discussed, just tax employment higher and you will
get more unemployment. So, the plan appears to be working. This is fine
tuning it and I urge you to vote for the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This amendment, we're dealing with the public,
private partnerships gonna be a non-profit corporation and the Internal
Revenue Code there are limitations not prohibitions on lobbying
activity. And so the correct word in the Internal Revenue Code  that we
need to have mirrored in the bill is &quot;limitations&quot;.
Additionally, the second part of this amendment is a incorrect statutory
reference. Instead of 143 it should be 143-B. And a similar change in
the third part of the amendment changing statutory reference. And then
we're deleting the word &quot;agencies&quot; on page 16 line four, and
listing the agencies out, instead of just referring to the word
&quot;agencies&quot;. We're gonna actually list them out. So, I'd move
adoption of the amendment.

yesterday. What the bill would do would be to establish a joint select
committee on the preservation of biological evidence to review matters
related to the preservation of DNA and biological evidence, including

Bill 1194 a bill to be entitled an act to make changes to the
administration to the state retirement systems. General Assembly of the
state of North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Collins, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To briefly debate
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This bill looks rather lengthy and looks like it
has a lot of changes but as you know we have several retirement plans
under the state and local government retirement plans, so a lot of these
are repetitive, same change made for the different retirement plans. I
think I can narrow this down to seven changes in the entire bill. On
page 2, there is simply a definition of when a particular benefit
accrues to the state retirement participant, so that's no longer vague.
And that same change is repeated on page 4 for a different part of the
plan. On page 5, defined a limited penalty on an employer for not
remitting contributions in a timely basis. This is repeated on page 6 as
well for a different retirement plan. Page 9, there's a process defined
for paying a death benefit for a deceased retirement plan member and
this is repeated on page 10, page 13 and page 14 if you want to read it
four times. On page 15, there's a limited, the board of trustees on page
15 is required to publish an annual report on supplemental insurance
offerings that are offered to retirement plan members and participation.
This is an additional reporting requirement. On page 15 also, there's a
clarification of what happens if a former spouse dies while receiving a
member's benefit under, the lawyers can correct me if I'm wrong, but I
think this is a quadri qualified domestics order. On page 16 there's
limited immunity for two boards. If you read that carefully though, it
doesn't make them immune for any kind of malfeasance that they purposely
were doing. And there's on page 16, we simply pushed back the sunset of
the qualified excess benefit arrangement from 2015 to 2017. I've just
enumerated to you every change in this bill, be happy to answer any
questions. I'd ask that you support the administrative changes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. If not, the question before
the house is the adoption of House Bill 1194 on its second reading.
Those in favor will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no. The clerk will
open the vote. Clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. 116

has passed its second reading and without objection will be read a third
time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. Representative
Brawley, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask
Representative Collins a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Collins, do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He
yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins, in the section that
changes or sets up the death benefit, is there anything in there that
would change a retiree's designation, when they retire they select how
they want to draw out their annuity. Is there anything in there that
would change that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] And I think, is David Vanderweine
here by chance? In reading through it, David you can correct me if I'm
wrong, the only thing it does is basically give you a default
arrangement for if you've named a beneficiary it goes there. If you
haven't it goes to this person, kind of like any pension plan does.
Isn't that correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate. If not, the question before the
House is the passage of House Bill 1194 in its third reading. Those in
favor will say aye. Those opposed will say no. The ayes have it. And
House Bill 1194 has passed its third reading, will be enrolled and sent

<p id="075:00">
Weeks ago, when we took up the omnibus tax bill. Representative Pierce
stood up on the floor and brought to our attention the need to possibly
exempt admission to agricultural fairs in our state. Myself and
Representatives Dixon and Dobson also had that concern, along with many
other members. And we do appreciate Representative Howard keeping her
word and doing exactly what she said, that we would get the bill through
finance and bring it back to you. It's here before you. And we believe
that this would take care of our small fairs, that all the fairs in
fact, but particularly for rural counties that come through once a year,
letting many children and seniors in for free and give them an
educational opportunity to see potentially farm animals and things that
they may not come into contact with on a daily basis. But this is the
bill that was promised, and I'd be glad to take any questions. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Carney, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized
to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and ladies
and gentlemen of the house. I'm rising to support this. But without
trepidation and I'm going to tell you why. I've served on revenue laws,
and I've served on a subcommittee that looked at this very issue of
these exemptions. They originally had five bullets, events at elementary
and secondary schools in the big bill you passed, the tax law changes,
agricultural fairs, youth sporting events, state attractions, limited
non profit events. The subcommittee took all that under consideration
and you can imagine that within our discussion and I do commend
Representative Howard for leadership and allowing this discussion to go
its full length within the committee and the subcommittee. On our our
arts, our culture, our non-profit arts cultural and historic
organizations. Under cultural, it picked up the zoo, the symphony,
aquariums and a lot of other non-profit entities. Well these groups
said, look, if you're, the subcommittee came out and make a couple of
exemptions and we narrowed it down, I want to make sure I have this
right. We narrowed it down to, we took out agricultural fairs up to two
activities a year sponsored by a non-profit that did not employ people
in state attractions. Those were the three that we excluded. Now what I
bring you to my trepidation about is, all of those groups came together
and said, okay, if you're going to exempt all of us, then do all of us.
And we won't push this. So that was the fairness of doing that. However,
they still wanted their exemption. They still do. And today, I'm going
to support this bill because I believe that this should have the
exemption. I believe that the non-profits in this state should have that
exemption. I'm going to give you an example of what we're doing here,
not opening this up to our non-profits, arts groups, cultural and
historic organizations. If a county fair has got an aquarium for their
attraction, when we pass this, they are going to be exempt from charging
sales tax at the gate. But then an arts group in another part of the
state may say, we're going to host a big fund raiser and we've got ??
coming to the event. So everybody's going to pay their big ticket to go
to that fund raiser and they're going to pay a sales tax on it. So I
think there's a problem that we really need to debate as a full body. So
I'm going to, and I want you to think about that over the weekend, I'm
going to support this bill today, and I'm going to object to third
reading and I'm going to bring back an amendment on Monday night. That
we can have that discussion around. And I would ask that you think about
this over the weekend. Think about the calls you had before on the
non-profits losing their exemptions and their status. There are a lot of
these community groups that they really depend on their ticket sales and
some of them I've heard from, and by the way I've already started
hearing from them</p>

<p id="080:00">
Some of 'em don't make enough on their ticket sales to probably cover
their tax that they've gotta pay their sales tax. So, then they're gonna
have to dip into their contributions to pay that. It's a bigger, bigger
issue than just sayin', &quot;You all go take care of your tickets. You
pay your sales tax.&quot; But we're starting here today by sayin' the
county fairs, we should exempt them. And I agree, so I'm going to
support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Last year, members, we had a tax reform bill, lower rates [?] etcetera.
This is 400 thousand, next week we get to decide how to spend 21
billion, plus or minus 400 thousand. I'll vote for it if anybody can
actually give me a policy reason why this should be excluded, in
comparison to the others that are not excluded. I can't think of one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Shepard, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a question of the bill sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Holloway, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Holloway, do you know what the difference is in revenue
if we exempt this and what it would be if we exempted all the
non-profits that Representative Carney is talking about?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I can't answer your question completely. I can tell you for this bill
specifically, that it impacts the budget this year with a figure of
zero. And that next year they predict, even though it's very difficult
to predict, because the fairs allow so many people to come in for free,
young kids and seniors, it's about 400 thousand dollars for this bill.
What would the difference be for exempting all non-profits? I could not
answer that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Holloway, I believe that Representative Howard, Chair
Howard has indicated she has the specific answer to that question. If
the gentleman would like to redirect.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will redirect to Chairman Howard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Howard, does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield. Actually, I don't have the exact number, but I can tell you
that it's a large number. And as Representative Stam just spoke so
elegantly about the House Bill 998. This is the beginning of unraveling
that major piece of legislation. And I don't believe that's what we want
to do. Representative Holloway, with great respect and Representative
Pierce agreed to run the bill, because it would have held up 1050 for
three days, three more days, if we had, had the amendment on the floor
last week. And out of respect, I certainly do need to get that bill
movin'. But, this is the beginning of unraveling all of the hard work
that you did last year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor. Representative Lewis, please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank you, ladies and gentlemen of the House.
I want to commend the gentlemen from Stokes. We're all sent up here to
represent the folks back home. I think the intention behind this bill is
to do that. I certainly commend the hard work that he's done. I commend
the honorable way in which he's brought this matter before us. I also
want to echo much of what the lady from Mecklenburg said. This is indeed
an issue of treating the same things the same way across the board. And
I'll echo what the distinguished lady from Davie just said. This is the
first step in starting to treat the same things differently. You've
already heard a pledge from the distinguished member from Mecklenburg
that there will be an amendment to this bill, next week to broaden the
exemptions further. Folks, we did make a commitment that we were going
to treat the same things the same way. This bill goes in the opposite
direction. This bill is well intentioned. Utmost respect for all of the
bill sponsors. Utmost respect for all of you who support the bill today.
Unfortunately, I cannot do that and I'll be voting 'no'. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill.

The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.

<p id="085:00">
I am very sympathetic to what Representative Holloway wants to do
because I've got a fair that's on this list, if you've got one of the
agricultural fairs, and of course they want to be exempt from the sales
tax but so do the symphony, and the zoo, and all the other state
attractions that we have imposed a sales tax on. So we made a policy
decision last year, well we will treat everybody equally and fairly and
no one's treated any better or any worse than anybody else. And so that
was the policy decision we made when we passed tax reform and it was the
only fair way to do it. Now we're coming back and we're beginning to
tilt it and so it becomes a matter of, well who has the clout to get a
special exemption for their special interest? You can't vote for this
bill and then vote against the amendment that Representative Carney
wants to offer on Monday to allow the other non-profits. Now, the
members of my side of the aisle wanted to do tax reform, the goal was
we're gonna lower the personal income tax, we're gonna lower the
corporate income tax. I know that we had the opposition from members on
the other side of the aisle. They didn't agree with that but that was
the policy that we set. Well, when you started lowering the rates how
were you going to pay for it? Well we had to do it by eliminating some
of the special exemptions in the tax code. Now, next week we're going to
be debating a budget in this House and we need more money, not less
money. They say it's only $400,000. Yes, that's right, in a 21 billion
dollar budget that's not a lot of money but do you want it to cut the
teaching assistants? Do you want the school health nurses? Do you, where
do we want to make the cuts? I mean, $400,000 is $400,000 and so, Mr.
Speaker, I'd like to make a motion that we re-refer this bill back to
the Finance Committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has made the-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Back up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
-the motion, duly seconded, Representative Holloway. The motion before
is to re-refer to Finance. The gentleman is recognized to debate the
motion if that is the gentleman's purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, that is it. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, as a young child I remember
getting up on Saturday morning and watching professional wrestling and
one of my favorite wrestlers was the Nature Boy Rick Flair and he had a
little crew, it was called The Four Horsemen and I think The Four
Horsemen have come after me today on the floor of the House. What I'll
point out to you, I have got a lot of respect for the non-profits and I
understand what's been said here today. It won't be whittled or broken
down if we don't allow it and the thing I will tell you that's different
about these little agricultural fairs, again, it's one time a year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Holloway.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The merits of the bill are really not in order at this point. This is a
vote on the motion to re-refer to the committee. The gentleman will
please stay focused in his comments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm trying to and I'm trying to tell them why it's a bad idea to send it
this committee. I don't think, or refer it back. Folks, we didn't seem
to have a big problem with this last week. I don't see what the big deal
is. We've got a tremendous challenge when we go to the Senate to even
deal with this. I just ask that we just keep it here today. If you want
to vote the bill down, vote it down. I'm not afraid to lose the bill
here on the floor of the House but I really believe in this and believe
this is the right thing to do. Let's just keep it here on the floor.
Don't send it to Finance. If you want to vote no, vote no. You won't
hurt my feelings at all but I'm going to vote yes and I hope we'll do
the right thing because these fairs need to stick around and they're a
big, big thing for our small communities, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To be clear, the gentleman will be voting yes on the bill, not the
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You're right. I'm not voting for the motion. I want to-

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Holloway does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield all the questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I appreciate very much my good colleague from ?? I had a question for
you. In the definition it includes commercial agriculture fare and my
question is are there any for profit companies who run fairs who would
be exempt from sales tax. Whether contractors or any other for profit
company involved.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't know that I could answer that. I would have to refer that to one
of the Finance Chair's. I'm an approach guy. I don't know the technical
answer to that and all I'm looking to do is to keep the folks that are
the non profits from having to submit to sales tax from the admissions.
So that's all I'm looking to do. I don't know if I have your answer and
I'd have to defer to one of the finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Wait Mr. Speaker, I believe I have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The chair apologizes. The gentleman didn't realize.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. May I redirect the question or may I follow up with an
additional inquiry?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I redirect? Is there a Finance Chair that would like to answer that
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Howard, does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There's several different makeups Representative Jordan. Some of the non
profits, such as the Lyon's Club, they own a piece of property and they
lease out that piece of property to another entity. So that is a for
profit entity that is leasing the property and sometimes they bring in
the rides and sometimes they have the fifth concessions. There's a whole
makeup of different groups that run these county fairs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much Representative Howard. As a follow up if in that
case if a non profit leases the property to a for profit organization,
the for profit organization would be charging the sales tax on the
admissions as opposed to the concessions at the non profit. Is that
correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's the way it should be but there are lease agreements. It's a whole
bag of different leases and agreements. That's why we struggled with
this Representative Jordan, because there was nothing that was uniform
and consistent. So therefore the subcommittee made the recommendation
that everybody would just be treated the same all across the state.
Therefore the county fairs like the arts, and the Symphony and everybody
would do the admission tax the same.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative. May I have a follow up to the bill sponsor?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Holloway, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield all questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Holloway. Is the state fair one of these
listed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All fairs. Every one of them. State. Every one of them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are there for profit contractors who run the state fair? Who would be
charging the admission and the tax would come out of their for profit
money?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Again I don't know that I can answer that. If you'll let me just look
and.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My inquiry is because we have a commissioner of Agriculture who went to
prison because she was taking money from fair operators so there must be
money involved. So I want to know are these for profit operators?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What I am interested in again, is a small act fairs. The easiest way to
do this was to include them all. Again I don't know that I can answer
your question. You may want to defer again to one of the Finance Chairs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. May I speak on the bill?

<p id="095:00">
I'm very much in favor of our small - thank you, Mr. Speaker - very much
in favor of our small non-profits not having to deal with this issue,
and Ag is an extremely important issue to me. I don't have a fair in my
district, but we have several that we go to that are in and around us.
My concern is that there are for-profit operators who run some of these,
apparently fairs, and I don't know that we should be exempting any
for-profit company from paying a sales tax on an admission. As we've
heard, there may be non-profits who, maybe, lease the property, or
something, they would not be charging sales tax on their concessions.
That would be something we might discuss - I don't think we should do
that. But, the admissions price would be paid for .  .  . the sales tax
would come out of the for-profit company, and I don't think we should
exempt for-profit companies. And, that's where I stand, and I think I
would have to vote against this Bill because it includes that type of
situation. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dixon, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The debated Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Gentlemen recognize the debated Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the Floor, Members of the House, I realize
the sensitivity of this issue, and I certainly realize Representative
Howard talking about the beginning of the dismantling of that. But, let
me put this perspective on it, and let me go back a few years, because
most of these fairs that we are talking about have their historical
origin in relationship to agriculture, and when there is a relationship
to agriculture, obviously the circumstances of farming or farmers are
brought into play. I know that everybody in here today is going to vote
their conscience on exactly how they feel about it. But, let me give you
a perspective from a right good while ago that may provide you with
additional data as you make up your mind how you're going to vote on
this Bill. On September 30, 1859, a few months before he was to become
President of the United States of America, Abraham Lincoln was invited
to open up the Wisconsin State Agricultural Society Fair. Some of his
remarks then may provide interesting perspective for us as we consider
this debate today. He began that - and this is going to be brief - by
saying this, &quot;I presume I am not expected t o employ the time
assigned to me in the mere flattery of farmers as a class. My opinion of
them is that in proportion to numbers, they are neither better nor worse
than other people. In the nature of things, they are more numerous than
any other class, and I believe there really are more attempts
politically flattering them than any other. The reason of which I cannot
perceive, unless it be that they can cast the most votes.&quot; Those
circumstances no longer exist. He went on to say, &quot;But farmers
being the most numerous class, it follows that their interest is the
largest interest. It also follows that that interest is most worthy of
all to be cherished and cultivated.&quot; And then, here is my point:
&quot;that if there be inevitable conflict between that interest,&quot;
- meaning the interest of the farmers or agriculture - &quot;and any
other, that other should yield.&quot; So Representative Lewis, or
whoever said it, I will have no problem in voting for this Bill today
and against Representative Collins' amendment on Monday. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentlemen is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just want to stand up and speak. I think we've had a very, very good
debate. I think everybody know's what they're going to do on this bill.
?? address a concern that Representative Jordan had made. My friends
from the gallery have sent me some text messages to answer it. The thing
that fits with ?? was the rides which is contract, which this bill and
the new tax law in no way impacts. As far as the admission, so that is
not for profit at all. Those are the folks that the non profits who run
that that's taking them out of having to send the state's sales tax. So
there's no for profit folks that are going to be impacted at all.
But with that being said, vote your conscious. Do what you think. I like
rule fairs. I want to keep them going. I don't want to have to tell all
the school kids and stuff that get so excited about getting the free
fare tickets that it won't be there for you. So I hope we'll move this
on to the Senate. With that I'd like to make a motion Mr. Speaker.

Thank you Mr. Speaker. I'll be brief. You've heard the title of the bill

this is an effort to continue to cut down on calls by cutting down on
hard copies that will be printed ?? these decisions still sending them
to, for example, the Chief Justice, the Justices of Spring Court's Court
of Appeals, and to each counties Clerk of Court. But we'll just make
sure that there's an electronic version available, otherwise, that folks
can still purchase if it need be so we would encourage your support of

amendment that would simply restrict the hardworking taxpayer's money
from being used in severance payments. It's my belief and I think that
many of you will probably share this belief, that if the leadership of

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, when we debated Senate Bill 127 on this house
floor in the long session, we addressed public records in that
legislation, I’m gonna address the changes that have been made as a
result and why they were made? The non-profit corporations ___[02:15]
economic development for the state of North Carolina under the bill
before you which Representative Farmer Butterfield seeks to amend this
entire section out of the bill would require that once public funds are
obligated any conversation that is being head by this private non-profit
corporation, once public funds are obligated then the public records
would be subject to the Public Records Act. Projects submitted to the
Department of Commerce or consideration of discretionary incentives in
which funds are either not awarded or not accepted only the briefing
memo that this non-profit corporation prepares to the Department of
Commerce would be subject to public records and disclosure. So, one of
the number one complaints that you hear from your Economic Developers
back home is that, “I can’t have free flowing conversations with these
private sector entities but with fear of public disclosure and it alters
the competitive balance between our state and other states.” This is the
one of the number one complaints that you hear from the economic
developer folks and if once public funds are obligated all the materials
will become public that’s the really line of demarcation that we are
talking about here. If public funds are never obligated then it’s a
private conversation. So, that’s why I ask you to vote against this
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Grier Martin please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks very much Mr. Speaker. My friend from Wake County, Representative
Murry  has I think correctly identified one of the tensions that’s
inherent to the economic development process, when something should be
provided private in order to facilitate the kind of discussions that
must take place in order to do this kind of work but when the public
interest to know finally outlays that and that information becomes
public that’s something under our current system of economic development
North Carolina has dealt with this over the decades. I think most folks
will not say that the balance that we have right now is perfect but it’s
something that has work certainly the public and the press is abdicating
for greater transparency in those who is my friend from Wake County
said, “We have to actually do the work behind the scenes initially to
get the real done might abdicate for more.” That’s happen before that’s
always gonna have as long as we are doing this work, right. Now, there
is a good debate to be had on whether we should or should not move
towards a more private model for economic development and will have that
debate on this bill but what I would like to think is not out for debate
that if we are gonna move to a greater law for the private sector and
economic development…

through 45 by rewriting the lines to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. First of all, I'd like to say that I have
nothing really at all against public-private partnerships. And I think
it's a good thing that the state is looking at this. There are a lot of
things that we can't do in the state government. But then we are not and
cannot go straight to the private-partnership piece of this and do
everything as private entity either because we are stewards of the
state's money. And what I'm trying to say on this bill is that this bill
allows for any officer, employee, or board member to earn $120,000 of
tax payers' money in an annual salary. Which will and can be
supplemented with non-profit money from the private funds. My amendment
reduces the amount of the tax payers' funds to $85,000 for the officer
and $60,000 for the employees. At a time where we are talking about
teachers' salaries, it just doesn't look for the state to do this. Also,
probably the most shocking portion of this bill, is that it allocates
$120,000 annually salaries for 17 board members and these board members
are made up of politically appointees. Now, this can lead to, if 17
people receive this salary, this is two million dollars. I'd rather see
this two million dollars actually spent in bringing businesses to North
Carolina than to pay political appointtees to sit on a board. Now, most
non-profits I know, the board members are not paid. And they do it
because it's in the best interests of the for non-profit. And I hope
that anyone that sits on this board will feel the same. So, I object to
this portion of the bill, and that's why I'm trying to say that no state
funds can be allotted for any board member on this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion. Representative Murry, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, I would ask that you would oppose this amendment. There is a
limitation in the bill on the amount of public funds that can be used on
salaries. And this would further limit the amount of salaries, lower the
public funds. And this, at the end of the day, when you're talking about
a public-private partnership, you gotta have a balance between public
dollars and private dollars. And this would hamper the ability of the
public-private partnership to hire qualified individuals. And it would
further restrict the amount of private sector dollars that are raised to
be used on economic development activities. We would have more of the
private sector dollars consumed with salaries, versus going to the
direct marketing of this state to recruit businesses to do business and
expand in this state. So, I would ask that you oppose the amendment.

... suggested that we need to strike a balance, so are you suggesting
that the balance means that thee employees should be compensated at a
rate up to 240 thousand dollars, since that would be a balance between
public and private? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s not what the bill says.
That misconstrues the entire legislation. What I’m saying is that we
should pay fair market value for employees, and the public sector should
be limited on the amount of investment in this partnership, and so I
expect what you’ll see is you’ll have fewer employees doing more work at
a higher compensation rate and be having more production as a result of
this public-private partnership, and that’s why we’re limiting the
amount of public funds being expended on salaries. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, Mr. Speaker? [SPEAKER CHANGES] does the gentleman yield to a
follow-up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Am I correct though in understanding that the
language of the bill, that the cap on public funds, there’s not also… am
I correct that there’s not also a cap on total salary? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The cap is 120 thousand dollars, and where there’s not a cap but where
the real compensation conversation comes in is the overall employment
performance bonus pool, and so a significant amount of performance
compensation is going to come likely from performance bonuses. That’s
how the private sector operates. The way. We don’t have bonuses for
well-performing secretaries in our public sector, and so this is
standard operating procedure in the private sector to have
performance-based compensation. That’s where the over 120 thousand
dollars would come in for a compensation perspective, and that would be
private sector dollars for bonuses. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative

moves to amend the bill on page 4, line 47 by rewriting the line to
read… [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Members,
my amendment simply actually takes the language of the bill to exactly
what the recommendation was coming out of the committee. The Economic
Development and Global Engagement Committee used this language, and
actually as the bill was filed had this language, and what it
specifically does it make sure that any board member, any employee, any
member of this new nonprofit corporation has to comply with the State
Ethics Act, and I say that for a number of reasons. Although there’s a
conflicts provision in the bill, and although we have other provisions
in the bill, it is a lesser standard of state ethics. This simply puts
in the same robust standard of ethics that we apply to everybody else,
and particularly makes sure that we live up to our transparency and
reporting requirements. I think that becomes all the more true when
we’re using specific taxpayer money on the corporation, and as well,
they’re doing public business. So regardless of whether you agree or
disagree with the philosophy of the bill, that’s really not at issue
here. What is at issue is that we live up to our ethics requirements and
that we make everybody else live up to. And as I suggested, it’s exactly
the language that came out of the committee, and exactly the language in
the bill that was as it was originally filed, and I move adoption. Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Gill, please state your purpose.

?? The vote stands. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Murray, please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Last year on the house floor when we debated the public private
partnership, the Senate Bill 127 had the same language we're talking
about today from a conflict of interest perspective. I will remind
everyone that bill passed in a bipartisan basis 77-38 on the second
reading and 86-27 on the third reading. We've expanded the ethics policy
and the conflict of interest policy in this language not just to include
the board but we're also including an ethics policy, a conflict of
interest policy, gift ban to cover board members, officers and
employees. Everybody knows what the golden leaf foundation is. The
golden leaf is not subject to state ethics act. And so I would make an
analogy to the golden leaf foundation from an economic development
perspective to what we're trying to set up here. And so that's a private
sector acting type entity and that's what we're trying to operate here.
Conflict of interest policies, ethics policies and gift bans operate in
the private sector and that's what we're trying to emulate here and I'd
ask members to oppose the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Langdon please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] On the motion I hit
the wrong button and I'd like to change my vote to yes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman will be recorded as having voted aye on the
motion to table. Representative Bumgardner please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker I did the same thing. I was in the back of
the room discussing another matter and I voted the wrong way on that
motion. I hit the red button and I wanted to hit green. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman will be recorded as voting aye on the motion to
table. Representative Glazier, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To debate the motion a second time please. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm sorry Mr. Speaker, thank you. Members, I would listen to
Representative Murray and I appreciate his point but it says nothing to
the merit of this. The conflicts provisions are one thing. The ethics
rules of the state have more than conflicts provisions in them and
contain specific and important transparency and reporting requirements.
Representative Murray suggests that we ought to emulate Golden Leaf. I
would suggest given some of the issues that have occurred recently,
that's probably not the best example I'd have put on the House floor
about ethics provisions and how we look at transparency and reporting
requirements. And so all this does is go back to exactly the
recommendation that the committee had that came out with as this bill
was filed. So clearly the committee in a bipartisan way thought this was
an appropriate ethics standard. It is a more robust ethics standard than
what is in this bill, and if everybody is aware again, regardless of how
you are on the model, the problems the model has had in other states
where there have been problems have precisely been because the ethics
rules weren't robust enough and everybody gets caught later with it. So
this is really a preventive measure and while it may not be fun to
follow the ethics rules, we certainly ought to make sure that this body
does that from the beginning. Again I urge adoption of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Grier Martin, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]The
gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Folks
as I said in an earlier debate on another amendment, there may be a
right way to do public private and there may be a wrong way. If we do it
the right way, ideally down the road a decade or so from now we might be
able to look back and say we did something right, we put in appropriate
safeguards and this was a good thing for the people of North Carolina.
I'm starting to fear though that instead sometime in the next decade,
we've got a front page above the fold newspaper investigative reporter
headline on what went wrong with the changes that North Carolina made to
its economic development. If you don't vote for this amendment, I think
you are increasing the likelihood of that bad headline happening. Think
about some of the scandals that have hit North Carolina in the past. If
you choose to not have our ethics rules apply, you're making it much
more likely that you're a cause of one of those headlines. I urge you to
support this amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hamilton,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of this
amendment and I'll tell you why. Over the next five years, this public
private partnership or so it's called, is only required to raise close
to six million dollars in order</p>

<p id="130:00">
The contract remain in place. That means if my numbers are correct, it's
only about 6% of the total amount of money that the organization could
receive over the next five years. That means 94% of the funding
associated with this quote public private partnership will be from
taxpayer dollars. For that reason, I think that they should be subject
to the same ethics requirements that the rest of us in this room are. I
urge your adoption of the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Murray please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the
amendment a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized
to debate the amendment a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This would
create a standard for an employee higher than any other state employee
in the state of North Carolina. There are employees that deal with
public private partnerships and give out millions of dollars of
contracts, of DOT contracts that are not subject to the state ethics
act. I would ask that you oppose this amendment because we're going to
run off private sector people from helping us move North Carolina
forward from an economic development perspective, if we have a barrier
so high that they just say it's not worth the juice isn't worth the
squeeze, I'm not going to get involved in this public private
partnership to help move North Carolina forward. We need this public
private partnership to move at the speed of business, not at the speed
of government. I would ask that you oppose this amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Collins, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To see if Representative Glazier would be available for a
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, does the gentleman
yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Glazier, I'm not an expert on the general statutes so I just needed to
get a little bit of clarification. It looks to me that we're saying two
different things here. That we're saying all employees of this operation
would be subject to I guess GS138 A3 and then all of them above a
certain pay level would be subject to 138 A22 or something. Could you
explain the difference? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly, and a good
question, Representative Collins. So the first part simply says that all
the employees and directors are subject to the state ethics act. The
second part exempts any employee making less than $60,000 the
requirement that they have to file the state ethics form, so that we are
consistent. The requirement ought not be that maintenance folks and
clerical workers have to file the reporting form. And so it exempts them
and is really getting at the higher paid folks which is pretty standard.
And that was deliberately put in there in order to make sure that
everybody doesn't have to fill out the form to be a clerical worker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just have one follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman yields? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm not, again, I know what we have to do and
I'm not much of an expert on the rest of the state. Is this something
that all state employees do, DOT and DOC workers and all that kind of?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There are certainly some exemptions but on the whole,
state employees are required to comply just as any other public servant.
Public servants are required to comply with state ethics act
requirements. And that's all this does. We exempt all lesser employees
in terms of salary from having to file the reporting requirements which
is obviously something we still have to do. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Shepherd, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr. Speaker, before on the motion to table, I voted no and I should
have voted yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman will have been recorded
as voting aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on
the amendment. If not, the question before the house is the passage of
the amendment, sent forth by Representative Glazier for the House
Committee Substitute to House Bill 1031. All in favor vote aye. All
opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will let the
machine record the vote. 63 having voted affirmative, 52 in the
negative. The amendment passes. Representative Murray, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill as amended. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We had a robust debate on this
bill when it was originally filed as senate bill 127. I want to go
through some of the changes that this bill has with regards to certain
items. Senate bill 127 did not have any minimum fund raising
requirements for this public private partnership and so this bill, this
legislation would require before a contract is entered into with the
state, with this public private partnership to raise at least a quarter
million dollars of seed funding and there's additionally this public
private partnership would be required</p>

<p id="135:00">
. . . have to raise at least 1.25 million dollars a year over five
years, so it's a 6 million dollar requirement as part of the contract
obligations in order to meet performance. That's a new change from
Senate Bill 127 from last year. Additionally, there are baseline
performance measures that are outlined in this legislation, and that's a
new requirement, as well. It's more expanded so we're going to be able
to analyze how this public-private partnership is operating with State
funds, with private sector funds, and how . . . and whether it works,
whether it's something that's benefiting the State of North Carolina. I
would additionally point out that there is a Public Accountability and
Standards Committee for this ?? development partnership that's comprised
of four secretaries and three appointees from the Legislature to help
make sure that the contract that is entered into between the State and
this private entity, that the contract is being met. I think we've got
great additions that are made by folks in the forward good debate, I
think we made this bill better on the House Floor today. It's a clean
bill, and I would ask your support, and ask you to go back home and talk
to your ?? developers on how this is going to improve their operations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Meyer, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the sponsor a question, and then to speak on
the bill.
SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Murry, does the Gentleman yield?
SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Murry, we currently have an Economic
Development Board that advises the Governor, are the members of that
boards paid a salary?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] They're not paid a salary. The intention of this
board, and I think we're working on an amendment to clarify. The
intention of this legislation is not to have the board receive
compensation. It's a non-compensatable board. I understand why . . . I
could see how you could read the legislation and see that but that's not
how boards operate. Any of the boards on the economic . . . I am on the
Governor's Economic Development Board, and so I can assure you that it's
not a compensatable activity that I've been involved with, helping the
Governor, helping develop the Governor's economic development policy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the Gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does this legislation allow for compensation to be
paid for the board members of this new public-private partnership?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's not how I read the legislation. We are, I
think, we are working on an amendment to clarify that, but I don't read
this legislation as having a board that receives compensation. The
intention of this legislation is to make sure the employees are
compensated, to limit the amount of public funds that go to that
compensation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm concerned that this public-private partnership is
far too private and not public enough. This takes public functions that
are currently served by members of the Department of Commerce and turns
them over to the private sector. Commerce already utilizes many
public-private partnerships, and to great good for the State of North
Carolina. The Department of Commerce represents the entire State and
works on building economic development in every area of the State,
including the low-wealth areas of the State. Opening up this
public-private partnership gives us, as a Legislature, much less ability
to impact economic development across the entire State, and comes too
close to letting the fox into the hen house. What concerns me most about
this Bill is that we're turning over 20 million dollars of public money
to a partnership that has very little public involvement after we turn
it over, and that, in fact, with unclear language in the bill about a
board, we may be paying board members a hundred and twenty thousand
dollars a year for a role that we have public servants that do for free.
I stand against the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hurley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Lady has the Floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I hear what Representative Murry is saying, but he has
not put an amendment on the table to clarify that, and this bill clearly
states that this can go to board members. This kind of money can go to
board members. This is just what we were able to look at quickly,
because this came to a small committee meeting and was quickly read in
to us. I know they've been working on it a long time, but it needs to go
to a big committee. It needs to be aired out a little bit more because
little things like this are just horrible for this bill. Another thing
that's in this bill that I did not discuss was bonuses. There's nothing
in here . . .  it says that bonuses can't be made, but there're no
restrictions or guidelines as to how much someone can get a bonus, and a
bonus for what? You know if you get a job, you're going to get a bonus .
. . I know every State employee. I used to do procurement, and if I
couldn't make . . .</p>

If I get a dime for every dollar that I saved this state of North
Carolina as a bonus, I would be really happy. The way this day is right
now I would like to trade my seat for one of the jobs to sit on this
board. That one hundred twenty thousand dollars of state money. That’s
just the minimum because there’s no say in how much profit money they
can get. So for this, I cannot support this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Tine please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Representative Murry would yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Murry do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank you Representative Murry. Last session we
had a similar bill that did similar things that got caught up with
surprisingly some Senate activities on the other side so I supported
that bill when we had it here and one of the reasons was the money that
was going to be collected was going to be pulled state wide and
redistributed to divisions in areas that would perhaps might not have
the resources available to them like the mountains like the east because
we don’t have big businesses in those areas and thus we need the
economic development. I read through it and I didn’t see that type of
revision in here but having read it quickly I’m looking to see if
perhaps that provision is still in the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That has not changed from the previous if you look on Section 3.2 or
Part 3 of the creation of collaboration for prosperity zones that’s
really the section that makes sure that various departments across our
state governments collaborate and work together on a regional basis. To
make sure that we decentralize commerce. Get it down to the regional
level. Get it partnered with transportation and education and make sure
everyone is singing out of the same song book so you don’t have to worry
about permitting. If you have an economic development conversation on a
regional basis and have all the interested parties from a departmental
perspective around the table, it will help decentralize activity. Get it
out of Raleigh. Get it out of commerce and get it into your rural areas.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman in the yellow.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I saw that in there. I see the process and the structure that
you’re setting up but what I don’t see is any sort of specific language
or provision that would say that some sort of equal distribution or at
least some sort of percentage might go to rural or particularly hit
areas or any sort of guiding language in regards to it because although
we can as I’ve seen already in my short time here we can have the intent
of those types of things but s soon as it goes over to a type of
department they may interpret things differently or decide to do things
differently. So is there something specific that deals with that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would say that the prosperity zone model is the decentralized process
that you’re describing and getting private sector investment into this
partnership and distributing that investment across these prosperity
zones enables areas that don’t have robust private sector or large
business partnership opportunities to receive benefit that investment
being made in this entity and then distributed through the prosperity
zone process. So that’s how we’re getting to the end that you’re asking
about.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative. I’d like to be recognized to speak on the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A gentleman’s right. You may debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. I get the concept. I’m still a little concerned. The
reason that I am is because we compete against ourselves inside of the
state. It’s just the reality of economic development that an area in
eastern North Carolina is going to be looking at the same business that
somebody in western North Carolina is going to be looking at and if we
don’t figure out a way to make sure that we’re spreading the love
through the state to make sure there are assets in each area, it’s be
very easy for a department that you have a person in each area but I’m
concerned the assets might stay in particular areas of the state. It
might something that the representatives might be willing to work on to
talk about but I just want to make sure that’s something we address as
we move down the road. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Murry, aye?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
How much is this gonna cost Representative Murry?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is unclear to see what this legislation will cost but I can tell you
it’s gonna be consumed within the commerce budget, there is no
additional funds needed to appropriate because this transition will be
completely absorbed within the existing budget of the Department of
Commerce so I don’t know why fiscal note would be necessary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Another question Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman aye?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What existing budget in the Department of Commerce we are talking about?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The NER Sub-Committee of which I’m a Co-Chair along with my colleague
from Chair, Representative West we have in developing working with the
Department of Commerce to help develop their budget and there are
willing and able to consume all activities associated with this
transition within their existing budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Another question Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman aye…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Have those ___[01:06] been appropriated yet?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have not a budget vote to this point but there is no fiscal impact
because like I say I will said it third time, any transition from the
current Department of Commerce to this public private partnership we
completely consumed within the existing budget with the Department of
Commerce.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Mitchell to the chair and to its space the direction of
your question it’s my understanding and Representative Murry may be able
to confirm this that in commerce the provisions of the bill that would
have done an appropriation were removed because prior to that this bill
had been referred to appropriations. Is that correct Representative
Murry?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct. Contrast that to the Senate but Senate version which
had an appropriation and so the Senate version of this bill actually
went to Senate appropriations. The house versions don’t have
appropriation language and didn’t need to go to house appropriations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker I just like the next statement on the process here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for a point of personal…Well, the gentleman
is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill, here the problem with folks, we are talking about
rather large sum of money, on one side which is been in the Senate and
this side the Senate has evidently put in an appropriation which I
understand is about 17 and me involves for the some reasons rather we
have done nothing in terms other than make noises about the department
of ___[02:43], this sounds to be sums in their budget, as far as I’m
concerned, as far as we are concerned we don’t have a budget for any of
our yet. And I don’t see right now this bill should not be referred to
committee on appropriations till such time and as funds can be
identified as to work this program is gonna call us, ___[03:03] this
program is gonna call us, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stan please state your purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, would Representative Mitchell aye?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Mitchell, aye?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Sir, I aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Mitchell we are at a two year ___[03:23] budget. The
budget for two years was in-acted a year ago, wouldn’t that include the
funds that are in question here we do actually have the appropriations
on going…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don’t believe that’s right Representative Stan because we have a done
a two year budget we are in the second year of the budget now the
adjustments would be made to that two year budget, we haven’t made those
adjustments to that two year budget and we need to know I think in my
mind what is this gonna cost us and what adjustments we have to make to
that two year budget in order to get it done?

Holley. The lady may not have heard the gentleman's debate on the
motion. I don't know if the Chair would, if the House will come to
order, if the gentleman will please restate the intent of this motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The intent of this amendment is to make it abundantly
clear that the board of directors for this non-profit corporation is not
to receive any compensation. The compensation caps are limited solely to
the annual salary for officers and employees of the non-profit
corporation. That does not apply to the board of directors. We've taken
all board of directors language out of that section in the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I have a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does
the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes ma'am your question, I am
amending the bill to make it abundantly clear that board of directors
members do not receive any compensation of this non-profit corporation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does that also include money for bonuses? Will that
come out of state funds as well? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The only compensation
that board of directors members will be eligible for would be the state
per diem for the days that they serve and that's it. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Holley, the lady brought a point, a valid point that the
members recognize it needed to be clarified. It was not the original
intent to pay the board members a compensation. Further discussion,
further debate on the amendment. If not, the question before the House
is the passage of the amendment sent forth by Representative Murray to
the House Committee Substitute of House Bill 1031. All in favor vote
aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will
let the machine record the vote. 114 having voted in affirmative, none

state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, members of the house. When this first
began to be talked about, I had concern and I got involved in talking
with various people, having conversations about how going forward this
would affect the rural parts of North Carolina. Then began to invite
various people who will have significant input into how this takes
place. Secretary of Commerce and other people. We've had several round
table discussions in Eastern North Carolina with a lot of folks
interested in this type of thing. And after that kind of activity and
input, I stand to support this bill and ask you to do so. I think it
will be very good for all of North Carolina, particularly those areas
that we sometimes feel that we don't get a fair shake. I think that we
will get a fair shake so I support the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Robert Brawley, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen. I
appreciate the innovativeness and creativity and I also have a lot of
respect for tradition, achievement and success. During the debates on
the unemployment insurance, we heard comments about how well we've done
in North Carolina, reducing our unemployment numbers. And the success
we've had there. If you look up economic development in North Carolina,
if you Google it you get things like outpace national economy, North
Carolina's consistently ranked among the best climates in America,
that's business climates in America. Our economic development commerce
department is recognized as one of the best in the nation under any
standards you look for. And I think we can be proud of what's been done.
The opportunity is out there in North Carolina. If not, I certainly
would support making the opportunity available for any non-profit
corporation that wants to, get involved and complement the successes we
do have and what we are doing. But I see absolutely no reason to turn
what has been so successful potentially turn it over to a non-profit
that's going to be obligated to the people who make the contributions of
supporters. You talk about fairness across a state, how is this
organization, this non-profit</p>

CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As I’ve listened to this debate, first
I do want to thank Representative Murry for bringing forth the amendment
on the compensation for the board members. It cleared up some questions.
The idea of the public money being supplemented by private money I think
is a very good thing because businesses seeing business commitment to
recruiting business is a powerful story. I did have concerns that were
raised about the potential for the money not being spent wisely, and I
certainly wanted to commend Representative Glazier on both his candor
and courage in recounting the unfortunate outcomes of two things that
his party had done with Golden Leaf and the Rural Center, and I
certainly appreciate him raising that cautionary tale for us to keep a
good eye to keep that from happening again, and I appreciate his
cooperation in doing that. Mr. Speaker, I support this bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bumgardner, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the bill as amended. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, I
can’t support his bill. I appreciate the intent of the author, and I
have a philosophical problem with taking taxpayers’ money and using that
to entice, enhance, whatever euphemism you want to use, businesses to
locate here. And we’re dividing the whole state up into enterprise
zones; how come the whole state can’t be an enterprise zone? I never
agreed with having an enterprise zone here and a free trade zone there.
If it’s good for there, why not over here and why not over there? The
fact that we’re having to put all this language in here about ethics
tells you that this thing is rife with potential for bad outcomes, and
it’s going to be a long time before we know the full outcome of this.
The government spending money to helping, supplementing private dollars
and government dollars and mixing them all together, it’s an idea that I
personally questioned the validity of from day one. I really don’t… I
think a lot of success stories that are pointed to by people saying
“Well this was great and this happened because of a public-private
partnership,” you don’t know if it may have happened anyway and then
better. And one other thing I have an issue with in this bill, which I
sat here reading this bill while we’ve been here for a good while, and
it’s pretty long and convoluted and complicated, in the back of the
bill… I can’t hardly remember now what it was I was going to say, so
anyway… I ask you to vote against this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Wilkins, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the bill as amended. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Speaker, and I know you’re going to say “Oh my goodness, here he
goes again,” but I’m going again. To me, this bill is really unfriendly
to your rural areas, and quite frankly, I’m not sure how many times some
of these rural counties can take another shot in the mouth and still get
back up, so I make that point and I move on because you’ve heard it
before and you know I’m concerned. If I weren’t concerned, I wouldn’t be
standing up right now. The other part that gets me, gets to me about
this bill, is that I believe we as legislators…</p>

Representative Hamilton, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just want to, for the record, say that there
was time last year when I supported this bill. I actually have my name
on it, I believe, if I'm not mistaken I voted in favor of it in this
chamber but that was when I thought that it was truly a public-private
partnership and that we were headed towards something that was a real
opportunity to bring in the business community and those representing
the government for bringing jobs to North Carolina and moving North
Carolina forward. The problem that I have with this version of the bill
is something that I stated earlier, $250,000 of private investment so
that we can turn of 17.5 million dollars of tax payer dollars to a
private entity is absurd. It's not a public-private partnership. That
$250,000 threshold is less than 1% of the total budget. So I'm concerned
that we are giving up our responsibilities as legislators. The oath we
took was to represent the people. Our job, our primary job is to set the
budget and to execute that budget. By turning over 17.5 million dollars
to a private entity with virtually no private support indicates to me
that the business community is not entirely behind this or at least the
bill drafters think that business community may not be behind this. or
else the $250,000 threshold would be a whole lot larger. I urge you to
vote against it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hastings, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To enter the debate, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I very seldom take people's time to speak but when I ran
economic security and jobs that was the top issue and that has been the
top issue for a number of years in the rural communities that I
represent. If you study in depth our economic development law in North
Carolina you know at the local level we can have a line department, we
can have an Economic Development Commission, or the statutes also allow
for a nonprofit, similar to what we're doing at the state level. What
many of you might not know is the state is about 15 years behind
Cleveland County. Now, in Gaston we still have an EDC, but in Cleveland
County, about 15 years ago we went through this process and it was
controversial at the time but if you'll Google Cleveland 2020 you'll see
that this same kind of process is set up at the local level in Cleveland
County. So I can understand why some might have a little reservation,
and it was controversial 15 years ago but it's proven to be a success in
Cleveland and I just wanted to commend Representative Murry-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hamilton, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if my good friend, Representative Hastings, would yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well of course.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative Hastings. Just because
I'm curious, what is the breakdown of the percentage of private
investment in the partnership you're referring to because I can tell you
in my neck of the woods it's more than 30% of the total budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You can view it online. May I respond?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You can Google Cleveland 2020 and look at the different private
investors that have invested and the cooperation that they have with the
chamber and they just made a decision to go from a county line
department, and an EDC, into what the statutes allow in our economic
development law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative, I will certainly go look that up but my guess
is it was gonna be more than 1% of the total budget for the year. Would
you agree? The private investment piece, I mean.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You can Google it and you can Cleveland 2020 and ask them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And as I was saying before I was interrupted, politely interrupted, I
support Representative Murry and would just encourage you to look at
what Cleveland County did 15 years ago. Thank you.

<p id="165:00">
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and I'll be brief. I know the afternoon is
getting late. I'll just say that no one cares more, or has more concern
for the demise of the rural areas than me. That's why I supported and
signed on to Representative Holloway's bill concerning our agriculture
and our fairs because I think it's important to protect our rural areas.
I voted sometimes against my own party because I thought it was to the
demise of rural areas. We are hurting. We continue to hurt. One of my
counties has a thousand less people now than it did 12 years ago, as
many of your rural area counties have. So I get it. I understand that
our rural areas are hurting.
But let me say no one has took the time like Secretary Decker has to
come to the rural areas, to come to my counties and listen and take the
time to hear from my constituents and to hear what's going on where
we're really hurting in these areas.
So if I thought for a second this bill would be hurting rural areas, she
would not be for it and her administration. And they have come to us,
they've listened to what we've had to say and incorporated our ideas.
And frankly I trust what she's trying to do. And if I thought that it
was going to hurt rural areas, I would not support this legislation.
What we're doing, I know this state as a whole is improving, but we're
still struggling. So let's give this a chance to work. Let's try to
support this. Let's get behind the secretary and let's give this a
chance to work.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bumgardner, please state your business.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as
amended a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I went back and found my place
where I lost my train of thought earlier. We're creating a new board
here. This bill also, to me, it limits property rights and it does that
by telling people how much money they can make. When you have to limit
how much money somebody can make, what incentive do they have? Why would
they want to go out and build a big company and make all they can make
if all they can ever make is $120,000 a year?
The other issue is we want them to be successful but we only want them
to be so successful, that's why we keep arguing back and forth over how
much money we can pay people that work for these companies. And we're
using taxpayers' money to pick winners and losers. That's a mistake. I
plan to vote no on this bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Susan Martin. Please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of this bill
and I would like to commend Representative Murry for his hard work with
the Department of Commerce in moving this forward. I have some great
economic development directors in my rural communities in Wilson and in
Pitt counties. I think of Wilson as a little more rural even though we
have a lot of that in Pitt County.
And the biggest issue that I hear is yes, Secretary Decker has come out
and listened and we are very supportive and we're very excited. We're
excited to see her vision. But you need to get off the pot and you need
to move things forward and enable her to do this work.
When I've gone out to them and had the opportunity, what can we do for
rural communities. The biggest thing that we can do is to let them get
to work and to enable them with this legislation. They are very
supportive and I rise to support as rural communities, as well. I think
we should vote in favor of this bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Whitmire, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] I, too, rise to commend this bill and thank the

said earlier, in my district and I drive 285 miles one way to get home,
we have had no less than 5 visits by Secretary Decker. I have had plenty
of changes earlier to query concerns and such as that. This is a good
bill and as we make our state into an area that job providers want to
come, this is one more way to make it happen. So I ask that you support
the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ask Representative Murry a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Murry, the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gladly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, my friend. I just wanted to give you an
opportunity. I've been a little bit confused by some of the debate and
it seems that some people are critical because they feel like that the
government is not doing enough here. And other people are critical
because they're fundamentally opposed to economic incentives. And I just
wondered if you could briefly and very clearly kind of point out what
are our options here. What's going to happen if we don't pass this bill
versus what happens if we do?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I'm glad you brought up the incentives question
because...</p>

This public-private partnership is going to be the sales and marketing
arm of economic development in the State of North Carolina. Sales and
marketing is not what government does well. Sales and marketing is not
the job of the government. And that's where the private sector
partnership comes in. No incentive grants will be obligated by this
public-private partnership. There will be no public funds obligated. And
it still remains on the public side of the house, so the debate over
incentives is not the subject of this conversation.
So you talk about the options. What are options? Right now, I would
argue that the existing framework for commerce in our state is rather
disjunctive. We've got some great partnerships. We've got great local
economic developers. But they're not singing off the same sheet of
music.
And so that's how I see this public-private partnership. We're going to
be talking about the same North Carolina, the same plan, using the
Governor's economic development board, the economic development plan
that's been created. And use that as a business plan to help market our
state and grow our existing industries and recruit new business.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One more brief question if you'll yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gladly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Once again, if this bill fails, economic incentives in
North Carolina will still go forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's right. The JDIG and ONE NC and all those
economic development incentive packages, they're all up for
re-authorization in 2016. I expect robust debate but that's not what
we're talking about here. We're talking about sales and marketing.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I've read this over many, many

Just the innovation piece imbedded in the science and technology part of
this bill will do wonders for North Carolina by itself. I'm in whole
support of this bill and I encourage everyone in this Chamber to vote
green.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Millis, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask a friendly question to Representative Jones.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones, I've listened to the exchange
here. I just want to ask you a question to make sure that I'm on the
same page about what's going on here today. While the dialog went on in
regard to what is being debated here, it's not about whether we're going
to do away with economic incentives, which under that large umbrella not
only includes public dollars for public infrastructure, but also has the
aspects of taking tax dollars by force and giving those dollars out to
specific private businesses. That economic development term as we
currently stands it's current statute covers that whole umbrella.
My question to you in regard to that is do you believe that this move
here today puts pretty much our economic incentive or economic
development strategy in this state on steroids in terms of the way if we
have current policy that may be considered bad or good. Therefore, what
I'm getting at by your question is that whether the economic incentives
is not the debate of the matter is that do you think that we're actually
furthering down the wrong road or we're actually going in a better path?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Millis. I'm not sure if I'm
smart enough to answer that question or not. I'm just a country dentist
from Rockingham County. I just wanted for my friend here to explain the
alternatives. There seems to be a little confusion, at least in part of
the debate, as far as I was concerned and I just wanted to ask him to
clarify that. So I appreciate his clarification and truthfully, I don't
know the answer to your question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Steinburg, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen of the house, I
rise in support of this bill. I am also one of the folks that has been
on the fence for a period of time. I have friends that are involved in
the old partnerships. I respect the jobs that they have done over the
years. But we have not seen the kind of economic development that time
would warrant. It just hasn't been there. And I truly believe that we
need to head in a different direction.
I had a very successful career in sales and marketing. I don't
understand some things about some things, but I do understand sales and
marketing and I know how important it is.
There's an old adage in sales that nothing happens until something is
sold. Nothing. And...</p>

Secretary ??, I’ve heard her name invoked here by many of the members of
the House. She is indeed something special. I have over all of my years
in my career worked with people in many different states and regions of
the country and around the world for that matter, and she is absolutely
one of the greatest visionaries that I have ever encountered. She is
enthusiastic, she is always there when you need her regardless of how
inconvenient it might be and how she’s going to have to rearrange her
schedule. I have had her on many occasions call me as late as 9, 10,
10:30 at night to try and firm up something because of a last-minute
change she had that would bring her into Northeastern North Carolina to
talk with someone who was on the verge of perhaps wanting to invest a
significant amount of money in business. We’ve had a lot of economic
development in Northeastern North Carolina so far. I’m very encouraged
by what we’ve seen. I’m more encouraged by her vision, and so I at this
point would encourage you all to accept that vision. Let’s change
course. Let’s move in the right direction. Let’s support this bill.
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Pages, if you’ll please come to the front
of the chamber. A moment of envy for Representative Floyd as we dismiss
you. Ladies and gentlemen, pages, we appreciate the service to the
chamber this week. I hope that you had an opportunity to learn a little
bit more about how this process works and I hope you had an opportunity
to make some friends among the other pages, and go back to your family
and your friends, share the stories of this week, and hopefully
encourage them to come and participate and serve this great body. Ladies
and gentlemen of the House, let’s show our appreciation to the pages.
Thanks again for your service; you’re now dismissed. Have a great
summer. Representative Larry Hall, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Speak on the bill as amended. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
is recognized to debate the bill as amended. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Speaker, and I appreciate the debate as well as the efforts
that were made on the bill, and looking back on what was originally
envisioned when we started down this process and looking at where we are
today, it’s a little bit disappointing because we’re not considering
this bill in the framework of the other things we’ve done to rural North
Carolina, and this is the first legislature, for those of you who don’t
know you made history, where we had more members from metropolitan urban
areas than from rural areas, and so maybe it’s fate that rural areas are
going to take it in the shorts, so to speak, every time the issue comes
up. And when I say “take it in the shorts”, I’m talking about how we
have this effort to provide economic development in these partnerships,
but we all know this development, unless we target it and direct it more
sufficiently, is going to go where the most money can be made and the
easiest development can be done, and that means where we have
infrastructure, that means where we have strong educational
institutions, that means where we have great quality of life already
existing in North Carolina, that means where we have healthcare already
existing. You’re not going to get someone to take that risk where the
workforce is not there, the infrastructure is not there, the trained
population is not there, and get them to compete on a statewide basis
with some other part of the state that does not have it. The benefits,
the profit margin won’t be there, and so that’s why I’m disappointed
that in this bill, and the question was asked, we don’t have specific
tiers or some specific way to ensure the development goes to the parts
of North Carolina that can’t do it on their own. Yes, let’s have
public-private partnership…</p>

But go to where we are having a problem getting the development done. We
don't need you in the Triangle. We don't need you in the Triad. We don't
need you in Charlotte-Mecklenburg. They are strong enough to stand on
their own and get that done. The other areas, particularly in Eastern
North Carolina, need this help, but it's not targeted and directed and
assured that those who need it the most will get that help. And so, the
public-private partnership does not necessarily reach the objective we
thought. I would also note that there is no guarantee as to what we'll
get from this process, but we do know we're in a different position. We
went from ten million dollars needing to be available by the private
side of this cooperative effort to two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars. And now, we're in a position where we have no guarantee as to
where these efforts and resources will go, so I submit to you we
could've done better. We should have done better. When you think about
the other areas of education where we've so badly hurt our rural areas.
When you think about healthcare where we've so badly hurt our rural
areas. Where you think about job training and cuts to our universities
and especially our community college system. And yet, we have this
opportunity. We held out the hope to our rural areas that there might be
some salvaging of your future and Representative Wilkins talked about
they're just hanging on. This bill won't help them. This bill doesn't
give them the incentives. It doesn't direct them to where it's needed to
most. And if you were a savvy businessperson. If you were in a
non-profit and your objective was to make the best return. You would go
where you can get that best return and that would be where the least
risk would be. And actually, the greatest return on investment. And that
wouldn't be in our rural areas, especially in eastern North Carolina, so
again I ask that you go back and look at it. I ask that you - in a
conference committee or whatever happens with the Senate - go back and
try to help our rural areas of North Carolina. Just don't leave them
hanging out to dry time and time and time again, whether it's
transportation formulas, education, community colleges, infrastructure,
at some point have some mercy on our rural areas of North Carolina. I'd
ask that you vote against this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask a question of the bill's sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Murray, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gladly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mister Speaker. I find myself in the same position that
Representative Jones was in that between one person talking and another
person talking you get kind of confused. And this is sort of the way
I've determined what we're trying to do here. Pretty much, it's a
consolidation of efforts; of economic development. Right now, we're as
you said: fragmented. One section is looking out for themselves here and
over there. With the approach that you're taking in view of the
marketing and sales department, you got a group that is looking over the
whole state and they will work to find companies that - because of the
issues and resources that Representative Hall addressed - can only be
situated in a certain area, but they will also be looking out for areas
that do not have those kind of resources but can support businesses of
different types. And when those decisions are made to go into those
agreements, our incentives - whatever they may be - is not going to be
the Wild Wild West. We're still going to have good supervision, good
review, good decisions about how we spend State dollars on incentives
for growing businesses in North Carolina. Am I right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I couldn't have said it any better myself. We are one North Carolina. As
the tide rises, all our boats are lifted. This public-private
partnership sees to make that happen and I would ask your support of the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm a little confused, too. I am totally in support of public-private
partnerships. I do believe that you're correct that the - that this body
will not do well and our government doesn't do well in sales and
marketing, so we should give that. But my question is is that why did it
go from ten million to two hundred and fifty thousand and does this
really mean that...</p>

<p id="185:00">
It's not really a partnership if we, I hear Representative, her
concerns, and why is it $550,000?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's an excellent question.  The requirement that came out of the edge
committee was actually a ten million dollar threshold before the
contract got entered in to. That's a high bar for really no knowledge of
whether it's going to ever actually get achieved in a timely fashion to
be effective. And so what we did, we, before a contract can get entered
in to they have to raise a quarter million dollars. There is an annual
fundraising requirement in the first year. That quarter million plus a
million and then an annual fundraising requirements of 1.25 million
dollars a year over a five year contract period. And so the fundraising
requirement has basically been spread out over a five year period
instead of 10 million dollars before you ever enter in to the contract
it's 6 million dollars over a five year period, which is more
reproducable. And from a public funds perspective, I think that the, I
think that this entity's going to operate so efficiently that I think
that there's going to be less public fund obligation and this is my
personal opinion and this is based on conversations with the secretary
but just because the Department of Commerce gets funded at a certain
level today doesn't mean that entire amount of funding is gonna pass
through to the private partnership. That's the goal, it's to de-obligate
state from public funds and allowing this partnership to do things in a
more efficient way without having additional public funds expended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The question before the House is the passage of the House Committee
Substitute to House Bill 1031 as Amended, on it's second reading. All in
favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The
clerk will let the machine record the vote, 73 having voted affirmative,
41 in the negative, the House Committee Substitute to House Bill 1031 as
Amended is past it's second reading and without objection-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Objection.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Objection having been raised the bill will be ordered engrossed and
placed on the calendar for June 10th.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Warren, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, sometimes it takes me a few minutes to process things like
amendments and after I've given it some thought I'd like to have my vote
changed on the Glazier Amendment to an aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman will be recorded as having voted aye on the Glazier
amendment. Ladies and gentlemen, for your planning purposes next week.
Monday will be a no-vote session, skeleton session, at 4 PM. Tuesday, we
anticipate session being at 4 PM and we do anticipate a calendar to
dispose of. Wednesday we will come in at 8 AM but purely to gavel in and
to recess so that we can do re-referral bills. I believe at that time we
will have to do a referral from Appropriations to Finance and back. And
then on Thursday, is everybody's favorite day, it's the day that we take
up the budget. We will begin at noon. And for your planning purposes,
just give this thought, depending upon how long that process goes, it
normally goes eight or nine hours, we will determine whether or not we
would prefer to stay over, since it's a two-day bill, and vote at
midnight so that you can move on early on Friday morning or come back
early in the morning for the vote. And we will discuss that some time on
Thursday as the debate goes on. So again, 4:00 on Monday, no vote, 4:00
on Tuesday, there will be votes, 8:00 AM on Tuesday, there will be no
votes when we gavel in, it will come later in the day if at all, and
then 12:00 PM on Thurs-, or 12 noon on Thursday. Notices and
announcements, Representative Holloway, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm wanting to extend some birthday wishes to an

lot of respect for this individual and have always considered him a
mentor and after that Ag Fair thing I thought about being a little bit
mean to him but then I realized that usually payback is three-fold so I
decided I better just stay nas[??]. But if you will, wish Representative
Nelson Dollar a happy birthday.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I will be brief. But I did want to take a brief
moment, before we adjourn, to recognize the life and contributions of
Former Representative John R. Gamble, Jr. of Lincoln County,  who passed
away on Sunday at the age of 92. Dr. Gamble served in the House from
1973 through 1980, and then again from 1991 to 1998. Dr. Gamble
graduated from Lincoln High School, Emory University, and the University
of Maryland School of Medicine. He did his training in surgery at
Charlotte Memorial Hospital and Roanoke General Hospital. He served in
the US Army as a M.A.S.H. surgeon in Korea and Japan. He lived his life
in Lincolnton and practiced at Reeves Gamble Hospital until it was
donated to the county for the formation of the Lincoln County Hospital.
Incidentally, he also hired my mother as the first Registrar there. He
served multiple terms as Chair of the Lincoln County Commissioners as
well as here in the North Carolina House. Despite our political
differences, and there were many and I got some classic stories I'll
save for another time, the Doc and I forged a friendship during his last
term in public office after serving on a bipartisan committee, formed to
hire new tax administrator for our county. Mr. Speaker, Members of the
House, thank you for your indulgence as we remember Dr. and
Representative John Gamble, community leader from Lincoln County, who
was laid to rest just maybe an hour or so ago. Please remember him in
your prayers and his family and I thank you.
