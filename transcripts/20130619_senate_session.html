gallery will please silence all electronic devices.  Leading the Senate
in prayers, the Reverend Peter Millners, the chaplain.  Members in the

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let’s pray together. God, you are a god of Eve and Jacob. We come to you
and we have to admit that we are deceptive in our ways, each of us, and
yet you want to give us a blessing.  You say in scripture, “If my
people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves and pray
and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from
heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.  So we pray,
today, the lord, in this company of people assembled in this land that
it will begin now to meet the conditions that will enable you, Lord, to
fulfill your promises. Teach us how to live life rightly, how to follow
in the footsteps of Moses and the prophets. Change us to look more like
a redeemed Jacob, a liberated Jacob who is now Israel. For Christ’s
sake, we pray. Amen.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown is recognized to explain the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President.  In all of us who have served with Jean would
have to say that she became a dear friend to all of us.  One thing I
will say about Jean Preston is the term lady was definitely Jean
Preston. She was as genuine as they come. You just couldn't find any
person more genuine than Jean.
I think about Jean and I remember when she decide to run for the house.
It was a dual district back then and it included part of Waslow County,
so she came over to Waslow County to campaign for that seat and she was
running against a couple of encumbrance and of the three running she was
definitely the underdog.
I remember somebody in Richland's telling Jean that they didn't know why
she was over there because she wouldn't get a single vote out of
Richland.  Naturally she carried the precinct and when the election came
around Jean won one of those seats and serve representing Waslow County
for a while and then thru re-districting Jean house district became
Carterette in Jones County.
Well I grew up in Jones County so I felt it would be great having Jean
represent Jones County with me and what I didn't realize that when it
became election time Jean get's more votes that I do and I grew up over
there, so that would just tell you how tough Jean was.  You couldn't go
to an event that Jean Preston wasn't at. She was the hardest worker I
have ever seen in my entire life.  That's why her constitutes loved her.
 She didn't miss any event.  You couldn't out work that lady.  She was
just relentless.  And when it comes to constituent work she was the
absolute best.
Of course when she came over to the Senate our district was right beside
each other we spent many many hours working together on coastal issues
and on career tech and of course special needs where dear to her heart
those issues as well.  She and I became very good friends.  There were
very few weekends that we were not at the same event or talking on the
phone about some legislation.  We just spent alot of time together.
I remember the last time she ran, we had to talk her into running.  She
was ready to retire and we talked her into running and she got her 60%
of the vote like she always did and she served those two years and then
she was ready to retire and spend more time with Susan and the grandkids
in particular and Cameron was getting ready to go to UNC and play soccer
and Parker was into baseball and she talked about wanting to spend a
whole lot more time with them.
It was tragic the way Jean left us because I know she was really looking
forward to her future and spending time with her family.  Se was a great
lady and I do truly miss her especially on some education and coastal
issue that we've worked so close together and I know everyone is this
body misses her too.
I have a picture of her and myself in my office and I look at that
picture quite often and I think about how good of a lady she really was.

<p id="15:00">
Understand and speak briefly to it. I certainly treasure the time that
I've spent with Jean. I knew her when she was in the House and there
were education issues that I was working on when I was in the school
system I would talk to Jean she was the voice of the education over
there in the House for six or seven terms, and then she was a trusted
colleague here as we worked on education things and I'll always remember
that. We're honored in saying goodbye to two of our great friends we did
Donnie's yesterday and Jean Preston, and their memories will remain with
me a long time and I am honored to have Jean's daughter Suzanne as my
legislative assistant, a sweet genteel person through and through and
sincere through and through, just like Jean, and one of the great ?? of
Jean's life was  Suzanne, her daughter, and Cameron and Parker, the two
grandchildren who are also here somewhere today, Mr. President, and with
your indulgence I would ask that - maybe we'll do that later. We'll have
them stand later. They're here and, proud for them to be here, and I
know that Jean is looking and smiling down on Suzanne and Cameron and
Parker, and so proud of you all; and ask you to support this resolution.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. I can't let the opportunity go by to say
something about Jean Preston. I first met her when she came to the
legislature after she was elected in '92, and served with her in the
House ten years. In the first meeting I had with her she came by my
office and told me the kinds of things she was interested in and she
kept emphasizing her background in education. And I said - then I called
her Representative Preston, later started calling her Jean - if you
really are committed to this education stuff, you tell me where you want
to be and what you want to do so that you can enhance that. She was put
on the education committee, and she played a major role on educational
issues. Didn't matter whether the House was on a Democratic control or
Republican control. And she had a sense of dedication and commitment
that's probably unequaled by anybody in this place on those issues. She
really had a compulsion for them. Over the course of time those who
serve here tend to establish a bond between each other and it's almost
like a family bond in many ways and I just felt so proud to be
associated with Jean, both in the House and over here in the Senate. Her
advocacy for young people and for the kind of quality education that she
felt that she had received in North Carolina is unequal. I knew a lot
about her. I didn't realize that she spent time down in Robeson County
at Flora McDonald College at the time and I've got to believe that
that's part of what made her so special that she carried away some of
the good attributes Robeson County has to offer. I'm honored to have
known her, I'm honored to have served with her, and I'm honored to
commend this resolution to you because we really do celebrate the life
of a very wonderful, special individual.

Senator Davis for what purpose do you rise?

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate I stand in
front of you today to reflect and say farewell to a person I actually
consider a friend. Jean was a native of Greene County. Greene County is
a small community; tight knit and tend to know everyone, and I can tell
you she was very well known and highly regarded in our community.
Growing up there, and when I made my way to the Senate, so often
residents of the community would always ask about her and when I would
go back and often find myself sitting down often sometimes with
administrators with the school system they would always bring her up and
something she had done to help students in our community. It was a
tremendous loss to us at the time when she left to go to the coast but
we understand why she had to go. One of the greatest gains then was when
she returned to the General Assembly. I remember so often, again, people
conveying messages to send back and forth and what I miss so often.</p>

<p id="20:00">
No I have an opportunity to come back is we would often meet right in
the corner nearly every session and talk about Green County she would
say well Don how's everyone doing back home and they would, when I go
back home people would ask me and they were given reports on how I was
doing here but she always checked on me and even asked how I was doing
when I first came she reached out and I appreciated that more than ever
and I would simply say a couple things. When we come here ?? we come
with a charge. We have interests in many issues but there are probably a
few things that we really stake our ground in. She staked her ground in
education and not only did she stake her ground in education but she had
a long track record of making a difference in education especially with
special needs children. For me that was important  as my interest has
been in education, she taught me. The second thing I would say about
here was that we heard earlier. She was a first class lady and I would
better characterize her as truly a sweet, sweet spirit and the epitome
of grace the way she carried herself. On behalf of not only the Senate
today but all of the resident's in Green County, and not only do I say
that we miss Senator Preston but I end by saying that we miss as we
called her in Green County, Pookie.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just will tell you that when I first came to the General Assembly, I
met Senator Preston because of my interest in education and got involved
with the wrong group of people in trying to get something done and
Senator Preston said to me, &quot;Lady that's not the way to get that
done.&quot; She proceeded to take me under her wings and to help me and
because of that we were able to get scholarships to recruit
African-American males into the teaching profession. And Senator Preston
and I continued to work in our years on the house in education, and I
never met a finer person, nor a person more committed to education than
Senator Preston as she indeed was a lady and she was committed to
teaching young people across this state. I will never forget her, nor
what she did to try and help me with education and to help educate our
students and I do honor her and had the pleasure of working with her.
Thank you.

We talked about what a wonderful lady Senator Preston was, she really

One time I was walking, we were walking to the elevator together and I
said Jean, how you doing? She said doing pretty good but we need to get
rid of the leadership. And I need to point out we were in charge then. I
said ok. But I do commend this resolution to you.

We talk about Senator Preston and she truly was a lady, and in every
sense of the word. But there is another word and Senator Hunt was
talking about it. She was tenacious. As much as any lady I've ever met
in my life. And the grandchildren I think have that tenacity from their
grandmother and they're excelling in athletics, probably due to their
grandmother. I can think about when she was running. Mr ?? you lived
this memory with me. I go to bed about ten, ten thirty and my phone
ringed about a quarter to eleven. It'd be Jean Preston. Somebody had
said something and my god we where going to lose that election. And this
went on for a good three or four months and Lisa said finally,  I'm a
worry about you and this Jean Preston? And I said if you look as good at
seventy as she does you better worry. And that being said, Suzanne the
main thing....</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I would feel very remiss if I didn't say some very kind and thoughtful
words about Senator Preston. I really had not gotten to know her well
until Senator _______ wife passed away and the senate took a bus down to
her funeral. Senator Preston and I were seated close to each other
during that trip. So we spent about four hours down talking and after
the funeral, having lunch together and as well as the trip back up. I
got to really learn who Jean Preston was – her background, her history,
her connections through the community but most importantly just the
intrinsic values that she had as a person and her passion toward issues
related to education.
I used her consistently as a tool when it came to seeking input on
legislation that came before us in the education committee. One of those
persons I could go to and say, &quot;Jean, I'm not feeling quite right,
what do you think? What are your thoughts? Give me an additional
perspective on this.&quot; She was always thoughtful, she was always
insightful, she always took the time to communicate but most
importantly, she was very principled in what she said. She was one of
those people who approached issues with a sense of bipartisanship.
I know there were issues which I felt strongly about as a member on the
other side of the aisle. I'd speak to her about it and if she felt she
could lend me her support, she would. Likewise, she'd come to me and we
would discuss things that might go the other direction. But she was
always open. She was always receptive. She was always warm and friendly
and connected to everyone and somebody who I had the deepest admiration
for and someone who'll be sorely missed in this chamber.

What has already been said has been done so well and I can't add too
much to it because the comments have been so good, but I would feel
remiss if I did not stand up and just acknowledge how very much I liked
this individual. She sat behind me here in the chamber and I got to talk
to her and I got to talk to her in caucuses and visit with her in her
office sometimes. I just really appreciated her quiet dignity. She
didn't say all that much but when she did, people listened to her. She
had beautiful southern manners. She was a pleasure to be around. As
people have already said but which is so true, she was just the epitome
of what we call a great lady. Quite frankly, I feel privileged and
honored that I was able to serve with Jean Preston.

Thank you very much. I got to know Jean Preston when I was elected to
the house. She and I served over there several terms together. Then she
came over here to the senate prior to me coming. When I got recruited to
run for the senate seat, I went to Jean right off the bat to see if she
could help me, because the senate district included Greene County and
although Jean, as has been brought out today, lived down in _____ lately
but prior to that time she was a Greene County native. Luckily for me,
she had a large family that still lived in Greene County. She made sure
that I got to meet all of those people and took me under her wing or I'd
say she put a noose around my neck to be sure that I was led to meet the
various people in Greene County because she said, &quot;This is going to
be tough.&quot; But thanks to her help, I was able to join her in the
senate. Our time together was much too short over here but I certainly
appreciate all the help that Jean Preston and her family gave me during
those campaigns. Thank you very much.

Thank you, Mr. President. I won't belabor what's been said but I didn't
have the benefit of knowing Jean as long as so many of you'll did, but I
felt like I did. The reason I felt like I did was because of this
connection that I had with Jean that already has been talked about and
that's Greene County. See, I married a Greene County girl...</p>

A marigold is a lot like Senator Preston. And I knew a lot about Senator
Preston before I got here because one of her dear friends was a very
close friend of my wife’s family and I had known her since  I was about
sixteen years old and so when Ms. Patricia ?? found out that I was
running, she kept telling me, oh you’re going to enjoy my friend jean
Preston so much. And when I got here, Jean really did what everybody
else has talked about. She took me under her wing. She was always
looking out for me, every time I saw her, how are you doing Buck? Are
they treating you okay?  If they’re not treating you okay you let me
know, we’ll figure it out, we’ll take care of it. And one of the
education ties, one of the ways she helped me the most was in our
difficult  budget session, in the last session. She let me know that the
Eastern School for the Deaf was on the chopping block. And she didn’t,
she told me she didn’t feel like that was right that I didn’t know that.
And so I talked with her about it and kinda came up with a little plan
of action and in the end we were able to show that that was not the
right choice for the state to close that school. And so the folks really
back home can really credit Jean for helping me figure out a way to skin
that cat. But she was always looking out for me. She was a great lady
and I’m really sorry that I didn’t get to serve more time with her.  And
I’ll miss her. So I commend the resolution to you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  You know out of everyone in this chamber, and
I wanted to take the definition of, I think Senator Brown said it first
when he gave us Jean Preston as the lady that she was. I want to carry
it one step farther.  She is the epitome of what I call a southern lady,
and I think everyone in this Chamber knows what I’m saying. I had the
unique opportunity to learn about Jean Preston in three ways that most
of you probably never did. In fact, I know you didn’t. The first way
that I learned about her was running head to head against her in a
Primary campaign. Now, when I look in retrospect at that, it might have
been a very foolish decision on my part.  But the reason I did that was
a story all on its own. But I met this lady, the very first time I ever
saw her, she and I were standing, I was standing behind her and we were
in a line getting ready to speak in front of about 400 or 500 votes in
Craven county. And she turned around to me and she said, Norm we need to
get together and talk. And that expression became so familiar to me in
the next there or four years because that’s what she would say when we
had a problem that we wanted to solve together. For the next six months,
on the campaign trail, Jean Preston and I, myself a lot of times were
campaigning in front of groups of 2 or 3, or 4 or 5 in outlying areas of
our district. And I just began to get such an appreciation for this
lady. Because I never heard her say anything that didn’t come straight
from her heart.  And never did she say anything that she totally didn’t
mean. Jean Preston never said anything to gain a vote.  She said it
because she believed it.  And so when we went through this Primary
election and I’m not even going to tell you the results because I don’t
want to embarrass myself. But I had become so impressed with her, a few
weeks after that when I was offered a Chairmanship of our county party.
 I took it, and I took it primarily so that I could get our country
organized and help this lady win this seat. Because I knew that she
would be a tremendous asset to our county.  To Pamlico county, which was
the new county in her district. The second way that I got to know Jean
Preston was by serving with her.  Three of the counties that she had,
because I did go back later and win the House seat when she was running
for the Senate, or when she won the Senate seat, and I was able to serve
her representing two of the three counties that she had. And to my great
delight when I first came into the House.</p>

<p id="35:00">
I was able to serve with her on Appropriations Education Committee. Her
from the Senate and me from the House. And I do not want to even tell
you some of the conversations she and I had about our Senior
Appropriations Chairman after the lights were turned down and the halls
were empty and the chambers were empty because we really gave you guys
and ladies a hard time about what we thought needed to be done for our
district in education. And she was such a lady who somebody said
tenacious. What an appropriate word because she really was. And just to
know her under those circumstances and to be able to serve with her and
to represent a portion of the same folks that she was representing, I
learned so very much after that two years serving with her in the House
while she was in the Senate. And the third way I got to know Jean
Preston, more than any, anyone in this room, was by stepping into the
position that she had held in this chamber. When I was campaigning for
this Senate seat, when I would go into places and present myself and ask
for people’s votes and tell them what I was going to do. I knew without
any doubt whatsoever, especially the people over in Carteret County,
when I stood up to speak they were not measuring me by what I was saying
or what I looked like or how I said it. They were measuring me by how I
would compare to Senator Jean Preston.  And I am so thrilled to say that
evidently somehow, just a little bit I was able to live up to what she
meant to those people.  Because when you go time after time after time
and you hear folks talk about what a marvelous person she was, you begin
to understand, without even soliciting it, you begin to realize that
that’s the truth. Because people don’t say that just to impress you.
They say things like that because they really mean it. And so I count
myself blessed to have known her in those three ways. I too miss her. I
will always miss her. I will always hold her up as a standard as long as
I am serving the people in that district.  And it’s just been a delight
to see Susanne and the children and her husband, and just to see them
everybody. Because every day I walk to my office,  I pass Susanne,
Senator Tillman’s office and I see her in it, and it just brings me back
into remembrance of why I truly am here and that’s to serve the  people
of the state of North Carolina and my district and I commend this
resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there further or debate? Members of Senate I’m just going to take a
moment before we vote and I just want to echo what has already been
said. I think the, the thing about jean Preston that struck me as much
as anything, I think Senator Apodaca alluded to it and a couple of
others have said something about it, is she was one tough lady. And she
was someone however that if she told you what she was going to do you
could count on it. We have now two consecutive days this Body has taken
the time to honor former members. And I would just like for you, the
members of the Senate to reflect on that fact and reflect on the
comments that have been made about both Senator Preston and Senator ??
and how those comments have come from members of both parties and have,
have been, I think in very obvious terms, straight from the heart and an
indication of the relationships that are developed on this floor and in
the halls of this building and the legislative office building over the
years. It is one of the grand things in my view of serving in the
Senate. And Susanne we are continued to be blessed by your presence and
we thank you for the willingness of your, you and your family, for you
to share Jean with us for all the years.  It is a treasured memory for
all of us and it’s something we will continue to keep in our hearts and
minds.  Further discussion or debate? Hearing none, question before the
Senate is the passage of Senate Joint Resolution 15 on its second
reading. All in favor will vote aye, all opposed vote no.</p>

[Speaker changes.] I saw an accusing finger pointed at me from across

President. Thank you, colleagues.  This matters come over from us from
the House and the reason my..I have a connection to it is it relates to
a portion of the bill that relates to what the official folk art of
North Carolina would be under this bill and that is to name the
whirlygig art of ??????? Simpson of Wilson, the official folk art of
North Carolina. And I'll take just a moment, very briefly to explain to
you why this is so important to our neck of the woods.  Mister Simpson
passed away very recently but his art, as strange as it may sound to
some of you, is recognized all over the world.  It is encased in museums
in foreign countries and in major cities throughout our country. One of
his pieces was at the Olympics in Atlanta, and you might find it
strange, but this gentleman served our country honorably in World War II
and was a machinist and when he retired, he started making folk art and
we call...everybody calls them &quot;whirlygigs&quot;....</p>

And basically they are as you probably have seen in other venues,
recycled pieces of metal and equipment and items turned into art. And
it’s quite fantastic and when I was a kid I didn’t appreciate it, and I
hope people will appreciate what I’m getting ready to say.  When I was a
kid I didn’t appreciate it.  There were all these strange windmill type
objects with the reflectors and paint all over them out in the middle of
the country along this farm road. And we used to have great fun on
Friday nights when we didn’t have anything better to do than drive down
that windy road and let our headlights hit all that fantastic stuff out
there in the middle of that field.  And we just didn’t know any better
and there was a tremendous festival in Wilson County, the Whirligig
Festival that has been going under, under going for many years. Many
thousands of people attend it in the fall and there’s a large park there
that’s been established to collect and renovate and store all this art
for the future.  When you have people that come from all over the world,
strangely enough, to come see this stuff you would have people tramping
through this field out of nowhere.  You know you sometimes wonder if the
local guy is a whole lot more special than you appreciated when you were
a young kid. So that’s part of what this bill is about.  The other
parts, some of which come from classes, fourth graders and so forth. I’m
not aware of any opposition of this bill. Any folks that had some
concerns those mattes got straightened out in the House.  So otherwise
I’ll try to answer your questions but I commend the bill to you.

Mr. President?

Thank you, I’d just like to report to Senator Newton that this bill

Would the bill sponsor yield to a question?

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton, I consulted about this bill with Former Senator Richard
Stevens and he had a question that he thought was very important to the
consideration of the bill and so I will pose the question to you. I know
it was a good question when he asked it of me.  The bill proposes to
designate the Virginia opossum as the official state marsupial.  I don’t
know if we have a North Carolina opossum, there seem to be a lot of them
running around but his question wasn’t that.  His question was, are
there any of our other state symbols that it’s legal to hunt and kill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brock, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
See if Senator Clodfelter will yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you know that the reason why the Virginia opossum and not the North
Carolina opossum has never made it to this side of the road?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brock I had a suspicion that might be the case, but I don’t know
if we can hunt any of our other state symbols and that was the question
Senator Stevens wanted me to ask.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m up here hoping there will be further discussion or debate.  Hearing
none.  Senator Davis for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To grant your wish.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d like if the bill sponsor would yield to a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, I notice that the marble salamander is distinguished by its
charismatic personality, could you tell me how you determined that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have no idea.  That one definitely is over my pay grade.
