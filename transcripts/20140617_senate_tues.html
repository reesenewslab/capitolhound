[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Goolsby, for what purpose do you rise?

[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe there will be a J1 meeting tomorrow. All J1

And my personal privilege. Today is the 272nd birthday of my 7th great
grandfather William Hooper. For those of you who went to school in North
Carolina you probably learned that he was one of the three signers of
the Declaration of Independence in this great state.
I've presented to all of you on your desk a little rendition of some
history provided by one of the societies that recognizes all the signers
of the Declaration of Independence about my 7th great grandfather.
Strangely enough, he actually had moved down to the south from Boston.
His father was a preacher there. Like Senator Stein he attended Harvard
Law School or got his law degree from Harvard at the time. And moved
south. Moved to of all places Wilmington, North Carolina and practiced
law there.
He ended up marrying a local Wilmington girl who was the daughter of the
High Sheriff at the time. And when the revolution came around, he was
selected as one of the delegates to the first Continental Congress,
along with names that you will recognize being from North Carolina. John
Penn and Joseph Hughes. He...</p>

...when up and served.
On November the 23rd, 1774, the voters of Wilmington, after the initial
Congress, met and elected him to the Wilmington Committee of Public
Safety to &quot;carry more effectively and the execution the resolves of
the late Congress held at Philadelphia.&quot;
John Adams wrote in his diary about William Hooper, along with Patrick
Henry and Henry Lighthorse Lee, I believe that was Robert E. Lee's
father. That they were all three the orators of the Congress.
William Hooper, at the close of 1776, had attended three Continental
Congresses, five Provincial Congresses and four Provincial Assemblies
besides being a member of the Wilmington Committee of Safety. Although
he was absent when independence was actually signed on July the 4th,
1776, he, like many other delegates, affixed his name to the amended
declaration on August the 2nd.
On December the 22nd, the Great Seal that you see right up there above
the President, our Lieutenant Governor, he was actually appointed along
with two other individuals, Joseph Hughes, another signer of the
Declaration of Independence, and John Burke, to actually devise the
Great Seal of the Great State of North Carolina.
On December the 22nd of that same year, 1776, they met and actually
started designing that seal.
Senator Tucker asked me to make sure that I read this quote to everybody
and you'll see at the bottom of page three it begins. After attending
three congresses, he began, like many of us, to tire of the routine and
of being in Congress and he wrote, &quot;I am weary of politics. It is a
study that corrupts the human heart, degrades the idea of human nature
and drives men to expedience that morality must condemn.&quot;
In 1777, early in that year, he and many other delegates were stricken
with malaria and he went home to his beautiful home called Phinean on
the Cape Fear Sound. It's no longer there but it was a beautiful place,
I've seen pictures of it.
He then attended the General Assembly in the years 1777, '78, '79, '80,
and '81 for the borough of Wilmington.
When he realized that his home and his family wouldn't be safe from the
British men of warships that were off the Masonboro Sound, he moved his
family into town. He was suffering at that time from malaria and a badly
injured arm and he became a fugitive from the British at that point.
When Major James Craig and his men took the City of Wilmington, the
Hooper House downtown was burned. He had to flee and his family had to
leave on horseback. He was hunted by the British for a number of years
during the war. Phinean was burned and another home of his was also
burned.
He continued to serve his country after the war was over. As a lawyer,
he continued to try to litigate and to bring peace between the Loyalists
and the new sovereign American citizens. He handled a number of lawsuits
and at one point was even appointed a federal judge.
He ended up dying on October the 4th, 1790. He was originally buried in
Hillsboro and then, like the other two signers of the Declaration of
Independence, his body was moved to Guilford Courthouse where he is
interred to this day along with his other two signers.
I appreciate this time, Mr. President, to speak about my 7th great
grandfather, who's birthday I honor today. Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator. Senators, the Chair is happy to
extend courtesies of the gallery to general contractors from across the
state, members of the Associated Builders and Contractors from all over
North Carolina. Thank you for joining us. Please stand and be
recognized.
[applause]
Do we have any other notices or announcements? Senator Soucek, for what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To make an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Soucek, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I want to remind everyone every Wednesday at 12:30,
for about 30 minutes in between the two chambers at the Chapel, the
House and the Senate have a joint chapel service. We sing a couple
hymns, we have a legislator share a brief message and we always get you

Thank you.

business to come before the Senate? If not, the Chair recognizes Senator
Berger for a motion.
