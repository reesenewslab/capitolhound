[Speaker changes.]...camera bill...this does not require cameras be put
on cameras..or cameras to be put on buses.  The second question that
came up was why not use the ????? forfeitures and require that the
school boards use that to put cameras. We revised  by sayin' we could
not require that in this bill...that was not an option so we did not
require that in here. We encouraged local school boards to use funds
from increased fines for cameras on buses but we could not require it.

[Speaker changes.] Mister Chairman, can I ask the bill's sponsor a
question please?
[Speaker changes.] Representative Carney...yes.
[Speaker changes.] Is your...the difference in the original and the PCS,
is there a big difference?
[Speaker changes.] The only difference is that it would be only west of
Interstate 77 and effective date of 1/20/14.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Chairman...I don't know about the rest of the
members but I'm fine with that and, if we don't have copies...
[Speaker changes.] Ok...without objection, we will proceed without
having the PCS before us. The...and....excuse me, have you finished
Representative Presnell? (inaudible.) Ok...questions from the committee?
[Speaker changes.] Mister Chairman?
[Speaker changes.] Representative Jeter?
[Speaker changes.] Not to over-complicate things but the PCS currently
has a date of...effective when it becomes law. I have an amendment to
the PCS to set the effective date of January 1st, 2014.  I would ask
that that amendment be considered by the ?????????
[Speaker changes.] Ok, do we have that amendment available?
[Speaker changes.] The staff behind you has it.
[Speaker changes.] ????????? of the amendment. On page one, line
23...deleting &quot;when it becomes law&quot; and substituting January
1st, 2014.  Representative Pittman?

[Speaker changes.] Thank you. Reading through this...thank you for
bringing it forward...I'm just curious when you talk about under

<p id="10:00">
um, take some trees off a large track of land, for whatever reason,
would that weight limit apply to that truck doing the tree under
contract?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't think so.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Tree truck under contract?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is, this is generally for your electric co-op
people that are holding, um, big, uh, telephone poles on top. And so
that they can make the roads that are in the mountains. Kind of like the
Tail of the Dragon, you know how that road goes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, I've been on it. Where you have to pull over to
let your taillights pass you. Uh, understand, I'm just trying to make
sure for clarity that it, it pretty much dictated to the vehicles owned
and operated by those public utilities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Under contract to a public utility, or electric or
telephone membership corporation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Thank, thank you Ms. [crosstalk]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And used in connection with the installation. Yeah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative [Torbett?], I believe Ms. Carter may
have a further response on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The, um, question would be answered on subsection
small A, it says as used in the, connection with the installation,
restoration, or maintenance of utility services, so it would have to be
limited to those purposes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It would have to meet all of those requirements, um,
listed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay? Is it, does that answer it. Okay, um,
Representative Cleveland?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further questions to the bill sponsor? You're
recognized, Representative Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Uh, favorable report for the...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] PCS as amended?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] PCS for House Bill 623, unfavorable to the original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Uh, PCS as amended?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] As amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [Ok roll is on DCP G?] PCS and unfavorable to the
original, and is there a [foral?] on this one?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. So, you've heard the motion, all in favor say
aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed no. Congratulations, um, Representative
Presnell. Okay, next bill is 684. Increase Driveway Safety on Curvy
Roads. Now we have a, we have a PCS. Representative Elmore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. In my district we have some
curvy roads.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Elmore. Uh, let's get the PCS before
us, so have a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There's no move Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll take Torbett, Representative Torbett, may the
motion, PCS before us, please say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed no. Thank you, Representative you're
recognized, Representative Elmore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. We have some very curvy roads
in my district, uh, you, uh, when you go through the curve you're back
where you started by the time you get through it. Uh, and what this bill
will do, is the issue of issuing driveway permits currently, how the DOT
structures that, it is the landowner would make the request, they would
deny it, then you have to go through the appeals process when they
actually address what you need to do to accommodate the need. Basically
what this will do is put all of that discussion in the beginning versus
putting the landowner through the, um, appeals process. Now this only
applies to, um, driveway permits where there is not the sight distance
that is in the manual. So it is for those tight curves and things to
have these issues brought up in the beginning versus at the tail end. So
it's a whole lot more customer friendly to, uh, the residents and
property owners in my area.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh, okay, are we ready for questions? Representative
Shepard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, Mr. Chair, I'd like to make a motion to the
appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Hold that motion. Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, is it standard procedure for the DOT to
require the driveway owner to pay for the mirrors?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Uh.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] you're recognized, answer the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, after talking with DOT, because these are such a
case by case type basis, it varies based on the need that they address.
With these cases they're having to look at so many different things,
it's just not always mirrors Representative Starnes, it can be reducing
the speed limit. It, it's truly a case by case.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I, I understand that, but my question is the practical
application, and you're familiar with this, you'll get up there in the
mountains and they'll have mirrors there at the driveway so you can see
to get out, and the kids come along and they shoot the mirrors out, you
know, and they break them, and I'm just wondering, once they're
installed is that the homeowner's responsibility or is the DOT absorb
that cost? Because the way I'm reading this, the, the driveway owner has
to absorb the cost of the mirrors.</p>

<p id="15:00">
When I asked that question of the DOT folks, it varies some, but it is
part of the land owner’s responsibility in that negotiation to work that
out, because under current rigs, technically they can not make them have
the driveway period. [Change speaker] One follow up then. [Change
speaker] Follow up. [Change speaker] If the home owner bares the expense
of putting the mirror up and somebody comes along and they shoot it out.
Is there any obligation that he replace the mirror? [Change speaker] I
do not have the answer to that, staff may have to answer that one.
[Change speaker] Mr. Perry do you know the answer to that? Did you hear
the question? [Change speaker] The bill authorizes the cost of the land
owner, we would have to ask DOT how they intend to administer this
provision. [Change speaker] Anybody from DOT would like to respond to
that? [Change speaker] Good afternoon, my name is John Nance. I’m Deputy
Chief Engineer with DOT and as was explained a condition of the driveway
permit, in the cases where the mirror is required, which not always the
case, It does require the property owner to provide that mirror and
maintain that mirror. So, if a mirror is damaged, is put out of service
for whatever reason, its the property owner’s responsibility to provide
a new mirror, to notify us that the mirror is not there and we will
certainly share desire to have that mirror in place, because the
property owner needs it, to be able to see. [Change speaker] Did that
answer your question? ?? [Change speaker] It answers it, but I hope if
the mirror is broken and home owner doesn't replace it, I hope they
don’t revoke his driveway permit. [Change speaker] Thank you.
Representative Pittman. [Change speaker] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I just
had a question and Mr. Nance might need to answer. I’m wondering what
the standard site distance is? [Change speaker] John Nance DOT. The site
distance is an engineering decision and its affected by vertical grades
and the curvature of the road. The rule of thumb is ten feet per mile of
speed limit. For instance, a fifty-five mile per hour zone, its
generally five hundred, five hundred and fifty feet. Some of the things
we do as part of this process out west is, that we discussed earlier is,
advance signing, sometimes additional clearing on slopes and things of
that nature, the mirrors that have been mentioned. Some improvements,
some widening of pavement, some advisory speeds, lots of different kinds
of traffic engineering things that we do to notify people that things
are different and they need to be careful. [Change speaker] Any further
questions? Representative Cullen. [Change speaker] Instant comment, on
the being able to deny driveway permits. I think that the Department of
transportation is required to provide access to all properties. So I
guess I have question. Can they deny a driveway permit? [Change speaker]
Mr. Nance you want to answer that. [Change speaker] Yes Sir. We are
required to provide safe access and most all occasions we are able to do
that. Some driveways, on rare occasions may be limited to something like
a right in only, not an out. In rare occasions, you see right in and
right out on occasions, where we put an island or something like that.
So, we are required to provide reasonable, safe access and in most cases
we can do that. Very rarely do you have a very narrow piece or a
situation where we can’t come to some conclusion to get that access.
[Change speaker] Further questions to the committee? I believe
Representative Sheppard was going to make a motion. [Change speaker] Yes
Sir, Mr. Chairman I would like to make a motion for favorable report for
House Bill 684. [Change speaker] The PCS ? [Change speaker] I’m sorry,
is there a PCS on it? I didn't get it Sir. ?? a favorable report to PCS
is unfavorable to the original. I don’t see a referral on mine. Is there
a referral anywhere? [Change speaker] No referral. [Change speaker]
That’s it. [Change speaker] ?? hear the motion. All in favor say I.
Opposed no. Congratulations. [Change speaker] Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[Change speaker] We got some of our committee members have bills. This
vote is to House Bill 626 Representative Moffitt and I believe it’s the
PCS has been prepared on this. Senator the PCS has been passed out.
Motion to have the PCS before us. Representative Pittman makes the
motion to have the PCS before us. All in favor say I. Opposed no.</p>

...but first I have to go before a judge for a judicial hearing to even
get permission to be able to do something with them, and then if I want
to sell it I have to auction it, meaning that it has to go to the
highest bidder, and I may not get back out of it what I have actually
already invested in it.  I don't have the time to do those things.  I'm
a mechanic, and I need this process simplified.  So that's what I'm
trying to do, is simplify the process.  It would eliminate the judicial
hearing piece.  It still requires the certified letter.  It still goes
through the DMV.  The certified letter can be sent from the DMV or from
the mechanic, but the DMV has to be notified.  The law actually did not
allow--it didn't specify any disposal of vehicles that were over $800.
It only referred to selling vehicles that were less than $800, so this
would take away that $800 cap on the vehicle's value and allow him to be
able to sell it in a private or public sale without the judicial
hearing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Question, Representative Jeter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Representative McManus, if
you take out the judicial process, who gets to determine the lien on the
property, or is the lien on the property determined by one judicial
process and the sale by another, or...?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  It goes through the DMV still.  They determine--and
they would actually--the certified letter, if it comes back--the person
that owes the money can still request a hearing, and if they do, then
there is a hearing, and it is required.  His problem is that he has sent
letters that have come back without any response, or any request.  He
knows one of the people had moved to Virginia; he doesn't know where.
So he has sent letters to be forwarded, certified letters, but now the
next step would be the judicial hearing, since the letters came back
with no response, no request for a hearing.  So now he's in that limbo.
So this would still--if the person owing the money wanted the hearing,
it would still be available to them.  It's if they don't respond to the
certified letter that then the DMV can determine--and it actually
specifies in here how the value is determined by the DMV, so that they
know the value of the car, and any money that he could make off the car,
over and above what he has invested in it, does return to the DMV.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Starnes
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you.  What?  Help me understand the process.
Let's say that the mechanic decides to sell the automobile because the
owner doesn't come in and doesn't pay for it, and I buy that automobile.
 How do I get a clear title to the car then?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The DMV would issue the title.  That was how it
worked before, even if it went through the option process, but the
DMV--once that certified letter comes back with no response, the DMV
assumes the title for it, and then the DMV would issue the title when it
was sold.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  And then--but the DMV would apply the same standards
as to determine whether or not it would require a salvage title.  So
let's say the car had been in a wreck, and they fixed it, and it was in
the excess of 50% of its value.  Then would the DMV issue a brand new
title?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  There was no provision in that in the prior Bill, so
I didn't address the salvage issue.  I'm sorry, I don't have an answer
for that.  I don't know if Staff would.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Does the Staff have an answer for that?  The Staff
says this doesn't deal with salvage vehicles.
{SPEAKER CHANGES]  Doesn't what?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  This Bill addresses vehicles that are being serviced
or repaired by a provider.  It doesn't deal with salvage titles and
salvage vehicles.  This is just any vehicle.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I'm following ??.  I understand that, but let's say
that they brought the car in because it had been in an accident, and it
had been wrecked, and so they fixed it up, but the repairs were more
than 50% of the value of the car.  Wouldn't it then be required to have
a branded or a salvage title?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  That sounds like a DMV question, but does the Staff
know that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Well this--I guess what I was trying to say was this
doesn't change anything with relationship to a salvage...</p>

The standards for salvage title would still apply representative
Sternz.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does that answer the question? Ok.
Representative Blackwell. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you mr chairman. I'm a
little bit concerned whether I understand this fully. If I do somewhat
then I'm a little bothered. Maybe I could ask Mr Perry or one of the
staff a legal question I think. In the wording on the first page I read
it to say that if you have a notice that informs the recipient, that his
or her property may be sold pursuant to this section without a judicial
hearing. If the certified mail notice is returned as undeliverable that
seems to say notice is effective provided its not received. And I'm not
what kinda of effective notice that is. I mean. Is that in fact what
we're saying. We're gonna require you to give a notice but the way you
get to rely on it is that you prove that the person to whom notice was
given never received it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is the question directed to
the staff? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe it was directed to Mr Perry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The language that you're referring to is, I would
assume to encourage the person to keep the mechanic informed as to an
address. So that, they're telling us that if we don't have an address
and we sent out mail and its returned to us. Then theres a possibility
that you will lose your car. So we tell them upfront. If we don't have
the correct address and we send you mail and it comes back then you
could lose your car. Thats basically what thats saying. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I read the wording that is
underlined there as saying if the person cant reasonably be ascertained
its or. I dont see, where is the part that says that you're on notice
that if you dont keep me informed as to where you are that I could send
you a letter later saying I can sell this without further notice
provided you don't receive the notice. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the staff
have an answer for that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm not sure I understand the
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Which line are you referring to
representative Blackwell. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Which staff member or which
question?[SPEAKER CHANGES] Which line [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ok on the first
page, house bill 620. Do we have a PCS? No Ok. If you look on lines 25
through 29 the underline language thats being added to the bill. It says
that except that the notice shall further inform the recipient that the
property may be sold pursuant to this section without a judicial hearing
if the certified mail notice is returned as undeliverable. Which seems
to me to say, you give notice that you can sell it without a judicial
hearing provided that it comes back and its not been delivered. Which
seems to me to say the notice didn't get delivered. That somehow doesn't
make sense to me. And i'm trying to clarify if i'm reading it wrong.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If you look, and I dont know if this will help any but
on page 2 line 22 the current law is that if the certified mail notice
has been returned as undeliverable of if the name of the person having
legal title to the vehicle cannot be legally ascertained then the leiner
can institute special proceedings. So those two factors are already in
the law and those are the standards by which they determine whether or
not the property can be sold through a judical now this created an
exception so if theres a problem with it maybe i dont know if DMV could
help us out with this or not. [SPEAKER CHANGES] mr chairman may i follow
up on that. In what I'm looking at is page 2...</p>

<p id="45:00">
Hiking the language about a special proceeding a special proceeding if
it were done in a case where somebody didn't receive notice which is
what the law currently says as I understand it the special proceeding
would require that you got to notify the opposing party so they know
that your disposing of their property we are changing that as i see it
to say so you don't get noticeable special proceeding there's no
judicial hearing and one of the two ways that you establish your right
to sell it without the person having a chance to appear is by simply
saying here's my certified letter that came back undelivered which means
they didn't get the notice it doesn't proved that they didn't have an
address it maybe somebody was on vacation you know im at home and i
leave my car at a dealership where you you know maybe the car broke down
and triple A hauls me over there I'm going out of town on a trip gone
two weeks there's a ten-day notice I think in here I don't know that it
would happen that quickly but you know send me a certified letter they
leave me a little thing in my box two or three times in a box that says
if you dont come by the post office and claim it i dont know about the
rest of you but sometimes that little slip gets in between the other
papers at my house and it may be that the letter get sent back that's my
concern is I don't want to make life hard on the mechanic but i want to
be sure people get fair and accurate notice and that we don't streamline
this so much that we are allowing premature sales [Speaker Change]
gentlemen in the rear identify yourself can you add some information to
our discussion [Speaker Change] yes i will assist if i can tracy davis
im the assistant supervisor with the department of motor vehicles here
in Raleigh over the notice and storage section if i could just say our
concern is that this bill will take out a layer of protection for
consumer as well as the lien holder we've seen instances where certified
mail that we send the first time and I agree with you that notice
telling you that if you don't get the notice your not going to get the
hearing he won't  be aware of that our feeling is our first notice if it
becomes returned unclaimed then we send it to the court process they
require further certified notices had that person been out-of-town
Postal Service we solve three instances where this would be of benefit
to have special proceedings Postal Service puts the card in the mail in
the mailbox they wait seven days if it's not picked up they do that
again and then wait another seven days on the 14th day they notify us
that is has been undelivered so at that point we consider it to be
undelivered  when that's an owner or lien holder had that consumer or
that owner been out-of-town they may get the next notices of court
proceeding requires that notice we have seen instances where folks maybe
have not  processed their titles yet maybe its a vehicle they bought and
had the mechanic work on it then they processed their title then maybe
they would recieve subsequent notices the court would send as well as
the statute allows you to wait 60 days to change your address so if we
have sent the first notice and you didnt get it post office works of a
14 day calendar you could abide by the statute changer address any
subsequent notice that the special proceeding send you may recieve
because the address may have been changed and you abide by the actual
statute requiring the address to be changed [Speaker Change] ???? all
the names i have got and want to speak on the bill we are going to
displace this bill at the agreement with the sponsor and move on to the
next bill and she can work on this and come back next meeting thank you
lets see all the names we have that are going to speak on this bill. ok
bill 759 residentual brown brian brown the other brown i dont believe
there is a pcs on this the bill is before us [Speaker Change] thank you
mister chariman members under current statutes it prohibits operation of
a motor vehicle car truck tractor trailor bus unless it is equipped one
operational red or amber stop lamp on the back of the vehicle this bill
simply changes that statute to require operation of a motor vehicle
truck tractor trailor bus ect to have two operational red or amber stop
lamps on each</p>

side of the vehicle. With that I'll yield for questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
OK, Representative Carney.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was telling Representative Brown that
Representative Mitch Setzer and I have a identical bill, so at the
appropriate time I'd like to be recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Bumgardner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
A lot of classic and antique vehicles don't have but one tail light on
one side. Especially pickup trucks. What are we going to do about that?
Are they going to be exempt, or going to have to put another light on?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
That would probably be a good question for staff. That's not something I
considered in the draft of this legislation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Mr. Chairman, this bill applies to vehicles manufactured after December
31st 1955.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
OK, Representative Bumgardner, follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up. There's a lot of vehicles made after that date that only have
one tail light. I happen to know, having worked on a lot of older cars.
Really, especially pickup trucks, it was the mid, early to mid '60's
before it was typical to have a tail light on both sides. I'm just
saying, a lot of guys like to drive their old pickup trucks, and cars
too for that matter. If you look at a car made in the, anybody that's
old enough, a car made in the '30's or '40's they've got one tail light
on one side. And I know it exempts vehicles that old and most cars in
the '50's and on up were 12-volts and had two tail lights, but trucks
especially would have one light, one brake light, one tag, one light to
light the tag. If you look at trucks like Chevrolets made in the late
'50's, I happen to know, I have one tail light on one side. I'm just
saying.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Further questions?
Representative Jeter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Members, we're going to do an amendment to bump the date to 1970.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Mr. Chairman, at the appropriate time move approval of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
OK, we are going to have an amendment before us, momentarily. To change
that date from 1955 to 1970.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Mr. Chairman. Torbett over here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Torbett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Just to make sure that it doesn't bring reference that some of us may
have driven those cars in '70 and they are not be referred to as
antiques.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Point taken.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
OK. Without having the amendment at hand, do I have a motion to approve
the amendment to change the date from 1970...?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
So moved.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Jeter makes a motion, second by Representative Arp.
All in favor of that amendment ?? by saying aye. Opposed, no.
Thank you very much. The bill is now back before us.
Further questions on the bill?
Representative Arp.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Motion to approve the bill with enrolling it into Committee Substitute
of the amendment. And unfavorable to the original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
OK, we have the motion. Representative Bumgardner will speak again. A
question again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just know that if you have an unintended
consequence of making these antique car guys mad, they're fanatics and I
know because I've been one of them. And so you've made a good move
moving that date. Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
You're welcome.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I support the bill now. Fully.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Got one more vote. Thank you.
Representative Moffitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Actually, I apologize I wasn't really paying
attention to the bill sponsor in the beginning of the debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, sir.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Essentially what were doing is were establishing
probable cause in regards to law enforcement being able to pull someone
over if they only have one operable tail light is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This did come to my attention as addressing a court of
appeals case that a law enforcement officer pulled a vehicle over with
one operable stop light, tail light and the case was ultimately decided
that that was not a probable justification for stopping that individual.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Assuming everyone had time to read titles, if there's
any questions, I'll be right here Mr.Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Excuse me? I didn't catch that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Going on your ?? as it being a simple bill, if you
read the title, that pretty much explains everything. If you have any
questions, I'm available.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Simple local Bill for the town of Bellmont,
Representative Shepard. Any further comments or questions? Motion will
be in order
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes sir Mr.Chairman. ?? time for favorable report.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have a motion on that for the Committee to consider.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, I believe there were legal questions that were
being answered so were going to entertain a motion from Representative
Dollar
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would move that we send the bill to Judiciary A
without prejudice
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Okay that's passing the bill on to Judiciary A and
there we hope the legal questions will be ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Can you repeat the Bill number?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The bill number is House Bill 620.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What this will allow them to do is will allow the
Judiciary A Committee to address the, essentially its a legal issue. It
will allow them to address it, and at least have some prospect for the
Bill to, the Bill to be considered prior to crossover.

Judiciary A without prejudice. Any further comment on the motion? All in

questions asked of Mr.Moffitt that stand us between.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Correction noted.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.Chairman, Members of the Committee. This
is a Senate idea, that started with Senator Harry Brown in regards to
establishing administrative regions throughout the sate that makes a
little sense in regards to D.O.T. ?? and with a study in regards to the
economic development partnerships.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The transportation portion of this, which is what this
Committee is to consider. This Bill goes to Environment next, then it
goes to Commerce, then it goes to Appropriations. But D.O.T. is really
the, the D.O.T. districts, which there are fourteen, is the basic map
for the administrative districts. Were taking the fourteen and combining
them into seven. That way the
