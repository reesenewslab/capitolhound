The old storm water rules were actually coming into conflict with the
new storm water rules. Things we had to go through, one was a 48 inch
steel pipe that was coming out of the ground which was then deemed to be
naturalized because it was under the old EPA regulation, older
environmental regulation. They weren’t able to remove the pipe. But what
we’re trying to do is trying to make sure that if you’re re-development
or project that these brand new rules don’t interfere with a project
that was originally built with the old rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Comment on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Mr. President. Thank you, Senator Brock. My read of the
amendment is that it would make it more difficult for water sources that
are impaired that suffer from storm water for them to benefit from new
rules that apply when a development is under major re-development, that
seems to be the right time to put in new storm water rules. I agree with
you if it’s existing development and the rules didn’t apply at the
original development, they should be grandfathered, but when you’re
doing a re-development, it seems like that it should be subject to the
new rules just as a new development would be. I’m concerned about the
impact of this amendment on my constituents drinking water and Jordan
Lake and Falls Lake so I’ll be voting against this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there and further discussion or debate on amendment one.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, on the amendment, I may be mistaken, but do you still
have to go through a, in accordance of 89C general statutes of having
the right calculations made with the storm water variables permeability,
infiltration, and retention of partially impervious materials including
gravel, mulch and pavement. I think some of the data that you’re looking
at will still be part of it. If you want you, we can hold off the third
reading until tomorrow to make sure everybody’s clear on it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brock, I believe that was your first speaking on the amendment.
The first was an explanation of the amendment, under the rules. Is there
and further discussion or debate on amendment one. Hearing none, the
question before the Senate is the passage of amendment one to House Bill
201. All in favor vote aye, all opposed vote no. Five seconds will be
allowed for the voting. The clerk will record the vote.
33 having voted in the affirmative and 15 in the negative, amendment one

Senator Brock, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. House Bill 201 was introduced last year, was a
good idea. I think we’ve taken it a little bit further. What we’re
looking at, we ran into an area, we ran into this issue in my area, of a
large project, in fact it was one of the largest economic development
projects in the state of North Carolina. A company bought an old mill
that was in very, very good shape. In fact, it’s one of the best built
buildings in the state. Under the new energy code, they would have to
implement energy savings on the building that the weight of the
insulation could not...or would be too much of a load on the roof and
the structure. What this will do...and also goes back to other mills
that we have throughout North Carolina because currently we have 153
million square feet of unutilized space. We have a lot of empty mills in
the state of North Carolina and basically if a company wants to move
into that building under the 2009 energy codes, not the 2012 energy
codes, but the 2009 energy codes, and used that building for
manufacturing or some other purpose, they don’t have to try to update to
the new technology of the new insulation. Because a lot of the building,
they cannot handle that type of insulation on that roof. You’re
building’s going to sit empty. For the one company in Davie County that
it happened to, it cost them over $20 million in revenue lost because of
opportunity loss. If they...they told me if they knew that North
Carolina had these 2012 energy codes...</p>

The first year that we have moved now from a ten year to a five. The
savings to the state was one basis point which is .01% in the
retirement. The reason we’re looking to move back is I believe that a
