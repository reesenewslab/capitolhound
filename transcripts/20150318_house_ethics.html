  Ladies and gentlemen, we will call the meeting to order. This is the
House Ethics Committee. We have some folks with us that are helping us
out today in conducting this committee and the sergeant at arms are
Marvin Lee and Reggie Sills and Terry McCraw, and Chris McCracken. Thank
you, gentlemen, for helping us out today. We also have one of our pages
with us, Tabby Zorn, where is Tabby, over here? Tell us a little bit
about you, Tabby, where are you from and so forth, where do you go to
school? You don&#39;t get many opportunities to do this, now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I am a [??], but actually I am an exchange student from Germany.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Germany?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, it was a program, if you were [??] exchanged [??].
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, we&#39;re glad to have you. What part of Germany are you from?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The West of Germany, nearby Dusseldorf.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh, yes. Well, welcome, we&#39;re glad to have you with us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can I ask her a question? I [??] what school in [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, appreciate you being with us. I&#39;m John Faircloth and one
of the chairs of this committee and Representative Glazier, Chairman
Glazier is the other chair and I&#39;ll start out by saying that we
consider this a very, very important committee. Everyone knows that when
you take on the responsibility of representing the people back home who
thought enough of us to put us here, that you also take on the
responsibility of doing things int he right way and we are definitely
committed to that. This will be a relatively straightforward meeting,
we&#39;re not taking up any controversial subjects or anything today. We
wanted to be able to get together and talk about the committee, what our
responsibilities are, and how we interact with the other parts of the
system here. This is a matter that&#39;s obviously the concern of every
legislator and certainly every House member and weh ave some folks here
who have been around a good while and have served on this committee
before and we have others who are relatively new to the legislature,
perhaps, and certainly new to the committee. So you will have some
handouts, committee members, that were passed around I think. What we
will do, we will have three presentations, the first of these is from
Brad, is it Krehely, Brad? Brad will talk to us about a brief overview
of this committee so, Brad, come on up. I&#39;ll remind you that the
lights that you see ont he desk are, if you have a question or
something, that light should be green. If it&#39;s on green you&#39;re
being heard, if it&#39;s on red you&#39;re not being heard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee. I&#39;m Brad
Krehely, I&#39;m a staff attorney with the research division and I&#39;m
counsel to the House Ethics Committee. The Chair has asked me to give
you just a brief overview of this committee and how it works, how
it&#39;s different from the Legislative Ethics Committee, and just how
our staff at the General Assembly is organized to deal with ethics
issues. So what&#39;s the House Ethics Committee? The House Ethics
Committee is a standing committee of the General Assembly and like other
standing committees, bills are referred to the committee and heard. The
House Ethics Committee should not be confused with the Legislative
Ethics Committee. As a standing committee we sometimes have substantive
presentations like we do today. The Legislative Ethics Committee is a
little bit different, it is a joint committee with House and Senate
members, it is bipartisan in equal number, so there are six democrats,
six republicans, twelve people total, it&#39;s also bicameral in equal
numbers. So you have six senators and six representatives on the
Legislative Ethics Committee. The Legislative Ethics Committee is
different because it is involved in some different responsibilities. It
issues advice. So it does formal advisory opinions when a legislator
comes directly to the Legislative Ethics Committee. It also takes
recommended advisory opinions from the State Ethics Commission and
either approves or modifies them. Those recommended advisory opinions
become final advisory opinions. The other thing the committee is it
investigates complaints. The Legislative Ethics Committee has
occasionally made suggested changes to the ethics laws. So if you&#39;re
on both of those committees, understand that they are different
committees with different functions. In terms of how our staff is
organized, we have an ethics training and advising staff that consists
of Tim Hovis, Erika Churchill, and Denise Adams. If you&#39;ve done your
ethics training

  of you already know them if you haven&#39;t done it yet you&#39;ll get
to work with them. They also give informal advice so if you don&#39;t
want to get a formal advisory opinion from the state ethics commission
or the legislative ethics committee go to Erika, Tim, and Deniese and
they&#39;re happy to help. We also have a group that primarily staffs
the legislative ethics committee that&#39;s Bill Patterson, Susan Barem,
and me. And our job is to assist the chairs there when we have things
before us like advisory opinions or investigations. And then finally the
House ethics committee which is this committee is kind of a hybrid of
the two staffs. Bill Patterson, Denise Adams and I are assigned to the
committee. But as a practical matter you may be working with Erika, Tim,
and Susan Barem as well. So Mr. Chairman that kind of concludes the
brief overview of how we&#39;re organized and what this committee does
we look forward to working with you and just let us know how we can help
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you are there any questions? Representative Glazier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It&#39;s just one and ?? as well. Part of the function of this committee
is to handle bills that are referred to it and ethics bills on changes
in legislation that either it initiates or that are referred to it.
Would that be accurate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s correct. And committees and house committees can also
introduce their own bills as well. But certainly bills that are referred
to here as we&#39;re doing today informational presentations for
interested parties all of that is appropriate and the committees can do
that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions? Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Now we&#39;ll go to the state ethics commission and talk about some
recommended revisions they may have. And this is presented by Perry
Newsome who is the executive director of the North Carolina state ethics
commission. Welcome to the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Glad to have you with us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Thank you for having
us I am the executive director for the ethics commission.  I&#39;d like
to introduce two staff members I have with me today. You probably have
or may deal with either of these people in the future. I have our
assistant director Pam Cashwell and our advice attorney Cathy Edwards.
Just very very briefly because I know the time is short and the marching
orders today as I understand them are to give a brief ten minute
overview of the commission what it does and then talk about any kind of
special requests or issues there may be on the table right now. And
I&#39;ll try to do that as quickly as I can. For those of you that
don&#39;t recall the commission consists of eight members. Four
appointed by the governor four by the general assembly two of those
members by recommendation by the speaker of the house and the other two
by the president pro tem of the Senate. We have a staff of thirteen
members and the ethics commission administers primarily two laws the
ethics laws the state government ethics act chapter one thirty eight A
and the lobbying law. Everything the commission does is mandated by law.
We follow it&#39;s a the older version from 2012 because we haven&#39;t
reprinted them. But we basically administer the laws contained in that
book. And trying to fulfil our statutory mission along those lines.
I&#39;m going to talk about the four primary functions that the
commission performs pursuant to that law. Every single one of them
mandated by the ethics act or the lobbying law or both. First is the
financial personal interest disclosure process. The statements of
economic interest now that&#39;s the one thing that I know that every
one of you is familiar with because you have filed one or more in your
careers. And just as a side note or reminder you have to do another one
very soon the deadline is coming up in less than a month. So please keep
that in mind. There are two options for filing now manual and online
filing. There are approximately seven thousand you are among seven
thousand filers that we have. However last year we had over ten thousand
filings. How does that happen you might ask the reason is some people
file multiple forms there is turn over during the year on covered
boards. Even sometimes in the legislature as you know. And so some
people file more than one document as the year go on. Electronic filing
is becoming much more prevalent and we&#39;re very happy about that.
That was instituted in 2012 and last year four thousand people took
advantage of online filing. Leaving a difference of four thousand filing
manually. Once an SCI is filed then we have a legal duty per the law to
evaluate those statements of economic interest for most filers not for
all of them but for most. And what that means is we take the disclosures
in those forms and we look

Those who analyze that and do as much research into that as we need to,
to try to identify areas of intersection or overlap between the private
interest and holdings that are reveal there in your public duties. So
the purpose of that is evaluations is to identify those areas of
possible or potential as it’s called “Conflicts of Interest” doesn’t
mean there is anything wrong it just means that is the potential that
people have to be careful of that. Now, you all don’t skip us, we do not
evaluate, the law is not require us to evaluate legislators or judicial
officials and for good reason so that’s why sometimes this concept is
important to legislators but it is a big part of what we do and it
involves a whole bunch of people. Another recent development for the
disclosure process is online access to statements of economic interest
starting last month 2015 and future statements of economic interest will
be available online that is excluding personal contact information. We
revise the forms this year starting 2015 to separate the personal
contact information from the substantive disclosures in the statement of
economic interest for various reasons and only the substantive
information is available online is still in public records that people
can gain in another way but it’s not just gonna be available on the
website. Second, main legal function that we perform is advice and
that’s Cathy Edwards just introduced earlier Advice Attorney, we are
very, very fortunate to have and she has been doing this since 2006 and
so she has a lot of experience doing that and she does a good job
heading up that section and this is where we provide specific guidance
to people, public servants, legislators, anybody who is affected or
covered by the lobbying law with regard to a specific situation or a
specific conduct that they have a question about. And it is our legal
duty to issue this advice, if someone asked us we have a legal duty to
respond and comply with the law by doing that. As you might imagine, the
types of request we get very greatly from the simple answers to which we
can give on the spot immediately to very complex, some very complex
difficult questions that take a long time to answer. There are two types
of advice—Informal Advice and Formal Opinions, the informal advice is
given by staff some of that what Brad described, you can call the Ethics
Commission and staff can give you informal advice or their formal
opinions they are issued by the Full Ethics Commission and consideration
at a meeting. All forms of advice whether it will be informal or formal
is strictly confidential, none of that is made public unless the
requester makes it that way. We have found that request for advice are
very ___[03:20] in nature and you folks generate a spike in request when
you are in town we get more request for advice, when you leave town
those requests get down a little bit and that’s completely
understandable, there is more going on, there is more interactions, and
there are more questions about what people should or should not do, and
it also bring a spike in advice request. In 2014, we address nearly 600
requests for advice. The third major function that we perform is
inquiries and complaints. The commission handles complaints under both
the ethic side and lobbying law and there are very specific requirements
as to how those complaints must be filled and move forward under the
Ethics Act not so much on the lobbying law but under the Ethics Act is
one of the more extensive sections in the statue and it fills out fairly
precisely what has to happen at each stage. For example, complaints
under the Ethics Act have to be signed and anonymous complaints so they
have to be meet those formality requirements. Once those objective
standards are met however it’s a very low threshold for moving beyond
the first stage and that is it’s pretty much an allegation standard if
someone allegedly says the right thing or the right gives right facts
then we take that for granted, we take those as true and then move to
the second phase of the complaint investigation. Last year we handled
190…

  <p id="15:00">
  It&#39;s an increase. Finally, the education function is the fourth main
function that we perform. You&#39;re also aware of that from past
experience. And we help educate not only yourselves, or assist the
Legislative Ethics Committee with that function, but also public
servants. That&#39;s their largest number of people that take part in
the education program. But also lobbyists as well. We do at least one
dedicated lobbying program per year just for them. And then there are
components of the lobbying law, as you know, that are covered in the
other basic presentations.
Okay, finally. I wanna use the last bit of time that I have to talk
about the subject that is mentioned on the agenda. And that is proposed
statutory changes. I have to give you some background on this in order
to kind of introduce it. And I am, I know we don&#39;t have time to go
into the specific proposed changes today. Because there are too many of
them. And this is just an introductory meeting. But going back to when
the ethics law was passed in 2006. And really starting, it was effective
2007.
We had just been encountering situations, issues, questions in
administering this thing for now going on nine years, where we would
find areas that we think might benefit from some changes. Some of those
changes are, most of the changes actually, are of the technical or minor
nature. Some are more substantive than that. But these are born of an
actual experience of dealing with this law for over eight years. Several
years ago, we started, staff started it and then the commission was
definitely involved towards the end of this process, but we started
identifying these areas that we thought, going to both the ethics act
and the lobbying law provisions that would benefit from changes.
Again, some minor some not. It culminated last year with the ethics
commission actually taking up proposed, possible proposed changes and
approving submission of those to the general assembly for its
consideration. And there, it&#39;s a fairly imposing looking document.
And it&#39;s something I ?? Got a lot of pages. That&#39;s why I said
I&#39;m not prepared to go over this this afternoon. I don&#39;t think
you want me to. And more recently, last month, the commission revisited
those proposed changes.
Added a few and then prioritized some and authorized that those be
presented this session. And that&#39;s what we are doing currently. I
would offer to come back at a later time and present those in whatever
detail that you would like. Answer any questions that you might have,
and in any. Just basically address those in any way that you would  deem
fit. So I think that&#39;s probably more time than I was alloted. I
apologize for that. But, any questions, I&#39;ll be happy to ?? at your
discretion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir ?? questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Mr.
Chairman. So I wonder if it would be useful for us to, prior to, I think
the next meeting we have the targeted bill to look at. But the following
meeting was the one they&#39;re after to sit down and go through the
document. But to get the document out to committee members and staff
maybe in this next week. So they&#39;d have a week or two to look at it
before we started in on it.
Would that make some sense? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative ?? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Would it be possible to just give a
brief oral overview of some of the ?? the changes right now? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Sure. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Would that be possible right now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure. I think we have time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I dunno
?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I could very briefly go over the commissions. ??
The top. What they&#39;ve identified as a top priority.
And again when you see these, you&#39;ll go through a lot of them.
It&#39;s change this name to that name. Things of that minor in nature.
So you know they&#39;re not all, don&#39;t think that they&#39;re all
of, you know, momentous impact in going through the act. But just things
that we&#39;ve encountered that might make it better. But the top ones,
the first one is actually a complete rewrite of the complaints section.
And we have found that in administering that there are some, again, some
terminology issues.
Some things might be a little bit confusing as to the names of stages of
the process. And so just going through that, we have proposed a complete
rewrite of the complaints section. We&#39;ve actually, that&#39;s one of
the ones we have actually written the proposed changes. So there is a
section when you see it, it will be as rewritten. I&#39;m sure bill
drafting will have a lot to say about what that looks like. But you can
get the gist of what we&#39;re going for on those. And so that&#39;s a
fair.

  <p id="20:00">
  Comprehensive one and it includes a lot of specific changes. Another one
is clarifying for the Commission what it means to be associated with the
Department of Administration for administrative purposes, that’s what
the law says and it really is a fiscal issue as to whether or not being
associated with the Department of Administration means that they are to
provide Human Resources and fiscal services for us incident to that cest
we charge as opposed to being able to charge independently for that.
That is in most respects not a tremendously large issue except for us in
these tight budget times. Another one is provisional appointments and
evaluations. Right now the way the law is, certain public servants can
be appointed provisionally, meaning that they can be appointed if they
just file their SEI, their Statement of Economic Interest with us and
then we will evaluate it as soon as we can, but they go ahead and take
their position. These are primarily Community College Trustees and
University Trustees and that was put in there for a very good reason.
The proposal was to make everybody provisional in that way and pretty
much the practical reason for that is because in the appointment process
and the way these people get covered sometimes we get large, large
groups at one time, so for example when the appointments bill comes down
there are just hundreds of people on that. These metropolitan planning
organizations and rural transportation planning organizations, they have
large blocks of turnover at a given time and what we want to avoid is a
situation where we just cannot physically with the staff we have do
those before those people need to take their seats or they are found to
be in some technical or worse violation of the law because they are
taking their positions and taking official actions without being
evaluated so we that that that’s a good change that basically just makes
it the same for some appointees as others. Another one is what we call
the board to board SEI filings provision. There was a law passed last
year that implemented by any old SEI evaluation, those evaluations I
told you about with those 6,000 evaluations that we had to do was just a
little bit much to handle and so in response to that a bill was passed
that established biannual, every other year evaluations for people and
we’ve established a schedule for that but there’s an exception in there
that if someone is serving on one board and they are appointed to
another board, a totally different board, it could be the Electrolysis
Board Member that’s appointed to the Board of Governors, could not be
any different. Could not be any diverse in the nature of those duties
but the law says that that second one, the appointment to the second one
they do not have to file a second statement of economic interest which I
understand from a burden standpoint. I wouldn’t want to fill out another
one either but the problem is that when we evaluate those statements as
we have to they do not get a true evaluation for the second one because
they’re exempt from that process, so what it could lead to, we have not
encountered problems necessarily along this line, but what it could lead
to is someone being appointed to that second board and there’s no
warning of what the potential pitfalls might be from a conflict
standpoint. And then the last one has to deal with SEI compliance and
that is in the process of enforcing the filing of those SEIs. There are
certain time deadlines for people. One the filing deadline reaches there
are 30 days, then 30 days after receipt of a notice from us they’re
subject to a $250 fine. 60 days after that receipt they’re subject to
being removed from their position and the recommendation is to just
shorten that schedule and tie those 30 day and 60 day periods to the
date of our notices, the letters, as opposed to the receipt Sometimes
receipt is difficult I guess to show in some cases. So those are the top
five that have been identified but again there are many more, a lot of
which are technical in nature. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further questions?
Thank you so much for being with us. I appreciate that and as you can
tell from that presentation we’ve got some work ahead of us. We have one
ore presentation but before I get to that I’d like to recognize a couple
of folks, Kim, is it Straight, Straich, Kim Straich over here with the
Board of Elections I believe and

weekly meetings and the next one that might will be the next week will
be the first day of hearing which was file the other day so at least
that’s a likely agenda for next time and I just wanna to announce that
but thank you and to say we have incredible staff and incredible clerks,
and it’s an honor to work with Representative Faircloth and this
committee is one of the committees where we work together and there is
really ever any partisanship and it’s safe for us all to try to make the

and it’s always a comfort to do so. Briefly I want to talk about three
things, we were asked to speak about what our program does, to talk
about concerns, to talk about solutions and that sort of thing.
Secretary of States Lobbying Compliance Division role here is basically
to look to the folks who are being paid by someone else to influence
public policy development. And the way that is done within the framework
of the law is that these folks are to identify themselves and primarily
that’s done through a registration or function with our office and their
employers are to also do the same and to assure us publicly that they
have authorized people do to lobbyist to speak with you on their behalf.
In addition these folks are obligated by…

  Well, to make regular expense reports and what then happens to this
registration information and what happens to these expense reports is
that we put it up on our public website for the various folks involved
in public policy development and even the observers to look in and see
this information and to make of it what they wish to do so. The
information is not really there for Secretary of State’s office. It is
provided to us to make available to other people. To show you some
measure of how much interest there is in this information on the
Lobbying Compliance Division website of the Secretary of State’s office,
in the last 12 months there were 992,000 hits. That is a lot. Now, my
colleague Miss Brown is going to speak in a moment about the mechanics
of how we do things. But basically, the function of this information is
to identify at the highest level to the public servants who it is that
is being employed and who is employing them, so that servants who all
lobbied recognize that it is a situation where somebody’s a paid
advocate. And, the public servants are then in a better position to
weigh the relative significance of the information that’s provided in
whatever way they were to see fit to do so. But, you are some of the
primary beneficiaries of this system. Miss Brown is going to speak about
what we do and how we do it and what the resources are and then I’d like
to speak to you a little bit more about another few dimensions of this
process. Yes ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. My name is Jill Brown and I’m the director of the Lobbying
Compliance Division for the North Carolina Department of the Secretary
of State. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, thank you for
having us today. I want to talk about the mechanics of how we do things
and how registrations and reports are processed in our division.
Registrations are electronically filed.  The fee is $250 and that, of
course, is paid electronically and goes to the general fund. If you have
previously registered, that information is pre-populated. So, if you
registered last year, that information is pre-populated. If you are a
first time filer, then you have to enter all the information into the
database. After we receive them, we examine them. We determine if they
have complied with all the information that is required by law and then
we publish them on our publicly available website, where people can use
either the lobbyist’s first or last name, to find the registration and
the principal’s name to find a registration for the principal
registration or to see who is representing the principal. For reporting,
those are electronically filed as well. There are 2 methods. Some of the
information is pre-populated and we have provided to you with examples
of some of the forms. If a lobbyist does not have any expenditures that
they have to report, then we have a very short form which is a one
pager. If they have more than something to report, then that report is a
four pager. We review the reports to see if the correct person has
signed the report, sometimes that does not happen. We also review it to
determine whether not their notarization is proper and if they had added
the amounts that they report that they had spent on a designating person
is added correctly. Once that is done, that report is placed on the
website. The registrations populate the directory. The directory is
updated every 24 hours. If someone registers and we process their
registration today, it is placed on the website today. The directory is
also provided on the public website. It’s updated every 24 hours. We
send a directory to every designated person every 20 days, when the
General Assembly is in session and every 60 days when you’re not in
session. Who does all this work and all this processing? That would be
?? review officers and they review all the documents to determine if
they are in compliance with the law. They also provide customer service.
That customer service means for example, if someone if having difficulty
filing their registration electronically, they will walk them through
it, either on telephone or they can come into our office and register as
well. We also have a scanner, so people can also file their reports as
well if they are having difficulty.

  <p id="35:00">
  Thank you for the opportunity to explain how the system works and now I
will turn it over to back Chief Deputy Mattox.
Chief Deputy Mattox : Thank you Mr. Chairman. There are three points
that I think anyone who wants to look at this area of the law, keep in
mind. In a general sense the laws relating to ethics and lobbying and
these functions probably represent the most complex intersection of
constitutional rights that any agency is ever going to be faced with
trying to administer a program. And that imposes some limitations on the
way things are done but they aren&#39;t things that we can&#39;t work
around but I just want to point out to you that almost everybody
that&#39;s involved in the intersection of these issues has some very
specific substantial constitutional rights that have to be taken into
account, as these things are adjusted one way or the other and they are
periodically adjusted.
(Mattox continues): The second thing is, that the portion of the
Secretary of State&#39;s domain, sort of speak, is primarily dealing
with people coming from the private sector commercial environment, while
lobbyist interact with the general assembly and executive branch
officials that is still basically a competitive business industry with
themselves and they compete as you well know, all of that is in sharp
contrast to looking at what a public official is doing or needs to be
apprised of.  In overall, the central theme, at the moment,  in the law
as we understand it to be for the Secretary of State is that the
disclosure of the information is the primary tool for implementing the
role that the Secretary of State is supposed to have. So, there are some
privacy considerations that are appropriate on the public servant side
of the equation that are not always present when you are your dealing on
the side that relates to commercial businesses.  Mr. Chairman that&#39;s
pretty much a summary that is the best we can do in ten minutes.  We
would be available to come back at your pleasure.  We appreciate the
opportunity to be here today.  We would ask that you consider
institutionalizing this and having us at least once a year to come back.
Change Speaker: Thank you sir, any questions? Thank you so much Mr.
Mattox.  Are there any other questions from the committee while you are
here? Please Keep an eye out for information from our two clerks Becky
Bowerban and Megan Lewis.  We probably will be, as Chairman Blazer said,
we will probably be meeting on a weekly basis at least until we get
through the legislative matters we need to handle. And if any of you on
the committee have a suggestion of perhaps someone who may need to come
and offer information for us please let us know we would love to do
that.  Are there any other comments?
(Silence)
If not we stand adjourned
