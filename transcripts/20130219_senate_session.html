The Senate will come to order. Sergeant at Arms will close the doors.
Members will go to their seats. Members and guests of the gallery will
please silence all electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayers,
Reverend Peter Milhausen, Chaplain. All members and guests in the
gallery will please stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please pray with me. Gracious and loving God, have
mercy on us. Lord have mercy. For sometimes we do not know what we are
doing. Have mercy Lord. And turn our minds from our lives to being able
to hear your divine wisdom from on high. You are better than the fullest
purse, Lord. Or the most magnificent income. Broad acres of grain fields
do not yield the peace that comes from your side.
Lord you are Jehovah-Jireh, the Lord who will provide. You are
Jehovah-Rapha, the Lord who heals. So Lord we call upon you in this time
of need to strengthen us with your voice and to give us the courage that
has to come from you. We pray in the name of Jesus. Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Berger is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. The journal of Monday,
February 18, 2013, has been examined and is found to be correct. I move
that we dispense with the reading of the journal and let it stand
approved as written.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection, the journal for February 18th stand
approved as written. Leaves of absence are granted for Senators Blue and
Senator Nesbitt.
Senators we have a nurse of the day and an EMT of the day. If Gayle Lane
and Alton Lane from Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, will please stand.
Thank you for being with us today.
And upon a motion of Senator Brent Jackson of Sampson County, the
chair’s happy to extend courtesies of the gallery to members of the
Lakewood High School Student Council, their advisor Ms. Donna Jordan,
Mr. John Laub and Mr. Mike Red. If you’ll please stand. Thank you for
being with us today.
Reports of standing committees, the clerk will read. No reports today.
Senators we’re going to move right into the calendar. We have one item
on the calendar today. It’s the House Committee Substitute for Senate
Bill 4. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 4, no entity exchange, no Medicaid
expansion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President, members. We thought we would
be ready to roll with Senate Bill 4 today, but we’re going to need to
vote not to concur. A couple of technical corrections we need to make
with that in a conference committee. So I ask you to vote no to
concurrence. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing
none, the question before the Senate is concurrence in the House
Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 4. All in favor will vote aye, all
opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting, and
the clerk will record the vote. One having voted in the affirmative…
Hartsell, Senator Hartsell, no. One having voted in the affirmative, 47
in the negative, the Senate fails to concur in the House Committee
Substitute for Senate Bill 4, and the House will be so notified.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
