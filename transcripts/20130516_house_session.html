The house will come to order.  Without objection, Rule 12H is suspended.
 So ordered.
Members please take their seats.  Visitors please retire from the
chamber. Members and visitors in the gallery, please silence all
cellular phones and
personal, electronic devices.  And, we'll allow another minute or two
for members to enter the chamber.
Visitors in the gallery, Rule 12H is the rule that requires that we wear
coats and ties on the floor. And so, I asked, without objection, to
suspend Rule 12H because I don't have a tie on today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, just a question.  I thought Representative Moffitt had
passed a bill against that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, and incidentally, it only says that you have to have a tie on.  It
doesn't say that it has to be around your neck.
The Sargent-at-Arms will close the doors.  The prayer will be offered by
Representative Deborah Ross.  Members and visitors in the gallery,
please
stand and please remain standing for the duration of the Pledge of
Allegiance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members and particularly the freshman, I have told this story before,
but I
will tell you this.  When I was a freshman, one of the pastors in my
district, his wife gave me a book of prayers, and she told me that she
thought that they would come in handy in my political career and they
certainly have.  She wrote them and the one I'm going to read you today,
she wrote almost 20 years ago.  She wrote it on May the 11th, 1993.  She
has recently passed.  Her name was Mary ?? and she was a very, very dear
friend of mine.
&quot;Oh wondrous worker of miracles, praise be for the mystery that
surrounds us
and that through eons of creation has brought us to this moment, to
gather
alive, breathing, moving, sensing, hoping and praying.  In this
mysterious
instance, at this luminous time, touched by nature's fleeting beauty,
praise
be for the friends whose steady hold keeps us buoyant on our journey and
for
the messages of grace from strangers who pass our way.  Praise be for
the
possibilities before us and for the surge of determination to accept
difficulty, not as an excuse for passivity, but as a goad to creativity
and the door to abundant life.  And, praise to thee for all the clues of
love,
daring and outlandishly scattered about which overturn habit and hate
and
harm. Give us courage to make some of the days ahead different, bright
and beautiful with your grace.  Amen.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to
the
Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with
liberty and justice for all.
Representative Moore is recognized.

(SPEAKER CHANGES)thank you mr speaker, ladies and gentleman of the

bill, the effective date being the date it was enacted. Staff discussed
this with us in the fact that such an indefinite effective date could
create a possible appear of contracts issued, which would purport the
act to effect contracts entered prior to the effect</p>

date. So to clarify that, this is simply a technical amendment to
specifically state that this bill will become effective and effect
contracts made on or after the effective date. I believe that two are
one and ask for your support, and I discussed this with Representative
Whitmire and he has no objections.

purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I'll speak briefly.  I was not here at this
portion of the debate or for these bills late last night. So I'm going
to put my words, at least, in the record as it relates to this bill.  I
will be voting against the bill and disagree fundamentally with the
principle of the bill for a variety of reasons. First, and I do respect
the fact of Representative Ford's amendment that was done in JC and
Representative Whitmire's limitations on the bill. But if this
limitation and this substantial limitation on parties ability to
contract and judicial independence can be done in family law cases, then
it makes no sense to cabin that off from other cases.  Either this is a
good idea or it's not a good idea. Either it works and it's
constitutional and not preemptive in one area or another.  But here what
we're saying is, we ought to put this limitation on contracts, and
parties ability to contract, and their choice of forums, and their
choice of provisions of law, and their choice of where their cases will
be heard.  But we can do it in the area of Family Law because it will
have less effect there and probably they're more individual rights
issues versus business issues.  Well, to make that totally arbitrary
unreasonable separation creates at it's starting point, I think, the due
process problem forever invoking these provisions, and I suspect to the
extent they ever will be invoked there will be immediate challenges to
them.  If it's important to do that as a public policy in a contract
involving child custody or involving equitable distribution, it equally
ought to be important as it relates to agreements between companies.
Well, the argument is, that's companies and businesses and not
individuals.  But what about sole proprietorships? What about limited
partnerships? What about the small business? Do we say this law should
apply to them to protect them the same way we do individuals? Because
they're certainly disadvantaged versus international corporations. There
is no easy dividing line. Either this is a good idea or it's not and to
say it applies only to part of our civil law but doesn't apply to the
rest creates in and of itself - thank you Mr. Speaker - the
constitutional problem. Second, the whole concept of telling parties
that they may not put in their contracts particular choice of law
provisions or where cases will be heard, I think sends an enormously bad
message in the international community.  This isn't aimed at any
particular sphere. Although it's origin of this bill, these types of
bills, clearly were aimed at a particular sphere. This is aimed at all
international circumstances and what does it say that the United States
wants to be so insular that we say that our law is superior and it may
not be trumped in any circumstances even when the parties agree that
that's what they want to happen.  That's the benefit of the bargain that
they agreed to. This has an enormous influence even as a law in the
books as a principle of what we're doing. We don't like your law? We'll
void it. We don't want to deal with the ramifications of your cultural
law?  We'll simply eviscerate it from our contracts. Do we really want
the reverse and the reciprocation of that to Americans in other places
across the globe?  We have Americans living everywhere and we have in
the Family Law area, particularly where I live, enormous implications
where we have people coming and going from all parts of the globe, and
Family Law issues intermixed with business issues. I think and
understand the basis of the concern of this provision.  But I think as a
matter of policy, as a matter of constitutional law, as a matter of law,
and really from the politics of it as it relates to how North Carolina
is perceived in the international community, on all those grounds I
oppose the law. Thank you very much.

On the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman is recognized to debate the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I appreciate the comments, but I will simply say that had it not been
for multiple cases, fortunately not North Carolina, where people’s
constitutional rights in the categories of section 50 and 50-A have been
basically assert by foreign laws. I wouldn’t be concerned about this,
but take it as fact that this is a very, very present threat that must
be dealt with and it’s dealt with in the most positive of manners so
that we are making sure that the most fundamental basis of which we
exist is protected and I ask that you support the bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blust please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members of the house I think Representative
Glazier’s concerns are covered on page 2, line 38 where it says:
Nothing in this article shall be interpreted to limit the right of
natural persons, voluntarily to restrict or limit their own
constitutional rights by contract or specific waiver. Consistent with
constitutional principles. So I don’t think we’re going to see some of
those concerns he raised come to fruition, but I also want to address,
last night we were in a rush and the question got called. I want to
address a couple things said last night. One this bill isn’t need, this
hasn’t happened in North Carolina yet and two, we can depend on our US
Constitution, state constitution and as to the second of those
propositions, I wish we could. I’ve always wanted to depend on our own
Constitution. But we have seen that document put in, in just frankly
grave danger and right now we stand at a point where if one justice were
to die or retire and get appointed with another, that whole document
could be changed. And that’s just a fact. Precedent isn’t always
followed. There are things that can be found in this Constitution that
nobody else had any inkling were ever in that Constitution. So I don’t
have, I wish I could depend on it and I think that’s one of the big
political questions that is before us still is how are we going preserve
that. And it is a little bit disconcerting when you read of a present
sitting United States Supreme Court Justice who goes to a conference and
makes a speech which says we ought to be looking in many instances to
foreign law. Where another constitutional, where another Supreme Court
Justice went before some group and said, boy if we we’re starting a
country we ought not to look at the US Constitution we ought to look at
the South African Constitution. And there is a fear among many, and I
think it’s real that certain Justices, certain judges and people in the
legal profession don’t have that devotion to the US Constitution and I
think this bill is partially addressing that. Second is the, the second
concern was well, this isn’t really happening, this isn’t really
something that we have to be aware of and I’m sorry but it is. There
are, in Europe already there are some instances that in the United
States where it has been recommended and sometimes followed, the Sharia
Law. And it is fundamentally at odds with United States jurisprudence.
Just fundamentally the two systems cannot be reconciled. Individual
rights are not recognized. And I think especially from the progressive
side there ought to be a whole lot more concern then I’ve seen. I’ve had
a hard time understanding why there is so little concern. Because some
of the groups of people that are championed, at least so they say,
championed on the progressive side are absolutely trod upon under Sharia
Law. For example homosexuals are stoned and I don’t want to see that get
started and it’s creeping, but it is stated that within those who are
pushing it that that is their goal is to have this type law.</p>

...rule the world. And it is creeping in and certain child custody
situations, in marriage and domestic law, but as it gets a foothold,
they're going to push even harder. And we have seen that in other
countries. We have seen that start in some other states and I am glad
that we're going to take a strong stand here in North Carolina that
we're not, we're going to nip it in the bud and not let it get started
here. So I support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Pittman, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative Whitmire has
made reference to 27 cases where what we fear has happened in other
states and people say, &quot;Well, it's not happening in North Carolina,
what are you worried about?&quot; Well I say when you see danger coming,
it's best to try to do something to prevent it before it gets to you. I
think if Admiral Nimitz had known that Pearl Harbor was going to happen
he wouldn't have had all his ships bottled up in the harbor. You need to
see danger coming and you need to take action.
America, you know, this is America. And people come from all over the
world to come t America to get away from the kind of law they're having
to live under and to come to a place where the law defends their God
given freedom. That's what our constitution is about. And the concern
about messing up contracts, you know, there's nothing in here that
prohibits people from looking at other law if they want to in contracts,
but the point is when they do, to make sure that our constitutional
rights are protected. And that, to me, that's what we're about. If we're
not here with the idea of protecting God given rights that are
recognized in our constitution, I'm not sure, well I'll just speak for
myself. If that's not what I'm here for, I don't have any business being
here. So this is a way to try to help forestall danger that we see
coming and defend our people's rights and I think we need to support it.
Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGE] The lady is recognized to debate the bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
House. I know we had a lot of discussion on this bill last night. It
still discriminates against women and it is wrong. It expands the number
of people who can take part now in denying healthcare to women. And it
prevents women from purchasing a healthcare plan on the exchange with
abortion coverage. But it also presents another problem. It presents
challenges to counties and cities across this State who have to provide
healthcare to their employees, many of whom are women. If mayors and...</p>

But something does die, and yet in the tension between the woman and the
fetus the woman under law of this country, in the first trimester at
least had the constitutional right to choose. Having said that, what I
also understand and what she understands and cannot ignore is that there
are two parts of the equation. Her biology tells her that, but by
contrast is exemplified by the bill last session and this one now.
Abortion opponents also as Representative Adams has said refuse to
understand the psychology of certain women in some of these cases. They
understand that there are times, too many times, many times when an
embryo for all of us is an embedded blessing, but there are other times
when it is a nightmare. And too often we stand here failing to recognize
how deeply felt is the right to protect and decide the processes of
one's own body.
And like far too much in public policy we sit here today deciding what
insurance may pay for for the women of North Carolina without really
asking many of the women of the state of North Carolina. Each woman is
unique with the unique medical history and life and circumstance that
this bill shy of the issues of rape and incest, fails to make any
differentiation. and so I will use an example I used two years ago
because it comes home very sincerely to me. Assume my wife and I were
trying to get pregnant, assume that the pretest showed that neither one
of us was a Tay-Sachs carrier.
Assume the test was wrong. Assume we found out into the pregnancy that
in fact the baby is Tay-Sachs and will not have anything resembling a
life very long out of the womb and when it does will suffer incredibly.
And assume my wife and I would be good parents and would want that
child, but we don't want to bring a child into the world in that
circumstance for days of pain if any days at all. And assume I have
insurance coverage that specifically covers all of the decisions and the
medical consequences of what we have to decide, and assume after days of
crying and thinking about it and praying and spiritually making a
decision, we decide to abort. After doing that, what this bill is now
gonna say, you make the decision after the woman's right to know with
everything that's included in that and you paid for the coverage but
guess what, we're gonna deny it because 100 people in Raleigh said we're
gonna deny it. You paid for it but you don't get to have it.
How omnipotent the people in this chamber believe themselves to be. T9o
invade my families decision. My personal decision, personal decision,
moral decision, and then the economic decision that goes along with it
to double the pain. That is fundamentally not the role of government.
That is the first reason I disagree in every way with us doing this.
This is the most intense personal, spiritual private decisions people
will make. They have the right to prepare in all ways for it and
regardless what we did in state policy to now turn around and say that
the private insurance carriers that they've been paying cannot cover is
fundamentally wrong on every level.
Secondly as you discussed to some degree last night from what I'm told,
it is also fundamentally preemptive by the Affordable Care Act at least
as it applies to the private insurers Not only in the Duff case which
came out and I think you talked about it last night on March. 14, 2013
from the state of Missouri, which makes it clear that yesterday in
preparing thinking I would be on the floor I went back and looked at
other cases and you can also look at a case from the eastern district of
Michigan on April 3, 2013. A case March 22, 2013. A case from the
District of Colorado February 27, 2013. And one January 8, 2013 from the
district of Minnesota. All holding that the Affordable Care Act preempts
what we are trying to do on the floor. At some point we ought to follow
the law. This bill because it will be struck down, at least that
proportion of it as applies to private insurers...

The member has moved the previous question, the question before the
House is the adoption of the previous question on House Bill 730.  As
many members that favor the adoption of the motion will vote aye; those
opposed will vote no. Fifteen seconds will be allowed for voting. The
clerk will open the vote.  [pause]  The clerk will lock the machine and
record the vote.  70 having voted in the affirmative and 36 in the
negative, the previous question is adopted.  Under our rules, three
minutes of closing argument is allowed for the Minority Leader or his
designee, and the same for Majority Leader. Representative Paul is
recognized to offer the three minute statement or to designate who will
make the same for the Democratic Caucus.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I designate Representative Luebke from Durham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Durham is recognized to speak on the closing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Leader.  And Speaker and members of the House, I am so
upset by the decision to cut off debate.  We had fourteen lights on...I
believe that's as many we've had in this entire session.  As we could
tell from the debate, as far as it got, this is an issue that divides
this chamber.  It is an issue that matters, to some extent, not to all
as much as perhaps jobs, and the availability of a job.  But, it is an
important issue to many, many people; not just to women who want the
right to choose, but to men who want to support their wives, their
partners, et cetera.  Now what we've done here--I want to speak to what
would be normally a point of personal privilege--that we have undermined
the functions of this house.  The House is here to debate the issues of
our communities.  120 of us, to cut off debate after two, three
speakers, is outrageous.  I think the majority should be ashamed--not
the majority--not all of you, I want to step back from that.  But the
Chair, and the member who called the question...it is not right to do
that, to deny us--those of use who wanted to speak-- the chance to speak
on behalf of our constituencies, and on behalf of our conscience.  I
hope, Mr. Speaker, this never happens again in 2013-2014. This is just
wrong, wrong, wrong.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady from Mecklenburg County, Representative Shaffer, is recognized
to offer the closing for the Republicans.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  We've heard a lot of debate today, we heard a
lot of debate yesterday on the House floor, as well as in committee.
And as Representative Martin pointed out, we have gotten off of the
topic of the bill.  We have--we have--strayed away from what this bill
does.  What this bill does is protects the right that is guaranteed to
North Carolinians under our state Constitution, and a right that is
guaranteed to us under our Federal Constitution.  I stated this
yesterday, but I want to remind you again, our Constitution says no
human authority shall in any case control or interfere with the rights
of conscience.  Again the first portion of this bill has to do with
healthcare providers in protecting their rights of conscience.  Our
current law protects the doctors and nurses from being forced to engage
in abortion if they have a moral objection to it.  This simply extends
it to all healthcare providers who would be involved in that procedure
and who would have a moral, religious, or ethical objection to that.
Concerning the latter two portions of the bill, which has been the
source of much debate, this does not have anything to do with removing a
woman's access to an abortion. It has to do with not requiring people
who have an objection to it to paying for it.  We should not be
requiring taxpayers to fund this type of procedure that they find
morally objectionable.  To be very clear, the first of those two
provisions is expressly authorized by the Affordable Care Act.  We have
not gone far afield from that.  It is expressly authorized which is in
the handout that was on your desks last night, and I trust is still
there.  Secondly, the second portion regarding cities and counties, that
mirrors the federal Hyde Amendment.  This is language that is in our
federal law.  It is expressly authorized by federal law.  We should not
be requiring individuals, taxpayers or otherwise, to be forced to pay
for a procedure that they find morally objectionable.  In closing, I
simply want to say that the right of conscience is mentioned in sev-

[SPEAKER CHANGE] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, yesterday
I voted for it because frankly, it just popped up and it's a three or
four page bill and didn't really have time to read it, but I did have
some concerns yesterday but I didn't want to keep you here long. And I'm
not going to keep you long today. But I'm just going to tell you briefly
what my concerns are. This creates another exception to employment at
will. It's another way to claim why I was fired or not hired even if it
was only part of the factual stew. We don't need more exceptions without
evidence of a burning fire. There is no such fire that I know of.
Secondly, there are many industries, I think they carve out financial
services industries, but there are many industries and services where
securities claims, cash, pharmaceuticals might make it reasonable for an
employer to say, &quot;Hey, it's up to you of course, but if you want to
work here, our security department must do an annual review of whatever
to help us locate people who are reselling our product, for example,
illegally.&quot; If a company can have a policy which says employees
cannot comment on social media under the name of the company, which
seems a reasonable rule, shouldn't they have the right to investigate a
reported violation of that company rule and require access to a
suspected site?
There's another conceptual reason, constitutional rights don't really
apply in the workplace except to the extent, of course, you can't hold
people in involuntary servitude or slavery and that, of course is
workplace. But rights like privacy or free speech or free press are not
workplace rights. This bill is a bad precedent which codifies to the
workplace, even the private workplace, constitutional concept of
privacy. Especially bad therefore when it's applied to the private
sector. I'll just give you an example. You, each of you have assistants
and what your assistants do reflects on you. You're covered by this
bill. And if you, for example, got a rumor that maybe your legislative
assistant was talking down about you on his or her Facebook account, you
couldn't ask them, &quot;Show me your Facebook.&quot; I'm a lawyer in a
small town. The reputation of my staff is as important to my success of
my business as my reputation is. And I've had excellent staff for 35
years. But if I got a rumor, if somebody said, &quot;Did you know your
staff had on his or her Facebook site pornographic stuff or they don't
go to church on Sunday or they smoke,&quot; or just whatever, I think
doesn't fit with the image of the firm I want to give, this bill makes
that illegal to even ask them to look at the site.
Now I'm the last person who should be bringing this to all, because I
don't even know what some of the terminology of this bill means. Did you
know that at one point last session, I was the number one person
followed in the General Assembly on Twitter and I didn't even know what
a Twitter was, but I had a great staff that did it and I was number 2 on
Facebook and I can't, to this day, get on Facebook to figure it out.
It's not that I want the passwords of my staff...</p>

SPEAKER CHANGE
Ladies and gentlemen, I was in the process of recording votes for
members who didn't record. I want to make sure that I call the
amendment, the last amendment by Representative Stam. Correctly it was
112 in favor, 0 against. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to welcome
another group of students, teachers, and chaperones from Star Elementary
and Star Montgomery. They're to my right, welcome. Representative
Elmore, please state your purpose.
SPEAKER CHANGE
To ask one of the bill sponsors a question
SPEAKER CHANGE
To Representative Hall, does the gentleman yields?
SPEAKER CHANGE
Yes.
SPEAKER CHANGE
This gentleman yields.
SPEAKER CHANGE
I'm not an attorney, so this language is, can be even more confusing to
me. As a school teacher, a big problem that we've been having that
continues to happen is the concept of cyber bullying and kids using the
Facebook and all of the Twitter and things to attack other students, or
to be, use their names in a negative way, that sort of thing. And also,
something I thought about in reference to this field is the pursuit of
child pornographers and things of that nature. Will this legislation
hinder those type of investigations dealing with cyber bullying or child
pornography or anything of that nature?
SPEAKER CHANGE
It would now. Unfortunately, that's one area that we overlooked in the
original bill, but the amendment that we took up last night, if you
remember the one that talked about all educational institutions, that
was an exception the university came to us with, and we made it apply to
all educational institutions, and it gives them the right to not only
look at that institutions website or email, but if they suspect there's
bullying or criminal activity, it gives them the ability to go in and
look at their private settings and private accounts, and that's for
colleges, universities, as well as elementary, junior high school, and
high school
SPEAKER CHANGE
Representative Brandon, please state your purpose.
Representative Dollar, please state your purpose.
SPEAKER CHANGE
To ask representative Hall a question.
SPEAKER CHANGE
Representative Hall, does the gentleman yield?
SPEAKER CHANGE
Yes.
SPEAKER CHANGE
The gentleman yields.
SPEAKER CHANGE
Representative Hall, does this bill in any way, does this language in
any way, restrict an employer, and/or an employer being the state of
North Carolina, from their ability to access anything whatsoever, legal
or illegal, that has flowed across the employers, an employer purchased,
owned, leased piece of equipment, or state owned or leased piece of
equipment, computer equipment, or any other device, that the employer or
the state of North Carolina as an employer, has purchased or owns?
SPEAKER CHANGE
It 100% doesn't, and that was actually the main purpose of the amendment
today. It was almost the full page of additional language that was added
today. The extra language made clear that not only equipment, but their
email server, their system, it actually went a bit further than that,
and said that anything they acquired through their position with the
state, they can also have access to.
SPEAKER CHANGE
Mr. Speaker for one follow up.
SPEAKER CHANGE
Does the gentleman yield?
SPEAKER CHANGE
Yes.
SPEAKER CHANGE
Gentleman yields.
SPEAKER CHANGE
So for example, the state of North Carolina as an employer, would never
in any way, shape form, or fashion, in any passive way, in any shape
form or fashion, not be able to fully enforce, whether it's child
pornography or any or just somebody being lazily wasting time, instead
of doing their job, and that being facilitated.</p>

sure now everyone is looking at my Facebook account.  Thank you Mr.
Speaker.  To that point it could shape how an employer treats you.  We
are really getting into as we look into the digital age how much of our
private information is private.  This bill kinda sets some groundwork so
the employers have a reasonable expectation of what they can and can't
do. and so that the employee has a reasonable expectation of what they
should and shouldn't do.  This is designed to protect their privacy and
that is what it's really about.  It's not as nefarious as it might sound
if you do not understand some of the digital lingo that's in the bill.
But it does allow some reasonable expectations of privacy on behalf of
an employee.  They check out at 5:00. They go home.  They are doing
their own thing.  How much of it is to be shared and not shared. But it
does spell out for the employer what they can and can't do with regards

approached me earlier and asked me if I should put my tie back on
because it looks like we're  getting a little bit lazy here today or lax
here today.  I said it probably had more to due with the fact that we
have a fairly light calendar.  We've got about 5 bills left on the
calendar and my guess is about less than about 30 minutes of debate or
about 4 or 5 hours.  But what we are going to do is take a quick break.
I would encourage you to go to the dashboard because the bills that we
are going to take up are bills that are on the dashboard now and were
added to the calendar after we came into session.  We are also going to

And again, this is obviously just more proof that we need to really work
with the governor as he has proposed to reform Medicaid and look at ways

try to contain these costs, so I would ask for member support of the
bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Queen, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? recognize to ?? the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. This is a routine thing in the general assembly since I’ve been a
part of it, to fix our Medicaid gap because again, this is a $13 billion
program in North Carolina. We heard in appropriations this morning that
there is issues about the gap. The gap is not all that big. It’s down to
just around 200 and some million dollars out of 13 billion, and 118
million of this is basically an accounting issue where we have in
budgets past, we did it in the last session, we did it in previous
sessions that I was part of, where you take the last month and you roll
it into the next year’s budget, and you sort of have the 13th month.
Well, sooner or later, you’re going to have to pay for that 13th month,
so this fixes that. But my point is that Medicaid serves a huge number
of citizens in North Carolina with healthcare. It is a $13 billion
program and it will have forecasting issues. We saw on a forecasting on
hurricanes last night how many different paths a hurricane can take. In
an economy as big as North Carolina’s, when you have unemployment that’s
a point and a half higher than the national average, when you have
issues of health, whether it’s a flu epidemic or what in the previous
year for the uptake of Medicaid expenses, it’s hard to be precise, so we
never have in this general assembly enough cushion to cover the typical
swing in Medicaid expenditures of a $13 billion program that can’t be ??
down by it’s very nature. So, whenever we say North Carolina Medicaid
program is broke and needs fixing, this is fixing. Let’s fix it. North
Carolina in the last 5 or 6 years had the lowest growth, about half
those years, of any state in the nation in Medicaid expenses. We have
held Medicaid’s costs down. We have had some of the best outcomes of any
state for the dollars spent. We’ve been recognized nationally in medical
journals all over the nation for our work with our CCNC. Medical home
and medical management, best practices. We are the model for the nation.
So North Carolina has a very strong Medicaid administrative history. It
always has these budgetary issues and they are very hard to forecast and
predict. And if you were truly being straightforward in your budgeting,
you would make sure you cover this.

Thank you. Well, that is my point. Let’s fix it so we can continue to

of North Carolina in the $2.5 billion expansion that we have already
passed on this year. Let’s reconsider it now that we fixed it. Thank
you.

<p id="100:00">
...two basic corrections. Number one, right now the shortfall for this
year is $401 million. This is what we were told, when we were reviewing
the budget, was going to be the shortfall. The second point is that
there have been shortfalls all along in Medicaid.
Those shortfalls, and I would take issue with Representative Burr, did
not leave a $600 million shortfall; we left a $420 million shortfall.
And that shortfall was made up the same way that you're making up this
shortfall here. It's sad, but we're going to have shortfalls in
Medicaid. I don't care how you do it or how you make the predictions.
We have the best Medicaid delivery services in the country, and it costs
to do that, and with the cost of Medicaid and medicine going up, it's
going to go up. Remember that Medicaid is an entitlement program. That
entitlement program is going to cost you a year. It's hard to make
accurate predictions on that, and you're going to have shortfalls.
Every state in the Union has a shortfall. It varies, depending on the
size of their program. So folks, this is a usual thing. We don't get
excited about it, because we've been doing it. We've been doing $400
million a year for any number of years. I just want to try to set the
record straight.
The Speaker Pro Tempore: Ladies and gentlemen, we will continue this
debate until 1:30. It will then be displaced as we go to other matters
on the calendar.
Representative Dollar, please state your purpose.
Rep. Dollar: To correct the correction.
The Speaker Pro Tempore: The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
Rep. Dollar: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
No, maybe it wasn't $600 million; maybe it was closer to $650 million.
But we did inherit a hole in the budget, and that hole was created by a
number of things, part of which were decisions made by the prior General
Assemblies in how items were structured and how they expected additional
[??} money to come down.
And you can go back and look at the budget bills in 2010, and the truth
is right there in the numbers. There were also mismanagement in the
program that we spent the last two years paying back the federal
government for. There was also, as it, the number right now is $188
million, that was the 13th payment on federal drug rebates monies that
were shifted from one fiscal year to the next year that we are cleaning
up, and that issue will be done with when this bill is passed; hopefully
that will never be kited again.
And to Representative Burr's point, the forecasting that was done last
year was done with what's called a blended rate on the FMAP, instead of
using the real rates. Now the reason is, you know, it shouldn't have
happened that way. The administration has brought Ernst &amp; Young in
to help work with the forecasting; we are hoping to get that corrected,
but there are a number of structural issues that we have been working on
for over two years to fix.
We hope we're getting to the end of the structural issues and can get
more to the true reform of the Medicaid program moving forward, so that
we can have something that is sustainable and preserves the level of
benefits and the access that North Carolina has enjoyed. So I would
recommend the bill to you.
The Speaker Pro Tempore: Further discussion, further debate.
If not, the question before the House is the passage of the House
committee substitute to House Bill 980. All in favor vote aye; opposed

Association educators, and Norcon Chamber of Commerce. They both endorse
the legislation. I'm proud to sponsor this legislation with
Representative Whitmire, Representative Zoker, Representative Piece, and
I appreciate their service to our country, and we developed this
legislation to encourage our retired military personnel and honorably
discharged military personnel to take advantage of the opportunities in
our educational system, and go teach our kids to become teachers and
principals. And so this helps takes advantage of the great experience
that they gleaned while in the armed services, and gives them credit for
pre-bacherlors degree activities that would be consistent with the
lateral entry type program, and also directs the state board of
education developed rules specific to the military, to keep North
Carolina the most military friendly state in the country, and take
advantage of this knowledge and experience in our classrooms, and Mr.
Speaker, I would ask that you recognize Representative Whitmire for a

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We had to substitute #2 for House Bill 267, a bill that entirely and
actively specifies the conditions under which the turnpike authority may
collect tolls on an existing interstate highway. General assembly of
North Carolina in next.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, to be clear, that past bill will be engrossed
before it is sent to the Senate. Representative Collins, please state
your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Fellow house, to debate the bill. Excuse me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Fellow house members, this is a bill that passed through Transportation
and Appropriations, I think, without any descent. I've talked with Mr.
Trogg and others from the Department of Transportation. They have no
problems with this. There are a lot of people that really, really want
this. I know of nobody that doesn't want it. It basically says that the
turnpike, the tolling authority will have authority to toll existing
interstate highways only if they add excess lanes. That we have to have
the same number of non-tolled lanes that we currently have. They're
talking about possibly doing some hot lane type stuff, perhaps where I
live on I-95, and letting the people that want to go from New York to
Florida 10 miles an hour faster than everybody else on less congested
lanes pay 20 bucks and fly through it, but the trucks that would have to
pay $70 to traverse the entire state can still stay on non-tolled lanes.
Local traffic that wants to drive from Rocky Mountain of Wilson to
Fayetville something can still stay on non-tolled lanes so that they
have to maintain the same number of non-tolled lanes as we currently
have. Again, I know of no objection to this bill, would appreciate your
support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Waddell, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. See if the bill sponsor will yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I like your bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I really do. Question.</p>

You say that we would be able to adjust the speed limit, probably on
those new toll roads?[SPEAKER CHANGES]The thought being floated by DOT,
and this of course would have to have some input from the General
Assembly, I think there has been some this year, is that perhaps you
might go 65 (MPH) on the old interstate and 75 (MPH) in the hot lanes,
or something like that. There might be a 10 MPH advantage to paying the
toll and if you wanted to fly through our state as fast as you could get
through it.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Follow up? Gentleman yields? [SPEAKER
CHANGES]Gentleman yields.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Well, that's really good,
because I was trying to make sure that Representative Moore was going to
be able to drive that fast car on a good highway![SPEAKER CHANGES]I
should have his support, thank you.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative
Charles Graham, please state your purpose.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you,
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the bill sponsored.[SPEAKER
CHANGES]Representative Collins, does the gentleman yield?[SPEAKER
CHANGES]I do.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker.Mr. Collins, I live
in Robinson County which is a border county, and Robinson County has
about forty miles of I-95 going right through the middle of that county,
and they have a lot of citizens in that county who are really concerned
about this idea of a toll, and the potential of three to four tolls in
Robinson County. What would your bill do to help relieve some of the
anxiety of the folks that I have in Robinson County?[SPEAKER
CHANGES]What my bill would do, is absolutely assure you that you cannot
have less free or non-toll lanes than you currently have on the
Interstate. No matter what's done to the Interstate going forward, if
you've got, and I think in your area it's two lanes in each direction,
and sometimes three lanes in each direction, you're like Smithfield, one
of the congested areas, you'll never have less than that number of
non-tolled lanes, for local traffic to drive on.It's been my hope (I
live along I-95 as you do) and most of the sponsors except for
Representative Corbett live there, and that has been our primary
concern. [SPEAKER CHANGES]So call on Mr. Speaker.[SPEAKER
CHANGES]Gentleman yield?[SPEAKER CHANGES]Gentleman yields.[SPEAKER
CHANGES]So as I speak to the folks in Robinson County who have one of
those public meetings coming forward this Monday, and I understand we're
talking about legislation here, but can I assume that what's on our
drawing boards right now is to effectively have tolls in Robinson
County? This legislation would allow them, just wanting to make sure I
understand, because I've had a lot of questions on this, and I have not
had one person encourage me to support the existing tolling proposals. I
just want to make sure that I do understand, in other words we have a
northbound, a southbound I-95; this bill would in essence have a
superhighway or super-expressway  somewhere in that vicinity.[SPEAKER
CHANGES]May I respond?[SPEAKER CHANGES]It's not saying that we will,
this doesn't mandate the DOT to do anything. What it is saying is, if
they decide to want to toll any lanes on interstates that already exist
in North Carolina, I think there are five of them if I am correct, they
can only do that if they build new lanes.What it really states is, and
if you read it, we put the language in there in the last committee, at
all times they have to keep the same number of non-toll lanes open as
they currently have. For instance, they can't toll the current lanes in
anticipation of eventually building new non-toll lanes, they can only
toll lanes that are indeed new. They have to keep the same...nobody ever
has to build a toll road according to this legislation, they just can't
build one unless they keep the same number of non-toll lanes that were
in existence before they built these new ones.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank
you. Just a comment, [SPEAKER CHANGES]Gentleman's recognized debating
the bill.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr Collins, I think this is a wonderful
alternative, and I appreciate you bringing forth this legislation, and I
look forward to having dialogue about this in the future, we thank you a
lot.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Robert Brawley, please state your
purpose.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Speak on the bill.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Gentleman is
recognized as debating the bill.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you. Mr. Speaker,
ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to compliment Representative Collins for
bringing this bill before us. The people of my area absolutely do not
like toll lanes, if you do a survey and ask them if it's toll lanes or
nothing, they'll say yes, but that doesn't make them like toll lanes any
better. This bill will do what Representative Collins has said it will
do, it's not as good as the original bill he introduced, but I think
it's what we need in this state, and I urge you to vote for it.[SPEAKER
CHANGES]Representative Bumgardner, please state your purpose.[SPEAKER
CHANGES]Debate the bill.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Gentleman is recognized to

sure about this bill, I've just been sitting here reading it and looking
it over, whether this is pro or anti...</p>

All opposed say no.

Committee substitute for House Bill 107, a bill to entitle an act to
allow a county from the eastern region to receive a disbursement of its
share of the motor vehicle registration tax proceeds as well as payments
made by the county in leiu of taxes. General assembly of North Carolina
enacts.
Ladies and gentleman, before we start debate on the bill, chair is happy
to extend courtesies of the gallery to three different groups so please
hold you're applause until I introduce all three. Another one is the, a
group of students, teachers and chaperones from Covenant Day Elementary
in Matthews. This group, I am assurred by Representative Bryan, has
[Haywood], his son in it. Another group from Upper Room Christian
Academy in Raleigh. And also, the chair would like to extend the
courtesies of the gallery to [Karen Hart], the chair of the [Mooresville
graded] school district board of education. The [Mooresville graded]
school district was called the best school district in the country by
Scholastic Administrative Magazine. It's also home to my personal friend
and national superintendant of the year, Dr. Mark [Edwards]. Please all
of you stand and let us greet you.
[applause]
And where is [Haywood]? Okay, I just wanted to confirm. Representative
Speciale is recognized to debate the bill.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. This bill, well, in the mid to late 90s the
eastern region started collecting an additional $5 per vehicle
registration. They had what they call the GTP plates for the global
trans park. That money was put into a fund to be loaned to the counties
and they would be charged interest and it was for economic development.
For a while there now the funds haven't been used. They've been sitting
stagnant and what this bill will do is allow them to divide that up
among the counties that participated, and allow them to use that money
for their own economic development. I ask your support.
Representative Shepard, please state your purpose.
Yes sir, Mr. Chair for, question for the bill sponsor.
Representative Speciale, does the gentleman yield?
I yield.
The gentleman yields.
[inaudible] Speciale, it sounds like a great idea but have you talked
with any of the local counties, or the boards there, the commissioners
to see where they are on all this?
I have, and this is something that several of the counties want. I have
a resolution here from Craven county in support of this bill and I've
talked to the county commissioners in Pamlico county, they're in support
of this bill. I talked to someone in the Senate who said that Onslow
county was in support. So I ask for your support.
Representative Collins, please state your purpose.
Briefly speak on the bill.
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
I've been in one of the other counties that's had the great privilage of
paying that $5 fee for several years and we had good discussions on this
in government and finance committee and although my county will not be
asking to do the same thing, I speak in favor of this bill which you
supported. Thank you.
Representative Luebke, please state your purpose.
Speak on the bill.
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
Thank you Mr. Speaker and members on the House. I mentioned what I'm
gonna say right now in finance committee. I don't understand how we work
to develop a rural area, poor, relatively poor part of our state, by
splitting the counties off from one another, which is possible with this
bill. Representative Speciale has a resolution from his county
commission and I respect that. And as I've said in committee, I think
it'd be fine to say that Raven county can break off of it if it wants.
But having it the way it is right now, one county out, another county
in, an example I used in committee was Nash and Edgecombe county.
They're right together, the railroad track split it. I just don't think
it's a good idea. I think we could work on it better. I'm gonna vote
against it. Thanks.
Representative Wilkins, please state your purpose.

<p id="125:00">
Well actually I was gonna say it's pulled from the agenda, that's not
true, we just sort of ended the meeting. To understand what's going on
here i think you need to first recall what the mission of the
partnerships is, and that mission is to do the marketing function for
the region and for the members. During our abbreviated committee
appearance I asked representative Speciale if of these counties in the
region could handle the function of marketing who they are, what they
offer and where they want to go. And I think the response and I welcome
correction if I'm wrong, the response was still that Craven county in
particular feels like this is money that is owed to it.
I don't know about Craven county if it really could handle the
marketing. I'll tell you I live in Parson, we're part of the triangle
partnership. Parson could not handle its marketing, not today, not
tomorrow, not next year. This is about the third or fourth of these
bills various county wanting  to opt out and wanting to take their money
with them and that just damages the whole concept. So if you're gonna
vote for this understand that you're voting to kill a concept, a
marketing concept that has worked and is working. I urge you to vote
against this separatist bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stone please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Ladies and gentleman this bill has been in
two committees I've had and I think I might be able to help it out just
a little bit. Craven county, representative Speciale's bill is not
pulling him out of that district, it's just simply saying the $5 tax
they've been collecting, which they no longer do, which is sitting in a
special trust fund away from all the other money, that their county gets
that portion of the money so that they can do some other innovative
things in their community. They're still part of that regional
development, the money the state appropriates through regional
development for his county still goes to the global transport, this is
just an innovative way for them to spend money that's sitting in a trust
account that they can go ahead and use now. So I'd ask you to vote for
the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Briefly speak on the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill a
second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] representative Stone said about 75% of what I wanted
to say so I won't repeat what he said. It came out very detailed in
finance, not only is it true that its their money but according to what
the director of the eastern region told us, each separate county has
their money segregated form everybody else's money in a separate trust
fund and they can get a loan at 8% if they want to to do projects in
their county. What representative Speciale is asking, he says we've
hired economic development of people in our county, it's our money, we
paid it, it's not mixed it, it's not commingled with other county's
money. Why can't we get our part of the money and use it ourselves
without having to borrow it from somebody else at 8%? It's a very
reasonable request, doesn't dissolve the partnership. So I would ask
that you support his county and let them so what they want with their
money.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not the

legitimately don’t know the answer. I understood that the way we were
passing the bill at first, any state appropriation to the eastern region
would not be changed. If Craven is taken out of it, will we now be
changing the appropriation to the eastern region? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes,
we would be. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We’ll be reducing it? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Shepard, please state your

Representative Harrison, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
briefly debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to
debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and
gentlemen of the House, as Representative Lewis indicate, there are some
issues related to the section of the bill that was added this morning in
committee that gives a one third value to intermittent streams and
isolated wetlands. This is a problem, a potential problem for the state,
so I appreciate Representative Lewis agreeing to work with is to work
out that issue before it moves into Senate, so thank you, Representative
Lewis. I urge you to support the bill. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McElraft, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] There’s also a concern about the isolated
wetlands and permitting of those at all, and I think Representative
Lewis has agreed to work on that on the Senate side. Home builders have
that concern. We should not even be required to permit those at all.
Thank you very much. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further
debate? If not, the question before the House is the passage of the
House Committee Substitute to House Bill 938 on its second reading. All
in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The Clerk will open the vote.
All members please record. The Clerk will lock the machine and record
the vote. 108 having voted in the affirmative, 1 in the negative, the
House Committee Substitute to House Bill 938 has passed its second
reading and without objection will be read a third time. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] General Assembly of North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate? If not, the question before the
House is the passage of the House Committee Substitute to House Bill 938
on its third reading. All in favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed say no. The ayes have it. The House
Committee Substitute to House Bill 938 has passed its third reading and
will be sent to the Senate. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, this
completes the calendar. We will go to notices and announcements in a
moment. We will not take a vote on Monday. It will be a skeleton
session, and for your planning purposes, barring unforeseen
circumstances we will also have a no-vote Monday the following week in
observance of the holiday. Again, except for something that could come
up that’s unforeseen at this time and the Chair’s not anticipated, both
of the next two Mondays will be no-vote skeleton sessions. The Chair
would also like to determine whether or not if we have a skeleton
session on Monday at noon if there’s any problem with that. Provided
that we have no objection, in case there’s a committee meeting running,
it would only be a skeleton session. Does anyone have an objection to
having the skeleton session be at noon on Monday? Noted. Notices and
announcements. Before we do, before we begin notices and announcements,
if we could please have the pages come to the front of the chamber and
the pages step down, and while they’re assembling, Representative
Elmore, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For a point of
personal privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for a
point of personal privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This week has been two
milestones for my seatmate Representative Bumgardner. He had his first
bill moved through right before crossover, and also today is his
birthday, so I’d like for all of us to wish Representative Bumgardner a
happy birthday. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Pages, before I thank you, I would
like if there are any parents or family members of pages in the gallery
at this time, if there are, please stand. Looks like you guys don’t have
a ride. Well I wanted to thank the pages for the pages’ family members
who get you hear and back, and I’m sure they’ll be coming up to get you
when the normal dismissal time at 3 o’clock comes. You all are probably
the first page group in quite a long time that on crossover day got out
before 3 o’clock. This was a very historic week. Ya’ll saw a lot of
debate go on today, ya’ll saw a lot of debate go on over the week; you
say people disagreeing but you also saw them show a tremendous amount of
respect along the way, and the members put in a lot of work, as did you
all this week. We appreciate the work you did. We hope that you learned
a little bit. We hope that you’ll bring your experience back and your
stories of what you learned this week to your family members, your
brothers and sisters and your friends, and encourage them to come and
join with us. Thank you very much for your service this week. Members,
let’s show our appreciation. You now may return to your stations.
Representative Iler, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For an
announcement. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for an
announcement. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Due to the no-vote session Monday, I
need to announce the Transportation Committee will meet at noon. Our
usual time</p>
