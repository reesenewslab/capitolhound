The House Finance Committee will please come to order. We have three
pages with us this morning. Jacob Morris, Jacob is from Wake County.
Louis Hollow is from Pitt County, Ree Gutting [SP] is from Mecklenburg
County and Carson Tomlinson from Wake County. We appreciate you all
being here and I probably messed up somebody's name. As always, we
appreciate our Sergeant-at-Arms who's been hear early this morning with
this long agenda, Fred Heines, Reggie Seals, John Brandon and Mike
Clampett.
First Bill on our agenda this morning will be House Bill 292, establish
music therapy practice act. Representative Brody, you're recognized,
sir. Button.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry, I thought it was on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley is recognized that we have the
PCS before us by the purpose of discussion. Without objection.
Representative Brody, you're recognized, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, ma'am. I'll be pretty brief. This bill is,
the PCS is creating a study on this music therapy licensure and I ask
your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Questions? Representative Warren?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. Just at the appropriate time,
I'd like to make a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And it's the appropriate time. Representative Carney?
Other questions or concerns from the committee? Members from the
audience? Have a motion to give 292, a favorable report. All in favor
will say aye, all opposed? I believe that's unanimous, Mr. Brody.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Next bill on our agenda will be 959, expand 1%/$80
rate for a mail machinery, Mr. Malone?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Again, Representative Samuelson moves that we have the
PCS for the purpose of discussion. The PCS, all in House Bill 959,
expand 1%/$80 rate for the mail machinery. Any objections? Hearing none,
Representative Malone you have the floor, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. This is a PCS to study committee on large
manufacturing facility, the 1% and 80. A lot of manufactures out there
do a lot of fabricating, as well, and as a result they're paying 6.75%
sales tax on the front end for each piece of equipment they buy in the
process of manufacturing a product for resale and they turn around and
collect a 6.75% on the back end, as well, from the person that they
sell, the company they sell it to. I think that's a little bit of double
dipping going on. I think it's also caused us to lose some jobs...yeah?
[background voices]
But it's just a study committee for the next two years to determine...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd like to be recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're recognized, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. I move that the proposed
committee substitute for House Bill 959 be given a favorable report,
unfavorable to the original bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A question. I see the study in Section 2, but isn't
Section 1 actually doing something more than a study?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We'll ask staff to explain the Section 1, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam, Section 1 of the bill has to do
with an incentive that was enacted in 2011 for large manufacturing and
distribution facilities and this related to an actually furniture
project that was planning on locating in Davie County and the incentive
that was given to them at the time was sort of in two parts. For one
year they were going to get a sales tax refund on their distribution...

...into some delays related to a wetlands issue.  And I believe they're
still trying to work out some issues with the feds, so they have asked
for a two-year extension on the out-end.  In other words, instead of
July 1, 2018 to move that to 2020 because of the delay in getting
started up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, ... could I follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, it's not just a study bill, but it's ...section one is an incentive
bill.  About only eight-one...eighty-one thousand dollars.  Something
like that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, fiscal can discuss impact, but you're correct.  The first part of
the bill is an extension of incentives that General Assembly has already
enacted, and then the second part is to study the one percent eighty
rate generally by revenue laws.  And Rodney can address the fiscal
piece.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, the eighty-thousand dollars represents the amount
of the sales tax refund that they would have received.  In essence, they
are still eligible to receive that refund, but they have not been able
to develop the project, so this is essentially revenue neutral.  It's
just showing that the impact is being shifted forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?  Follow up, Representative Stam?  Or are you satisfied, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I might ask staff, reading this fiscal note, you're saying eighty
thousand dollars, but it says it's expressed in thousands.  Does that
mean it's eighty-thousand-thousand dollars, which is eighty million
dollars?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I'm ... thank you for catching that.  That is actually
eighty-thousand dollars.  It's not in thousands; it's in actual dollars.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  Again, I'm not sure.  I see the reference to this study, and
I guess I want to go back to staff to explain, and I also understand the
part of the bill that is already enacted and we're just looking for and
extension, I guess my question for staff is is Representative Malone's
bill a general study of all of the one percent eighty dollars, or is
there a specific project that we're looking at?  That's the distinction
I'm trying to understand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's a general study by revenue laws of all of those.  All.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The entire issue of one percent eighty dollars?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Other questions from the committee?  Questions from the audience?
Seeing none, waiting for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madame Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, ma'am.  I move that the proposed committee substitute for
House Bill 959 be give a favorable report, unfavorable to the original
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have a motion to give the proposed committee substitute favorable,
unfavorable to the original bill.  All in favor will say Aye.  All
opposed No.  Okay, Representative Malone.  Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 280, I believe that's Representative Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Martin is recognized for a motion to have the P.C.S.
before us for the purpose of discussion.  All in favor will say Aye.
All opposed No.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madame Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you'll give us just a minute, Representative Cleveland.  Our Sergeant
at Arms is getting the material out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madame Chair?  Over here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Warren.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would it be possible to just take five minutes and have the Sergeant of
Arms pass out all the bills?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have a reason.  We're limited on time and didn't want to put all the
material out and have to reprint it for next week's.  So, I'm sorry.
That's ...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I appreciate your logic and your conservative attitude.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, thank you.  I'm cheap.  [LAUGHTER]
Representative Cleveland, sir, you are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madame Chair.  This P.C.S. will allow the culture...well, it
does three things, basically.  It will allow non-state employees
affiliated with the transportation museum to drive state-owned vehicles
on the museum property, only on the property. It allows them to move
state-owned artifacts, fire-trucks, whatnot.</p>

...and drive a trolly on a museum property. It authorizes the Department
of Cultural Resources and [unclear] Palace commission to charge
admission and related activities fees. The Culture Resource will be at
museums, if they don't already charge a fee if they desire to. And it
establishes a special fund in the Department of Cultural Resources for
the A+ schools on behalf of the North Carolina Arts. The A+ schools are
schools that use arts throughout their curriculum and they are receiving
donations from individuals and foundations and whatnot and we have to
establish this fund for Cultural Resources to handle the money. In a
nutshell, that is what it does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Questions from the committee? Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, madam chair. I guess for Representative Cleveland, I'm
concerned about the [unclear] Palace situation because I'm generally
concerned that cultural centers, historic centers, and museums have been
free of charge. Our museums across the way are free of charge. In here
the language you have says it will charge reasonable admission. I'm
concerned about a situation. I'm not in favor of charging to visit these
cultural sites at all. But if we are going to charge it seems to me you
should offer us a specific charge because reasonable in your mind or in
my mind may be one thing but in somebody else's mind is another. So can
you talk to me about reasonable fees and give me...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Reasonable fee...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me, just to finish. Can you give me a suggestive fee that we put
in an amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I cannot give you a suggested fee. Reasonable fees would be determined
by the palace commission and the cultural resources folks. This is part
of giving them the ability to become self-sufficient, self financially
to lower the burden to the taxpayer throughout the state for these
facilities and for me, at this point, to say we're going to charge $2.00
for admission would actually be moot. I have no idea what they need and
they have not approached me with it. I know at [unclear] Palace they
presently have an admission fee for their... I can't think of the name
of the new facility they built down there but they presently have an
admission fee and they have nothing for the Palace. Well, yes they do.
They have a $20 or $22 they charge for the complex so they have a fee
already in place. But the problem is they don't have the ability to do
activity fees so if they do special activities they need to be able to
recoup funding for that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[unclear] Representative Luebke, are you...? You're good?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just real quick, so you're telling me that there's already a fee there
to get into the [unclear] Palace and this is really just about having
evening receptions or...? The reason I'm looking at this is because the
word is reasonable admission which sounds like we are authorizing a
admission fee and if you're telling me there already is one, I'm not
sure what this means. Is it going up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At this point, Representative Luebke, I don't think any of the fees are
going to change. In the future, I honestly don't know. I cannot say
what's going to happen in the future. But they do have a fee at the
Palace and they have fees in other areas and we're just trying to
broaden it and give them as much flexibility as possible so they can
maintain their properties and the ability to serve the public.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Martin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, madam chair. My question relates to section one on non-state
employees driving state owned vehicles. What effect, if any, would that
have on liability issues? What would be the liability, for example, of
the non-state employee driving a state vehicle who injures someone?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They are covered by the state's insurance policy with Traveler's
Insurance.

employee who is at the transportation museum who may</p>

Speaker changes: The transportation museum has a very active foundation

more than likely be the individuals for referencing.

Speaker changes: They would be the individuals for referencing. They

Transportation museum.
Speaker changes: Representative Dollar.
Speaker changes: Thank you Madam chair, I am moving the vehicles in the
transportation museum. They have a lot of rolling exhibits so this will
actually help the members of the foundation, they have a foundation
there that is working to raise tremendous amounts of money and
supporters with years  but thy need this authorization as just a very
practical way of working the museum and in terms of the fees
Representative Cleaveland  said it right, you have got some fees are
already being charged at both of these locations they just need the
ability to broaden that out so they can maximize the return on these two
very very popular facilities and allow them to continue to develop those
facilities and keep them in the right shape and if they are able to
raise money for transportation museum and xx that empowers you to have
more money down the road to go to the hip  up- keep  those distorted??
sites that don’t have any capacity to really generate money. So it’s a
great bill and Madam chair, if you please?? I would be pleased to offer
a motion.

a couple of those ;for your information Representative Dollar.

file against the company that is bankrupt. However, because of the way
the Dodd-Frank Law is written, the lender who originally ordered the
appraisal from the appraisal management company is still on the hook for
paying the appraiser. It’s a very confusing thing, which larger
companies have much more ability to pay the fees and pay the attorneys
and everything else. It’s the appraisers who really bear the brunt of
that when that happens.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
??, yes Ma’m.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
It would seem to me that, in a way, if the appraisal management company
goes bankrupt, they bear none of the consequence of the fact that they
got paid for something that they then didn’t pay. If I’m correct on
that, then I would urge that you not support the amendment and leave it
the way it is, but I’ll let you answer that question. [Crosstalk]
In that scenario, the appraisal management company, if they go bankrupt,
would not bear the consequence of the fact that they received the money
from the bank but then kept it and didn’t give it to the appraiser. In a
way, under the current scenario, they get off not really scott-free
because you’re in bankruptcy, but in a way they get off scott-free, is
that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Then I would urge keeping the bill the way it is so that there’s some
way for the appraisers to get paid, and for the lenders to not have to
pay extra because the middle man didn’t do what they were supposed to
do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Madam Chair, could I address that question also.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Representative Brawley, yes sir, on your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Representative Samuelson, the situation that you described is very
similar to a situation involving a subcontractor of a prime contractor
for a homebuilder. Currently the developer will pay the homebuilder for
building the home who is responsible to pay the subcontractor. If he is
paid for the work does not pay the sub, the sub still has a lien on the
property which must be satisfied before the property can be sold. So we
have subcontractors and builders that are in the same situation as the
mortgage companies and the appraisal companies who have a totally
different mechanism for insuring that the subcontractors get paid. My
point of the amendment is, if we’re going to do this, let’s do this for
every sub, not just appraisers, but the plumbers and electricians who
may not get paid when a homebuilder goes bankrupt. In other industries,
mechanics liens exist for people that perform labor and don’t get paid.
This is creating a whole new structure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Representative Szoka.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you for that explanation and that example.
I think that example actually shows why that this is required because in
the example that you gave; the plumber, the carpenter whoever, takes out
a mechanic’s lien, which is a lien on the property that’s owned by the
homeowner or the builder at that point in time, so there’s a lien on a
physical asset which is entirely different than what we have here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Representative Jordan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Thank you, Madam Chair. As one of the members who was involved in the
major mechanics lien reformation that we just went through, we need to
keep these folks separate and deal with them the way Representative
Szoka has proposed would be my position. I would like to ask
Representative Szoka, have the AMCs weighed in on this issue of your
bill, this particular aspect?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Thank you for the question. Yes they have. They’re not in favor of it. I
had a stakeholder meeting on April 11th. The original concept for this
bill was not to do this recovery fund that was to have established an
escrow fund. Going along my experience that in the mortgage industry and
dealing with real estate attorneys and customers give a check it goes
into an escrow fund and it’s not touched; that proved to be totally
unworkable for AMCs for a multiple number of reasons, which I won’t bore
the committee with. But we threw that out. We looked at bonding
requirements, which there’s a small bond requirement in here. We looked
at staggering the amounts of bonding requirements for different-size
AMCs. However there’s no mechanism to tell how big an AMC is, so that
would have been inherently unfair for someone to pick and choose. This
?? management company pays this bond; this one pays another; all a bond
does ?? while it’s in here is that it gives us an opportunity in one
point in time every year</p>

So the only mechanism to solve this issue was the recovery fund.

please sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chair. If there are any
other questions or issues which I could address, I’d be happy to do so.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chair,
I’d make a motion that we give the proposed Committee Substitute a
favorable report, unfavorable to the original bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’ve heard the motion, members of the committee. All in favor will say
aye. All opposed, no. The ayes have it, Representative Szoka. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chair, members of the committee. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Our next bill up is going to be House Bill 67. Representative
Jones. Representative Kelly Alexander moves that we have the PCS before
us for the purpose of discussion. All in favor will say aye. All
opposed, no. I believe the ayes have it. Representative Jones, you may
proceed sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chairman, members of the
committee. House Bill 67, and I know the short title is permanent
license plates for charter schools. I’ll just start by saying that this
is not so much a license plate bill as it is a charter school bill. I
want to make it very clear that this has nothing to do with the license
plate laws that this body passed in the last session. Those laws did not
address charter schools. They did not take that privilege away from
charter schools or anything like that. But they may have helped lead to
a situation where we need to clarify what has been the existing practice
at least I think in most cases, prior to now. What this bill simply
seems to, tries to do is to recognize that indeed charter schools are
public schools, and treat the vehicles of a public charter school in a
similar way as we would treat a vehicle of the traditional public
school, by allowing them to be able to access permanent license plates.
I will say that this has been the practice. It came to my attention
during the interim, where my local charter school who had been given
permanent license plates, went to the DMV and they were denied, and kind
of went through a situation where well, they really weren’t sure what
they should do. So we just wanted to clarify this. You will notice under
the PCS that basically says that it does have to be identified by some
kind of permanent decal or painted marking disclosing the name. The
fiscal impact is minimal. It’s really not about the money. The fiscal
impact to the state is estimated at $6900 in the next fiscal year, $8600
going forward. I think that it is more to the charter schools, quite
frankly not just about the money but just recognizing them for who they
are. They are a public school and they should be treated in that manner.
Madam Chairman, I would be happy to answer any questions. As a member of
this committee, I would be happy to offer up a motion at the appropriate
time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sidebar conversation. ?? Yes sir, we’re ready.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chair, I move for approval of the proposed
Committee Substitute for House Bill 67, unfavorable to the original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee, Representative Hall.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chair, just a question for the bill
sponsor or staff on these new license plates being issued, and my
question goes to the charter schools or the other entities who would get
the plates. What is the procedure, I know they’re either painting</p>

&lt;h3&gt;markings or permanent decal. Is there a procedure for the
approval or standardization of those and I have a follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe John ?? from federal evaluation could, he's in a position to
give you a better answer on this. Mr. Turcott, you're recognized sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam chair, and members, currently counties, cities, municipalities,
other instrument powers of government get permanent tags have decals.
There is no standardization on how they do them. There is a number of
different ways of doing it. The bill just had a generic reference to
that so they'd be in the same category or they'd follow the same process
that's currently out there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir follow up Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you again for ?? a bill sponsored, either one and the question is
toward if a charter school gets issued these permanent plates and then
is no longer in operation, what is the procedure for recovery and the
cost for recovery of the plates or to have the plates turned in and who
is responsible for accomplishing that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Turcott.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The division of motor vehicles still has authority over tags and any law
enforcement agency would stop the vehicle and find in court inquire
about the tag would find that the tag is no longer in effect. If someone
challenges the status of it, the title of the vehicle. If the title of
the vehicle is in the name of a corporation nonprofit organization is
out of existence it's void. This is all a matter for DMV to decide and
they have procedures now that they've been using to deal with permanent
plates that have been revoked by de facto or by law. So.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hollo.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just for a comment and it might be something that the bill sponsor looks
at before it comes to the floor. We know charter schools don't have as
long average life as our public school systems do and other government
entities so this is an issue that's probably going to come up with some
frequency and maybe you would look at how those plates would be required
to be turned in when charter schools or other entities wind down their
operations so that responsibility is part of the lying down instead of
us having to hope that somehow department of motor vehicles or someone
else stumbles upon the fact that the plates might be out there being
improperly used.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? for you. I'm sorry Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Had a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have a call for a motion before us. All in favor will say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed no. I believe that's unanimous.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Next bill up is going to be Senate Bill 212, referendum on incorporating
late jains, Representative Blackwell do you stand for the bill? Or? Yes.
290, ??. 290 ?? Memorandum will roll. Go to Senate Bill 290, Senator
Davis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam chair and ladies and gentleman of the Committee .
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis, just a moment please. Representative Burr moves that we
have the PCS before us for the purpose of discussion. Any objections?
Hearing none, Senator you may go forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair, the PCS that you have before you was completed
without my knowledge, and I obviously didn't have any input in this PCS.
What I'm here to advocate for is the bill that I sent to you from the
Senate. That was approved unanimously in the Senate. What I would..

<p id="40:00">
question.  Senator.  What’s the difference  between  the two bills,
could you help us out with that a little bit?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well the difference is basically the last part of this bill has some
time limits on it and I again I was not advised of these changes, they
were not done by me and they were not done with my knowledge, i my prior
knowledge So what I would advocate would be for the bill that I sent
over here with an amendment that was suggested yesterday. Came out of a
meeting with Mr. Cohen and it basically and my understanding is, and
Representative Presnell is here, and my understanding is that she agrees
with this amendment as well and that would be to have a referendum in
November of the Lake Junaluska residents to approve or disprove the
annexation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chairman.  I’m not sure Senator, I apologize I’m just
not familiar with the bill. You said there were some time limits in the
bill, could you tell me where that’s at?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think if you look in the last page, talking about in the PCS, you will
see in Section 2 and Section 3, we’re talking about this act becoming
effective August 31, 2015.  And again, this is a very unique situation.
Lake Junaluska it’s a Methodist assembly, many of you may have been
there and visited that campus, it’s a beautiful campus.  The problem
that we opinion to canvass the homeowners including all the residents to
determine how they’re going to resolve some issues especially having to
do with infrastructure and they were looking at several options and the
option that was most appealing to them was to bean need by the town of
Waynesville and so that’s what my original bill was proposing.  And we
have members here from Waynesville, and from Canton and from the church
that would be glad to answer any questions that the Committee may have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, I’m going to ask the staff to give us the difference between
the original bill and the Committee Substitute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Cohen?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chairman. The Committee Substitute has, sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He’s new.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Committee Substitute has two differences.  First of all, the
description has some corrections because of some small errors in the
original description. So the Committee Substitute fixes the description,
so that’s one difference between that and the original bill. So I would
suggest if we go forward with an amendment dealing with a referendum
that we work off the Committee Substitute rather than the Senate passed
bill. The second difference however that another major one is that if
provides that rather than being effective August 31, 2013 the annexation
be effective August 31, 2015 and if however, if any of the area in the
described areas incorporated in a new town by the General Assembly
between now and June 1st, 2015 which would require an act to the General
Assembly that that described area in a new town would not be annexed to
Waynesville but instead would be governed by the provisions of an
Incorporation Act and there is a process for incorporation so that’s the
two difference. If however no Incorporation Act was passed the area
would be annexed to the town of Waynesville effective 2015.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the Committee.  Representative Burr?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could possibly the sponsor of the Chair tell us, since the sponsor
doesn’t know where the PCS came fom?  Could someone enlighten us where
the PCS came from?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would like that as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d be glad to do that.  Representative e Burr, yesterday we had the
opportunity because yesterday all of the folks that had skin in the game
or happen to be in the building and we did have about a two hour
conversation to try to work through some concerns.  And we had Mr.
Cohen, we had people from the Conference Center and then we had members
of the public that live in the Lake Junaluska area.</p>

<p id="45:00">
I believe that this Committee Substitute is an opportunity for everybody
to have the time to do what they felt like that they wanted to do.
Perhaps try to incorporate. If that isn’t possible, that then they would
go under the annexation. But this just gives time for the folks to be
able to have the opportunity to do what they felt like they would like
to do. We felt it was a fair thing, and when we walked away from the
table I thought that everybody saw the options we took.
Two of the options emerged. One to call for the referendum, the other to
give the opportunity for incorporation, if it was to be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madame Chair, if I may add to that? That I, as the
bill’s sponsor, was not involved in those conversations. Neither was a
significant group of people from that area involved in those
conversations. It was a very limited group. I just think that that’s
highly irregular. It’s not the way that… I’ve been here for, this is my
third year and this is not the typical way that business is done.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moffitt?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madame Chair. I would like to kind of steer
the conversation more to a pedestrian line of questioning regarding this
issue, if you don’t mind? In regards to the infrastructure issues, let
me ask you this Senator. Is there currently like a Homeowner’s
Association or something for the homeowners in Lake Junaluska?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, there is. And we have people here in the audience
with the Chair Woman’s permission that would be glad to address these
issues. In my opinion they’ve done their due diligence and they can tell
you the sequence of events, and the results of the surveys that they
did, They will be able to give you the details.
We have the town manager of Waynesville. We have a representative from
Lake Junaluska. We have a lobbyist that’s been involved in this area
extensively, Chip Killian. And we have a representative from Lake
Junaluska, the utilities board or whatever they… I forgot the name that
they’re called. But we have resources here that could answer your
questions in detail.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Follow up, Madame Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up for Senator Moffitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ve read through all the material and Lake Junaluska
has a Public Works Department. So apparently the Public Works is funded
by a contribution or an assessment against all the homeowners, whether
they’re resident, full time or part time of Lake Junaluska. Is that
correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madame Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I may answer the member’s questions? That’s correct.
The homeowners own the infrastructure. They purchase their water from
the town of Waynesville, but they own the infrastructure. And one of the
reasons why they’ve pursued this annexation, again this was a friendly
annexation that was initiated by Lake Junaluska, is because they have
significant infrastructure needs that they’re no longer able to fund. So
they’re looking for a way to upgrade their infrastructure and still
supply the needs of their homeowners.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A follow up, Madame Chair? Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up for Representative Moffitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In regards to Waynesville providing them water, does
Waynesville only own the pipes up to the highway there and then when it
hits Lake Junaluska property it’s the responsibility of Lake Junaluska
to maintain and repair and replace those lines? Or is it to the actual
residences themselves?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Not to the residences. Up to the road.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  That would be the highway, or…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The highway, yes. That’s correct. Waynesville owns
that infrastructure and they supply the water, but the homeowners own
the infrastructure in the homeowner development itself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Follow up, Madame Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What about sewer? How is sewer currently handled
within the assembly?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The same thing applies for the sewer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If this annexation was to occur, what would happen to
the Public Works Department within Lake Junaluska? I notice that they
would take over some of the remaining structures, but not the
infrastructure. So would there be a savings to the homeowner by
reduction or elimination of an assessment for these items. How would
that work? So what would be the benefit to the homeowners outside of if
they’re going to be taxed by the city of Waynesville through this
annexation? Do they get some…</p>

relief financially from the assembly by this action moving forward
[SPEAKER CHANGES]yes the unfunded liability they have for the
infrastructure will be taken over by the town of Waynesville and their
taxes will be actually less and their services will be greater than the
assessment that they now have[SPEAKER CHANGES]and I thank you[SPEAKER
CHANGES]Representative Carney, Representative Martin[SPEAKER
CHANGES]Thank you Madam Chair I got a geography question I'm
Presbyterian not a Methodist so I'm not familiar with Methodist heaven
that is Langdon, Alaska how you don't have to draw me a map but just
give me a rough ideal if you would Senator how Waynesville and Langdon,
Alaska are situated geographically are they I'm interested also how
contiguous are the property areas[SPEAKER CHANGES]there right adjacent
to one another and so it will be no problem and so they will then be
contiguous it will be an easy annexation for them they're both in
Haywood County??[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Senator Madam Chair
follow-up[SPEAKER CHANGES]yes sir, [SPEAKER CHANGES]thank you Ma'am so I
see before us what looks like homeowner's association seemingly to
support the original version of your bill and then the town of
Waynesville and Haywood County Commissioners all supporting it.  Who are
the folks opposed to it and what are there reasons?  and that's the one
thing I think I'm not clear on[SPEAKER CHANGES]Nor am I sir, I know
there are some people that are having a difficulty with In my opinion,
I'll give you my opinion, some people ?? ?? has been there a methodist
assembly for a hundred years and so there are some people that have been
homeowners there for a significant amount of time, there homeowners
there,there who parents and grandparents who brought property and so
they're having difficult time learning how the transition is going to
occur. The United Methodist church is no longer sending over I think
like over a million dollars per year to help support that area and so
they are struggling with how to meet these infrastructure needs with
that loss of revenue and so things are changing but yet the
infrastructure needs the utilities are still there so they have to deal
with that and this was something again that was initiated by Lake ??
not by the town of Waynesville [SPEAKER CHANGES]Madam Chair to speak on
the bill[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes sir,[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Madam Chair,
right now I got just one side of the story and that one side of the
story leads me to support the original version of the bill over the PCS
I'll be interested to hear the other side of the story but until I hear
it I'm certainly inclined to support the original version of the
bill[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Stam[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you
Senator Davis if everybody in agreement with this why doesn't
Waynesville just do a voluntary annexation, why is the bill
necessary?[SPEAKER CHANGES]Well my understanding well we haven't had a
referendum and the reason why that we haven't had a referendum is that
sixty percent of the homeowners are non-residents so the amendment that
has been proposed is to have referendum this November and I will
certainly be amendable to having that amendment onto the bill to have a
referendum this November and then the annexation could occur after that
but it's a very unique situation again sixty percent of the homeowners
are non-residents so they wont be able to vote on a referendum
anyway.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Follow-up Madam Chair[SPEAKER CHANGES]Follow-up
Representative Stam[SPEAKER CHANGES]but in the annexation reform bill we
passed last session there still is a means where municipality can go
through a voluntary annexation quest why don't they just follow the
statute that's currently there instead of having to go through this
law[SPEAKER CHANGES]Madam Chair if I may defer that question to Mr.
Killian or one of the other representatives that may be able to address
that legal issue[SPEAKER CHANGES]there someone in the audience that
would like to address that question[SPEAKER CHANGES]I'm ?? as I
represent both of the parties to this the ??group as well as the town of
Waynesville this type of annexation really doesn't fit into the general
law and its the kind of thing that is so unique that Senator Davis said
that we needed to come to a general assembly for approval of this.but I
think that Mr. Young Buddy Young who's head of public works for ?? can
answer most substantive questions about the issues the important issues
that representative Martin has raised[SPEAKER CHANGES]Excuse me it
wasn't Representative Martin's question it was</p>

<p id="55:00">
Well then let me address this to staff then.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Starnes, I believe Mr. Cohen might ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? we have provisions for voluntary annexations, and it's been presented
that lake Junaluska is physically adjacent to the city limits of ?? so
why is their  voluntary annexation not a reasonable option under the
current law?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My understanding, let's assume it's contiguous to the corporate limits,
it would require 100% petition of all the property owners to annex the
described area. If there were any people who didn't want to sign, their
lots and water infrastructure would be left out of the town. If it's a
satellite annexation, really the result is the same. It requires 100% of
the people proposing annexation, but if there's any subdivided lots left
out, if it's non-contiguous, then it couldn't be annexed at all. Even
leaving out some people. So my understanding, it's because they could
not obtain 100% petition.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Starnes, you have a follow up sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I'd be curious to hear- I see Rep. Presnell in the audience, I'd
like to hear what her take on this proposed committee substitute
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the audience, Rep. Pressnell, if you would like to-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, it is a difficult subject, if they did the referendum, my problem
is that all of the people affected in lake Junaluska, because they don't
live there year round, would not be able to vote. But most of these
people, these are homes that have been passed down to generation to
generation, and I think they should have the choice to vote. But if they
do a referendum then we can't. It's sort of- A referendum would be, I'm
assuming it would be the best way to do it, but I can't- I have to say
I'm okay with it, but like I say, all those people are not going to have
the opportunity to vote on it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, if I may ask a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Pressnell's exactly right, there was a survey done, a very thorough
survey of all property owners including those who were residents and
those who were not residents. Mr. Young knows  the results of that
survey and he'd be happy to share those with you, I think that was the
route that was decided upon after consultation with the local delegation
as being preferable to a referendum. However both parties are willing to
do a referendum if that's the desire of the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Chair is going to displace this bill for this morning and we will
bring it back at our next meeting Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could you tell me when that next meeting is?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We hope it will be next Tuesday.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chairman and members of the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Our next bill up is going to be Senate bill 312, referendum on
incorporating lake James, I believe the sponsors were here a moment ago.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We're going to ask Representative- We're going to ask staff to go
through this proposed bill in the absence of the sponsors. Staff?

Madam Chair?
Madam Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you ma'am and I apologize for interrupting the staff. I'd like to
speak briefly on the consideration of this bill. This is a very big
state, we all work hard, our schedules are packed, and we make decisions
based on the information we have before us. Last night, at about 9:45,
the member representing this area, Rep. Blackwell, and the bill sponsor
called me as one of the co-chairs of finance, and asked me did I think
it would be possible for Senate Bill 312 to be pulled today, and they
asked that for 2 reasons: The first was that there were some last minute
amendments that they wanted to have prepared, and the second and more
important is that there were members of the public impacted by this bill
who support it</p>

members from the lake James area that the bill will not be heard today.
I apologies to you and to everyone else of this has caused a tremendous
problem I would respectfully ask that the bill remove from today's
calendar and recalenderated the next time the committee on finance would
meet.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you ma'am chairman. I do appreciate what
representative Lewis says I just wanna make sure that it goes on that I
go that nobody know that I am part of the berg county delegation and I
think myself alone with representative Starnes fully oppose this bill so
what do today wanna make sure we are on record with that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hall.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you ma'am chairman. I appreciate co-chairman
Louise comments about people from lake James being available at seeing
audience several people who are here and follow up on representative
Lewis’s comments that people have come a long way to be heard on this
bill and it's property schedule for today I would hope that we can go
and address the bill today depose of it again I know they are here and
they made the drive I don't know why they didn't get notified or who was
supposed to be in charge of it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Carney.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you ma'am chairman. I was back in the day when
we having ?? corporation joint committee I was a co-chair and was very
much involved with this petition back in 2009 and it seems to keep
coming back we at that point have bill unfavorable report and I still
continue to be oppose to this if you look at all the considerations that
are giving before and area is being cooperated this particular project
did not meet that criteria. And like representative Hall said yesterday
there were people that traveled here from lake James that hard was gonna
be on yesterday's calendar and some stayed overnight they expense to be
here today so I have a great deal of respect for representative Lewis
and his effort to help the another member of that delegation. This bill
is being around for a long time and it has problem every time it's been
here. It just hasn't gone anywhere I would hope that we would move
forward today and address this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam chair is one of the bill sponsor in the room? I
don't see them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate bills senator Daniel was here just a moment ago
I don't know why he had to leave. Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ma'am I suggest that we hear from the people who are
here but not vote on it today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blust.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have talked to senator Daniel briefly and I just
always thought it was the protocol that we pretty much of they wouldn't
overwhelming reason went by the bill sponsors wishes and he's the bill
sponsor and he told me he desired to have a bill postponed I don't
understand why we wouldn't postpone it now I just gonna also ask the
question who actually represents the area covered by this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff can you? Blackwell and Daniel it's my
understanding and they both were in the room just few minutes ago.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam chair if I can be recognized.

If the bill is before us we need to go ahead and do the business of what
needs to be done o the bill so we can move forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The bill is before us. Are there members of the
audience that would like to speak on this bill? For or against. Sir if
you’ll give us your name for the record, and hold the button down on the
mic.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right. Good morning. My name is Bruce Irving. I’m
from Burke County. I live at 2680 Nc 126, Morganton, North Carolina.
I’ve been one of the people who’s been opposing this bill since 2009,
and even as far back as 1997. And every time we come down we have the
same problems. We get laid over, laid over and we just keep driving,
keep driving, keep driving.
Fortunately enough I am retired and I’m able to use my own financial
money to come down and speak to all of you. And I think most of you have
met me over the period of time. And the bill itself has enough
credentials. I think we wrote a book on this bill from the last 1997 up
until the present time.
And there are so many things that I could start off. If you haven’t been
informed and haven’t seen it, you can contact Bruce Irving at area code
828-584-1047. Please give us some helping hand. We have a petition from
Southpoint. Two weeks ago Senate Bill, they pulled out 1780 out of it,
to go to committee. The map itself, you’ll see, is non ??.
Representative Carney was on those bills. Many of you was on those other
committees.
All we’re saying today is let’s put some rest to it so we can stop
traveling, and using our gas and our resources. And I’m sure if it gets
shut down or do whatever you need to do, you won’t have this camaraderie
of people calling. Burke County’s uproar. Our County Commissioners have
sent letters down. Our County Manager, our whole county has been
forward. It’s almost divided, and it’s not a black and white issue, it’s
a community at stand.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I move that we give Senate Bill 312 an unfavorable
report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hager?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madame Chairwoman. I’ve made no… Made sure
everybody understands how much I oppose this Bill. If you look at the
map, and the map is not before us, but if you guys remember the map from
last year. It totally removes an African American community. It goes
around the community. They weren’t surveyed like the other communities
were. It jumps across a lake, it goes down a road. It’s just an
incorporation like I’ve never seen.
I think Representative Starnes made the comment that if you were trying
to annex this area there’s no way you could annex it because of all the
violations you have in it. It’s just a terrible map. And I’d ask anybody
that is for this annexation, to look at the map.
It’s just amazing everything that has gone on with this and how long
it’s been around. If you look at the map, you would fully oppose it
also.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam, we are going to vote, I’ll give
you one minute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I’m not in favor of this bill, but the last
thing you’d want to do Representative Brawley is move for an unfavorable
report. Because under House rules, one fourth of the committee can then
bring it straight to the floor. I don’t know if that was the rule 18
years ago, but that’s the rule now. So I would encourage people to vote
no for the motion on an unfavorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have a motion before you, and the motion is to
give the bill an unfavorable report. All in favor will say aye. All
opposed no.
Division. The Chair’s going to call that the ayes have it, and the
motion to give the bill an unfavorable report carries. And at this point
we’re out of time and we stand adjourned.</p>
