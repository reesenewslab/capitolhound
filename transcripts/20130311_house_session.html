The House will come to order. Members will take their seats. Visitors
will retire from the chamber and the Sergeant-at-Arms will close the
doors. Member and visitors will please silence all cellular phones.  The
prayer will be offered by Representative Susan Fisher.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, and in the tradition of the Episcopal Church, when I say may
the Lord be with you, you say, and also with you.  Let’s try that. May
the Lord be with you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And also with you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let us pray.  May God bless you with a restless discomfort about easy
answers, path truths and superficial relationships so that you may seek
truth boldly and love from deep within your heart. May God bless you
with holy anger at injustice, oppression, and exploitation of people so
that you may tirelessly work for justice, freedom and peace among all
people.  May God bless you with the gift of tears to shed with those who
suffer from pain, rejection, starvation or the loss of all they cherish.
 So that you may reach out your hand and comfort them, and transform
their pain into joy.  May God bless you with enough foolishness to
believe that you really can make a difference in this world. So that you
are able, with God’s grace, to do what others claim cannot be done.  And
the blessing of God be with you, and remain with you forever.  Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members and visitors in the gallery will please stand and remain

Lobby of the legislative building, they have Morgan Kelly and family,

Mr. Speaker.

Representative Adams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. On a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Adams is recognized for a point of personal privilege not
to exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I won't need that much time. I just wanted to
speak and comment about the arts just a little bit, because they have
been a major part of my life. I've spent 40 years teaching art, much of
that time training young people, to teach the people that we have here
today who have been honored for their work. I hope that all of the
members will take some time to view the work. I want to thank Denise
Weeks for putting the exhibit together and working with the schools and
the North Carolina Art Education Association, and I want to congratulate
all of the young people there. They have a variety of mediums there.
Most all of the them are two-dimensional works from print-making to
collage. The arts are very, very important. As a matter of fact, most of
us think about-- generally, we think about the arts as being nice, and
the arts are nice, and they're wonderful, and children-- We all love art
like we love ice cream. But the arts are more than niceties; they are
necessities for our lives. And they really-- what it all boils down to,
it's really what makes us humans. So I want to thank those young people,
I want to encourage them to find the mediums that you love to work in
and continue to do that. I'm sure we're going to see your names in
lights and in many, many places after tonight. Thank you. The work's
going to be exhibit for a year. Is that right? All year. So you'll have
a chance to pass it. I'm not sure if things are for sale or not, but you
might want to really take a really good look. I think they're very
rewarding, and it demonstrates the hard work of not only the young
people but the teachers who have taken the time to work with them. So,
again, congratulations to all of you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McElraft, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are recognized for a point of personal privilege not to exceed three
minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore. For 46, almost 47 years, I think
I've been mispronouncing my name. I've been married almost 47 years, and
I thought until the past few years that it was Mc-EL-raft. But I found
out in caucus today and also tonight that it's MACK-el-raft. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Elmore, what is your name and why do you want to talk?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of personal privilege. It's Elmore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. As an art educator myself, I want to reiterate what
Representative Adams was saying about the importance of Youth Art Month.
Not only do we have this wonderful display in the back lobby, Youth Art
Month celebrations are going on all over the state in your local schools
and in your local galleries. The arts are so important to the future of
our state through our creativity and our innovation that it fosters. And
that's a competitive edge for us here in North Carolina. I'm very proud
of these students and what they do. I'm proud of the teachers that teach
them. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. House Bill 95. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll be a substitute for House Bill 95, a bill to be entitled: An act to
alter the standard of proof for public safety telecommunications and
dispatchers. Gerald Sidney of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Torbett, you are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you. This is-- To me, it's not a simple
bill. As many of you know, the era of the past where 911 operators, that
used to be called dispatchers or whatever, they've taken more training.
It's not that same period of our history. I want you to imagine just for
a minute that you're</p>

Doctor in a hospital, with all the tools you have at your disposal and
all of your hospital amenities that you have, all your staff you have
there to help save someone’s life, take care of them. And then I want
you to imagine you’re an ER doctor, with all the latest technologies in
most places, and the staff and the emergency care and the assistance and
all the elaborate tools you have to work with to help save someone’s
life. And then I want you to imagine you’re a 911 operator, and you have
three tools. You have your training, you have your hearing, and you have
your speech. And that’s the only three tools that you have to hopefully
talk to an individual while they are trying to save perhaps the life of
their loved one. That, with very little legal coverage. So what this
bill simply does, it raises their liability to the level of an emergency
room doctor, gives them a little bit more coverage and protection. I
want you to think about it and just what they do with those three tools.
And that’s the only tools they have in the process of saving lives. And
I hope you support the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or
debate? If not, the question before the House is the passage of the
Committee Substitute for House Bill 95 on its second reading. All those

Assembly of North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further
discussion or debate? If not, all those in favor will say aye. All those
opposed will say no. The bill has passed its third reading and will be
sent to the Senate. House Bill 120, the clerk will read. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Committee Substitute for House Bill 120, a bill entitled an act
to require approval from the North Carolina building code council before
a unit of local government may require building inspections in addition
to those required by the building code, to specify the frequency and
effective dates of code updates, and to exempt cable television
installation from building code requirements. General Assembly of North
Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] While Representative Hager is
preparing to be recognized, I’ll announce that we will not be hearing
this on third reading tonight. Representative Hager is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker pro tempore. To debate the bill
and send forth an amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re recognized to do
that, to debate the bill and then send forth an amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This bill is very simple. It has really
two main parts and then you’ve got a smaller third one. The first part
of the bill prohibits cities and counties from going outside the
specified building code inspections that are in our building code. Let
me tell you, to talk a little bit about building code. Most of you folks
may or may not know it, I’ve got a couple books on my desk. One’s a
thermodynamics book, one’s property heat transfer, one’s a solids as
differentials book, and these are the kinds of books that go into
developing the building code for North Carolina. It’s not what somebody
feels like they need to do. It’s not what feels right. It’s a very
scientific code, and the inspections are set out to be very scientific
also, and that’s what they’re there for. Now, this prohibits them
getting outside that code, but it doesn’t prohibit a city or county or
individual from addressing the building code council and saying we’ve
got a problem on the coast with geology and we need a different
inspection. Well if that inspection’s good for my good friend
Representative Shepherd in Onslo County, then why is it not good in
Wilmington and why is it not good somewhere else? So it provides a
mechanism, the process does, to be able to get that inspection that
Onslo County folks think is good and needed into other areas where it is
also needed, the geology would be the same. That’s the first part of the
bill. It makes sure you stay within those needed areas of inspection and
allows the mechanism for newer inspections, that are looked at in the
scientific engineering way. Second piece of this bill takes the ability
of the code council and says that instead of you have to look at the
code for revisions every three years, we’re going to say now you can
look at it every six years. Now you</p>

<p id="25:00">
And ask yourself, does that preclude them looking at it every two years?
No. It just says in six years you have to look at for revisions. Does
this preclude the fact that we may have, and I'll use our representative
Shephards ?? as a good example. So we have a hurricane clip issues, to
where hurricane clips are failing during hurricanes. Does this preclude
the fact that we need to do an engineering study to determine a
different hurricane clip and put in the code? No, that can be done any
time. This just says, every six years you need to look at the code.
Third part of this bill, looks at how updates are made, how
interpretations are made and what website they're put on. Very simple.
Then it actually removes cable tv cabling from an inspection because its
low voltage cable and there's no safety or structural issues. Let me put
it out there now, our building code is designed to make sure you can
build a safe house, and a structurally sound house. Thats what its for.
Its not there for product placement. Its not there for social
engineering. Its there for folks in my district, where we had almost 20%
unemployment, can build a house that they can afford to build. And
that's what it comes down to folks, so we only allow folks to build
houses in North Carolina, that they can afford to build. As you guys
know, the building sectors been hurt worst than any other sector just
about in this state. This helps them a little bit at a time, helps them
get back on their feet. So I ask you to vote for the bill. Send forth
amendment Mr speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Recognize send forth amendment.
Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Haygard moves to amend
the bill on page 1 line 9 to page 2 line 11 by rewriting these lines to
read.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Haygard is recognized to explain
the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. The first part
of this is very simple. It just moves the language in a general statue
from the inspection work in progress to the duties and responsibilities.
More of a technical correction. The second part makes sure that this
bill has no effect on the cities and counties to perform periodic
inspections of existing buildings for hazardous and unlawful conditions.
This bill just applies to one and two family new constructions, not
commercial constructions. And the second one, I mean the third part of
the amendment clarifies where the explanations are put, what website.
Department of insurance website. That's basically all the amendment
does. I ask for your vote on it please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Discussion or
debate on the amendment. There's a couple members who sought recognition
on the bill. Representative Harrison or Luebke do you wanna speak on the
amendment? Harrison? No? If there's no further discussion on the
amendment the question before the house is the adoption of the amendment
sent forth by representative Haygar. All those who are in favor will
vote aye. All those oppose will vote no. Clerk will open the vote. The
clerk will open the vote. The aye's are 109, the no's are 3. The
amendment has been adopted. So the question before the house, is the
bill as amended, representative Cotham is recognized if she desires.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr Speaker. To speak on the bill.[SPEAKER
CHANGES] You're so recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you mr speaker and
members. House bill 120 was created to be a simple bill. And the goal of
this bill was to create a uniform building code through the state of
North Carolina. And you may ask, if this really needed. Is this really
necessary. And are there really problems. And to each of those questions
I would say yes. From personal experience. Now I cannot speak as
eloquent and as detailed as representatives Haygard and some of our
other colleagues can speak because they have practical experience
building homes every day and for many years. My experience comes, not
from building a home, but comes from a commercial building. And although
this bill doesn't involve commercial real estate and commercial
building. There are still some very similar issues and some similar
patterns that I would like to bring to your attention. many of you may
not know but at the end of the last session, i started the process to
open my own small business in Charlotte. And like anyone who's opened a
small business, I knew that I would face many hurtles just as anything
who's every built a custom build home. You know that you will face many
obstacles. I thought I was prepared but I can tell you I met my match
when it came to building inspections. And I mean no disrespect, to the
local men and women from local government who perform these inspections
for our safety. But I encountered some very serious and some very
frustrating ..</p>

creating issues that no home owner or no business owner should have to
go through.  All I wanted was a fair shake, for the building code to be
enforced as it is written, and no individual interpretations or
additional inspections that, guess what, cost me additional money as a
business owner, and this is what homeowners face.  I did not want any
surprises, and all the changes that I was all of a sudden gonna have to
do totaled over $30,000.  That's not small change to a small business.
That's not small change to someone who is building a home.  Every fee,
every inspection costs additional money.  That costs the builder money;
it costs the homeowners money.  There's the cost everywhere, and that's
a big part of this bill, and we need to make sure that we are talking
about that.  And, although my situations does involve more commercial,
there's a lot of overlap and a lot of parallel.  I have spent the last
several months talking with home builders, with commercial builders all
from over this state.  From phone calls to emails to even coming into my
office and talking about these issues, and some of the horror stories-
it should not be like this in North Carolina.  We should not allow this
to occur.  No builder is trying to skirt the law here.  No one is trying
to get something done quicker and risk safety.  That is not what this is
about.  Everyone deserves consistency, and what happens in Mecklenburg
should be the same in Lincoln or in Union or in Sampson County.  That is
what this bill is about.  It's about creating a uniform code, and so I
ask you to think about that.  I ask you to think about the constituents
you came here to represent, who are home builders, who are small
business owners, who are desperate to be a homeowner.  Those are our
constituents.  I ask you to support small business and support this
bill.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Harrison of Guilford is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I wanted to
debate the bill on Section 2 dealing with the change in the building
code updates.  I will defer to my colleagues about the other parts of
the bill.  I don't disagree with Representatives Hager and Cotham that
we need uniformity and consistency, and that's an admirable trait.  I
don't know that that's what we're achieving in part two of the bill
dealing with the delays in the building code updates.  I've heard from a
number of individuals and groups that are very concerned about this
bill, and you all on your computers tonight, we got an email from the
National Electrical Manufacturers.  There are others.  The NC State
Fireman's Association, local government representatives, the American
Chemistry Council.  A number of green builders, green architects have
spoken to me about this.  I think it's important to remember with the
building code that we're establishing a minimum standard of construction
that will last for nearly 100 years, so we want to achieve the safest
and the healthiest standards possible.  Codes can cover everything from
wind resistance to severe weather resistance to lead paint to energy
performance, and these are important considerations.  Right now we're
tied to the international code, and that's updated every three years,
and there are 25 other states that adopt the same procedure, and we are
number three in housing construction in this state, so it's important
that we sort of achieve a minimum standard that at least the rest of the
country is achieving, and I think it's really important that the rules-
that we construct our houses- that they are safe and healthy, we protect
the homeowners; these buildings are around.  Nearly 50% of energy
produced is consumed by buildings.  It should be viewed in context, and
I realize it's a separate bill.  There's a separate bill, House Bill
201, which will repeal the energy code that we adopted in this body two
years ago, and that increased energy efficiency.  If this bill passes,
we will not be able to re-address that issue until 2019, and I think
that's an important consideration.  I don't know how many of you all saw
that last week we were number two in energy job creation in the country,
and that is in part because of these clean energy policies we're
pursuing, and a lot of that has to do with housing; energy efficient
housing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does Representative Hager rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
State your point of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm wondering if Representative Harrison is talking about House Bill 201
and not this House Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll allow her a little bit of leeway.  We are on House Bill 120.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you</p>

Mr. Speaker, I only mention house bill 201 in the context of house bill
120 'cause if 120 passes, and 201 passes will not be able to achieve an
energy code for another six years.  So, those are the major points that
I want to make.  I appreciate your consideration.  I think this is an
important bill, and I urge you to vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I'm wondering whether Representative Hager
would yield for question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does Representative Hager yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gladly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager, do you believe in local control?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not when it comes to engineering standards.  Local control is good in
most areas, but not engineering standards.  Engineering standards are
worldwide, they're physics, they're geology.  Those change on region
basis, not local basis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You're recognized for a follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Thank you, Representative Hager.  I'm a little
surprised about this bill, because this is the sort of thing that the
committee on regulatory reform usually would not approve, because,
generally speaking, the committee on regulatory reform in fact reduces
regulation, and in fact what you're doing in this bill is increasing
regulation.  There's an extra step in here.  You're requiring city and
county inspectors to go to the state building council.  And I'm
wondering whether that doesn't seem a little odd to you that you're
adding bureaucracy, which is the thing that your side usually is railing
against, and so I'm just wondering where you are on this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for that question, representive Lucas.  This bill passed out
of the committee with a unanimous vote.  I think representive Bell made
the favorable motion on it, and I don't know exactly where you're
getting that I'm increasing bureaucracy with this bill, when you
actually reduce the number of inspections that are done.  When folks are
egregiously going out there and inspecting things that aren't proven
through engineering standards, that aren't proven through geology
issues, that aren't proven to be structural or safety issues, they're
doing these inspections willy nilly without following the process set
forth through the building code council to get these inspections into
the building code council if they're legitimate inspections.  Now, I'm
not sure how I can decrease the amount of inspections and create
bureaucracy.  I'm not sure I understand that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further debate,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I wanted to see if he'd yield for another question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would you yield for another, third question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ecstatically.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Pardon?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, he will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I want to ask you specifically, Representative Hager on page two, line
nine, and it's also on page one with respect to the counties.  This is
about the cities.  But the language is the same, as you know, in both
sections.  On line nine, references that city inspectors, county
inspectors must send their requests to the building code council and the
building code council shall review in a timely manner.  My question is,
what is a timely manner?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would you give me that page and line number again, Representative Lewis?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.  Page a two, line nine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is the gentleman referring to the bill, or the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I'm not quite used to this new system, as maybe you aren't
either.  But I was referring to the bill, and I can also reference page
one, line 26.  It's the same question I have, is what constitutes a
timely manner, if a city or county is concerned about something?  What's
a timely manner?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I've got it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representive Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I think, representive Luebke, I understand the
issues in other areas such as the law, or some of these others may be
like a rubber brand, and they can expand or contract, but in engineering
and scientific terms, those things don't expand and contract.  Physics
is physics.  Geology is geology.  I had explained before.  I think a
timely manner is when it's put through the scientific processes to
determine is this a correct inspection or not.  A, is it a good
inspection?  B, has it been inspected correctly?  C, are you achieving
the result that you need to achieve?  Now, how long it takes is how long
it takes.  Now, if there's emergency issues, there's a process for
emergency procedures within the building code council.  And I will tell
you that the building code council chairman, as an individual has
endorsed this change, and also the department of insurance has endorsed
this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, representive Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke is recognized to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Members of the house, this is a very odd bill,
because it does, first of all, take control away from your building
inspectors at the city and county levels.  You should know that</p>

At this committee reading on Wednesday, Thursday, that the County
Commissioner's Association had a representative who spoke against the
bill. Also, I checked the League of Municipalities, representing cities,
and I was told by the League that it too is against the bill. So we have
city, er cities in our county against this bill. We also have the
Building Inspectors Association against this bill. We also have the
chemical industry against this bill. Why are they against this bill?
Well, they're against it for reasons  Representative Harrison addressed,
that having three years in one, couple, in forty eight states and six
years in two states is not for them good business. So there's a whole
lot of people who are against this bill and I haven't heard of very many
people who are for this bill. And to me, the list of people who are
opposed to it, I don't know if you've heard from your cities or counties
about it, individual members, but I have, not only from my city counsel,
my county commission, and from my chief building inspector in the city
of Durham. Though, this, I'm looking in section one of course, and I
just can't see that this represents good policy at all. And I would say
finally that, will all respect, Representative Hager, the explanation
about engineers and this, that, and the other to get around the
definition of timely manner is really not okay. I mean our, what we tend
to put in our statutes is specific times. And I don't understand timely
manner, and I think there should be an amendment that says, two weeks or
one month or whatever it is. How is the the city supposed to know how
long they're gonna wait for the business, from the building councils,
the state building councils? So I'd, I'd feel a lot better about this
bill if there were an amendment that actually stated how long cities and
councils have to wait. But at this point, absolutely can't support the
bill and I don't really see how anyone else can either. I heard
Representative Cotham and I appreciate that she had a bad experience and
I'm sorry for her, but as far as public policy is concerned this is just
taking power away from cities and counties and giving it to a state
agency. I urge you to oppose the bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McGrady is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A question for the bill sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does he yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager, with respect to the three year insecure issue,
isn't it true that our neighboring states, South Carolina and Virginia
for example, and actually the majority of states revise their, their
code every time the International Code Council does, which basically is
a three year cycle?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McGrady, not all of them do. Michigan for instance has a
six year cycle. I'll, I'll say that the rest of those states you
mentioned also have lower taxes than us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But the answer though is that the vast majority of the states have a
three year cycle including our neighboring states, is that right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't know, I don't know the vast majority for sure. I think our
neighboring states do but I can't tell you every state does, which ones
do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One last question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess I'd, I'd like to just hear from you why should we be telling the
building code council what cycle they ought to do this on? I think
they're the people that, that are responsible for doing it. And I
understand the chairman came in speaking only for himself, but to my
understanding it's the council itself hasn't taken position. So that's
the question. Why should we weigh into this debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative McGrady. I, I think we as a legislative body
have a, have a responsibility, judiciary responsibility to the home
builders to make sure that is a managed right. It's certainly within our
purview to make sure agencies we have out there are doing the right
thing. In this case we think that they're not doing the right thing for
the sector that ran, for the devastation this sector's seen, and for the
folks in my district and each one of your districts that are trying to
build that small house, that first homebuilder that's just trying to get
in, that doesn't, that can't stand another twenty five hundred dollars
or another three thousand dollars due to more inspections or more
increase in energy efficiency and those things. Now they can always do
those things. I can increase the efficiency of my house by one or two,
but that’s my decision. I believe it ought to be the home builder's
decision. We tell them the minimum standards that they can build to, and
if they want to increase it, if a young family comes into some money,
they get, they get their taxes back and they want to increase
insulation, let them, but I don't want to keep them out of the home just
for that.

to prohibiting added inspections after a building has already passed its
final inspection. I don't think counties and cities ought to be going
back there to do that sort of thing. My concern is with the three to six
year issue. I met with the home builders this afternoon.  There are a
wide range of groups that the way this bill moved, it moved fairly
quickly and it wasn't any bad intention.  We just got room on the
calendar.  The lobbyists in favor of the bill did a very good job of
moving their bill forward but the fact is that a lot of folks are
beginning to figure out that this bill is out there and as I think
Representative Harrison mentioned even as while we were here we're
getting different groups weighing into the discussion with reasonable
questions that need to be answered.  I hope that I'll be in a position
when the bill comes back on to the calendar to vote for the bill but
because of my reservations about the three to six year issue I'll vote
no tonight and if I can't resolve them I'll be prepared to offer an
amendment when it comes back.  Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insko is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd like to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman of the
House, I share some of the concerns that have been raised.  I spoke with
the building inspector in Orange County.  They still have some questions
about the bill. One of the concerns they had was that building
inspectors have no immunity so if there is something that goes wrong a
building inspector because they weren't allowed to do some extra
inspections building inspectors would be at risk. The North Carolina
Firemen's Association is also opposed.  They have concerns that it might
affect fire safety, result in a higher insurance because it would be out
of compliance with some of the fire safety standards and I'd just like
to comment that there are many stakeholders, many parties, who are
interested in this bill and I agree that it has been rushed.  This is an
example of probably a process that should have happened more carefully
in the Committee.  I don't know that we really need to be raising these
kinds of issues on the floor. A really good Committee, a longer
Committee process where people actually had time to get their questions
answered, so I join Representative Grady that I'm going to be doing some
more homework on this tonight to make sure that these questions are
answered and I hope that we'll have a few days before we have a third
reading so we'll all be able to vote one way on the bill.  Thank you.
Tonight I'll be voting no on the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brody is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker.  I'd like to give a practical
view of this bill.  For the last decade I've been a home builder and I
wasn't a very big home builder but I guess about 25 homes a year was
kind of the average so I had a lot of experience in this.  It is a
full-time job. I actually built in about 6 diferent jurisdictions, one
of them being in South Carolina so that really doesn't affect here but I
built in 5 in the Nashua Charlotte area.  One of them was Gaston County
where I had to learn the building code and how they wanted to interpret
it as well as the inspections. But then right in the middle of Gaston
County I had to build in the  City of Gastonia and I had to learn a
whole different code and a whole different list of inspections. And then
I went to Union County where I'm from and I did the same thing, learning
a different code, learning different inspections and of course right in
the middle of that is the city of Monroe which I think has about, behind
Mecklenberg County has the record in the amount of inspections that are
required and then of course I built in Mecklenberg County which the
reality is I don't think they've come to grips with if they're part of
North Carolina yet in that aspect.  So that's a practical view of the
number of inspections but I want to give you a little brief explanation
of the three year ?? and I think we kind of get not an accurate view of
what's that all about. When the building code comes out, let's say for
example in 2009 and it isn't one where it comes out and then it's
automatically enacted.  The process just begins at that point and what
they do is they go through a review process and that may take a year to
review and decide what part of that international code is going to be
enforced in North Carolina.</p>

<p id="50:00">
Then for the next, about a year maybe a little bit less, it gets
filtered down through the local code officials and they have to learn
what the new changes are. So once the local officials get to the word of
what it is then that becomes, then that in return gets passed along to
the builders like myself. So in reality by the time; for example in 2009
code comes down to our level where we have to implement it, it may be
two and a half to three years just to get there and then we, I, we like
to as builders, at least like to work under a code for a while before
the new 2012 code comes out. So it’s a, it’s a relief for us builders to
be able to know exactly what our code is at one point so we can continue
to build our, our houses. I’m glad that the, Representative’s Hager’s
Bill has an exception to where they’re protective over things because
that does come up but it’s pretty rare that it comes up. So I ask you
where you consider the practical aspect of it and I ask you to support
this Bill. It is a good Bill. I say, thank you very much. It’s about
time we got some relief from that. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Clark is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the Bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’re recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What I’d like to do is try to address some of the questions that’s been
raised this evening regarding, maybe a question regarding local control.
We actually have a state-wide billing code. There’s no local control in
it for the specific purpose of providing uniformity. The purpose of the
building code is revived for public safety, health and welfare of the
public. And as such when you have a lot of local interpretations, it
creates the very bureaucracy that we’re trying to avoid. The way this
Bill is structured is that if a county has a specific reason to go
beyond what’s identified in the state-wide building code, they can
petition the building code council who has the necessary expertise to
vet their request and make a decision regarding whether those additional
inspections are required. And so that is still maintained in terms of
providing a local element. Regarding the increased liability to
inspectors I don’t actually understand that because what we’re talking
about is a standard of care. In fact, if you go to interpretations
beyond the code it seems to me not being a lawyer but that would
increase your risk of exposure. So what we’re trying to do is actually
create a standard, a uniform standard across the state that both
builders can rely on in the financial aspects of construction homes but
more importantly, the residents can rely on in the safety and viability
and security of the homes that they purchase through the construction.
And so regarding the three year cycle, I would make a distinction
between the residential code and the commercial code. At this point in
time we refer to the international code council for the ?? code council
we adopt those and we incorporate North Carolina amendments into those.
That is on a three year cycle. There is talk in industry that that is
moving too fast. And from the commercial side, the commercial code
references, international standards that were not even ready at the time
of publication and so those had to be incorporated into amendments. And
so, what I do want to make is the distinction between the commercial
code and the residential code. Purpose of the code is for life standards
and minimum safety standards. It’s not to interject philosophy or
anything else into that. That’s why we feel like, I will certainly be
supportive in be able to move this to a six year cycle for the
residential code. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debates? If not, the question before the House is
the passage of ?? committee substitute for House Bill 120 as amended or
in second reading. All those in favor will vote aye, all those who
oppose will vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock
the machine and record the vote. 88 voted aye and 26 voting no. The bill
has passed its second reading and will remain on the calendar so that we
have a clean bill tomorrow, the Chair votes the amendment encroached.</p>
