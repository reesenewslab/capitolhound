[SPEAKER CHANGES]
, usually in an child of my son here. my wife had to sit between us but
we don't have that barrier today that made us has worked all that out
and we get along great. thank you very much for having us here today as
West Virginia former West Virginia legislator and my son JB hasn't
present West Virginia legislators. we are here to say what what West
Virginia does is what North Carolina should be about wanting, and give
the opportunity and have the opportunity what West Virginia has done in
the area of public financing of judicial races and what it is meant to
us, and just a bit of its background and then my son 's perspective is
that he's in the legislature that memorialize and make permanent the
public financing of of our Supreme Court races. we don't have a unlikely
North Carolina. we have only one court between the trial courts and the
final appeal is called the West Virginia spring court has only five
members on you have both Supreme Court and a intermediate court. I opted
against twenty two people total, whose who are subject to your public
financing law. so, without very quick background on absent and why I
think it's important for you all to two thousand nine. our governor was
successful in having former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a
service chair of the commission of the commission in West Virginia,
which I served on to find ways to improve the need method of judicial
selection and to enhance and some way, try to restore the confidence of
our citizens in its judiciary. it had fallen throughout all-time low,
primarily because so much money millions of dollars by both the business
community as well as the plaintiffs trial bar and come into influence
the elections of our Supreme Court and also circuit judges, but
primarily, our Supreme Court recognizing that that hurt West Virginia is
standing in this country when it's trying to attract businesses out of
perception that justice was bought not not earned by being a good judge.

<p id="05:00">
...came up with several recommendations to improve things. The first,
and primary one was, after hearing Judge Bryant, from your intermediate
court, and other people from North Carolina, was that we adopted a
public financing test pilot program, to try it out, modeled almost
entirely upon your legislation that had passed a few years before that
in North Carolina.
So we are the model; we tested your model, and used it. In 2010 our
legislature, before JB [??] was elected, passed the governor's
recommendation to create a pilot program to try it out. So the first
time it was tried out -- you've been doing it now for six election
cycles, I think -- the only person who accepted the public financing
route for one of our two Supreme Court seats won an election, with
public financing, against two opponents who were, both raised over a
million and a half dollars, were both very highly connected in the legal
community and basically in the plaintiffs' trial law community, and this
person won with public financing, and he was a virtual unknown, he'd
never served in political office before, had a wonderful resume as a
good judge, would be a good judge, but had no experience at all in
raising money and that kind of thing that you have to do to get elected,
and he won. And by the way, parenthetically, he was a Republican, which
in our state -- we have about a two to one Democrat majority in our
state -- however, as with many states and with North Carolina, there are
a lot of conservative Democrats, and the Republican numbers are
swelling. But in any event, it was still remarkable and unusual for a
Republican to get elected to a full term. In fact, I don't think it had
happened since the Great Depression.
That's our experience with the program, and it was viewed as so
successful by both the business community, as well as the plaintiffs'
trial bar, that the legislature easily and fully adopted it as a
permanent program this past session that was just over and JB can tell
you a little bit about that bill, but nonetheless, the point is that the
model for us has worked, we believe it is going to enhance the
reputation of the judiciary in West Virginia and help restore our
reputation as a judiciary that makes laws and decisions based on the
facts and not who contributed to your campaign. And public financing of
campaigns is what brought that about, and we used your model to do so.
I would certainly be anxious to field any questions that you might have
as to our experience in West Virginia and what it's meant to us, but
that's our experience.
[speaker change] Thanks. My experience is slightly different as an
actual delegate who was voting on a piece of legislation to permanize
this campaign finance system in West Virginia, and just to give you a
little background on myself, I'm a freshman delegate, 31 years old, and
I like to consider myself a pretty conservative guy, and as such, I take
the First Amendment ramifications of public financing very seriously. I
understand the ways in which people's money should be able to be
expressive in the political arena, I believe that they should be able to
do so.
I also believe that there's a very big difference between a legislative
election and a judicial election, and in my state, unfortunately, unlike
your state, our economic climate is very, very poor. Just driving here
from West Virginia you can just tell when you're leaving West Virginia
and you're entering a state that  enacts pro-growth, pro-business
legislation, because the lights are off, the interstate's dark in West
Virginia, and it's very bright here, because there's people out buying
stuff, and people with businesses doing things. And one of the reasons
why my state lags so far behind yours is that we have a perception of
having a very unfair judiciary, and the word 'perception' is very
important here, and perception plays into my decision on this issue
significantly, because I don't actually believe that we have a bad
judiciary in West Virginia.
Contrary to what a lot of my conservative counterparts would have you
believe, I believe that the judges in West Virginia do a very good job
of being as fair as possible and deciding the issues based on the rule
of law, but that doesn't matter. All that matters is what people think.
All that matters is why people think that these judges have made these
decisions, and...</p>

<p id="10:00">
And when money creeps its way into judicial elections, it doesn’t matter
what side it comes from, one side is going to believe that the judge
made the decision for one reason or another that wasn’t based on the
actual facts of that case. It is my experience in conversing with and
dealing with many of the business leaders in my state, having judiciary
that is perceived to being independent will be one of the major steps in
growing the economy in my state, because businesses will be much more
willing to come into to a state where they believe they are going to
have a predictable outcome in any kind of judicated issue, be it in
front of a Business Court or the Supreme Court or the Circuit Court. And
for that reason, I supported West Virginia’s making permanent of the
public financing for judges. On a secondary note, as a legislator we’re
tasked with taking care of the public’s money and protecting the public
trust in the government. Were always going to be collecting taxes and
we’re always going to have things to do for the people, and the bill
that was created in my state, I found the amount of money that was going
to be spent on these elections to be while a very large number, in the
millions, a very large amount of money, I thought that the investment
was good, because what you’re getting out of it is a system of judiciary
that can be trusted by both the business community, the people of the
state, and as well as, you have to remember there are a lot of criminal
implications here too. Here is somebody is up on for first degree murder
who certainly would like to think your judge wasn’t out campaigning
potentially, when maybe they could’ve been reading a law book  or maybe
studying up on the ways in which a persons freedom might need to be
protected under the law. So, for all of those reasons I supported the
bill and I really will be more than happy to answer any of your
questions, particularly coming as somebody who voted a little bit in a
minority in my party for this issue back home, so thank you all very
much. [Speaker Changes] I wanted to mention that there is one big
difference between our legislation and yours, and the only that I know
of, and that is we do publicly finance a partisan election, we are still
a partisan state. Our constitution allows elections to be non-partisan
for the judiciary, but it hasn’t, our legislator hasn’t and I is not
likely to do so in the neat future. So, that is the difference, we have
to finance the primary and the general, so your system where you have a
one election and it’s non-partisan is probably a little less expensive
to finance than ours. [Speaker Change] And one last comment. This is all
predicated on the idea that we are working with the frame work of
elected judiciary. It would probably be my hope that judges wouldn’t be
elected at all, in the frame that I was working, in my state, in my
legislator. The goal is to find and elect the best, fairest and smartest
judges possible. I believe that allowing a public option for judges who
do so goes a long way to ensuring that the judiciary is as strong as it
can be. [Speaker Change] Are there any questions? [Speaker Change]
Representative Iler for an inquiry. [Speaker Change] Thank you Mr.
Chairman, thanks gentleman coming from West Virginia. I’m not sure who
this question is for, but I noticed that the definition of success
seemed to be that the gentleman won or the lady won the office. Could
that be a factor in there? That the perception that he or she is more
fair, because they took the public financing and the other guys were
bought because they weren’t and that contributed to that person’s
election or, is really successful and is really just the best judge of
the group. [Speaker Change] Excellent question, certainly the goal is to
get the best judges, but as we said, the perception of judiciary is also
very important. We have a very little nice laboratory on this issue
because it was actually two seats that were up, and so the top two won
and they all ran together. And, the won that won was a very highly
financed by special interest, winner, and that person is a very good
judge, frankly. She was the incumbent Chief Justice too, so she had a
lot going for by incumbency.</p>

did get a lot of votes because he was perceived as being not influenced
by money. I'm sure that's true. I'm not sure that's a bad thing either,
but I think at least the- well one other thing, sorry Debbie. What this
does when you have public financing, is it also makes the opportunity
for many many people are willing to run for the office who I know if
you're a politician, and I've been one, in the political arena you have
to go raise money. And some people consider that unseemly who would be
wonderful judges. Maybe they wouldn't be good legislators or governors,
but they might well be good judges and you don't want to discourage
people that really don't like that aspect of running for office, having
to raise great deals of money. You want them to be in the pool, and this
puts them in the pool.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Mr. Chairman.
I believe there was mention about a primary, if my recollection is
correct, we have a primary to get it down to the 2 candidates without
labels, and those 2 run off regardless of- there's no party, but they do
run off in November, til the- we already have a primary of sorts,
depending on how many are in the race.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Both are nonpartisan and and that's- and ours- that's the only
difference there but yes, you have 2 cycles like we do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So far, I'm working to improve that situation, so...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to answer your question real quickly, I think you can't answer it.
I think honestly there are probably some people- That's an inherent
problem with judicial elections. And you know, every time you vote on a
bill and every time you weigh a piece of legislation, it's important to
look at both sides of the issue. It's funny, we were in a meeting this
morning, and somebody asked me what I thought the biggest problem with
public financed judicial elections were, and my answer was it's possible
that people would think that those who didn't take the money was less
fair. And is that possible? Yeah, it's absolutely possible. But do I
think that outweighs the benefits of having judges not out raising money
and being financed with the people's money as opposed to special
interest money? I don't. But I can certainly respect and understand
anybody who would see that sort of issue sort of differently and come
down on the other side of that argument.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? Follow up very quickly.
Has there been any feedback or kickback or whatever about you taking my
taxpayer money and giving it to people who may or may not like- the come
back to-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I haven't had any feedback yet, but we just finished our session, so
it's- I'm sure that I will. It's an interesting question, but the answer
being the government is always going to do certain things with your
money you probably don't like. And it's impossible for a legislature or
a delegate to appropriate every penny that you pay in taxes to programs
and issues that you agree with, but the overall goal being the fairest
judiciary possible, I think you can disassociate the personalities from
that goal and say that why you're really buying or what you're really
paying for is a judiciary that the people can trust. And I think that
that sort of transcends the personalities that might be engaged in it.
And the safeguards there are in our system you have to raise, I think,
$35,000 from $100 donations. So there is at least the one safeguard that
that's a lot of people who have to give you a hundred bucks. Which means
that you're at least mildly popular in maybe one county or something, so
at least you're not a complete lunatic, and that will save the state
from having to spend money on people who probably have any business
being in the race. Which I think is another inherent problem that I
think is solved by that.
Let me add also that it is a very little bit of money, and our state,
pretty conservative place both Democrat and Republican, even though it's
registration wise still 2 to 1 Democrat. There would be no support for
any other form of public financing. Do you think that's true, JB?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, of any other type of election. This does stand as unique, but I've
heard no criticism of that, and the bill passed with good support from
both Democrats, about half the Republicans voted for it also and in the
Senate, I think most of them did. In any event, and so it had heavy
support and I never saw any criticism of that or raising of that issue
of the expense and I was kind of surprised that I didn't see it. But we
didn't.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Thank you Mr. ??. I have a couple of inquiries of
that alright. Just one distinction, here in North Carolina a big of junk
of the money that goes to pay for the races is not tax paid dollars,
they do pay taxes, but it is an assessment on your annual bar license.
So, it is really the attorneys who are paying for it, and so we have
some attorneys who were not happy about it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: You could ?? over that 50 ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Right, so the idea here was that the attorneys were
paying for a fairer system as opposed to being, because most of the
shake down for the campaign contributions goes to the attorneys, and so
the idea was that they would fund it. So, I just think it is important
for the record that we are not imposing this on our tax payers as much
that it's really just a small group of tax payers who use this system.
It's almost like a user fee, well let's think about it that way.
I had a question for you about the background as to why you had this
commission set up with Justice ?? in 2009. I understand that West
Virginia had a pretty controversial case that might ?? a Supreme Court
where the U.S. Supreme Court said that there had been undue influence,
and if you could give us a little background on that because when we
pass the Judicial Public Finance it was to avoid that kind of situation,
and then the threat of having that kind of situation is something that
some people worry about if we get rid of Judicial Public Financing. So,
if you could give us the back story as to why this became such an
important in West Virginia. I think that would be helpful to the
members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Yes, the election of the justice and he was a
Republican that  got elected with special interest money he would say,
and he is a friend of mine, and he is a good Judge, and in fact he is an
excellent Justice. An independent expenditure occurred from this ?? of
several millions of dollars from a special interest fund that he set up,
and of course that can't have any, the candidate can't directly be
involved in that and in this case it wasn't. The main reason this
co-guide did that was he totally, he tested of the guy that was running
against this ??. And even there again are the perception that this
Justice was bought and paid for went to the United States Supreme court
because one of the decisions which this Justice did not accuse himself
from was a case that involved of this ?? company that this ?? was a ??.
So, that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and as you know and
ended up with the court saying that that does give the appearance of ??.
We are not saying there was anything wrong, that that Justice did
anything wrong, ?? and even to draw the expenditure made on his behalf,
but the appearance was so abhorrent that he should have stepped down
from that case, but that decision by the U.S. Supreme Court came before
commission was formed. It came after the election and frankly this is a
very, I think, an interesting point.
For many years the business community was outspent by the ?? lawyers in
getting they have people elected courts. This particular election was
the first time where the business community had prevailed. So, that's
probably what brought both sides, frankly to the table of ??. We need to
do some about this whether I can outspend your side, and in meantime
everybody is losing because both sides are being perceived by the public
as just trying to buy influence. So, that ends your question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Please continue ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]: This is a followup debate. We have public financing
and almost all of our Justices use both Republic and Democrat, and so I
guess part of the concern is if we got rate of the public financing and
then the ?? bar was able to do tons more and we do have independent
expenditures. That still happened, you can't avoid it, there is no
rescue funds anymore because the Supreme Court said you can't require
that, but still even in that situation most of our Judges and Justices
like to use public financing and so the concern is if we don't do that
anymore and there is even more of a ramp up for the ?? bar and for the
business community.</p>
