Good afternoon everyone welcome to join appropriations. Like to welcome
my pages if you would raise your hands Marks Coocks, John Ellen, Will
Sabo, Emilio Wellman thank you for being here today. I don't have a list
of our Sargent of arms if you would raise your hand just give us a way
we will appreciate it, thank you for been here. We are gonna go right
into our agendas this afternoon and I would welcome senator brown to the
podium to discuss education lottery.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you ma'am chairman. I think this is a follow up
on where our last meeting kind of concluded as you know lottery is an
important piece in trying to put this budget together and I thought I
would talk about the positions again were out in may be the house at
then hope we get some back and forth on this issue. Right now the Senate
position is pretty much what we were at today which is a 1% amount used
for advertising and that new amount according to Barry Boardman will
create about a hundred sixty million dollars that the Senate plans to
use store the teacher pay in its proposal that 1% also does not have any
restrictions on the advertising it pretty much leaves things as they ate
today. The house proposal as my understanding is to raise the amount
that can be used for advertising to 2% but includes several restrictions
that in our opinion creates a lot of uncertainty on those dollar amounts
that can be used moving forward. To us it's almost I guess it puts is in
a position of where you saying let's put restriction on the lottery but
at the same time let's increase advertising about 2%. So it's almost
counterproductive in our opinion to take that approach so again our
position in the lottery is to maintain the 1% on advertising. You have
seen the new numbers that it creates which is another one hundreds sixty
million and the Senate plan it to use to for teacher pay. I would like
to get some thoughts from the house on the thought process on the
lottery numbers and maybe we can get some back and forth as far as
lottery dollars go.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you sensor Brown. Comments and questions from the
committee? Representative Dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you ma'am chair. Yeah I have a short and of it is
that we did an exploration to find additional revenue. In that
exploration we discovered there were some methodologies offered by the
lottery to increase the amount of money coming from a lottery to
education. Our congress obviously feels very strongly about the honest
lottery act and a number of those provisions which we have indicated may
be have some ability to negotiate those fair provisions but you know the
idea was generate revenue for education from a known and very reliable
source that we obviously are using to the tone of a, I guess now we up
to 500 and 84 million. The exploration up to this point in terms of
senator Brown what you got there, hundred and sixteen. I think the
exploration of the house conducted has born few because obviously we
have more money now that we are looking at this stage of for education
and then we did when we begin that process obviously we were really
different at the moment it's matter of since Dr. Boardman went back and
further refine those numbers as we have moved along. The difference is
really 29.5 million dollars. It may could be more could be less as we
have discussed on the continue to pinning on</p>

Scenarios that Dr. Boardman put forward and that are out there. So, I
mean we understand the senate’s position and I think you all understand
our position.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think the follow up for us is that 2% you are talking about generating
about 29 more million dollars to get a 2% on advertising. So, basically
doubling the advertising amount but because of the restrictions you are
only generating 29 million to try to workout some differences, we have
consider some options about possibly raising the percent of advertising
without the restrictions to accomplish the same time and it would take
very little difference, I want to give you an example, if you go to one
and a quarter percent advertising you generate about 20 million dollars.
So, you can raise that amount just a small amount whatever the
restrictions and accomplish the same thing that’s just a thought that we
have kind of consider out there to the house to see it’s something you
may consider.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senate Brown. Senator Hunt…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chairman, I was just thinking we have passed the lottery
bill in 2005, I don’t believe there is a person in this chamber within
the house of the senate they voted for it. And here we are telling
increase in the advertising, is that some that really wanna be doing? We
have got a stable situation at 1% I just can’t see increase in that,
increase in the advertising allowance, secondly and then we really wanna
cover up our airways with lottery advertising, buy your lottery ticket,
hit it rich, I mean do we want that kind of atmosphere in North
Carolina? I don’t think so.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator Hunt, further questions or comments from committee?
Senator Jackson…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chairman, Representative Dollar would you ___[02:25] for
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chairman and thank you Representative Dollar, could you
explain to me a little bit of that process? And why I would decide to do
what you did with the lottery numbers? Just a little more in depth,
Senator ___[02:43] I’m trying to figure out why we would be doing this
with this particular fund?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollar?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, thank you Senator Jackson. I think it’s really straightforward I
mean the Senator ___[03:01] is correct that those of us who are here at
the time about 10 years ago or so now 10 years ago most of us voted
against, not everybody but most of us voted against the lottery at that
time but it get passed and it survived a court challenge which some
people were engaged in and I have not seen and I may have missed, they
may have been bill filed in the senate or the house that I have missed
but I can’t recall since 2011 a bill being filed to repeal the lottery.
So, obviously we are sequent enough with we are kind of where we are,
where we are and I think everybody takes that reality is real. So, on
the house side we are looking for revenues given that we came into the
session with far or less revenues than we are anticipating from last
year and we were looking at, “Okay, what are the options out there?” So,
we clearly had ask the lottery, “What will be your options to generate
additional dollars for education?” Because I think that’s a lot of
people have been talking about is additional dollars for education and
they brought forward their options and off course those options have
been since scrub through our caucus as I mentioned before fairly
strongly that if there was additional advertising, if they wanna to make
sure that advertising and I think it gets it…

<p id="10:00">
Rep. Dollar: Under the concerns Senator Hunt had expressed, that you
would have the Honest Lottery Act go with that in order to make sure
that the advertising wa at least mathematically truthful. So that was
thinking, both to generate additional dollars for education as well
address the concerns expressed by Senator Hunt and others. I think as I
said before, you know,  in any event, however this particular issue goes
in the final budget agreement, one good thing that has come out of it is
that cleaerly we have been able to find some other non-recurring money
over there, and we were better able to find the baseline lottery number
so that obviously we have more availability to us in the education area
than when we originally started.
Speaker 2: Thank you Representative Dollar. Did you have a folow-up
Senator?
Senator Jackson: I do have a follow up. If Representative Dollar will
humor me once more for a follow up. (YIELD)  Thank you. I;m still trying
to get my brain wrapped around this thing because I was not here in 2005
when it was passed. If I had a been I would have voted against it. And
if some of my fellow members had been here as well we probably wouldnt
have a law written today as close as that vote was from what I
understand. So, in light of that, if we were to take the house budget as
you presented the lottery, in your mind would that mean that we would
actually be voting for a lottery? To increase it, in a sort of
round-about way we would be voting for a lottery?
Speaker 2: Rep. Dollar?
Rep. Dollar:  Well I wouldnt' think so, I mean everyone has to formulate
thoughts in their own mind. I mean obviously we're already accepting and
the senate is already accepting additional money from the lottery where
we stand today. From where we stood, 'cause my understanding is that in
the offer here is 116 million from the lottery over and above the
original money that was coming in from the original baseline enacted.
But, again Senator Jackson, It's not a huge amount of money that your
talking about when your talking about, you know, 584 million dollars
thats coming in from the lottery. We're talking about  29.5 million so
it's not a huge amount of money. And for those who are concerned about
the lottery, obviously, the Honest Lottery Act i would think would be of
interest to potentially to some members who had misgivings at the
beginning.
Speaker 2: Thank you Senator Dollar. Senator Brown?
Brown: Representative Dollar,  in the lottery number 64 million of that
are non-recurring numbers. And with the additional restrictions on
advertising - first of all with non-recurring dollars you've got some
uncertainty built into those numbers already. Then we add the
uncertainty on top of that with the advertising restrictions as well.
That's a major concern for us. How do you feel about those concerns? I
just, again, you've already taken one concern and added another one to
it.
Speaker 2: Sorry, are you posing a question for Senator Dollar?
Dollar: Well I can go by Dr. Boardman's analysis. Who analyzed it as
moving from 1% to 2% in the advertising and the effect   of the Honest
Lottery Act which when the physical note was originally done in March of
2013 there was no physical impact determined on revenues. Dr. Boardman,
in going through and giving  an ubiased look at it said you wouldn't
take in as much on the new money with apparently no impact on the
regular revenues and (clip ends)</p>

[0:00:00.0]
So, you are talking about small moves there and the big picture of it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Did you have any follow up Senator Brown?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would just say we are 29 and off on this issue, it’s a, ___[00:18]
things maybe some, maybe I think it’s not a lot of money but I think it
is important if we get this number settled because to move forward I
think every dollars gonna be important. I think I have mentioned
something that we would consider looking at is a house willing to at
least move on a different proposal or a plan to try to meet in the
middle of this at least try to settle this issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Recognized Hallway.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair. I have a little frustration here as we talk about
the lottery and we are concerned about more advertising but state…We are
in the game of business or we are not? If we don’t wanna be in the game
business let’s just get out altogether we can later head on ___[01:05]
or not, we won’t have to worry a bit about taking money from poor people
or whatever, 29 million dollars I just don’t see that’s a big deal, if
we are gonna this slow moving on this thing the lottery ___[01:20] the
Christmas folks, who wants to get this thing moving and get it rolling
and as I was mentioned the other day our proposal now, we are not
dependent on any of this lottery money to fund teacher salaries, we did
our house budget, we are now order to place or we are not, again for
word about advertisement let’s just do way with all up, there is no, we
are only getting a couple of hundred million dollars from the lottery
but forgive 400 million suddenly we have become centers I mean it’s, I
voted against it, I was against it in very beginning but I think that we
need to just quite to move a little quicker than what we are doing and
this is one time stuff we are going to be here forever.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown did you have a comment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will just say I gave an option of where we might move I would hope you
to consider that move. I think maybe we can move on the salaries and…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have two more questions Senator Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair. This maybe actually for staff and I don’t know
___[02:23] but and whoever I respond to be the best, when we look at 1%
with no restrictions, we have an expected value here 116 million and
what I’m looking for is somebody can give me whether it’s a conference
___[02:40] or just a sense of variants, it’s expected in that number and
what happens to that variants when you increase the advertising dollars
to 2% which we have looked at and separately when you add the
restrictions what happens to that variants again, we have talked about
how these ads confusion to it there is a way to get an actual
calculation of how much that it’s coming through and I wanna see staff
maybe able to respond.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator ___[03:12], Mr. Boardman is here and can respond to
that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Very important at fiscal research first with respect to conference
Senator Bill I will say that unfortunately, and the business producing a
point that’s we don’t get to budget on an ___[03:30] so that’s what we
are focused on. I will say with respect to the lottery it is volatiles
driven by the lot of different drivers, it can’t only being number one.
So, we try to take a very cautious or conservative approach when we put
that number out there and I think that same approach was taken this time
as in the past if you look back over the last several years, you will
see that generally that the lottery numbers are under protected and
that’s harm of that caution. So, if I had to say is there are a marginal
pair of plus or minus we try to work in basic conference senate bills
plus or minus 5% confidence but that doesn’t mean our point estimate is
right in the middle, we will tend towards the more cautious number, we
make that estimate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Boardman, follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could you give me at least a sense of what happens to those variants
when you add one variable and increasing advertisement and then an
additional variable for including for what are these advertising
restrictions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Boardman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you again those two items are treated as relatively independent of
that so we analysis that I provided for your static, we take the base
and look at, okay let’s increase the advertising, what type of impact
kind of return per dollar of advertising?

<p id="20:00">
[0:00:00.0]
…One expect that gives us one set of scenario but the base the
fundamental point, estimate base hasn’t changed and then we look at the
marginal changes and advertising what type of changes on that base would
occur? So, those are two separate events that we are measuring if you
would choose both policies would be the some of those two events.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Boardman, one more question on lottery, Senator Hind.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank Senator Harridan, I just want to comment on advertising recurring
is spending 1% of revenues, lot of revenues on advertising, that’s about
17.5 million dollars, if we double that we are gonna be 35 million
dollars annually. Can you imagine that Coney Allan___[00:48] atmosphere
that we are gonna have buy a lottery tickets right now and get rich
quick, I just can’t see it in North Carolina plus it’s tremendous
diminishing returns on advertising dollars that first 1% we are
generating an excess of 500 million dollars, the next 1% generates a
little over 30 million dollars, just worth it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further comments, Representative Dollar closing comment on…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, just one other observation and certainly leave it at this,
when the lottery started out I believe we were about 34% is coming into
education and that has dropped. So, I think it stand about 26% of the
actual gross revenues are into education. So, I think I mean obviously
that’s not a short session issue but I do think it’s one of the things
that should concerned everyone, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown do you have the closing lottery comment or do you like to
move on the salaries and benefits?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just think it’s important, we settle this difference so we can move on
because again it’s just we are talking about 30 million dollars and we
have got to come together at sometime.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Chair recognized that Senator Brown discuss salaries and
benefits.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We got our hand out I would like to get out if we could.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Now, we are waiting for the pass that these documents, all documents
from this meeting will be available on the senate appropriations website
at the close of meeting today or at the end of the day today, okay, as
passed out.
[Pause]
Senator Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chairman. I thought I would just hand out the sheet to
kind of give you a comparison on teacher pay and before I get into that
for the past three years our budget has really concentrated on medicate
getting that strike and we felt like this year for the first time we
could concentrate on teacher pay and we felt that was important because
as you guys and everybody here knows we have spent about two billion
dollars on medicate and we just felt like it was we have already some
___[04:08] and we felt like teacher pay was a place to put it. And the
first chart gives you an idea of how much money would be spent on
teacher pay in each of the three plans? The government’s plan was about
100 million, our plan was about 468 million and I think the house plan
was 178 million. This is just a different way to look at it, I want
those plans would mean as far as how your pay would increase overtime,
you can see on the senate plan as compared to the other plans, how
quickly teacher pay would get to $50,000 per year level, a much quicker
plan…

<p id="25:00">
Speaker: Also as far as percentages go, the senate plan woudl increase
teachers pay by eleven percent. The house plan by five percent. The
average salary on the senate plan would be $51,198. On the house plan it
was $48,234. But I think the most important number that we're dealing
with here is this next number. The third number. Which would move us on
the national ranking from 47th to 27th as far as teacher pay in the
nation. And you can see where the house plan would move us. It would be
37th. Also in the regional side of things, we are next to last in the
region. This would move us third in the region. On the house plan it
would leave us 7th out of the 10 states that are within the region. And
finally this is a snapshot of the teacher pay where our current salary
is, what the median regional pay is, what the average regional pay. What
our plan would put us, then you can see the US median/average salary as
well. This is a little history, and I think this is important because it
shows where North Carolina was at, what happened over some time and
where this would put us, I guess, back. And as you can see in the
'06-'07 year, North Carolina ranked 24th in the nation in teacher pay.
And you can see how quickly that dropped. And in the region we were
second for many years, and then we dropped from 2nd to 7th, then to
10th, then on the national level we went all the way down to 46th. Our
plan would get us back to 27th which would be close to the top as we've
ever been, I guess, nationally. And also 3rd in the region. We think
these are important numbers and you know there is a lot of debate, I
guess, on different types of pay, incentive pay as well, and I think we
can continue to debate those. And I think we should maybe find ways to
reward our best teachers. But I also think that we've got to get in the
game as far as teacher pay goes nationally, and I thought the senate
plan would do just that. Again this also addresses the piece that I
think most of us agreed on which was a starting pay fix. This would move
starting pay pece. This would move starting pay for teachers to 33,000 a
year. That's close to a little over a $2,000
pay increase for beginning teachers. Another importan piece of our plan
is that it also eliminates the old schedule that had about 37 steps in
it. This plan reduces that down to about 18 steps and the maximum  would
be about $5,000 a month or $50,000 a year for the plan. One thing too
that we're willing to put on the table is we would be willing to offer
this plan and not relinquish career status to be paid on this schedule.
i think that is a move the senate is willing to make. WE also deal with
the master's teacher pay, and I think this was agreed, I think in
February when the Governor and the Speaker and the Pro-tem got together
and proposed the beginning pay at $33,000.  One of the other issues that
was talked about at that time was the master's pay piece. And our piece
will allow any teacher that has taken one course by August 1st of 2013
to remain eligible for the advanced degree supplements moving forward.
And I think that was a provision, again, that was agreed upon by all
three parties at that meeting in February. Our proposal includes that.
As far as other pay goes, I'll go through that briefly. In education,
the non-certified personnel our plan offers a $618 salary that includes
benefits. That's a 2.2% salary increase. Other -  (Clip Ends)</p>

<p id="30:00">
Employees under education provides a thousand dollar salary increase.
That's including salaries as well. We also have the thousand dollar
increase for most other state employees and on average this is about a
1.8 percent salary increase for other state employees as well. I know
for magistrates and assistant deputy clerks we also allowed them to take
the step instead of the increase. That's in our budget. As far as ??
goes our budget proposed a .8 percent increase. Those I guess were the
highlights of what our plan will do. It's similar to what you've seen. I
think the key piece of that is the tenure piece that we're not tying to
this piece schedule. And I hope that you see the importance of taking
care of teachers in this particular package as you look at the history.
One time, I think as a state we could be proud of being in the middle of
the pack, and then we were at the bottom of the pack, this puts us right
back in the middle of the pack again. So madam chairman, with that I
know that the House would like to respond to that so I'll open the
floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Brown. Also I'll just note that we do have staff
available for any questions that might need to be referred to staff.
Representative Holloway?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. Thank you madam chair. Senator Brown, I'm glad to hear that you are
willing to consider relinquishing the tenure piece of your budget. And
certainly, when you look at this piece, scale or this graph that you've
got here, the Senate looks mighty good. And you certainly look like you
support teachers, and the House, we equally, we want to give our
teachers and state employees pay raises but the piece that's left out of
this puzzle is how you got to this number. And in your budget you
essentially lay off every single teacher assistant in the state to get
to the number that you're at and we protect all the teacher assistants.
And when we have our budgets and we hear from our constituents, we
haven't heard not one negative comment from our plan which gives a
little over five percent, protects the TAs, we've got things like Read
to Achieve going on and we want kids to learn to read by third grade. We
know that doesn't happen just in third grade. It starts at home. It
starts in kindergarten, first grade, and second grade. We'd be taking
all the TAs away from those teachers and taking a valuable resource from
them. So if I could, I'd like to, and I'd like to have a follow up too,
Senator, but.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam chair, I'd like to clarify something if I could.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This does not take all the teacher assistants away. This leaves the
teacher assistants in kindergarten and first grade. It does take the
teacher assistants in second and third grade, and with that there is
also flexibility for the schools to be able to move the TAs around as
needed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. Did you have a follow up, Representative Holloway?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do, but Senator Brown, also that money for the TAs, counties have
flexibility and even taking a cut for second and third grade, counties
use a lot of that money to fund teachers. We've got Wake County CFO
here, David Neder, he's here with us. I'd love for him to come forward
and just talk about what a proposal that you guys are proposing, what
that would look like for the school systems in Wake County or other
counties, and talk about what those cuts would mean to them. Could we
have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Holloway, at this time we're only accepting comments and
questions from committee members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Well very good. But that's something at some point though. I mean
we need to talk to these folks and even if you're just gonna cut it in
second and third grade assistants, that's still gonna have a tremendous
impact on our children. It's gonna lower the number of teachers in the
state, and I think that we've got such a strong, positive reception from
our House plan. I mean, I'm glad that you all want to give more, but
it's just where you're getting the money to do it. That's what we have
an issue with.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown. All right, Senator Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I thank my good friend Holloway and I respect him greatly, we work
together on education. There's a couple of things that we do need to
clear up. Many systems hire locally paid teachers. They also have the
flexibility of taking a teacher and converting that dollar amount and
buy nearly two full time teacher assistants. Some of them have done
that. With creative scheduling, you'll see more of that taking place.</p>

So, the net will not be the 7,400 Teacher Assistance that we are talking
about, it will be considered to be less in that but we have not
increased class load for teachers and we have not reduced any teachers.
So, when you say we are loosing teachers in our budget that is not
correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for your comment Senator Tillman, further comments or
questions from the committee? Senator Brown…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hacker I’m sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a question Senator Brown, like Representative Hallway the TA issue
is to me bothers me a lot, what percentage are you looking at if you are
include the TAs what percentage raise you are looking if you put the TAs
back?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager, one year of TA is about 116 million dollars, I
would have to back into those numbers to figure that out. So, I hate to
tell you the wrong numbers but…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman if you would hold for just moment. Representative
___[01:16].
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chairman. The model that we are trying to preserve just
put in place by Governor Hunt a number of years ago by adding Teacher
Assistance in there and just take out one aspect of it as far as
Representative Hallway brought it forward was about the ability of
reading and that model gives us results where at least half of our kids
aren’t reading proficiently and to say that the Teacher Assistant is
something that is really missing in the, would be missing in the scheme
of things, they have been in place for all that period of time and if
you look at results you see that the reading proficiency is diminished
significantly well below what we accept is an acceptable standards and I
believe what the senate is trying to do is find another model and that
is upgrade the quality of the teacher we fully recognize at the quality
of education comes from having the best and brightest teacher and by
having the pay scale increase 11% that is designed one to attract with
especially the $35,000 salary increase but also to retain the best and
really do, really read by the time the rate a graduate. So, if you look
at the big picture Teacher Assistance really had function as well as
people keep writing about.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator ___[02:36], Representative Hallway.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, thank you. Senator ___[02:40] I do wanna respond just to that I
would also point out that we have been cutting funds away for teacher
assistance for years, superintendents foolishly have spent the money
sometimes on other things and maybe things that they need but almost in
this entire state they are very few of any Teacher Assistance in third
grade which is a vital grade, they are already in faced our second
grades so one could argue that maybe there is not enough there to help
with the ___[03:07] but Senator Tillman they know I love you, I will
tell you all time you are my favorite Senator but now I have talked to
my superintendents and I have talked to them and they have taken money
that we have given them last year in the budget for TAs and they take
that money and they convert some of those dollars and the teachers and
if we cut some of the TA money then there is gonna be less dollars if
they have going to their system. Now, I don’t understand how that’s
gonna end up without producing fewer teachers but I just really think
that the TAs are important, I think having the extra hand is an asset to
the teacher, these classes even though we have an increased some but an
extra person there to break a child out in the small group, they help
them with their reading or whatever, I just see that as being an
important and again we don’t wanna put anybody out of work, we wanna
keep these folks to have a job with a job the number that we could
actually move on and I’m not saying this is a house position but it is
dollars that would not impact jobs, this is about not 10 million dollars
that’s the averages, that’s what the enrollment growth is calling for
new TAs and we could actually bypass not 10 million and not layoff
anyone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But we wanna keep the folks with the job and we also wanna keep folks
and teachers with the good pay and like I said, we have got nothing but
positive comments from all educational groups on our budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank your for your comments. Senator Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hallway, I appreciate your comments but I think you
touched on one of the real problems with Teacher Assistance. I think
even yourself have now admitted that the money been spent on Teacher
Assistance and been used for Teacher Assistance. And again, that’s part
of the problem we have…

<p id="40:00">
There are lots of studies out there that look at teacher assistance and
what kind of impact out has on student results and most of them, if not
all of them will tell that it has very little to do with student result
and again I think we can say problems will teacher assistance if the
money is not being useful to start with and then if you look study after
study and teacher assistance have no positive results in the end that's
the pace to teacher assistance. Again this is one of the issues this is
on the ?? I am sure to make negotiation on just like all this pace and
like lottery is but again I think what we want to show today on the
Senate side which is the numbers who we are today what we like to be and
what will out take us to get there and to get there you have to make
some hard choices I understand that and I think we all do and probably
the hardest thing about being in the house or the Senate is some time
you have to make hard choices and they are not easy to do and you are
going to get criticized no matter what you do in most cases but again
what you put your priority I guess is the question we will ask do you
want to be someone ?? 27th and 3rd in the region or you want to still be
37th in the nation near the bottom in the region I guess that's one of
the questions we can ask in debate. But again to do that you have to
make hard decisions and I know they are difficult and I understand that
but again we will try to negotiate this out I think this today will try
to lay out why the Senate propose the budget it proposed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you senator. I think we passed out our senator
offer in, if Senator Brown if you will just walk us through that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I can walk you through it not a lot has changed I think
the biggest pieces that have changed is on the reemergence we have
agreed on that number now between the house and the Senate which was
what line four then if you go again to the lottery piece where the
hundred sixty million that's line 32 where the hundred sixty million the
house is still on hundred sixty five million that's a key piece. On the
next page we agreed on the last week on Medicaid short file and the
Medicaid rebase reserves line 40 and 41 so those are in place now. And
then if you start looking pretty much at the pay starting with line 62
and for the next line as you can see the difference in what the pay
would cost and what the call will cost as you compare the house and
Senate budgets and then I guess you can look at the bottom line the
inappropriate pieces will move in forward. Again this is a Senate offer
we understand this is a, there's gonna be take and move forward we are
willing to do to sit down and want the house to do that. I just felt
like it was important because teacher pay has been I guess the top issue
of session pretty much and what we gonna do with teacher pay and I guess
the Medicaid piece and I just thought it was important we look at
numbers and understand why the Senate came up with numbers we came up
with. Again once how we are 24th in nation in teacher pay. Even with our
plan we only get to 27th and one time for many many years we ate second
in the region what our plan we just get third in the region. So we still
don't even to get buy to we were one time but I think this is a big step
to try to get us closer what we were one time. We would love to see some
offers or count offers from the house and will continue to negotiate
this and give faith I think we’re can find some common ground but I
think it's important to lay out why proposals are put out there and I
hope we have done that today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you senator Brown. Representative Dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you ma'am chair. I can give classification on
your offer here on line</p>

I'm sorry, line 44. The line 44 in your offer where you have $228
million in reductions in Health and Human Services and as we've
discussed and as has been known now for several weeks, $59 million of
that is not achievable because it was an assessment that was not
allowable under the Federal guidelines, these days. I think there was
another $14 million on the reduction that was, as I understand from
staff, that's not achievable, $73 million. If you can explain why that
has not been adjusted or how you make up that $73 million or why it
still be there as a reduction that's not an achievable reduction.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollar you're posing that as a question then? To Senator
Brown?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To Senator Brown, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollar, you and I have talked about this last night. We
will find those dollars. It has not been adjusted yet, but I told you we
would find those dollars somewhere in this budget to get that balanced.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator Brown. I appreciate everyone coming to the meeting.
Tomorrow will be our next meeting at 10 AM. No further comments or
questions, we're adjourned, thank you.</p>
