We’ve got a large room of people here today, so anyone in the back, if
you have a conversation, please taker it outside. Appreciate that. We
want to welcome the Pages who are with us today from Tarheel Challenge.
Kale on the Senate Pages – Kale Sterling, sponsored by… and all of these
are sponsored by Senator Jackson. Kale Sterling, Erin Scotland, Brian
Hicks, Levarus  Acock and Percy Clark, appreciate you being with us
today. On the House side, also from Tarheel Challenge, Ollie Anastasia –
I probably pronounced that wrong; I apologize – Wesley Anderson, Gabriel
Don, Peter Glenn and Brian Lee. Thank you for being with us. Our
Sergeants at Arms who are with us today are Bob Rossi, Joe Crook, Young
Bay, B.H. Powell and Doug Harris from the House, and from the Senate,
Mark Verbeen – I think I have that; I’m not sure I have the spelling
right here – Anderson Meadows, Cantin Lewis, Ed Kester, Charles Marsalis
and Ernie Sheryl. So they will be helping with the crowd this morning.
We’re very pleased to have with us Mister Art Pope, who is the Budget
Director – I think technically Deputy Budget Director – for the state of
North Carolina, and his team, to present to the Joint Senate House
Appropriations Committee the Governor’s recommended budget for 2014 –
2015, and without further comment, I would recognize Mister Pope to come
to the well of the Committee and to present the Governor’s budget
recommendations. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Mister Chairman, members
of the Committee, members of the general public, thank you for allowing
me this opportunity to present to you Governor Pat McCrory’s recommended
budget adjustments for his second year to be biennium, fiscal years 14 –
15. In the interest of time, I’m going to just cut right to the chase.
One of the main questions that has been asked, and legitimately so, is
that we are projected to have a 445 million dollar reduction in this
year’s revenue, and reduction in this year’s revenue not only obviously
effects this year, but effects next year’s biennium budget, the second
year of the biennium, because it effects the beginning balance and the
overall availability, so how are we going to address that shortfall and
address the Governor’s priorities, and I hope the General Assembly’s
priorities, including a 262 million dollar pay increase for teachers and
state employees? I apologize for the small print. We should also all
have hard copies, and most of these tables are also in the Governor’s
Recommended Budget, the green volume. Well to get right to this part of
it, you’ll see that this un-appropriated balance remaining from the
previous year this year is 323.7 million dollars. Now that’s going to
get reduced by the 445 million dollar shortfall, the negative number.
Last year we had over-collections, this year we have under-collections.
It will also be reduced by the anticipated reversion of 290 million
dollars in the operation of this year’s budget. So the simple math, 323
plus 290 minus 445, still leaves us with 168.3 million dollars. So the
very responsible, sound budget enacted by the General Assembly last year
and signed into law by the Governor didn’t spend all the money we had.
We left 323 million dollars on the bottom line unspent. By the way,
that’s in addition to 230 million deposited into the Savings Reserve
Account, known as the Rainy Day Fund, to over 500 million dollars was
unspent, 323 million dollars available for any shortfall or changes, and
then we have the reversions. On the 290 million dollars reversion, we
feel very good. That’s a solid number that is based on a survey of the
agencies. The detailed information is provided to the Fiscal Research
Commission that has very comparable…</p>

<p id="05:00">
to the 297 million dollars reversions that we have to last year's
budget, and if anything, we expect that number to go up, possibly over
300 plus million, and we're still getting information from the agencies
and you will get revised information as you work towards the enactment
of the budget. So at the start of that 368 million dollar credit
balance, you'll see a big overview of how the money is spent. We deposit
the statutory amount of the beginning credit balance, 25% into the
savings reserve account and 25% of the repair and renovation account.
That leaves a balance of 84 million. As you will see later, our
government quarry strongly believes that a strong repair and renovation
fund will repair the infrastructure of the state as well as we continue
to build up the rainy day fund, so we're going to add 8 million dollars
to each of those accounts under appropriations to bring those totals up
to 50 million dollars each. The four corning statutes should only be 42
million dollars each. That leaves a subtotal credit balance of 84
million dollars. The revenue consensus forecast - this is a new
consensus forecast, I'm not going to take the time to go into detail but
it was prepared May 2nd release - it's already been discussed, it's
available from staff and on the general assembly's website. So this is
191 million dollars less than originally forecast of '14-'15. Now I'll
go into more detail on that in a second. That leaves 20 billion, 962
million dollars in the consensus forecast. In addition to revenue on
changes, there are no major changes in the law being proposed to this
recommended budget - statutory law. However the state of North Carolina
reached a settlement with a major retailer who collects - does their
transactions by the internet - for the collection of sales and use tax
from out of state. This is based on the annualized list of collections
start in February. The 40 million is based on the annualized collections
resulting from that settlement plus the settlement - the additional
enforcement and compliance by other out of state retailers. So we feel
that 40 million dollars is a good number and 4 million dollars to adjust
for how much FICA tax was withheld by the state gives them an additional
44 million dollars, for total availability of 21 billion dollars.
Recommended appropriations are 20 billion 990 million - that still
leaves us unappropriated 100 million dollars. And I will go through the
other changes in the risk reserves and other areas of change that brings
up how this budget is also going to be very fiscally responsible,
conservative.  Now then. There are two comparisons to be made by this
year's recommended budget. The first - and I think the most important
comparison - is the previous year's budget. And that's what I want to go
over now. However this is an adjustment to what's already enacted in law
- what this general assembly and the governor enacted in law last  year
for fiscal year '14-'15 to also city comparisons from the original
enacted budget for '14-'15 and these revised adjustments. Now last year
in '13-'14 is the left hand column and the second column is the
recommended budget for '14-'15. And you'll see we start off with
unappropriated balance again but reduced by the 445 million dollars.
Now pay close attention to that anticipated under over collections. Last
year we had 537 million in over collections - more than originally
projected. Part of that is - we knew at the time, said at the time - was
due to an acceleration of income from 2013 into 2012 with federal tax
law changes as individuals, companies, businesses took dividend
payments, bonus payments, real life capital gain. They shifted income
into 2012 which meant we had very strong collections in April of '13 -
in fiscal year '12-'13 - 'cause they realized all that income in '12.
But that meant the income wasn't available for this year. And that is
one of the reasons - not the only reason - but one of the reasons our
projections were lower. When you combine those two years together,
fiscal year '12-'13 plus 537 million of over collections, fiscal year
'14-'15 minus 445 million, we're actually 92 million dollars plus for
the projections for those two fiscal years. That does show that the
overall trend is still an increase in the economies even though because
of the timing issues and other issues that we are reducing incomes this
year. That's a big shift from the beginning last year's budget with a
big surplus over collections versus a minus. Second you see the
anticipated reversions, again last year it was 290 million 742, this
year we're at 290 million. And I'll emphasize again, that is not a plug
in number based on last year's reversion, based on an actual survey of
the departments where they are now and we expect that number to go up.
The good news, which we'll go into more details, last year we did have a
negative number to reduce availability because of the appropriations,
supplemental appropriations that was needed for the Medicaid over</p>

…Last year that is zero this year, I will elaborate on that in later
slide there is a metaphase over this year as well. This is gonna
addressed by current year revenues are not include in the reversion so I
will go to that later. When you look at the again same information
transfer ___[00:22]?? account, go down the baseline revenue consensus
forecast. Last year the revenue was 20 billion 603 million, this year
it’s 20 billion 962 million that’s a plus 359 million dollars and it’s
absolutely correct and clarify and the revise projection there is a 191
million dollar decrease what’s projected for 2014-15 last year we see on
that next page but even after you take out the 191 million dollar
reduction we still have 359 million dollars more in revenue this year
than last year based on existing law let’s say 1.7% increase and then
you will see the same information that come down to total recommended
appropriation and you will see this year’s budget compared to
recommended budget of the last year is 359 million dollars more or 1.7%
increase and spending over last year. We do have reduction that left
un-appropriated with 100 million dollars. So, again to summarize this
year’s recommended budget compared to last years we do have an increase
in revenue, we do have an increase in appropriation let’s say 1.7%
growth after taking the account lower beginning credit balance due to
that shortfall. Now, here is the comparison to what was an active last
year for 2014-15 versus what is recommended, the beginning credit, some
of this repeated obviously beginning credit balance, the shortfall, the
reversions, 168 million dollars plus, you will see for transfer to same
as reserve account last year’s budget appropriated 37 million dollars to
the Rainy Day Funds same as reserve account. The government’s budget
increases at 42 million statutory amount and that’s ___[02:10]?? myself
and that’s actually going up to the 50 million after appropriations,
___[02:12] motivations is 12.7 million, ___?? last year, the Governor
recommend 42 million plus 8 million appropriations up to 50 million. So,
we are appropriating more money to the same reserve account ___[02:26]??
in this adjusted budget and it was acted last year, then we go down to
base revenue forecast and originally for fiscal year 2014-15 last year
the projection was 21 billion 153 million dollars in revenue that’s been
revised to 20 billion 962 so there you see the 191 million decrease. So,
flipping back &amp; forth compared to last year we got 359 million
dollars more revenue and 191 million dollars originally projected for
this year. Now, going down to the total recommended appropriations you
will see last years inactive budget is 20 billion 998 million and this
year is 20 billion 990 million so only an 8.5 million dollar decrease
overall and what was recommended inactive last year versus the Governor
adjustment and off course the big emphasis overall because there are
many net changes and the appropriation committees and the various
committees and departments which we will go through. Now, definitely
this is too small for you to read at least from the PowerPoint
presentation but again this document is in your budget book it shows the
lower head details and the adjustments in the committee, we are gonna
over that and detail later. So, I did want to give you the single shot
of that and then the same detailed information, comparison of the
2013-14 this year’s budget to the proposed budget for next year as
adjusted by the Governor and the top half is what we saw before and the
lower half gets to breakout by committee and it shows by the top half
1.7% growth of revenue as compared to last year and about 1.7% growth
and spending compared to next year. Again, it’s too small to read from
the PowerPoint the comparison of the 2014-15 inactive budgets inactive
last year versus the Governor’s recommendation. Now, I wanna go to a
little bit more detail on the revenue forecast, this graph right here
shows the actual revenue in the black line for fiscal year 2006-07. The
fiscal year 2013, and you will know and I have more detailed slide next
page and fiscal year 2011 as well the revenue was the actual revenue was
19.5 billion. In fiscal year 2013 it was 20.5 billion that’s a 1 billion
dollar increase. But again as I showed on the previous slide that’s 500
million dollars in over collections.

Originally projected 20.6 billion for this current fiscal year and came
out at 20.2 billion. Again that's a 445 million dollar decrease. But
that's after that huge collection so the reason we have this slide in
here, I'm going to go to the next one, I think it's a legitimate
complaint at times you see head and shoulders charts, which the next
page is going to be. This shows from zero to 22.6 billion, where we
think we have been, where we think we will be. And it shows a fairly
smooth line after of course that big dip from the great recession of
2009. So this is a head and shoulder chart, which makes it easier to
read the numbers. But look at the steep slope when you just look at the
head and shoulders versus the overall slope based on the entire budget
from zero to 20 billion dollars plus. What this more detailed head and
shoulders graph shows you again, you see the big jump from fiscal year
12 - that sharp, upward slope - to the fiscal year 13 of over 1 billion,
again 500 million dollars increase in collections, the light blue line
shows the original consensus forecast for this biennial. Going from
20.5, a very modest net increase because again, we were trying to
anticipate that fiscal year effect, money ?? accelerate to 12. And then
2.7% after adjusting for the tax law changes for this year to 21.2
billion. In fact, we went down to 20.2 billion but we will still go back
up to 4% growth and partially catch up so we'll be at 21 billion rather
than 21.2 billion for this fiscal year 14, 15. That's 191 million
revision downward. Now, the right two lines are I think the appropriate
term is scenario rather than forecast, because it's premature to do that
forecast - we don't do those forecasts until next year. But we do need
planning and the darker blue line on the top is a relatively modest
conservative realistic estimate that was done for house bill 998, the
tax reform package, to show what the overall impact would be. The light
bottom line, the pink line is an even more conservative estimate
prepared by the office of state budget management for this presentation
but it still shows more modest growth. It still shows growth even though
it's more modest. Now I'm going to go back one more time, you may say
that's a very steep growth curve, but again that's because it's head and
shoulders versus when you see it based on the 20 billion dollar budget.
So we do think these are responsible growths, and this budget's based on
the consensus forecast for this coming year, but do want to give you a
heads-up; a shot at where we're going in the long-term. Now then, on the
general fund revenue by source. In the interest of time, Mr. Chairman,
I’m going to go fairly quickly over these slides, because I know this is
familiar to many of the members already. But there's a little bit of a
change here, but I also want to focus on the sales and use tax of 6.3
billion dollars. There's been some concerns and even some criticism
about the state's reliance on the sales and use tax. Well actually, the
state’s reliance on the sales and use tax peaked in the 2010-2011 budget
 when it was 30.6% of the overall revenue. That’s when the state sales
tax was 5.75%. After that rate sunsetted in the 2012-13 budget for the
full year, that share fell down to 25.7%. This year and projecting for
next year, you will see the effect of tax reform. Part of tax reform is
making rates more uniform and simpler, closing loopholes. So there was
some base broadening for the sales tax. Also we did reduce rates for the
personal income tax. So you see that the percentage of the total sales
tax has gone back up to 30%. That’s actually rounded up from 28.9%. So
we're still below our reliance on the sales tax in this budget being
proposed at 29.9%, compared to the peak in 2010-2011 at 30.6% when the
state rate was 5 and ¾, versus the current state rate of 4 and ¾. All
right, this is where I want to go into more detail on Medicaid, and
later on when we have the presentations by our senior budget officer Pam
Kilpatrick from health and human services, we’ll expand on this. I want
to emphasize on the availability sheet, we are not saying there’s not –
again, we are agreeing that there is a Medicaid shortfall in this year’s
budget. And we estimate that to be 70 million dollars. This number is
going to be subject to revision. 70 million dollars is based on
information from health and human services, in their forecasting and
where we are year to date. It has been reviewed by us and the
information has been shared with the fiscal research division. The ??</p>

<p id="20:00">
Reason we think this number’s smaller than some of the numbers we saw
earlier is two-fold. One, we have been surveying the providers –
primarily the major hospitals – as to “what are you owed?” I know that
some of you have received emails or seen verbal comments that there is a
huge backlog in Medicaid payments that have not been made. There is a
backlog but based on the surveys to date and the information we have
today, the backlog due to providers are about where they were last year.
There’s not the big backlog we had. To be perfectly blunt, some
providers who gave us a large number, and I said, “Well fine, show me.
Show me your accounts receivable and show me your claims pending. And so
we can take that information.” And when you say “Show me”, the number
comes down, but we’re doing the actual survey. Now there are two
categories to this backlog. One is the normal billing, where you provide
services and then you bill through NCTracks health and human services.
There’s always a one-two month lag between when you provide the
services, bill it, and it gets paid. But we’re looking at that number to
make sure that’s not a larger number compared to last year. The second
area which is harder to pin down are pending claims. This is where
services have been provided but not yet billed. Again, there are always
going to be some pending claims for services that are provided in June
of this year, that aren’t billed until July. This year has even a bigger
issue because there have been challenges with NCTracks qualifying
people, with NCTracks receiving the payments from the providers and also
due to a larger number of individuals who are directed to Medicaid from
the federal exchanges under the Affordable Care Act, who have not yet
been processed. But we still believe that 70 million dollars will cover
the pending claims as well, which also leads me to the second point why
this number is lower. Last year’s budget for the second six months of
this year and the full twelve months of next year included substantial
increases in spending for what’s called the Woodworking Effect. These
are people who are eligible for Medicaid but have not participated in
Medicaid, but were going to be directed into the Medicaid system by the
Affordable Care Act and North Carolina’s federal exchange and the
navigators and others. There’s also related to that deemed eligibility
where you shell out for services, for example the emergency room, you
don’t have insurance, they’re going to deem you eligible for Medicaid
until proven otherwise. Well, the early indications, we’re working on
actual numbers, is that while the number of people referred to Medicaid
is about where we projected – over  80,000 – the numbers actually
eligible for Medicaid, the true count is substantially lower than that.
Out of a sample of about 18,000, there were about 6,000 people already
enrolled in Medicaid. So apparently what is happening, and this is
partly anecdotal, but we’re in the process of documenting it, that
individuals who did not qualify, who went to the federal exchange and
did not qualify for the insurance got automatically referred to
Medicaid. And that’s the initial number, even though some of them
already were on Medicaid. Some of them were even out of state residents.
So it’s for those two reasons, based on actual surveys of accounts
receivable in process, getting information on the accounts receivable
and pending claims from providers, looking at the number of participants
in the Affordable Care Act, that are actually going to be eligible for
Medicaid, we believe the 70 million dollar number is more realistic. But
here’s the two important points. We are not going to carry over that
liability without the money. So the cash remaining in the Department of
Health and Human Services, what would have otherwise reverted within
Medicaid, is being carried forward to meet that obligation. So we’re not
carrying forward a Medicaid liability without carrying forward the cash.
So the cash used for this obligation is not in that 290 million dollar
reversion. We have kept that separate. Second, as many of you know,
there’s a substantial payments throughout the year of drug rebate money
to the state of North Carolina. Approximately two thirds of it is due to
the federal government because they pay two thirds up front and
approximately one third to the state. In the past this has been treated
differently. And particularly the state auditor challenged and
criticized the practice that was done in June of 2012, treating that
drug rebate money received in June as being 100% state money, helping
balance the books for the fiscal year ending June 2012. But then they
had to start off in the hole in July of the next fiscal year, because
they owed two thirds of that money to the federal government. Well after
taking into consideration the auditor’s very legitimate criticism ??
with the state comptroller, we are not going to treat that drug rebate
money received in June as 100% state money. Instead, two thirds is going
to be set aside for the amount we know is going to be due the federal
government in July. So we’re not carrying forward Medicaid bills in
general without the money and we’re not going to treat the drug rebate
as 100% state when it should be considered partly federal so we’re not
doing either of those two ??</p>

<p id="25:00">
but also, as we'll elaborate more, if that numbers is wrong, that 70
million dollars number is wrong, the Governor is recommending a 50
million dollar Medicaid risk-reserve. So if the 70 million dollars is
wrong and there are bills that are due beyond the cash-carry forward,
we'll have an additional 50 million, brings that up to 120 million
dollars. So we think this is responsible budgeting, we don't have the
luxury of doing a range. You, the General Assembly, will have the
advantage of one more month's information. Our calculations were based
on data through March. You will have the data for actual payments and
accounts receivables through the end of May, excuse me, through the end
of April. That information is coming available now and you may, if
you're still working on the budget in June, have some of the May
information available. So you will have better information, more recent
information than the fiscal, fiscal staff have better information than
the budget office and it helped ?? service ahead for this year, excuse
me, for this budget. But we will to continue to work with you and
provide you that update information.
Next on the General Fund Appropriations, and this is comparison the
fiscal year of '14-'15, the budget that was enacted. Here you see for
fiscal responsibility, that additional 7.9 million to 8 million dollars
we were appropriating to the Rainy Day Fund save in Repair and
Rennovation, and the 50 million dollar Medicaid reserve. So this is from
appropriations not from ?? the beginning credit balance, it's total 65
million dollars. You will then see the net changes from the '14-'15
enacted budget to this recommended budget. I don't want to repeat that
cost. These can still represent increases over this year's buget but the
law you are adjusting is this year's enacted budget and another
important point is the 262 million dollar pay increase, we had the
information to allocate that by agency in the major committees. So
rather than being one big reserve of 262 million dollars at the end in
reserve to then be allocated through the certification process after the
budget's enacted and everyone starts taking their pencils and adding,
&quot;well how does this add for Education, how much is for the
Department of Public Safety,&quot; we have gone ahead and allocated that
money in the recommended budget for you so you can see it by the
departments where they are. I also want to emphasize, especially for
Education, that some of these reductions from the enacted budget are
reductions of projected increases. In particular, for Public Education,
the average daily membership, the enrollment, is giong to be 37 million
dollars less than originally projected. So it's definitely more than
last year but it's not a 37 million dollar cut to the public schools,
it's because enrollment's not as much, therefore funding's not as much.
Likewise, each year the Department of Public Instructions adjusts the
amount they need for their base salary because as the more senior
teachers retire and newer teachers are hired the amount salary actually
needed is usually lower and that number this year is a reduction of 64.
49 million dollars. Again, we're not reducing teacher's salaries or the
budget for teacher's salaries, they just need less. So those two
reductions alone account for 102.3 million dollars in the public
schools. Likewise, the community college system has lower enrollment so
that will be a 17.2 million dollar reduction from the enacted budget for
this year, even though enrollment's going to go up. As you'll see we're
reapplying that amount to the community colleges and the university
system is also experiencing lower enrollment and so that will a
reduction of seven point million dollars for universities from the
projected increase budget for '14-'15, not from the previous year's
budget.
Also, as we go through these reports through the committees, through the
senior as proposed by a committee in subject matter, now all of the
general fund savings are reduction means there can be less spending by
the agency. We do, as appropriate, maximize use of Federal dollars and
other receipts in order to save General Fund dollars, make more money
available for other parties including the same employ in teacher pay
rates. So that will be reviewed in more detail by the senior budget
officers for those committees. Again, this is pretty well, you've seen
this information beforehand. This just includes the details by a
committee compared to '13-'14 to '14-'15 and down the right hand side
you see the 1.7% overall increase from last year and then again, this is
more detailed, but what you've seen before compares them to the '14-'15
enacted budget from last year to this year. And you'll see it's only
eight and half million dollars less than originally enacted in total.
Again, you'll see the General Fund Appropriations by Sub-Committee,
minor changes from last year overall, and I'm going quickly in the
interest of time, but this is an important slide right here. This is the
issue</p>

<p id="30:00">
Recurring versus non-recurring spending.  Absolutely it is a poor budget
process to use non-recurring dollars for recurring expenses.  And even
as late as this morning reading certain newspapers that are saying, Oh
you are using non-recurring money for recurring expenses.  You are using
non-recurring money for the recurring pay increase.  We are not, this
budget does not do that.  In particular, the main source of
non-recurring money is the beginning credit balance at 168 million
dollars.  But as we've already shown, 50 million dollars of that is
going to rainy-day fund non-recurring, 50 to repair and renovation
non-recurring and 50 million dollars to the Medicaid risk reserve.  So
that's 150 million dollars non-recurring being set aside from that
non-recurring beginning credit balance only leaves 18 million dollars in
non-recurring money for the rest of the budget.  And as usual when you
go through the budget books, we break out the costs of recurring
reductions and recurring expansions, non-recurring reductions and
non-recurring expenses.  Another way to look at, it is not start with
168 million but 184 million beginning credit balance that carries over
to appropriations.  And there you will see in the dark green that we
have non-recurring revenue of 20.9, almost 21 billion.  We have
non-recurring revenue, 110 million because besides beginning credit
balance, there are some other non-recurring money becomes available,
surpluses from last year, various dedicated revenue sources.  We see on
the expenditure side, the total recurring expenditures, only 20.8
billion dollars. So we have 100 million dollars more in recurring
revenue than recurring expenses, including paying for the pay increases.
 Or look at it another way, we have 140 million dollars in non-recurring
expenditures which we are making up in part, paying for part of that
with recurring recurring dollars.  So we're actually doing the opposite,
we're using recurring dollars for recurring expenditures, and this is
very sound budgeting.  So we are not doing that technique, which I think
is very poor budgeting process.  Mister chairman, we now have the
highlights of public education.  In the interest of time I'm not going
to thank them all by name, but we have an excellent staff at the Office
of State Budget and Management.  All these Senior Budget Officers you'll
see except for one were here when Governor McCrory appointed me State
Budget Director.  It's been a joy to work with them, and our new guy is
going to get a good introduction to the general assembly today, and I
think you will find him very good at his topic as well.  So mister
chairman with that I want to start turning it over to the senior budget
officers, starting with Elizabeth Grovenstein on education, I will come
back at the end to address the specifics on the pay increases and answer
questions.[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Proceed.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you
mister chairman and members of the committee, may name is Elizabeth
Grovenstein, I am the Assistant State Budget Officer for Education and I
will be presenting the highlights of the education budget
recommendations.  And as you will see on slide seventeen, the
recommended budget for 2014-15 of 8.09 billion dollars for public
education is a 226.5 million dollar increase, or 2.9 percent increase,
over the current 13-14 certified budget.  It is also a 46.4 million
dollar increase, or 0.6 percent over what was the original enacted
budget for 14-15.  Several highlights of the public education budget
include 162 million dollars in this budget for pay increases for
teachers and other school personnel.  This fulfills the commitment to
raise starting teach pay to 33,000 dollars and provides a step increase
for teachers and principals.  In addition, there is 9.8 million dollars
from education lottery receipts used to fund the career pathways pilot
program.  This program is directed at retaining quality teachers who
take on increased responsibilities for students and success of their
peers and impacts of student achievement in the classroom. 23 million
dollars is provided from lottery receipts which doubles the textbook
budget, it's an increase of 23 million dollars.  Also, this budget
provides 18.7 million dollars, this continues the master's degree salary
that was announces earlier this year for those who have taken a course
towards the master's</p>

as well turning to slide 18 on the community college system the 2014/15
recommended budget for community colleges is 1.03 billion dollars this
budget is 12.1 million dollars or 1.2 percent higher than the current
13/14 certified budget it is also a 16.9 million dollar increase or 1.7

provides 18.6 million dollars that funds the 1000 salary and benefit
increase for all community college employees funded with state funds it
provides 16.8 million dollars that had been reinvested from the
reduction in the remedial course enrollments throughout the community
college system due to that reduction in remedial course enrollments
these dollars are reinvested to those programs that will help us in
closing the skills gap there's also a 1.9 million dollar appropriation
in the budget and that appropriation will offset the anticipated tuition

place Mr chairman I'd like now to turn to Pam Kilpatrick my colleague
will present a health and human services budget
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning and good morning to the chairs the members of the committee
and to the public I'm Pam kilpatrick with the office of state budget and
management and I will be reviewing the DHHS budget overview so the slide
before you is the summary of overall funding to the department of health
and human services total state appropriations last year's actual
spending 5 billion dollars you'll see that total requirements at 17
almost 18 billion dollars quite a bit higher which accounts for federal
primarily federal funds and all other receipts that are going into the
department next column is the certified budget for the current year
followed by 2014/15 certified budget the recommended adjustments to the
department's budget are an increase of 70.3 million dollars in total
spending authority 92.9 million dollars in increased receipts within the
DHHS budget and a net reduction of a hundred and twenty two almost a
hundred and 05:00</p>

<p id="40:00">
$22.6 million, for a revised recommended total appropriation of just
over $5 billion, or a .43% change from the current inactive budget, a
decrease in overall state appropriations.  But as you look to the top of
the chart you see that it is largely offset in increases in other
receipts in lieu of state appropriations.  Medicaid mental health, their
appropriations account for 86% of total DHHS funding from general fund
revenues.  And, they account for that now, they account for that in the
recommended budget for the Governor.  Other major appropriations, DCDEE
is the next largest, and then followed by Social Services.
So, this chart is to put into context all of the distinct or discreet
appropriations that are made by the general assembly to the Department
of Health and Human Services.  There are 11 different appropriations,
hundreds of programs and services that when they roll up turn into these
11 appropriations.  We're showing general fund share here.  So the
current certified budget of $5.1 billion  is adjusted again by that
$122.5/.6 billion, for a revised total appropriation for the upcoming
state fiscal year of just over 5 billion dollars.  We would also note,
as with all the presentations today, the impact of the proposed salary
increase for state employees is included with the department totals in
this presentation.
So, how did we achieve savings in the DHHS?  It was done, primarily, in
three ways.  It's achieved by refinancing, by provider assessments, and
by updating budget forecasts and creating efficiencies within DHHS.
So, highlighting the refinancing without reducing services, $22 million
in federal block grants and the Education Lottery proceeds are being put
into proposed to be invested in the NC pre-k program.  Of that, about
14.6 million is TANIFF, and 7 million is from the lottery, 15 million in
federal block grants for subsidized childcare, and refinancing the
regulatory staff in the Division of Child Development onto the DCCF
block grant.  Most of these dollars are due to updates and availability
from carry-forward from previous budget periods, as well as updates the
Department has received subsequent to the enactment of the biennial
budget on their federal grant awards. So these are primarily TANIFF
bought grants and Child Development block grants. In addition, 3.8
million dollars is invested into the AIDS Drug Program. It is a one to
one swap of state appropriations.  The program realizes excess drug
rebates.  We are proposing to budget those, to finance these services.
And an additional $3 million that was not included in the biennial
budget that is being earned in the current year is available next year
and can be used to finance Aid App without any change from the current
eligibility, from the current service level, or without a waiting list.
The next category of change is provider assessments.  These are in the
Medicaid Program.  This budget would achieve $75 million, which would
again be a one to one, in lieu of state appropriations by establishing a
$59.6 million state retention of a new assessment on local management
entities and managed care organizations.  In addition, following a
recommendation included in the Governor’s budget to the general assembly
last year, this budget would propose increasing the state's retention of
the existing assessment program with hospitals by $15 million.  Finally
included in the budget, $28 million in efficiencies and updates of
budget estimates, for example, health choice as a result while we're
seeing</p>

<p id="45:00">
Growth in the second year, as we’ll get to in the next slide. Health
choices underspending it’s budget as a result of children being moved
from the Health Choice Program into Medicaid. So,  we will account for
those savings in the budget proposal. In addition, State County Special
Assistance updates for the actual value of payments and the number of
payments being made.  We have gotten a revised forecast from the
department results in a savings to the State of about $4 million and a
savings to the counties as well, as we split that cost 50/50. So in
total, total general fund savings NDHHS $145 million. The Governor’s
budget proposes investment in health and human services primarily
targeted to at risk children. Metal health services primarily from block
grants and core public health infrastructure and thus, propose an
investment to get started with Medicaid reform. So, just to touch on the
$6 million which is  State share for employee pay raises at DHHS, most
positions cost allocated so that’s a little less than half what the
total cost will be when it’s implemented. $2.7 million to improve the
State’s ability to help the county’s in oversight in protecting children
and their welfare. $5 million to support growth in the case load of the
children in foster care. $3.6 million from increased lottery funds to
add to the NC Pre-K Program serving at risk 4 year olds. $10.7 million
of savings occurring within the current funding of the mental health
system are proposed to be re-directed to shore up the mental health
budgets which have had chronic shortfalls. Whether we characterize that
as patient receipts or spending, they are not balanced in their budget.
So we  are proposing to invest on a permanent basis $10.7 million so
that that critical part  of our in-patient care system can be sustained
and while, we use block grants to fund community services including the
Governor’s initiative on substance abuse prevention and treatment. $1.3
million to fund something that Secretary Vaush has certainly made a high
priority for us to be aware of is the amount and quality of the public
service that’s being delivered through the Office and the Chief Medical
Examiner. About $1 million is going there for transportation cost, for
medical examiner autopsy costs, to increase what we pay our Medical
examiners and also to train them to do the best job that could be done
and then, $350,000 or so  going into the vital records agency to do a
better job in serving the public  and getting out public records to
folks. Finally, $1 million is proposed in this budget to get started
with Medicaid reform. This would fund data, analytics, temporary
assistance to the Medicaid Agency to do this and some system work on
their NC tracks as it might be needed to implement reform. Overall, the
Governor’s budget will propose to you $23 million in State funded
expansion. It will recommend to this body re-investing existing State
dollars to critical needs and then, using Federal and other receipts to
maintain services for some of our existing programs. The net change in
DHHS $122 million. So, the next slide is the Medicaid budget. What we’re
showing you is Medicaid 2014 as an actant in current session law. So,
the top line is the current budget $13 billion, $9.6 billion in receipts
and $3.4 billion in State appropriations. The enacted budget that’s
already in place allows for spending growth of $405 million, $258.9
million in receipts and an actual net growth in overall State
appropriations already in place for Medicaid for $146 million. The
State’s investment in Medicaid since the 2012-13 enacted budget has
grown by a little over a half billion dollars as we look at the 2014-15
budget. So where we stand today, our director actually did a fabulous
job of giving you an update of where we stand and I’d like to recap and
hit a few highlights of, of where</p>

<p id="50:00">
we are so, what we've done is we are using the latest financial data
available at the time of budget development, which was actual North
Carolina accounting system information through March of 2014 and using a
historical analysis of expenditures for the first three quarters of the
year and projecting what fourth quarter expenditures would be. We are
making the assumption, at this time for budget development, that because
claims are lagging the budget we are not seeing the growth that was
anticipated when the budget was developed, that the difference between
the two is a lag in reimbursement for services. Whether those are
incurred but not reported, whether are those are pending and tied up in
the NC track system, or whether they are attributable to delays in
processing enrollments as a result of rolling out the new enrollment
system NC Fast. So net of all, we looked at a macro level. We looked at
overall spend in Medicaid and we said that in some funds they are
underspending their budget, in some funds we are right on target, the
net of the pluses and the minuses is that we expect that, at June 30th,
the Medicaid agency will have liabilities that have not been liquidated
of a net 205 million dollars. The calculated state share of that is 70
million. Because those claims and payments are not being made this years
we do expect there to be cash-on-hand at June 30th. The amount is
variable at the point in time we did this based on the rate of
collection of drug rebates. We assumed that would be 30-35 million
dollars. Depending on how those things occur it could be a little
higher. We don't think it will go lower but it could be. So that's what
were estimating in this. And again, to reiterate, the Federal share of
drug rebate has been handled variably over time. This state fiscal year
we will carry forward all of the federal share of drug rebate that is
collected by Medicaid after the last check write in June, after the last
opportunity to credit it back to the Federal Government and it will thus
improve the outlook going forward in July of next year. In terms of next
year's budget, we are using that enacted budget that the General
Assembly has put in place that enables an additional 146 million dollars
net growth in state money and multiplied for Federal share. In addition,
the following changes are being proposed , which are, I think I've
gotten a slide ahead, I'm sorry. We are looking at the 2014 base, it
includes the 2014, the 2013 shortfall of 70 million dollars, and then
taking that as a base, because the current year would not reflect all
the measures that were enacted in the appropriations bill, all of the
savings, and all of the annualized increases that were made, we have
done the annualization and we have assumed all of the health choice
children, greater than was initially budgeted, 71,000, are counted into
our Medicaid budget. We are assuming lower than budgeted impact from the
woodworking of the Affordable Care Act and we are adjusting the base for
FMAP increase Federal participation and spending. So with that, we would
recommend, at this time, based on our limited data but with good
analysis we think of what we have, moving forward with the budget as
enacted. Then we would recommend some changes. We're proposing the state
share of the salary increase for the DMA employees, partial funding for
a portion of the shared savings program that was enacted, a millioin for
Medicaid reform. The next two items are adjustments for savings in the
Medicaid budget, private duty nursing rates, as well as the prior
authorization of mental health drugs, and as we mentioned earlier, the
last two items are a refinancing of the Medicaid program using a state
retention of provider assessment in lieu of state appropriations. So
those state retentions just about equal the amount of the savings being
shown, which nets at about to a zero. The unknowns and variables at this
time, again, the accuracy of the backog, the estimate of growth, we will
have debate I'm sure and we look forward to working with your staff with
updated information on what is the right assumption to make about growth
in the Medicaid</p>

bottom of it all we thing that the most important thing is to make
provisions for variance based on what we know and don't know and are

Provides 43 million dollars for 2014-2015 over the enacted budget for
the highway maintenance program. And there are several initiatives to
continue modernization and improve customer service improvements for
citizens that conduct business with the Division of Motor Vehicles.
Mister chairman that concludes my presentation. I believe Mister Polk is
going to come back up to close out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister chairman, members of the committee, we've already discussed the
department savings reserve account. With the fifty million dollars
addition I've got the seven hundred one million. As overall, again about
a two hundred eighty eight million increase in savings reserved under
budget. Which is slightly over four hundred million at the end of 11-12.
Repair/renovations will be an additional fifty millions dollars. It was
one hundred fifty million dollars last year. This is probably the single
most dramatic effect of the unanticipated decrease in revenue. Had we
not had that forty five million. The beginning credit bounce would have
been higher. And therefore, the repair/renovation allocation would have
been higher. Again, we did increase from forty two to fifty million.
Looking forward to next year the next budget. The government
administration are in the process of completing both a twenty five year
infrastructure capital plan with an emphasis on the next five years. And
I think that next year will be the time the government will have a
proposal on a biannual capital plan for the next twenty five years. At
this point in time this budget does not, by the way, include any
borrowing for either capital expenditures, repair and renovations, much
less for operations. We continue the information technology reserve at
the same level. Chris Estes has done a great job as our chief
information officer. We have found that projects that take more time to
go from the planning stage to the implementation stage. The ITS reserve
that has already been budgeted for this year and last year. We reduced
about eight point six million dollars because we can delay the
implementation from this fiscal year to the next fiscal year. And we did
that partly as a cost saving measure. We want to spend the money when we
need to, not before we have to. Respectfully, this is an area where
viability may increase with additional reversions or other sources that
you may want to consider accelerating implantation of those plans rather
than laying them. But this is responsible and still meets the needs for
the state to delay eight point six million. As I indicated to you
earlier, we get a little bit more detail on the pay increases. Most of
this you've already heard before. For starting teachers years zero
through seven have been frozen at thirty thousand eight hundred dollars,
will be raised to thirty three thousand, which is a seven percent
increase. And this is the first step of a commitment to raise teem to
thirty five thousand dollars next year. Teachers on the existing pay
plan, with more than seven years experience there is a revised pay step
schedule. I've emphasized that. Had some inquiries. &quot;Well under the
pay step I'm only going to get a one or two percent increase.&quot;
That's under the existing pay step. What we are doing is advancing
teachers on the pay step, and we've revised it to provide an increase.
That revised schedule has been provided fiscal research by the
Department of Public Instruction. We have copies available for anyone
that has immediate inquiries and of course it will be set forth in the
recommended budget bill. As already indicated, highway patrol which is
also suffering from frozen pay steps which affected their recruitment
and retention. They will be receiving a bigger increase. Likewise,
masters and clerks have been on frozen pay steps. Overall, most state
employees on average will receive a one thousand dollar increase in
compensation and benefits. That comes out on average to eight hundred
nine dollars in cash, one hundred ninety one dollars in benefits. Where
you are at actual compensation will affect that mixture. So, if you're
earning fifty thousand dollars or less, you're getting basically a two
percent increase. If you're earning more than fifty thousand dollars,
obviously that goes down from two percent to one hundred thousand
dollars to one percent. If you need a little bit more detailed
information, this breaks it out by department as we said were going to
go by allocation by department, the agency within those areas. On
benefits, we have a retirement system and a contribution of seven point
two million dollars, in addition to what we already contribute. And a
one point nine percent cola increase for seventy million. You'll notice
the fifty six million. Again, the budget you passed last year was very
prudent, not only did it leave money on the bottom line, you went ahead
and allocated ----</p>

56.4 million for future benefits while the future benefits of the cola
increase so we back that back out, so that really means it's an
additional $14 million in addition to the 56 million for a total benefit
of 70 million. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I appreciate your
patience. We are here to welcome any questions. I know we're short of
time. My staff is available for your subcommittee meetings and
subcommittee briefings and of course a telephone call away. We look
forward to your questions and working with you through this short
session.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. Pope, for presenting us a very sound
foundation from which the general assembly can craft the budget for the
coming year. What we'll do at this time, we have to be out of this room
no later than 10:15 and some people have to leave a little earlier than
that, so if you will keep your questions short and keep them to
questions, we will try to accommodate as many as we can at this time.
Questions, Mr. Brandon? Representative Brandon?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Chair. I just have one question for the
education piece. When you say masters pay, I was wondering if they were
teaching 70% of the courses, does that include new folks or do other
people still have to fall into that requirement of 2013.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Last session the master's pay supplement was sunsetted,
it stopped for new teachers. This restores it for new teachers. A
perfect step, I think the 18.9 million dollars in projected savings that
this replaces was probably too much of a savings from them. Governor
Corey will have a proposal to reform the master's pay for new teachers
so that it applies the master's pay for teachers in their field. But for
this coming fiscal year, either way it's going to be 18.9 million
dollars.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Robinson.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Chair. Mr. Pope in terms of the pre-K, let me find
it, $3.6 million to fund 26,000 pre-K slots, can you tell me how many
children are eligible and how many children does that leave unfunded.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Well first and foremost, 26,000 is the existing level
of service, I wish we could fund 26,000 on $3.6 million. This will be an
increase, I believe it's about 600, but I will defer to Pam Kilpatrick
to answer that question in more detail.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Harrison.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Chair and thank you Mr. Pope.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I'm sorry. I apologize.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Chair, thank you. Senators, so again, the basic of
state dollars for pre-K slots is on average $5,000 per slot, so if you
divide 3.6 by 5,000, it could potentially fund up to 720 new slots in
addition to the 26,000 plus that are already existing.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Very quickly, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] OK. The rest of the question is how many children does
that leave unfunded based on eligible number of children.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I don't think they would have that number. That's a
number that would be available from the department. They would not have
that particular number. Representative Harrison.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Chair and thank you Mr. Pope. I'm off to
your right. This might be better directed to your deputy on this, but in
terms of the spay-neuter program, that's been something that's been
historically underfunded, and we had found the funding source of I think
a pet food tax, and I'm just wondering if that funding source goes with
the spay-neuter fund transfer.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] There's positions being transferred and that funding
source from Agricultural Department to Public Safety I believe, but I
will defer to again my budget officer. Thank you for recognizing that,
that the spay-neuter funding is separate from that transfer. But, ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes, sir. The spay and neuter program is in a special
fund that will also be transferred and there's an additional $100,000
recommended also in the JPS area for the spay and neuter program. But
the receipts, I believe it's about $250,000 in receipts, and we have
confirmed with the department of agriculture that those funds would be
available also.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Ford.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank you Mr. Pope. I was
looking through the Governor's budget and I did not see, and you may
have alluded to it in your comments,</p>

Do you have the required five year forecast that compares expected
revenues to expected expenses? [SPEAKER CHANGES] As you recall, I can’t
flip back to it right away. We do have the general forecast, we call it
a scenario, because of the range for it, but we will be glad to work
with the fiscal research division through a specific five year forecast.
So we have the information. Do I have it as a document? As a page in
this recommended budget? No sir, but we will find that. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] One quick follow up, it’s very important because not only is it
a statutory requirement, there are severe penalties, at least a
misdemeanor fine, penalty for not providing it. And given Mr. Chairman,
what we’re going through in the legislation side, I think it’s important
that we have that ?? five year projection so that we understand what the
big picture is. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I think you would have to arrest
some people in the past if you were going to enforce that.
Representative Goodman. [SPEAKER CHANGES]?? chart that shows the two
scenarios or projections for 2017 and we will extend it beyond that,
provide that information to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for the
further clarification. Representative Goodman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you Mr. Chairman. Mr. Pope, I’m over here on your right. Your own slide
17, says that there are salary increases for teachers and other school
employees. Is that all other school employees and is that a thousand
dollar minimum for all school employees? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually if
you would go back to it towards the end of slide, you’ll see teachers
and principals are 108 million dollars, and the second line are the
other public school employees ?? both administrators and support, and
that’s an additional 53.8 million dollars. And that does ?? the same as
the other state employees with 1000 dollars on average, including
benefits. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Two
questions, Mr. Chair, but the first is on the lottery. You may, there
were some shifts or some recommendations of some new areas to be funded
so could you just give me a brief update on where that leaves the
lottery with the funding for the counties in the other categories? What
changes? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We increased the funding for pre-k from
additional lottery funds. From the lottery surplus are this year the
non-recurring, we’re using part of that for the pilot program for the
Career Pathways for teachers. We left the capital funding for the
counties at the same amount. I believe it’s 100 million. That was not
changed. I will defer to Elizabeth ?? for that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes
sir, the 100 million dollars for the capital fund was the enacted level
and that has not changed. The new areas funded: Career Pathways, 9.7
million, the UNC Serves NC Scholarship Program, 5 million, Pre-K is a
total of 18.4 million, and text books, 23.1 million.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
One more question, Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Briefly. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Briefly, on the child and family support teams, in the DH
budget where that 250,000 dollars was eliminated, I’m just concerned
about what positions, are they all like state administrative positions?
Will it affect the local programs in any way, could somebody explain the
impact of that and what positions are actually eliminated? [SPEAKER
CHANGES]?? Patrick. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. The two
positions and the residual funding are for an evaluation contract. They
are state level administrative positions. They were part of the pilot
when this was being rolled out to the counties. It does not affect the
service level. But that funding remains unchanged within DPI, and this
is a state level administrative expense that has been deemed unnecessary
since it is now fully operational. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Adams. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. Just one question about
the masters on page 17. Am I to understand that if you’re working on a
degree, that that degree must be in your area? For example if you’re
teaching say, first or second grade, and you’re pursuing a masters in
reading, would that not apply? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Adams, I
don’t know the details of it. The funding is recurring funding to
restore it. Actually this current statute says it’s supposed to be
quote, I’m not sure the exact language, supposed related to your field
already. The governor will have a specific statutory proposal and the
state board of education is working on the exact language on how to
define what is related to in field. Some ways, it’s easy. If you’re a
special education teacher and you have a masters in special education,
that’s in field. If you’re a physics teacher and have a masters in
physics, that’s in field. I’m not</p>

<p id="80:00">
Personally familiar with masters in reading for generally first and
second grade reading. I presume that's going to be defined by the state
Board of Education. This budget recommends the funding for it. There
will also be work again in the Special Provisions and Statutes Unit and
the implementation by the state Board of Education as to what is and is
not in field. That's actually an issue in the current law and will
continue to be so.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Pope. Two questions dealing with the
Health and Human Service area, and I'll wrap them all into one. Right
now you're predicting this Medicaid shortfall at roughly $70 million,
and as I understand from Ms. Kilpatrick's presentation, she was looking
at numbers that were based upon March 30th, but as I recall in that
timeframe, the projected timeframe, was $70-140 million, so I'm trying
to understand what has changed to get us only to the $70 million level,
and likewise, to what extent has our physical staff been consulted with,
because I know at one point there were differences between physical and
what the budget office was looking at. Secondly, within HHS we've got
the $122 million cut overall, but I know I've heard the secretary
mention on a couple of occasions that what she really needs is good
staff to get in there, to fill the positions that are needed to be
filled with the type of expertise and skills that can help her run the
agency effectively. To what extent has that been taken into
consideration with the 122 that's projected to be taken from that area?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] In answer to your first question, the Health and Human
Services provide a range of the potential shortfall. Part of that was,
to be perfectly blunt, very simple math as to what they thought the
unrealized statements would be that the General Assembly enacted as well
as expected growth. We have met extensively with Health and Human
Services, they provide the primary information, do the forecast. My
office has taken an interactive role with them. We have met directly
with the Fiscal Research Division on two occasions, sharing information
with them so we know where we agree and where disagree. And we will
continue to do so with Fiscal Research Division, but again, the primary
information is from Health and Human Services. Unfortunately, part of NC
Tracks both provided for a data warehouse and analytical software to do
a better job of tracking, forecasting the balance of the year through, I
believe the system is called Trueven, as well as the next year. That was
delayed in a simple notation, and we don't have that information
available, so hopefully we'll have more information next year. But I
agree, I'll say it again, the $70 million that we think of state funds,
the state share, we believe is realistic, the 50 million Medicaid risk
reserve gives us room up to 120 million and the Fiscal staff and Health
and Human Services and Budget Office will have more information as each
month goes by before enactment of the budget. In regard to the staffing,
first and foremost something that this General Assembly had already
done, you provided a salary adjustment fund of $7.5 million last year.
We actually requested 20 million, but we got 7.5 million. There was some
debate on whether that was intended for Health and Human Services. The
Assembly had authority to adjust their salaries by shifting around, but
we did allocate part of that salary adjustment fund, a major part of it,
to Health and Human Services, especially to those healthcare
professionals. Also, this across the budget increase, salary increase
already in here applies to Health and Human Services. But finally,
Health and Human Services has about 1,800 vacant positions. We did not
eliminate those vacant positions. You're absolutely right. We need to
fill those positions, and they still have the authority to do some
reallocation within those positions to give more higher compensation,
they still have the authority, for example, to try and cut down the
overtime and contract service for nurses and other healthcare
professionals by providing better pay, so we did not take those
positions. There are a few small areas we asked for efficiency among
existing positions, but we did not take away those vacant positions.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Farmer-Butterfield.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Chair. My question is in reference to
DHHS. I notice that in terms of the North Carolina pre-K program it
looks like state dollars are being swapped with federal counter funds.
Is this due to an increase in counter funding or is it coming from some
other allocated area of services?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] It is an increase, but I will defer for your
correctional elaboration from Pam Kilpatrick. It's an increase.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Further questions at this time? If not, Mr. Pope we
thank you and your team from the Office of State Budget and Management
and the committee is adjourned.</p>
