<p id="00:00">
Well good morning. We’re going to go ahead and take a few minutes up
front to outline some of what we see the major portions of the budget to
be. Then we are going to go ahead after that and take some of your
questions. If you can, if you will hold your questions until we get to
the end of the overview, I think that will make it a lot more free
flowing. 2013 Senate budget proposal. The North Carolina Senate has
followed Governor Pat McCrory’s lead in crafting a balanced and fiscal
responsible budget that continues to invest in core priorities,
streamline state government, reform public education, grow North
Carolina’s economy. Like the Governor’s proposal, we are focused on
continuing to heal the state’s balance sheet by providing safeguards for
our long-term fiscal health through investing in infrastructure
improvements and shoring up our reserves and rainy day funds. This is a
$20.58B plan which comes within less than 1/10 of one percent of the
Governor’s proposals. Obviously it differs in a few details here and
there, but very very close. There is a 2.3% increase in overall
spending, and yet the budget also lays the groundwork for the largest
tax cut state history. The senate budget accomplishes this while dealing
with over $1.2B in additional Medicaid requirements. Medicaid continues
to be the primary driver in our budget. It is a problem that is
affecting every other single spending priority we have in state
government. Moving into health and human services, obviously with
Medicaid there has been the need to make some very very serious changes
and decisions to go ahead and bring that budget in at some manageable
level. The fact that this is an entitlement program, the fact that we
have to go ahead and fund whatever the bill is, and the fact that we
continue to have issues with the federal government tying our hands when
we want to make changes, only aggravates the problem that we have here.
The $1.2B of additional state money to fund Medicaid includes not only
the rebased numbers that we have for this year, but it includes $49M in
the first year and $114M in the second year of the biennium from the
woodworking effect of the affordable care act. We are pleased that
Governor McCrory is leading the effort to reform Medicaid. Basically,
we’re going to have problems in every other single area of our budget
until we get Medicaid reformed. There is a provision in the budget that
allows the Governor some time to go ahead and convene stakeholders,
interested parties from across the state, to develop his plan and
ultimately bring it back to the general assembly. The general assembly
deserves the right to vote on that plan at the end of his work, and
we’re looking forward to seeing what ideas come forward from that. The
rest of our healthcare budget’s focused on encouraging and rewarding
health care providers for increased efficiencies and better healthcare
outcomes. There is 4% that comes off of provider rates and goes into a
shared savings plan that will target those who are selling in the area.
We do fund additional beds at Broughton Hospital. One of the four
regional psychiatric hospitals funded by the state. We also establish
and fund a statewide telepsychiatry program to improve access to
psychiatric care for patients in rural areas. The budget allows people
with Alzheimer's disease and dementia to access additional hours within
the Medicaid personal care services program, which helps fix a problem
for special care unit residents created by compliance with federal
eligibility standards PCS. We expand support services including respite
care for families caring for a person with dementia at home, in order to
go ahead and encourage individuals to be treated in a more familiar and
love ?? environment. Many of the nonprofits that were funded through
DHHS are now going to be put into a competitive grant process that will
be managed by DHHS. This takes the legislature out of the business of
picking winners and losers in funding community nonprofits. Finally, it
also establishes regional rates for payment of hospital inpatient
services. This is done to eliminate the wide disparities in how
hospitals are paid for the same service. With that, I’d like to ask
Senator Hunt to go over the education highlights.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m going to do education first, then I’m going to do transportation. I
like to say despite a critical…</p>

Use of the money for Medicaid. Our budget protects money from public
education. The fully enrolls enrollment growth in k12, community
colleges, and university assistance. It provides 53.6 million to
continue confidence in education reform to strengthen student literacy.
Improve graduation rates. Increase accountability in the classroom. It
gives parents tools to make better informed decisions about their
children's education. It emphasize the importance of literacy by
strengthening the teacher education programs. Licenser requirements and
professional development and special focus on improving students reading
skills. It increases accountability in the classroom by employing
teachers through contracts that are renewed based on their performance.
It continues the senates commitment to implementing a pay for excellence
plan by including 10.2 million in the second yea to front annual pay
raises for the most effective teachers. It allows parents to identify
high performing average and struggling schools and overall student
achievement by clearly indicating the overall level of student
achievement and measuring whether a school is exceeding or failing to
meet standard appropriate goals. It eliminates the k12 flex cuts for the
school districts. To make the education budget process fully
transparent. Previous legislations are appropriated inflated amounts to
education but required local LEH ?? to return the money back to the,
back to the states. Our budget sends local school districts the exact
amount they have to spend. Whether than using a budget gimmick to appear
to be spending more. Well these changes remove unfilled teaching
positions but does not eliminate any teachers from the pay roll.
Students in school districts will receive the same amount of net of
state funds as they would with a flex cut. And finally on education, k
through 12 it expands teach for America across the state and encourages
recruitment of North Carolina college students and military veterans to
teach at risk students. On the community college system, it restores 20
million and recurring state funds. It provides 10 million for critical
equipment needs across the community college system. It aligns
enrollment funding model to a more personal affect actual enrollment
growth. By providing 4 million in funding to aid the colleges most
impacted by this transition. It invest an innovated technical education
program to help business build new products and technologies that create
and retain jobs. Like the manufacturing solution center. And the
textural technology center. It increases opportunity to help students
learn in demand vocational skills and authorizing community college
system to admit high school freshmen and sophomores in career,
technical, education and industrial engineering courses. On the
university system it makes responsible budgeting changes and creates a
funding reserve for need base financial aid. In order to provide
universities with certainty that financial aid available in future
school years. And finally it incorporates the administrative and
operational savings instructional efficiencies, and program
consolidation efforts identified by the university system and their
strategic directions plan. On transportation. Our budget continues to
maintain and invest in critical infrastructure. Remove political
influence from project decision making. Reduce precocity and enhance
customer service. Our transportations budget incorporates the governors
vision for overhauling the North Carolina highway trust fund which
consolidates various funding streams to prioritize and accelerate
transportation infrastructure at the projects regional and local level
by an estimated 35 percent over the next 10 years. It continues the
senates efforts to remove politics from transportation decision making
by eliminating main projects from the statue. Including previously
mandating toll projects and the off the top gap funds and mandated a
data driven prioritization process that includes local input to select
future transportation investments. It provides funding for targeted
maintenance needs focusing on improving, repairing, replacing,
structural deficient bridges and other critical infrastructure. And it
funds the replacement of information technology systems critical to DMV
customer service improvements. Extending operating hours at driver
license offices. And the acceptance of credit and debit card payments.
Now senator Brown is gonna talk about, whatever you're going to talk
about.</p>

<p id="10:00">
alright first I'll touch on the highlights of our economic development
agriculture and natural resources part of the budget.  Our budget
provides approximately 7 million annually for the job of maintenance and
capital development fund or JMAC that's been our budget for a while now
it also allocates 1 million in 2013 14 budget for our base realignment
enclosure initiatives to protect our bases as cuts continue in the
military across the country we want to make sure we protect our bases
moving forward. It continues to invest in proven economic development
projects like the highpoint furniture market and the North Carolina
Biotechnology Center and research strangle institute.  It creates an
economic development program to allow the department of transportation
to more rapidly respond to the infrastructure needs of new and expanding
industries in our state with protections to ensure those investments are
justified and also because North Carolina's rural communities are a
critical part of our state and our economy it launches a new new rural
economic development division within the state department of commerce
lead by new Assistant Secretary with a focus on improving rural services
and addressing rural needs it also invests approximately 55 million over
two years in a new rural infrastructure authority a streamlined and
efficient program that will offer one stop shopping for our communities
can get the support and resources they need. Our budget continues
efforts to maintain our states strong commitment to agriculture water
efficiency and domestic energy production as well.  In our natural and
economic resources budget it consolidates grant programs from public
water and waste water infrastructure projects into a new streamlined and
accountable division of water infrastructure. It provides resources
totaling 92.7 million which is more money then last years budget and the
first year to spur clean water initiatives and improve water and sewer
infrastructure also creates a new water and land conservation trust fund
it includes one and a half million expansion for strategic national and
international marketing of North Carolina's world class agricultural
products it supports farmers by investing 5 million to upgrade farming
equipment and technology at research stations providing 2.4 million for
bio energy program and including a 4 million expansion of the tobacco
trust fund for displaced tobacco farmers.  It allocates 1.25 million for
an expansion of shale gas sector development as well. Under justice and
public safety highlights our budget emphasizes a commitment to keeping
North Carolina's North Carolinians safe by producing I'm sorry by
providing funding for additional key public safety personnel investing
in critical emergency response technology and connecting law enforcement
agencies at the local and state level.  Our justice and public safety
budget also restores funding to 69 trooper positions within the state
highway patrol and provides increased funding for needed fuel and
equipment.  It adds 39 magistrates and 175 probation and parole officers
across the state to ensure cases are processed smoothly and criminal
offenders are supervised and complying with the law. It funds laboratory
equipment and 19 new positions for the North Carolina State crime
laboratory to provide critical support for criminal investigations to
law enforcement agencies across the state. It fully funds the upgrade
and maintenance of Viper technology to enhance public safety and
emergency response communication and it also moves the SBI to the
department of public safety.  The SBI is an investigative law
enforcement arm much like the state highway patrol alcohol law
enforcement and emergency management.  In fact the SBI is the only law
enforcement division housed outside of DPS. Were nation among law
enforcement agencies is vital and housing them within one agency is
common sense. It simply does not make sense for our states top attorney
to supervise the SBI just like it wouldn't make sense for your local
district attorney to supervise your sheriff's or police.  Internal
corruption investigation unit will remain within the attorney generals
office to provide objective and fair oversight over different areas of
state government.  In other highlights our budget fully funds a state
retirement system and it sets the framework for modernizing tough word
for me the states outdated IT infrastructure a move that will strengthen
protections for our citizens personal data and enable North Carolinians
to have a more customer friendly interaction with state government and
it adds funds and it funds an innovative</p>

<p id="25:00">
That’s how we handle that issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And is there tuition?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I can’t remember, I don’t think there’s a tuition increase in this
budget.  No.  There is a small one in community college by $2 an hour.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think you’re referring to the out of state increase.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We did not adopt that, no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
State employees and teachers aren’t getting pay raises? What’s the
justification for that? I know it’s going to cost money but they haven’t
had one pay raise in 5 years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Correct. And we helped get them that pay raise last time. We understand
why folks want pay adjustments. One of the things that occurred again
between the time that the Governor released his budget with 1% raise and
the time that we got a hold of it was the Medicaid situation. It matured
or came on us like a rush.  I think that ultimately we feel like we’re
better working on trying to get North Carolina competitive again,
getting our economy moving again, so that we have more workers, more
people paying taxes so we grow the pie for everybody and we’ll be in a
position of instead of looking at 1% pay raises from year to year we’ll
be able to look at better and more competitive pay wages to having the
best workforce that we can have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? for a moment.  It looks like hospitals are going to take a hit here
this is increasing rates, it looks like some declining reimbursement
rates for some procedures, it says outpatient procedures.  As you know
hospitals are already on a tight, tight ?? some of the changes that are
coming under the Affordable Care Act. Are you concerned about this, how
is this going to impact especially rural hospitals?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I think first of all you’re going to see that one of the changes in
the budget actually helps rural hospitals. It makes sure that they
receive, this move towards reimbursement rates by region is going to
help rural hospitals quite a bit. Another thing that you’ll notice is
that yes there are some, really in essence rate reductions in the
budget.  But there’s $1.2 billion more going into the health care system
than there was before. Probably the fairest thing to say is that most
hospitals are going to come out ahead, financially.  They may end up
serving more patients to get there, but that they are not going to be
taking a fiscal hit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There’s only so many people that are given, providers. There comes a
point where you can’t be accomodating more people.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We think there’s room for efficiencies in that system. We think that
they can do this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Also could you explain the regional payment structure, how would rural
areas, are they going to get a higher reimbursement rate depending on
their, I guess explain.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What it does is it makes the reimbursement rates more uniform.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So that, often times what’s occurred is that the same service done in a
rural hospital would get reimbursed less at a lesser rate. So I think
what you would see is more movement towards the middle so that you can
get your services done out in a rural hospital and the cost will be
reimbursed fairly for that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s just going to be geographic regions not urban verse rural.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They are geographic regions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There’s a provision that relates to the Vosh federal case. Can you
explain that and how you would change what the Supreme Court ruled?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’re going to have to elaborate on that one a little bit more.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There was a Supreme Court case that said there was a limit on how much I
believe it’s a state or a county government can get back from a Medicaid
patient with the Medicaid patient wins a ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I know what you’re talking about but will l have to answer you later so
I can catch up on that one. I know the provision you’re talking about.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
How about another provision in JPS that would require I think it’s the
state or maybe all law enforcement agencies to send up information by
officer on traffic stops and then there’s another provision about
officer involved shootings, what’s that all about?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s all accountability.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? or is that something new?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s the accountability side of the issue, honestly I can’t remember
that provision that well just thinking through it so I may have to get
back to you on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There’s a provision in here for a CCNC audit, and from what I understand
CCNC might be going away in a few years.  So why do the audit?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don’t know that CCNC is going away in a few years I think that what we
know is that there’s a number of proposals out there for how to reform
our Medicaid system. Theres several efforts in here designed to make the
activities occurring at CCNC.</p>

<p id="30:00">
A little more transparent and accountable, not because of concerns about
CC&amp;C, but just because we have to get our hands around this huge
problem. We won't know what the governor's final recommendations on
Medicaid reform are for a number of months now. The more information on
the table, the better off we'll be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The changes that you are making in Medicaid, are any of these gonna
require federal waivers?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The federal waiver is likely to occur with the effort that the
governor's doing. The 1115BC waiver. Most of the things that we're doing
here are things that we can control without having to do a state plan
amendment. I mean, one of the problems that we ran into last time was
that we budgeted based on the state plan amendment and it sat up in
Washington for nine months. We're at a crossroads on Medicaid. Everybody
here can tell that we have 400 some odd million dollars more in spending
this year in the entire state budget and oh by the way, that's about the
size of the Medicaid rebase. And all these things that we talk about
that we want to do in education and justice and public safety and the
environment they are all running right into the Medicaid juggernaut and
we have just got to get it fixed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Overall, why do you feel that this is a strong budget proposal?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think we believe that first of all, we live within our means. We've
been through four extremely difficult years, with recession and
post-recession, and yet we managed this budget not only without a tax
increase, but we managed it with some tax reform accounted for and a tax
cut accounted for. We're able to protect spending in critical areas,
we're making the hard decisions to divert resources into critical
programs, and sometimes that means tough decisions on those that are
left behind. Bottom line is, we are doing what we can with the resources
that we have available to perform the fundamental responsibilities the
state government has.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, there was a proposal in the last budget, in the second years,
if it were merit pay for state employees that never came about. So you
have it in this year for teachers. Why would this budget be different
from last year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As you know, the last budget has 127 million dollars for merit pay for
all government - all state government employees. We've narrowed the
scope here, we're just talking about teachers. Actually, the difficulty
in doing merit pay across the board is how do you measure, you know it
becomes very subjective. We think we have ways now that we can quantify
teacher performance, so we can use this 10.7 million dollars to target
the best teachers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The other thing that's in there is there's a million dollars for the pay
study that the state that the executive branch wants to cover. The
results of that study will help inform what we're able to do on merit
pay. We are little further along in our plans and efforts in education,
so we were able to move on that part, but we have a ways to go and have
to wait for the results of that study.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, eventually we gonna get to merit pay for everybody?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll take that. We would like to do that once we can accomplish this
with the teachers, I think we're in a position to do this with other
state employees.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One more. Here's the Democrats are already saying they don't have enough
time to read the budget, let alone figure out what's in there, it seems
like a pretty short time frame. You've got 413 pages of special
provisions, I think. How do you, I mean this is one week, it's supposed
to be done by Thursday. What are your thoughts on kinda the timing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My prediction is you will find they have plenty to talk about. I think
they will get though it and they will find plenty to talk about. I think
the three of us all remember actually having our budgets delivered paper
