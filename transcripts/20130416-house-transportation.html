Representative Boles. Representative Boles moved to the back corner, it
looks like. He likes to sit in the back corner anyway. Going to call a
meeting, the April 16th meeting of the House Transportation Committee to
order. Want to start out with our folks that help us in service every
week. The Sergeant at Arms today, Bob Rossey, Martha Parish, and Bill
Bass.
Pages, if you’ll stand and wave your hand as I call your name. Sierra
Owen, Northampton county, Representative Wray. Adam Riddell, Alamance
county, Representative Jones. Carson Whitaker, Franklin county,
Representative Moffitt. Thank you for your service.
One of the bills we anticipate today is not going be on here. The moped
bill has been withdrawn a day or so ago. We’ve got two, I hate to say,
simple bills. Representative Stam, who has been here most of the day in
Education and Transportation, is going present one or two of these
bills. House Bill 272 will be our first one. DoT connotation changes.
Representative Stam, you are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Representative Jackson joins me on this
along with Representative Bryan. It’s already a House Committee
Substitute, we don’t have a new PCS for you. If you ever tried to
present a bill that’s already been eviscerated, well…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, do we need a motion for the PCS?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, it’s not a PCS. Another committee passed it this way.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Committee Substitute came to us as it is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So they’ve already ripped the heart of my bill out. But I’m here to
present the easy part, the good parts that everybody love, right Darre?
The first one is this, that when DoT in condemnation pays interest on a
judgment, it should pay interest until it pays, whereas the current law
is that they pay it until the date of judgement. Oftentimes there 30,
60, or even longer time period when they haven’t paid it because of the
bureaucracy. Just like in your own personal finances, you have to pay
interest on your home mortgage until you pay the payment, not just when
it’s due. That section one of the bill. There is a fiscal memo that says
that will have a minimal effect beginning in 2018. That’s just fair.
Now, section two, and this is one we worked on quite a bit. It sort of
looks like its give attorneys fees to attorneys, but actually, if you
analyze it, it’ll give fewer attorney fees to attorneys. But it’s also
fair.
Here’s the problem. DoT lowballs their deposits. Matter of fact, the
fiscal memo says that DoT says none of their...listen to this, they say,
the Attorney General’s office states nearly all of our verdicts are more
than 25% above deposits. We actually heard testimony that, last year,
all of them were that. In other words, they lowball. The effect of low
balling is that that sends the landowner scurrying to a lawyer. If they
would pay closer to market value, more people would negotiate it
themselves, and since typically lawyers charge on a percentage, not of
the whole recovery, but on the difference between the deposit and what
is recovered, it actually would decrease the amount of attorney’s fees
being paid by the landowners. But how do we accomplish this? There’s
existing law on lines 26 through 29 of some situation where DoT has to
pay attorney’s fees. And we’ve added a third category where the final
judgement exceeds the amount of the initial deposit by 25% or more. We
also have made clear in line 25 that just because the landowner may have
contracted for a contingency fee with the lawyer, that doesn’t mean the
state pays some contingency fee. It’s limited by the amount, by the
prevailing hourly rate where it’s tried. In other words, if you hire a

<p id="05:00">
A lawyer from Charlotte to run up to Davidson Co. to try a case, the
fees will be based upon the prevailing hourly rate in Davidson, not in
Charlotte and that's a limit on existing law. So, that's the bill. The
fiscal memo says zero, zero. The next two fiscal years, which is why is
probably doesn't have a referral to appropriations. Minimal in the next
two years after that and then in fiscal year 2017-18, somewhere between
a half a million and 3 million a year.  I encourage you for it.
Representative Jackson, would you like to step out and be recognized?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Jackson is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just want to echo what Representative Stam said about the attorney's
fees. People look at attorney's running the deal and start to think
maybe there's something in it for the attorney. It's actually just the
opposite. We'll get less fees if this deal passes. However, it will be
better for land owners. I'm one of those 2012 cases where the verdict
was less than 25 percent. The state actually had appraisals in that case
that were roughly about what the jury awarded and we actually have the
document from DOT where DOT refused their own appraisal and then reduced
the deposit by about two hundred thousand dollars and that's what they
deposited. Cases like that could be avoided if DOT would give a fair
deposit based on a real appraisal. I think this will encourage that. It
will probably hurt condemnation of lawyers, but I think overall, it
would be better for the state. So, I move for adoption.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, questions from the committee. [inaudible] Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you committee. Representative Stam, I heard
your comments and I thought the first part was a little funny that two
attorneys up here were telling that they were not raising fees. That's
almost the joke of the day but anyway, I'll go back to you said we're
trying to get the prices more in line and I have the question because
the appraisers that do the DOT appraisal work are certified. So, I don't
know how we could have two difference prices. I've actually seen some
and talked to some of these DOT appraisers and what it sounds like I'm
hearing is that the price depends on which attorney you get and if
that's not the case why don't we change some rules and regulations into
the appraisal department—how they appraise this land versus changing
this. I'm just inquiring because I don't know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certified doesn't mean that you're going to come up with--if I have five
appraisers, all of whom are certified, they're going to come up with
five different figures. I'll give you an example from my own law
practice.  I never tell an appraiser what value I want to have, but I
have 3 or 4 appraisers I know that historically appraise low. So, if I'm
doing an estate evaluation, I call one of them. I know 3 or 4 appraisers
that historically appraise high. If I have a condemnation case, I call
them. Then if I have a client who wants to know what to sell his or her
property for, like the fair market value, I've got 2 or 3 others
appraisers that seem to come right in there. So, I just call the right
one. Well, the problem at DOT is that their list is all the low ballers,
it's not that the others are not certified. It's just that different
people have different ideas of how to approach the value of land.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You know, I was under the assumption that we all used comps  when we did
this. I guess the comps change depending on who the appraiser is. I'll
go back to my question is maybe we need to be addressing this with the
appraisers. Is there any way to look at how we can address the same
question? I don't know, but that's my concern.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, every appraisers picks his or her own comps and rarely will they
pick the same comps; and even if they pick the same comps, they adjust
them differently. So, you're always going to have differences with
comps. Always. If they get within 25 percent, they've been doing their
jobs, but my experience is that they usually come in about 75 percent
low. You know.</p>

We’re fifty percent low.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, I’ve got five names so far. Shepard, Cleveland, Jeter, Torbett and
Pittman. Shepard? Representative Shepard?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  I have a question. Representative Stam, are all
the hot-shot lawyers from Charlotte?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, they’re all over the place.  I was… no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. It’s noted. Representative Jeter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mine was for a motion when appropriate, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.  Representative Torbett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My question is also for Representative Stamm.
We open to the last paragraph.  I think it starts on at the end of line
34. Evidently compensation will be rewarded by a judge, including a
reasonable attorney. Does that also include an unreasonable attorney?
And then I noticed nowhere in here was there a capping of said attorney
fees so can you give me an idea of what one of those hot shot lawyers
from say up here serving in the general area might charge.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have dozens and dozens of statutes allowing judges to award
attorney’s fees in different kinds of cases. This example, unfair
deceptive trade practices, promissory notes.  The judges, unless
otherwise ordered, the judge consider about six things. One, how much
time they spent in it. Number two, the reasonable amount of time they
spent on it because judges will chop your hours in half if they think
you’ve over-lawyered it. Then they want to know the prevailing fee for
similar lawyers in that area and they take affidavits.  Then they want
to know what results you got and then the judge makes those findings a
fact and those are awards.  Those are appealable and that kind of thing.
What this bill does is not only for this third category of case, but
also for the first two category of cases. It says that the limit on
attorney’s fees is a prevailing hourly wage fee in that district, in
that county, so that you are not…  Well, let’s say that you’re in
Chatham County, the prevailing hourly fee might be $200 an hour whereas
in Charlotte, it might be $400. So it would be capped at $200. That
language is a cap.  It also says that the judge can’t double it for a
contingency or you did a wonderful job and got a good result.  He can’t
increase it because of the result. It’s a cap.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’re addressing some of the concerns that I have.  You mentioned
there’s other cases there’s a judgment rendering, for a lack of a better
term, I guess damages or paying for whatever, but in a lot of those
cases, you mentioned it wasn’t against the state.  And when it comes
against the state, since we don’t make money, then of course, if it’s
filed against the state, its taxpayers’ dollars going to pay for that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s the point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This does not affect what the landowner pays to the attorney. This
allows the landowner to get a part of what the landowner paid the
attorney back from the state in these three certain cases. But it’s only
going to be a part usually because it can’t exceed that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Maybe I can be of some help here. I believe this was in judiciary.  Some
of these questions may have been vetted there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, it received a unanimous verdict from Judiciary B.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I have a question for the bill sponsor also. This is not
the attorney right to work bill. This is a different bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up from Representative Torbett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a closing follow up.  The idea that it passes Judiciary
unanimously actually concerns me even more.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The chair is trying to be helpful.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, Representative Pittman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sir, Mr. Chairman, I was going to move for approval, but since George
beat me to it, I’m going to let George do it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Well, I did have some concerns that
Representative Torbett had on the language.</p>
