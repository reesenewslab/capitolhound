Senator Rabin: House Bill 727 is necessary because automobile insurers
process thousands of total loss claims in North Carolina each year, the
vast majority of these claims after the total loss settlement is made to
the vehicle owner or to the lien holder. The title is then, or
certificate is then passed on to the insurer.
Sometimes these titles are lost, misplaced, or destroyed, and this bill
allows, puts a method in place for these salvaged titles to be obtained.
Having said that, Mr. President, I'd like to send forward an amendment.
The President Pro Tempore: You may send forward your amendment.
Clerk: Number 10[?); it's on the dashboard.
The President Pro Tempore: Thank you; the Clerk will read.
Clerk: Senator Rabin of Brunswick moves to amend the bill.
The President Pro Tempore: Senator Rabin, you're recognized to explain
the amendment.
Sen. Rabin: Thank you, Mr. President.
The bill unamended gaved the DMV pretty much a blanket immunity, and
what this amendment does is it provides protection for the Department of
Motor Vehicles when acting in good faith upon information obtained. And
if that information is not correct, then the Department is held
harmless; however, for any routine problems the Department is
responsible for, they can be held liable.
I recommend the amendment.
The President Pro Tempore: Discussion or debate on the amendment?
Hearing none, all those in favor of adopting the amendment will vote
aye, all opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for voting,
and the Clerk will record the vote.
49 having voted in the affirmative and zero in the negative, oh, there
it is. House Bill 727, the amendment is adopted. House Bill 727 has
amendments before you for third reading. Any further discussion?
Senator Rabin.
Senator Rabin: Thank you, Mr. President. I just request your vote,
please.
The President Pro Tempore: Further discussion, further debate.
The question before the Senate is the passage of House Bill 727 on its
third reading. All in favor will vote aye, all opposed will vote no.
Five seconds will be allowed for voting. The Clerk will record the vote.
Why don't we play roundup. Senator Apodaca, your vote?
Senator Apodaca votes aye, Senator Berger votes aye, Senator Wade votes
aye, Senator Bryant votes aye, Senator Rucho votes aye.
House Bill 727, having passed its third reading, will be sent back to
the House for concurrence with the committee substitute, for the
amendments.
House Bill 589. The Clerk will read.
Clerk: House Bill 589, [??] election reform.
Mr. President.
The President Pro Tempore: Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you
rise?
Sen. Apodaca: Motion, please.
The President Pro Tempore: State your motion, sir.
Sen. Apodaca: Mr. President, I move that the rules be suspended to the
end that staff may join Senator Rucho on the floor.
The President Pro Tempore: Without objection, so ordered.
Senator Rucho, you are cleared to speak on the motion.
Sen. Rucho: Thank you, sir, and Members of the Senate.
This election reform bill is something that is going to work to bring up

There is also a provision now mention the fact it was reported that
there would be an increase from four thousand dollar to five thousand
dollar maximum I believe 1982 that four thousand dollar maximum was
established and if you just do the cut on the cpi from then to now that
4,000 would be 16,000 But what we're trying to say that it will be a
5.000 limit.  It will be adjusted I think every 2 yrs by using the cpi
index I know everybody in this room fully  understands that the money
less but the cost of campaigning whether you use TV, media or direct
mail or whatever constantly goes up.  And so what this does is is help
eliminate some of those problems We have a situation, lets see where the
bill reduces the opportunity to gain ship in the timing the candid  of
the withdrawal and what that does is it  insures that all parties will
have an fair notice on open seats We eliminate all straight ticket
voting allowing voters to choose the person not the party and it also
allows those and helps each of the voter to pay close attention to the
non-partisan elections which at this point of judicial elections out of
other elections.  Some counties commissioned elections and those down
ballots racist and initiatives do deserve the scrutiny of the vote of
the individuals that are voting It also provides that the earliest
someone can register is on the 18th birthday. There is a lot of
confusion in my own son's situation he had pre-registered and then got a
letter wasn't quite 18 thought he was suppose to vote the bottom line is
everyone that turns 18 will know its time to go vote and therefore will
register will get registered appropriately, and finally the bill
restores NC's voice in a presidential election by moving up the date of
the NC primaries that will be a primary election for our presidential
preference. Many times having an election in May primary election we in
NC don't have very much say in the selection of a presidential candidate
parties This just gives us an opportunity to become active in that
process and allow our citizens to act accordingly I will comment about
one report that was in WRAL they comment about the fact that the when
someone is at the polls at the time let say, 7:30 when the polls close
anybody in line at the same way the law exists today at 7:30 if that
line goes well beyond that everybody votes WRAL should be sure their
facts are accurate before they make a ?? statement like that Mr.
President I believe I gone over the list I'll be delighted to attempt to
answer any questions on this and I would urge anyone to take advantage
of this election to reform and give us an opportunity to pass this good
election and put some confidence, honesty and integrity back into the
electoral process. Thank you.  Speaker change further discussion further

The experience of those people in New Hampshire.  In Iowa, and now
Soouth Carolina.  And we get a chance to talk to the president,

our small towns. And I'll say this, North Carolina is a lot better place

bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Ford, for what purpose do you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President and the ladies and gentlemen of the senate.  As
a freshman in the minority party, when I came to Raleigh, I came up here
with an open mind.  Everything that I am learning about the state
legislative process, I am learning from you.  Voter ID has been very
unpopular among many.  I am one of three democrats in this chamber that
put their name on a voter identification bill, a bill that would have
guaranteed that no registered voter is denied the right to vote and to
prevent the unauthorized use of a registered voter's voting privilege
through the fraudulent misuse of a voter's registered voter's identity,
senate bill 235.  I believe that we should protect the integrity of the
voting process, and I understand the arguments against that.  However,
for me, whether it is one person or 10,000, one is one too many.  But
this bill goes beyond protecting Senator Rucho, the integrity of the
process,  but it restricts access to voting.  To me, this is
un-American, and it does a disservice to North Carolinians.  I cannot
support a bill that restricts democracy.  Number one, it eliminates same
day voting registration.  Number two, it eliminates preregistration for
teens.  In 2012, nearly 50,000 teenagers preregistered, most as
unaffiliated with any particular party.	 And last, it reduces early
voting.  Folks, we should be expanding the voting process for all while
protecting the integrity of the voting process.  This is not voter
reform, this is voter suppression.  I cannot support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.

Senator Stein, for what purpose do you arise?

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may send forth his amendment.  The clerk will read.

Senator Stein moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, you're recognized to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the senate.  I'd like to follow up
on this point on early voting that senator Ford just raised.  This bill
shrinks from 17 days to 10 days the number of early voting days.  In the
2012 election, general election presidential year, general election,
900,000 people voted in that first week of early voting. 900,000, nearly
a million people.  2 1/2 million people voted early.  In fact, a
majority of North Carolinian voters, 56%, voted early in 2012.  This is
one of the most wildly popular, pro citizen initiatives this state
government has ever taken.  In fact, there was a poll - 85% of the
people of this state support early voting.  That's because, 75 percent
of the people have early voted.  You all are reducing the number of
days, you're reducing the availability of early voting.  Senator Bryan
asked Senator Rucho, well how do we know that we're not going to lose
the number of hours of early voting that's available to the people?
There's nothing in the bill that will ensure that the people have access
the same number of hours of early voting over tat ten day window as they
do in the 17 day window.  The amendment that I send forward addresses
that point.  It's pretty straightforward.  All it says is, however many
hours you as a county have early voting in the primary over 17 days,
have the same number of hours available over 10 days.  And if you need
more sites to get to the total number of aggregate</p>

Mr. President and ladies and gentlemen of the Senate. I’m concerned
about this bill as much from the standpoint of its fiscal impact as many
of the other issues that are raised. My question to Senator Rucho was a
legitimate one about the additional cost to counties for having a system
of duplicate, multiple primaries.
Let me tell you a quick story about Wake County. Wake County has a woman
named Cherie Poucher as our Supervisor of Elections. She’s a Republican.
She worked here in the General Assembly for the Republican Minority
Leader in the House. I respect her as much as you can respect any
individual and she is respected by most of the elected officials in this
county because she runs fair elections.
But if you were to ask Cherie about this bill and this amendment, she
would tell you that in Wake County where we have over 600,000 registered
voters, where we have somewhere approaching 200 precincts or polling
places, that early voting and having the number of hours we’ve basically
had has saved Wake County tremendous dollars because we haven’t had to
open new polling places.
My precinct has over 6,000 people in it and yet we don’t have lines on
Election Day. My precinct is a precinct that looks like Wake County. We
don’t have lines on Election Day because of early voting. It has saved
the County Commissioners and the Board of Elections at least two or
three extra polling places because of the number of hours that are
available.
Now if you start restricting hours, we’re going to have to have new
polling sites to accommodate these 6,000-plus voters, I said “people,”
6,000-plus voters. If we had 200 precincts in Wake County each precinct
would have upwards to 3,000 people in it to vote on the same day.
So, we can’t go back, Senator Rucho is absolutely right, to where we
were in 1997. But in these rapidly-growing counties, if you start
cutting back on the number of hours for early voting, not only are you
creating requirements for more polling places and they’re tougher to
find now.
You can’t use schools when they’re in session because you’re
interrupting the kids. You’re not using churches and stuff as much as
you used to. You’re not using rec centers. They’re tougher places to
find.
We ought to sort of get with it with the new technology and the ability
to determine whether somebody who says they are who they are should show
up early to vote and that’s what early voting does, it moves us from the
20th century I think reasonably into the 21st.
Senator Stein’s amendment that there would be the same number of hours
as we already have at least serves as a finger in the dike. At least as
a finger in the dike. The fact of the matter is that in these rapidly
growing counties you need more hours of early voting to keep from
spending more money to open more polling places having to buy more
voting machines.
These machines are used once a year, twice a year, on however many days
we’re voting. We ought to be aimed at buying as few of them as possible.
We can’t create more days. We don’t have to pay for the extra days.
There are 365 in a year, we don’t buy new days.
But we have to buy new machines when you start compressing this voting
time. So, not only the cost of the new machines, the cost of the new
polling places. You’re adding additional costs for the election process.
So I would urge that you support this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Ford, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if the distinguished Senator Rucho would yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can you explain to me at the end who would bear the costs of these
expanded voting sites?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The voting sites would be borne by the County Boards. Let me just
clarify that too, so that we understand. When Senator Blue was talking
about the precincts and he’s got 6,000 members in his precinct, this
also as part of Section 24, also requires a study so that we evaluate
the mega-precincts like in Cumberland County or like in his county with
6,000…</p>

...voters and the General Assembly will come back with recommendations
on size, border population and the like, to help eliminate some of his
concerns regarding the size of the precincts. And also, you're not
buying new equipment. The Board of Elections is using the same equipment
that's on general election day, moving it to the location. So it's not
purchasing new equipment. It's utilizing more efficiently.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Go ahead, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Would you consider this to be an unfunded
mandate from the State to the counties?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] From what Senator Brock said, I'd probably, you would
say not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? Senator Tucker,
for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Excuse me, to debate the amendment. I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, may I ask Senator Rucho a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tucker, go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho, in the new tax plan, are there not
unencumbered dollars that will be coming to the counties in the new tax
plan?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. The way the tax plan and the county, and the
municipal tax returns, they will be greater than they presently are now.
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Thank you, sir. Just a comment, Mr. President, if
I may?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're recognized to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. On page J-6, in the budget, the Help America
Vote Act, which is commonly known as HAVA funds, we appropriate in
general government about $400,000. And for that $400,000 that we
appropriated, these additional funds will allow the State to access $4
million of HAVA Federal funds for information technology in State
elections. So there is some money so that, I don't think, Senator Ford,
that it's justified to say it's an unfunded mandate. They do have
dollars coming their way. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Meredith, for what reason do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Senator Stein would yield to a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Senator Stein, I had one question about
eliminating the first seven...the days we were eliminating were
disenfranchising certain voting demographics. The first day of early
voting is the first day of early voting, so I'm a little confused how
we're eliminating the first seven days being eliminated when the first
day of early voting is the first day of early voting. Can you explain
that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd be happy to. If we got rid of early voting all
together, then the first day of early voting would be election day.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And what has proven to be the case, is that if we had
everybody come out on election day, we would have to have massive
expansion of the number of precincts, which would entail having more
money on the county's part. You'd have to train many more people. Buy
more machines. So every day you compress the schedule, you are pushing
to toward election day. What has happened historically, and I don't know
why, but African-Americans have voted at the very beginning of the
process. The fact that you would moving it back, yes there is always
going to be a first day, but you are going to reduce the number of days
in which people can vote. And furthermore, African-Americans vote
disproportionately in the entire early voting process. So if you were
restricting the opportunity to vote early voting, then you are reducing
their opportunity to exercise the franchise in the way that they have
factually, empirically have done. My amendment will mitigate the damage
of reducing early voting by ensuring the same number of hours. My
amendment will mitigate the damage by reducing the number of hours. The
key is to make sure you have the same number of poll hours available to
voters. I agree with you that if you do that, then the damage is going
to be less so. But if you just shrink early voting without a guaranty
that counties are going to offer voting to people, they're pushing
people to election day, which is a work day, which can impact on
people's ability to participate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant, for what reason, for what purpose do
you rise? Senator Hise, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Senator Stein will yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, just to clarify from what I heard you
say. If counties, under their choice, maintain the number of poll hours
they currently have...</p>

Buy an additional week, I guarantee you that overwhelmingly and they'd
want to see that timeframe expanded.  And the only thing I'm asking us
to do is every four years, when this presidential election cycles com,
that we go back to the type of voting that we're doing right now, that
resulted in roughly 1/6 of registered voters carrying out the vote, over
900,000 people.  That something we should all be in favor of.  So I ask
for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate?  Senator Rucho, for what purpose do you
arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.  To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Again, Senator Mitch is sick is absolutely correct about the fact that
we will try to do everything we can to reduce the lines so that everyone
will have a good opportunity to go to the polls.  If we work with
senator stein on this issue, we're not just interested in the
presidential years, were interested in a tall.  And if there's an
expansion and if you go from IE's mike county, we have 10 locations to
20 locations, that gives a better opportunity without having to travel
across Ocounty to be able to go vote.  That being said, if we work with
senator sign on this issue, this amendment will not be needed, and I
urge you to vote no on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McLaurin, for what purpose do you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you so much, Mr. President, members of the senate.  I'm thinking
about this from my perspective as a businessperson, employing about 30
people in my community and business people all over North Carolina,
small business people who want their employees to get to the polls and
vote.  And what senator stein has put forth is I think a very pro
business friendly, fro employee amendment that will enable us as
employers to encourage people to get out and vote early.  And I think
that's positive, it's something that we should all be able to fill that
about and it will be positive for our work force.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let us see if I have my order right.  Senator stein has in amendments
that has been displaced, and we are now discussing senator make his
sixth amendment.  Any further discussion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Mayto sick, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But I will do in the interest of trying to see if we can work something
out on these issues relating to early voting, I will ask that the
displays temporarily as well, since they address in many respects the
same issue.  But this is uniquely different because we're asking about
doing this on presidential election years.  So I really do believe that
in presidential election years the two approaches and play that allows
people to vote as freely and openly as possible, notwithstanding only
Mayto on the other off years.  So I don't mind displacing it temporarily
to see if we can address some issues in their totality, but I do believe
it addresses something that feels uniquely with what occurs in
presidential election years.</p>

it's occurring, we would anticipate that this will solve all of the
problems will be addressed and I think they will prove to be a
non-issue. That being said, Mr. President, I'd like to send forward an
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman may send forth his amendment.
The clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho moves to amend the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho,
is this bill on the dashboard? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It is. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] You're clear to debate your amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, sir. This amendment makes a number of various technical and
clarifying changes after yesterday's meeting regarding absentee ballots
and timing for special elections and we also move to study the issue of
defining political committees that prove to be a question as to what it
really constitutes.  There are other parts of the bill, clarifying the
process for a County to confirm voter registration for a voter who
requests an absentee ballot, clarifying the absentee ballots must be
received by the Board of Elections. If the ballots are not received by
the election date, the absentee ballot must be postmarked by election
date, received within three days of that date, technical changes to
correct statutory placement of provisions authorizing voter legislation,
 applies changes requiring special elections to be held at the time of a
primary or general election, to special elections for bond referendums.
On September 10th of 2013, removes new language regarding pole observers
and instead requires election oversight to study the bill that was
brought up yesterday as to questions about the observers, and we tried
to address that and we'll continue doing so.  Clarifying changes to
language allowing registered voters to update registration information
at one-stop sites.  Mr. President, there are a lot of technical changes
in there.  I'll do my best to respond to any of the questions, but that
I urge you to move forward.  This was a result of yesterday's discussion
during the Rules Committee and also a number of questions that were
brought up by members trying to get some clarifying language and that's
exactly what this tries to address. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Blue, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Evans.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho, yield
for a question.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho, we're going to get you
over here yet.  Would you yield to a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes,
sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho, I'm sorry because we don't have a
split screen, so I don't see exactly what's being changed with the
amendment, but I do think that we sort of adjusting some of the most
fundamental rights, if not the most, in a free society.  So I'm just
trying to figure out -- [SPEAKER CHANGES] What you alluding to so I can
try to identify the spot that you're --  [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm trying to
figure out what we're really changing.  I've read the Amendment and in
certain places it says that you're repealing sections,  and I'm just
trying to follow it since I don't have the bill and before it goes to a
vote I want to understand it. And so, if you would, bear with me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] You describe three or four
things that this Amendment does and I was trying to follow it in the
bill.  If you have in some synopsized form the five or six things that
this amendment does, I'll try to follow it.  I simply didn't follow you
when you were explaining it.  I was trying to match it to the bill and I
couldn't do it because I don't have a split screen. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.  I will share that with you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Right now. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Are we still on the
amendment or are we back to the bill? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We're on Senator
Rucho's Amendment Number 3. Senator ??? for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President, and I don't know who to
address this to.  Let me ask Senator Apodaca.   [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Opadaca, do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, this is extremely difficult to try to digest and listen
to the debate on this bill.  Can we just displace this, and I'm thinking

things.

About 4:30 Senator Nesbitt. That work?
[Speaker Change]
That would be fine. And if there are others I mean, we may wanna go
ahead with the amendment process so we know what all is out there. But
as some point I think it would do well for both of us to go look at some
of this stuff.

Fine but I don't of any others. I mean, I've got one, Senator Nesbitt.
We have several.

Good to know. Yes send em on over we'll look at em. I didn't wanna

Would you stipulate that we would ask for all amendments that are
prepared to come forward, and we'll put them on the dashboard. Then
they'll be available to everyone. Is that OK with both gentleman?

It's fine with me.

I will send mine, if he'll send his. And we'll send our, we'll send ours

The house will come to order. I stand corrected. Yet you are ?? ?? as
the house. The senate will come to order. Please take your seats. The
chair understands that house bill 589 amendments number 1, number 2 and
number 3 have been displaced and the bill is before us, house bill 589.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd like to withdraw amendment 1 and submit a new amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Amendment 1 is withdrawn and you are recognized a new amendment which
will be amendment 4, concur read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, you are recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Members, this amendment does three things. One, it says that
whatever sites you open  have to be open for all during early voting,
you can't stagger them in and they have to be open for same number of
hours although you can stagger the hours so that some could be open and
some could be later, that's up to the County board. It also says that
the County boards, if they can't find public facilities for early voting
sites they can go to private facilities if necessary. And the more
important part is as we discussed earlier is that there is a minimum
that the counties have to offer the same number of hours to early voters
that there were in 2010 if it's an off year election and in 2012 if it
was a presidential election and I commend the amendment to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator ??, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, Senator Stein was so persuasive and convinced us that it
was a good thing to do and we fully agree because we are all involved
and interested in trying to make sure that we have access to our
citizens to have their voice heard. I will ask that the Senate will
support amendment number 4.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brock, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if senator Stein would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, this is a fair question to you or anyone no matter which
side we are on. Election day voting but won't concern our ?? for a long
time on this. Some of us are workers that we have our, on the election
day from 5:30 until, they can't leave and with the people that are
volunteering, that is a great civic service but I am just worrying about
having these man of hours as the per loaned early voting cycle. We are
gonna make it look tougher for people to commit 12-13 hours per day
during early election cycle.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do not believe we will. The number of hours are the same so that you
have X number of hours being worked in 2012, you'll have the same number
of hours. My understanding is there is no continuous work requirement of
anyone who works on the poll so that for the early voting you can
actually substitute people out during the day.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ok, so it's not accumulative follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So it's not accumulative hours of 2012, it's just same hours a day from
9 to 5. If not accumulative hours from 9 to 5 for the numerous states
before but now since you assured shorter period, you are not trying to
add starting early election voting, earlier into the day and extend it
later into the afternoon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that a county board..</p>

him what the problem a couple of different ways if they have fewer
sites. have to leave them open longer is your losing seven days of early
voting in all hours that were available to the people who live in the
seven days are not available to people for their convenience. the event,
so those hours need to be added in somewhere in the last ten days of
early voting. if the county as more sites as our scan be applied to that
site. if they keep the same number, size, they will have to extend the
number of hours, but you can have different people work shifts during
that period, early, but this is just
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
because amendment you have the person who brought a think it shows
initiative, we have no matter if we have a longer period of time or a
longer day of initiative, we have an estate is finding big the good
people to work and becomes tougher and tougher burden on his people to
work in a briefing and thanked us more than we have to look at somebody.
science is not a partisan issue is really tough for the board of
elections to find good people who work needs ours. we might want take a
look at that in the interim, a some way to be able to spell are these
people because we have a lot of senior citizens sometimes very tough to
ask somebody to work at level fourteen hour day in an election cycle
were we had a longer day longer cycle. the seven extra days as a long
time to commit for election workers an hour looking additional hours,
which makes for longer day so the one you it's a catch twenty two out of
their nature would take a look at it in a fun way will dispel some of
our election workers to make sure there are a widow of a worker best
people thinking it's not computerized to essence down the question,
chances are you are you… and looking at your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
tell me if I'm correct in the way it works that you will have each
county to him hours. they provide an early voting in those respective
years. TNR to whale by Bob Multi plan, the number of hours their site as
well( the number of site to get a toll number of hours and began to
create a floor or the number of a numerical floor for the number of
hours and site they will have ongoing and they can apportion that I
intend if they would deem appropriate sewage is create some found
boundary as standard across the state is that what you're in is my
understanding that at a major understanding is perfect.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
it's precise. my hope is that county boards of election and recognize
this is a floor because the percentage of people who are voting early
has increased each and every election and the population of our state is
increasing each and every year, and so my hope is that they will offer
more sites, because the more sites that offer the people more
convenience. their giving their citizens in a national religion be back
here
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Thank you, Mr. President.  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, this is
pretty much the same as we discussed minus some clean up in this bill
that took care of this language that Senator Stein managed so it
wouldn’t be redundant and secondly, there was an issue dealing with the
bond referendum dates that has been eliminated. I urge that you pass
this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion and debate on the amendment?  Senator Nesbitt, for
what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Question for Senator Apodaca.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, I apologize to you.  I thought we were going to do a
perfecting amendment, but since it’s a new amendment, we need to review
it.  If we could have an opportunity to do that, just displace it for
ten minutes and I’ll have our staff read it and just make sure we know
what we’re doing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s fine to me. Ten minute recess, Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, we can move on with other amendments. If we can just displace this
one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that alright, Senator Rucho?  Let’s displace that amendment then.
We’ll move forward on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Amendment 6 is displaced.  The bill is back before you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To bring back that displaced amendment form earlier.  I believe it
probably would have been wrapped Amendment #2.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Number 2. I’m not sure that we had it displaced.  I thought you were
contemplating that, but at any rate, it’s back before us at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. As indicated earlier, what this particular amendment would do is
separate and distinct from what Senator Stein had suggested.  I think
that in off years, what his recommendation is would certainly make sense
after elections. But in presidential years, we have unprecedented
turnouts. As indicated right now, we have over 6.4 million voters here
in North Carolina.  We know that we go back 2008, we had about 705,000
participating in voting in the first week of the early vote period.  And
that’s simply in the first week alone.  We know that this past year in
2012, we had over 900,000.  903,000 to be exact who were participating
in the early vote period during the very first week of the early voting.
 So what this amendment would do is that when we’re having those
presidential elections, where there’s unprecedented turnout and we want
to avoid those long lines on Election Days, we want to convenience
voters as much as we can. We want to increase participation in the
process, that we will restore the one week that would otherwise be cut
simply in the years of presidential elections. So I ask for your support
because I think all voters, regardless of their party affiliations,
enjoy voting early.  We see there was a 200-person increase simply in
2008 and 2012.</p>

I feel certain if you would've asked today all of them who participated

restored, certainly in our presidential election years for general
elections
[speaker change] Mr. President
[speaker change] Yes
[speaker change] Senator ?? for what purpose do you rise?
[speaker change] To debate the amendment number 2.
[speaker change] You have the floor.
[speaker change} Mr. President and members of the Senate I thank Senator
McKissick for his willingness to step forward and do something to help.
I think based on Senator Stein's amendment, when we put a floor on there
of the number of hours that existed in 12 and 08, this really is
addressed and what it does is, is it doesn't prohibit the county boards
and/or the state board from increasing the hours if the need arises,
that gives them the flexibility, so I urge since we have already
addressed this issue, we vote no on Amendment 2.
[speaker change] Mr. President
[speaker change] Senator Clark for what purpose do you rise?
[speaker change] To speak to the amendment.
[speaker change] Senator Clark you have the floor.
[speaker change] Before I speak to the amendment, I ask Senator Brown to
yield for a question if that's okay?
[speaker change]  Senator Brown do you yield?
[speaker change] I will
[speaker change] Senator Brown, if I remember correctly, you do have
some military installations in your district, right?
[speaker change]  Yes
[speaker change] is it Seymour and
[speaker change] Camp Lejeune, New River Air Station
[speaker change] So you have a very large military population, right?
And it is probably not uncommon that throughout the year they have
training activities, sometimes they go maybe a week, sometimes ten days
where they are working 24/7?
[speaker change] That is true.
[speaker change] Thank you Sir.  Okay, Mr. President I have a concern
with our Veteran's. Because also I'm from Fort Bragg where we have a
large military population and throughout the year they are engaged in
training events, sometimes they go for a week, sometimes up to ten days,
24/7, so I'm concerned about making sure that we have a wide enough span
of time so that we can accommodate out military members who might
potentially be engaged in training activities.  I mean when they are
engaged in those 24/7 training activities, I mean when they are engaged
in those 24/7 training activities they can't just up and go and run to a
polling place and vote. So I think it is probably during those
Presidential elections for our Veterans lets have an expanded time
period so they can take advantage of the opportunity to vote as well.
[speaker change]  Mr. President
[speaker change] Senator Tillman for what purpose do you rise?
[speaker change] To ask Senator Clark a question.
[speaker change] Senator Clark do you yield?
[speaker change] Yes I do.
[speaker change] We treasure the military vote very much as all of you
do, especially those who represent them, we have absentee ballots that
are available to the military including everyone else, and they are
always going on training sessions and sometimes they are not convenient
and they are around election time, but in anticipation of that, each and
every one of them could do an absentee ballot without I don’t think, a
lot of problem, they have been doing that in the past.
[speaker change] Well actually, it is not that simple because I'm
talking about for instance like at Ft. Bragg, where I work at the
mission training complex, a lot of times the rank and file folks don't
even know they are going to be engaged in training at any particular
time so if all of a sudden we tell them  they are going to have to
participate in an MRX, they won't know that so they are not going to be
submitting or requesting an absentee ballots in advance.
[speaker change]   Mr. President
[speaker change] Mr. President, Senator Rabin for what purpose do you
rise?
[speaker change]  I have a little bit of experience with the military, I
think the amendment in the bill as they are stated right now, is just
fine, it will work out fine. In my experience, it's never been an issue.
They can get the absentee ballot if they work on it. If the system would
work better. And I've never known a commander who would deny the
soldiers the right to vote and give them part time off, it just doesn't
happen, hasn't happened in my experience, I won't say it won't happen
once in a while. But in general, just smoke and mirrors, thank you.
[speaker change] Further discussion/further debate? Senator Stein, for
what purpose do you rise?
[speaker change] To debate the amendment.
[speaker change] You have the floor.
[speaker change]  Thank you. This isn't smoke and mirrors, this is about
people being able to vote in the election they care about the most, more
than any other. The general election on a Presidential election is the
one where we have the greatest turnout because its what resonates with
people the most. We all know that all elections are important and we
wish people would participate in all elections. But in the last
presidential election we had 900,000 people come in that first 7 days
and yes we've mitigated the problem with the amendment and I appreciate
your support of the amendment but Senator McKissick idea just says one
one election, one time, every four years, let's keep it at 17 days. It

Absolutely sensible Amendment, I support it and encourage you to vote
for it as well. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clark, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak to
the Amendment a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have served in the military for 20 years as well and
my experience, it has been a problem. As a matter of fact I can remember
doing the last presidential election when I was actually at a polling
site seeing a few troops show up there being escorted by one of their
leaders, and I guess they felt pressured because they didn't, they
needed to get back to their post and I can remember one say &quot;Well
Sarge, I would like to get a vote&quot; and he says &quot;Well, we have
to get back to the post, we just don't have time. It doesn't matter as
long as we have somebody to be president, you shouldn't be concerned
with that.&quot; So time pressures can have an impact on out military
troops and I'm certain that probably the Major or the Lieutenant Colonel
or the Full-Bird Colonel certainly wouldn't ?? such, but when you have
those troops down there, that make, are the rank of Sargent, Staff
Sargent, something like that, they're tending to try to please their
leadership, so sometimes they do things that they probably should not
do, so I think it's probably in the best interests that we try to look
out for those soldiers who may be lower down on the totem pole and make
sure that they are given as much time as possible to go to vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise, for what purpose do you
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the Amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You
have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President, Members of
the Senate. We set forth an election process and we work County
Commissioners and others plan for elections that are coming each year,
so that we elect everyone from ?? Water Conservation to president. It is
not the purpose of our elections to provide a different system and a
different timetable depending on which elections happen to be on the
table that year. This is about consistency ,that we do our elections and
provide people the equal opportunities when they are electing Country
Commissioners as when they are electing president. This Amendment
changes that. This Amendment says that when we are fortunate enough to
choose the electorates for our president that we open the system in in
different areas, differently then we do at other times. It is time that
we put consistency, that is what this bill is about, across the state so
that people can not continue to use the election policies to advantage
themselves. So I ask that you oppose ??. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the Amendment a second time. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] You have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To be completely and
totally consistent it would be best not to change existing law, but
that's not what this bill does. This bill radically changes existing law
its a voters' oppression act. We don't even want the kids in high school
in their civic classes to get ?? history to vote. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
McKissick, will you stick to the Amendment that is before us? [SPEAKER
CHANGES]Absolutely, but I want to be very clear, based upon Senator
Hise's comment, that we are doing something that's different, because
what we are doing is changing existing law. I would be very happy if we
were to allow the additional week in every election year, in every
election cycle. I think that would be the right thing to do, but since
this bill is proposing to decrease it, and because it is decreasing it,
I'm simply asking that as a convenience to voters, those voters who came
out en mass in 2008, those that came out en mass in 2012, those that
will come out en masse again in 2016, that we respect the fact that they
don't wanna wait in very long lines, that they don't want to sit there
and have to wait for some court to enter an order, so that all the
people waiting in line can possibly vote, because we have those two and
three hour lines, a lot of people don't stay there, they don't get a
chance to exercise that constitutional privilege. So this is simply, as
an accommodation to voters, regardless of whether they are a Republican,
Democrat or unaffiliated, but simply as an accommodation to voters, to
give them that extra week. Yes, it would be better if it was consistent
every year, but I'm taking for granted the fact that that my best wish
will not be realised. So I'm simply saying, to be fair and reasonable,
to those voters who we know will go back, those voters a sixth of whom
in this state who came out and voted in the first week, this past year
in 2012, that those voters will come out again at the next presidential
general election, that they get that privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

...you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just briefly, and I want to be real consistent here.
For me, is it about expanding the voting opportunity process. We just
heard from one of our members talking about the military. Why would we
not want to accommodate our military? We're talking about voting here,
folks. Voting. Give people the opportunity to vote. Regardless of how
they vote, I just want them to vote. I cannot believe that I'm listening
to you talk about limiting a voting process. This is extremely
disturbing to me. Can we please move on and support this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? Hearing none, all
those, the question before the Senate is the passage of Amendment 2. All
in favor will vote aye, all opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be
allowed for voting and the Clerk will record the vote.
Seventeen having voted in the affirmative, and thirty-one in the
negative. The amendment fails. The bill is back before us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think we're all set to take back the amendment that
was put aside. I think it was Amendment No. 6.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Amendment 6 is back before us. Senator Rucho, you are
recognized to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. I think we've already explained it and
I believe Senator Nesbitt has had a chance to review it. And I think
we're ready for vote. I urge you to vote for this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. And in order to be
reciprocal here, Senator Rucho was so persuasive, and he amended his
amendment that we now support the amendment and I urge everyone to
support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? Hearing none, the
question before the Senate is the passage of Amendment No. 6. All in
favor will vote aye, all opposed with vote no. Five seconds will be
allowed for voting and the Clerk will record the vote.
Forty-five having voted in the affirmative. I'm sorry, we have some more
who haven't checked in just yet. Hise. Tillman. Forty-seven having voted
in the affirmative and one in the negative. Amendment 6 passes and the
bill is back before us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Kinnaird, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho has quoted a poll that says that 70% of
the population supports voter I.D. But, there is a great deal in this
bill beyond voter I.D., the people simply do not support. Straight party
voting, 500,000 more Democrats voted in the last election than
Republicans. And now we're removing straight party voting. That's a
little odd to my way of thinking. But what is really popular with the
public is early voting. Well over 75% people very much like and
participate in early voting. So it is very odd to me that we would limit
the most popular part of voting.
And in addition, I have a personal interest in this because like Senator
Nesbitt and Senator Rucho, I introduced a bill on the behest of the
students of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. They were
looking for a place where they could vote on campus, all of them at
once. And what we came up with, working with Senator Nesbitt, was
actually early voting. So my students had asked me and I was very glad
to introduce that and when it became early voting, everybody...</p>

One. And we were all very pleased about that. And, this will have an
impact, this bill, in addition to these other parts and the early
voting. Because 29,200 UNC students just at Chapel Hill alone will be
disadvantaged. And 12,500 in just my community college in Durham, in
Chapel Hill, and Orange County, will be disadvantaged. And why we would
want to disadvantage our young voters, those who are going to be sitting
here someday, those who are going to be making the public policy that we
are making. Why we would want to disadvantage them, by making it harder
for them.
So, to that end, Mr President, I'm sending forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, can I have you send forward your amendment?
The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird you are recognized to debate the bill. Or, your
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr President. What we are going to do is then restore this to
where we were before. So that we're back to the second Tuesday, Thursday
before an election. So that we have, again, enough time that my
students, and all students across the state and the military, and
everybody else has enough time, because we know that it has worked, and
that over 75% of the population would like to have that advantage. So, I
urge your support of this amendment. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Debate Amendment number 7.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We thank Senator Kinnaird for bringing forth her amendment. This issue
has been addressed in providing additional hours under the Stein's
amendment, in actually offering some additional time, based on the
flexibility in the county. And on the state board of elections, to
provide the opportunities for more satellite locations to meet the needs
of everyone of the one hundred counties and the population within those
counties. There is no need to change what we've already got. We've got a
good plan in this bill, and I urge you to oppose Amendment 7.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak a second time, because I wasn't clear what this does. When it
scene sets, which we would say, well, let's find out what works in your
bill, we're putting a scene set on it so that we can find how this would
work, and then it goes back to where it was.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion and further debate. Hearing now before the Senate is
the passage of Amendment 7. All in favor will vote Aye, all opposed will
vote no. 5 seconds will be allowed for voting, and the clerk will record
the vote.
Sixteen having voted in the affirmative, and 32 in the negative, the
amendment fails. The bill is back before the Senate.

Mr President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Graham, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Voting is one of the most fundamental and cherished rights for all
citizens. For me, it is intellectually dishonest to say that this bill
is about election reform. It's not about restoring integrity to the
voting places of North Carolina. Integrity has already been established.
It's not about providing voting transparency, transparency has been
established. It's not about making sure we don't have any political
games being played, games are being played as we speak. It's not about
providing confidence, honesty, integrity, and trust in government. Trust
is being lost as we speak. It's not about what other states are doing
across the country, they're.</p>

doing the same thing we are doing.  Deny access for people to vote.
It's not about students, not knowing if they preregister at 16, they
can't vote until 18.  It's about hurting and taking away the right to
vote, for the elderly across Carolina, for those who are poor, for the
people of color, and students.  It's about impacting urban communities
throughout North Carolina, whether it is in Mecklenburg, or Gilford, or
Forsyth. Awake a New Hanover county where a lot of people go to vote on
election day. They will be severely impacted. For an example last year a
Mecklenburg county 280,000 citizens or 62% of voters, early voted.  On
election day only 170,00 folks voted.  To cut back early voting on
election day will severely impact Mecklenburg county.  It will cost
money it will require additional voting sites and locations, and it will
disrupt voting on that day.  I predict it will happen in all urban
counties across North Carolina.  Many are home by coincidence, just
happen to be democratic.  Probably just a coincidence.  It's not just
about creating longer lines, buying new equipment, section 2 claims, and
other things brought by this bill.  Why in the world would we want to
end straight party voting.  By coincidence, maybe because democratic
voters do that.  Why would we want to cut down the length of time for
people to vote.  Senator Ford is correct, we should be expanding
opportunities, for people to vote.  Why in the world do we want to end
same-day registering and voting, and why are we picking on the kids.
Pages in this body come every week sense January, they are 15 and 16
years old.  They are seeing government in action.  They can get a
drivers license, probational drivers license.  We're graduating
privileges but yet they can't preregister to vote because somehow it
just gets confusing between 16 and 18.  Why in the world would we not
allow college students in North Carolina to show their college ID's.
We're talking about credited university's, we are talking about White
Forest, Duke, Johnson City Smith, Winston Sam State. Why can't these
college students use their ID's to be eligible to vote.  We're raising
more money by this bill.  Major companies can contribute more money but
the people get less access.  This bill goes against everything we should
stand for. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brock for what purpose do you rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Graham are you open for question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] None at this time thank you sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Graham does not yield. Senator Graham you have the floor. [SPEAKER

Americans, as North Carolinians. The basic right to wake up whether it's
two weeks before election day or on the election day and not have to
worry about artificial barriers in my way to vote.</p>

Thank you Mr. President. Senators and Senator Graham you’re long on
oratory, and short on facts. You need to take a look at what Georgia did
when they passed their demographically a lot like North Carolina. Have a
higher minority population then we do, nullifies the demographics are
about the like. Right Senator Goolsby? Check what happened after that
2012 voter ID Law. See if it didn't go up, more so for minorities even
then the whites, it's a fact. That's not rhetoric, that's not playing to
the crowd and the TV cameras, that's a fact. A overwhelming majority of
minority voters favor voter ID. That is a fact. A overwhelming majority
of voters in general favor voter ID. Voter ID you are wanting to know
why we are doing this bill. And the people that I talk to say why in the
world haven't you done this bill. 35 other states have and they're
getting good results. You name a couple of states that I just ask you to
check the one closest to us with the, the demographics most like us. And
see what results are. Voting increased in all sectors, all races,
greatly ever since then. That's a fact. And if you, if anyone thinks
that proving who you are is gonna disenfranchise anybody, and we're
gonna give them an ID, so Sundra I won't yield. If someone is gonna give
them an ID, and they still say they can't vote, that's foolishness.

I finish you can ask all you want to Senator Stein. I've heard about 15
minutes of it, and I'm a give you only 5. The people I hear from wanna
know why in the world we haven't done this, to get voter integrity out
there. And you say well there's only a couple of cases Senator Stein. If
you don't check it you ain't gonna detect. We don't know how many
thousands of cases, and one day registration you think it's such a great
idea to have mobs, and mobs of people up there that have never bothered
to register in a huge election. And they wanna come in on Election Day
and register to vote, and then you gotta deal with that provisionally,
and check all those out. That creates havoc, that greats the opportunity
for fraud and everything else. If you don't think enough about voting to
make sure you're registered, it used to be 30 days in advance Senators,
until recently. This is good common sense voter integrity election law.
And I'm proud that we can offer this bill and not a single soul will be
disenfranchised. What it does</p>

(SPEAKER CHANGES) Senator Parmon for what purpose do you rise?
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Thank you Mr. President, to speak on the bill.
(SPEAKER CHANGES) You have the floor.
(SPEAKER CHANGES) As I sit here and listen at this debate, I reflect on
the number of years as a young woman helping to prepare African
Americans to vote. So, as I sit here this is very disheartening for me,
and as I listen to us talk about photo ID, that’s no longer an issue in
this bill. House Bill 589 is purely and simply a voter suppression bill.
And as we celebrate it, I thought about Representative (??) today to
celebrate on the House side the good deed, the good deed we thought, but
us justly compensating victims we created in sterilization, I thought
about how closely we are coming to doing that again today. As elected
officials, officials and policy makers, we are taking it upon ourselves
to pick winners and losers in this State, by creating barriers to voting
and to the Constitutional Right of the citizens of this State.  I’ve
heard us compared to Georgia. I’ve heard us compared to Florida,
Pennsylvania. But I want to remind everyone of us that we are North
Carolinians. And one young lady sent me a text that say, I am not from
Georgia. I’m not from Florida. I’m from North Carolina. And I want my
Constitutional Right to be recognized. I do not want you all to give
barriers and to put up barriers that will make it difficult for me to
vote in the State of North Carolina. And I will tell you, as an African
American, as a woman, I fit most of the categories that people talk
about when we talk about the barriers. And I remember too many African
Americans that I’ve had to work with to encourage. Elderly people, that
have for years were afraid to vote. And now, we fear again, creating
confusion and  chaos, about a Constitutional Right. This is immoral.
It’s evil. And it’s unnecessary. And I’ll tell you I am offended as a
North Carolinian, and as an African American woman, to be discussing
here today on this floor, barriers to suppress the vote. Thank you.
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Further discussion and further debate.
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Mr. President
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Senator Robinson, for what purpose do you rise?
(SPEAKER CHANGES) To speak to the bill.
(SPEAKER CHANGES) You have the floor.
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Voting is a Constitutional Right. And anyone or
anything that stands in the way of that suppresses that right. It is my
position that House Bill 589 stands in the way of many who exercise, or
want to exercise, their right to vote. Different from you Senator
Tillman, a large majority of my constituents are African American. And I
would say that 99.9% oppose this bill. I also came from Georgia 45 years
ago. And I came out of a segregated South that denied my mother, my
father, my grandparents and everyone else the opportunity to vote. That
is a treasured and a precious Right, that in this bill you’re trying to
take from people. I want all of you to get a copy of the recent
biography of former Supreme Court Justice Henry Frye, the first African.

American elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives in the
20th century. Who served in this Senate from 81 to 82 and then 1999 and
became the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in North Carolina, the
first African-American. Justice Frye is one of my constituents, he’s one
of my friends, and he’s a church member where I’ve been a member for 40
years or more. In Justice Frye’s own words, he talks of how he was
denied the right to vote in Ellerbe, North Carolina. After graduating as
a valedictorian from Mineral Springs High School, he moved to Greensboro
to attend North Carolina A&amp;T State University where he graduated
summa cum laude. He was a second lieutenant in the United States Air
Force and rose to the rank of Captain. When Frye returned to Ellerbe,
North Carolina, to vote, he was required to pass a written test to
register to vote. They did not approve his right to vote. He had to
return, but his failure of the test motivated Justice Frye to become an
attorney so that he could prevent others from enduring the same
humiliation. Why, you say, do I recite this? First, so some of you
understand some of the history, the bad history of this state in terms
of voter suppression, and the struggle that many of my predecessors had
in obtaining that right. Secondly, to extenuate the fact that voting
rights had been denied for centuries in this country, and thirdly to say
that years ago the right to vote, the right to deny anyone’s right to
vote was based on the color of one’s skin under the guise of literacy. I
want you to read Justice Frye’s biography so you, too, will learn and
understand one of the ugly parts of history, one of the ugly parts of
North Carolina’s history, but hopefully you’ll understand the mistakes
that you’re repeating in this legislation. This legislative year becomes
a new day in the history of North Carolina. House Bill 589 denies the
right to vote based on a valid photo id, based on your acceptable
standards. Probably one of the most appalling sections is Section 2.2.
The reasonable resemblance to termination which says if the election
official determines the voter’s photo id does not enter resemblance to
the voter, the judges of the election precinct would be required to rule
on the matter. Now, I’ve been a Chief Judge, one for about 10 years.
Now, Senator Clark the other days showed me his acceptable photo id, and
I would say as a previous Chief Judge that his former appearance, still
dark skin, young, elongated face with the bit of black hair does not
really look like him today. He has a bit of aging in his face and a
little grey on that head. So an election person in his precinct might
determine that Senator Clark is just another young black man in
Fayetteville, perpetrating someone who desires to vote. As a matter of
fact Senator Clark might say that my grey hair does not resemble my
photo some years back at Bennett College. How appalling this is, you
say, but how appalling is this legislation that takes this great state
of North Carolina back to the days when voting was denied to my parents,
grandparents, and many of your parents? And even when I fought for the
rights of my people to vote and to register them, do you want to return
to the Jim Crow South? Recent data shows that more than 318,000
registered voters in North Carolina lack a photo id. It is no surprise
that the voter requirement disproportionately affects African-Americans.
We’re 23 percent of all registered voters, but 34 percent of those
without a North Carolina photo id. We, too, as women are
disproportionately affected. We make up 54 percent of voters, but</p>

percent of those without a state issued photo ID.  Democrats, of course
you know this, are nearly 3 times as likely not to have a photo ID as
Republicans.  Nowhere in this bill is a photo ID required for an
absentee ballot, however.  Mr. President, I’d like to send forth an
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robison, you may send forth your amendment.
Clerk read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson, you may explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.  Thank you Mr. President.  This amendment would
assure that anyone who shows up at the polls without one of the approved
state photo IDs or whatever those requirements are, and have to leave to
go downtown somewhere or to a DMV and get a photo ID.  I know a lot of
elderly people that I served as chief judge in my precinct who would
have to do that because all they have is a bible with their names on it
and birthdate.  This would mean that they would have the same
opportunity as anyone using an absentee ballot, the same opportunity.
It means that they wouldn’t have to go down and try to come back again
and vote.   Instead they could use one of the same items that absentee
ballots are able to use, and you see those listed here and I don’t have
to recite those to you.   If it’s good enough for people to use who are
sending in absentee ballots to get counted, it ought to be good enough
for people who come to voting sites without their photo IDs and they can
vote that same day.  I commend the amendment to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Goolsby, purposely arise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson, yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President.  How many North Carolinians
did you say are without IDs and would require them from the state?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The data that I received says 318,000 registered
voters lack ID and that came from a Charlotte Observer article.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Ma’am. Would she yield for another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have it back in 2005 when Georgia went through the
same exercise, the liberal newspapers said that there would be 600,000
that would be disenfranchised and require IDs.  Are you aware of that,
Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure I am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And are you aware also Ma’am, further question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] When the facts came in, since 2007 when Georgia
actually cleared this law through the courts, that 290,611 IDs over the
last 7 years have actually been issued.  Are you aware of that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, as a matter of fact Senator Goolsby, my sister is
the manager of one of those precincts.    And are you aware also, as I
answer you, that a lot of those folks who actually do not vote are not
being counted?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Ma’am.  Would you agree with me that 600,000,
which was originally alleged, versus the 29,611 is a far cry from the
initial number put out by the liberal press?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, but are you aware also of what the current number
of unregistered voters is in Georgia and registered voters as opposed to
those who have photo IDS?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ll yield for a question. Yes Ma’am, go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I already asked you the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, I’m not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re not.  Ok. Do you have another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do, one more.  Will she yield for one more question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Can we go through the chair to ask and answer
questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I apologize, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Goolsby do you have a question of Senator
Robinson?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are you aware, Ma’am, that from 2006 before voter ID
was implemented in Georgia through 2010 that black voter participation
rose about 34%, and that Hispanic voter participation rose by 67% and
white participation rose by only 12 once photo ID in Georgia was
actually established, my home state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I am aware.   May I ask him a question too?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Goolsby yields, yes.

…to the 2000 years, the majority of voters in Georgia were white
Americans?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, ma’am, I’m aware. Yes, I am. Will you yield for a
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ma’am the years I’m talking about are actually 2006,
the year before voter ID was implemented in Georgia, through 2010. We’re
talking both the 2008 and 2010 election. That is the first year that
President Obama ran, and then the off year. The voter participation in
Georgia, with minorities, blacks rose 44%, Hispanics rose 67%, white
voter participation only went up 12%. Aren’t those good numbers for
minorities? Would you at least agree with that, Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You know Senator Goolsby, I don’t agree with you.
Because it ought to be 100%.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m answering, Mr. Chair. It really should be 100%
participation by minorities because minorities are the ones who were
denied the right to vote for centuries in this country. And their rights
were suppressed. And you again are doing the very same thing so that you
will not have the turnout of minorities in the next election.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Graham, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask Senator Robinson a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you represent anybody in Georgia?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, my parents, my mother still lives there, but I
represent North Carolinians.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, we’ve
heard a lot of numbers tossed out there today. I guess it’s a good
start. Three hundred thousand individuals don’t have IDs issued in the
state, particularly state issued IDs from the DMV. I think we’re missing
out. The first fact is when you look at identification cards and
driver’s licenses, first the DMV issues more than the adult population
of the state of North Carolina. So there are more out there than the
census say we have people over 16 in the state of North Carolina that
exist.
Now there is a question as to whether or not those match up with the
state voter database. The state voter database would also indicate that
in 2012, eight thousand two hundred and twelve people voted who are 112
years old. There is called legacy data in the system. Everyone who was
registered to vote prior to my junior year of high school, 1993, is a
legacy system, and were not required to have full data in order to be
registered to vote.
So therefore they out in blank data systems. Such as 1-1-1900 as their
date of birth, when they upgraded the system. When those do not match
with the DMV numbers now, i.e. the person was not born in 1900, it is
showing that there is not a match in the database. That person doesn’t
have an ID. That’s simply not the case. The numbers are vastly inflated.
And we’ll talk about IDs. I know this has kind of been here. I brought
my community college ID, where I teach. I just asked the first question
for anyone else here. What does the Mayland Community College ID look
like? What does a Western Carolina ID look like? What does East
Carolina’s look like?
Now if you were to add all that’s been proposed previously to 55
community colleges, 16 universities, 36 independent colleges. One
hundred and seven IDs that you’re asking every precinct worker to be
able to identify if they come through. That’s why we’ve limited this.
The individuals know what a passport looks like, or a driver’s license
in the state of North Carolina. I also say that this same ID says
nothing…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure, I’ll yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Senator Hise will yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein you yield? Uh, Senator Hise do you
yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Uh-huh.

...text of the 2010. They implemented voter ID and the voter population,
or at least the percentage of voting, by African-Americans went up,
therefore one caused the other. So we can't really say that, right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, I think that you have shown it is
different to say there is a cause, but I have seen no other explanation
for the correlation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll give you that, then. Georgia, the increase was
17%, from 2006 to 2008, I mean from 2006 to 2010, in terms of of
African-Americans voting. In North Carolina, the same time frame, we
didn't have voter ID; the percentage of African-Americans voting went up
40%. That's 23% more, so what's the cause for that?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]There is a correlation when you look simply at the state
of Georgia between the increased IDs and the time period they have
passed voter ID. In the state of North Carolina, we had no such
stimulus. So if there is an increase that is attributable to that, that
40% had we passed this at that time, could have been 60%, 65%.
Correlations do have a direction and a positive correlation would
indicate a positive correlation.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]Senator Clark, to what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]We have just seen that in the state of North Carolina,
voter participation by African-Americans from 2006 to 2010 went up by
23% more than it did in the state of Georgia because North Carolina did
not have the voter id. So if we are going to say that correlation does
imply causality, I would say that the reason it went up so much more in
North Carolina, was because we did not have the voter ID.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]Senator Davis from Greene, to what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]To see if Senator Hise would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]Senator Hise, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]Thanks, Senator Hise. What I want to do is just shine
some light perhaps, and just get your response. Outside of serving here
I've actually been in education, higher education for fifteen years, and
actually as a sociologist. The first thing I would like to clearly
clarify, in terms of methodology, in the past conversation, correlation
and causations are two different methodologies. I would like to
establish that correlation is the relationship, causation is cause and
effect. Even though this has been part of the conversation that has come
up a couple of times already in this chamber, and I've heard it before,
when we look at the results in Georgia, I would concede,based on the
facts as reported, a 44% increase amongst the minority community.
However it would appear to be a loose use of the data to draw a
conclusion of causation, the cause being in a lawless past and the
effect being more minorities therefore voted. There is in the world of
research what's called the Hawthorne Effect, when a subject may be aware
they are actually being under investigation, they may perform
differently--
[SPEAKER CHANGE]Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]Senator Apodoka, to what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]Are we going to have a question sometime, or are we
going to have a dissertation?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]Senator Davis, please get to your question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]I will, Mr. President. Long story short, what we don't
know in terms of the intensity, is were they responding because of their
opposition to the law because advocacies rallied, were they opposition
because they favored the law, and my question is, would you not agree,
that more longitudinal study examining this over time would be a more
concise way of drawing a conclusion of causation?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]Excuse me.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]Senator Hise, you are allowed to answer the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]There are some absolutes in studies. First of all, one
of those is that more data, in a longitudinal study, always leads to
better conclusions. That's the nature of it. Although at some point you
get to</p>

causality, it's impossible. You can however prove that a correlation
exists. In this study, to be reported as a correlation, you were in the
probability that it's less than one in a thousand that it could not have

made that we are going to go ahead and vote on this amendment and then
I'll recognize Senator Stein to speak after the amendment has been taken

number 9 to house bill 589. All in favor will vote Aye. All opposed will
vote no. 5 seconds will be allowed for voting and the clerk will record
the vote. Before we announce the vote, senator Walters and senator
Curtis have both been excused for the rest of the session. 14 voting in

North Carolina has had straight party voting and is one of 12 states to
still do so. In 2012 1.4 million Democrats, 1.1 million Republicans and
25,000 Libertarians voted a straight party ticket. 56% of the voters
voting in that election. 2.6 million almost of a 4.5 million turnout
voted a straight party ticket. Contrary to the description of these
voters as low information voters, these voters are often supporting the
candidate slate of their respective parties. In addition this is a major
convenience to our voters. 80% of black voters and 45% of white voters,
approximately, vote, use straight party voting in 2012. In a local
election year where there is a partisan election it will take the voters
almost 7 times longer to mark, on average 7 races that would be on those
ballots. And during state election years it will take these voters 17
times longer. North Carolina is amongst a third or fourth, 3 to 4 states
with the longest ballots and the longest number of elected offices on
our ballots. We are making it take longer to vote at the same time that
we are cutting the early voting period and we have new election
officials all over the state due to the changes in the party of the
governor. And when we don’t really yet know how these early voting
locations will be expanded and to what extent. There are two documents
on the dashboard that will show the racial disparity involved in
eliminating state party voting and the diversity involved in the use of
state party voting. If we could have the first, the scatter shot graph
on the dashboard please for the members. If you will look at this
scatter shot graph, and you may have to scroll it up to see, the dots on
the graph indicate the numbers of black voters turning out in the 2012
election. The left axis, is the, is the number of, is the percentage of
black voters in each precinct. The horizontal axis at the bottom goes up
to 100%. That would be the percent of straight party voting. You would
see the significant trend of the graph to the right indicating the large
number of black voters who vote a straight party ticket. And also it
indicates some 40% on average, 40 to 45 percent of white voters who mark
a straight party ticket. So both, there’s a racial disparity involved
and also significant diversity involved at the same. The major thing to
note is that this prop, eliminating straight party voting will result in
longer lines and voting times in precincts across the board first of
all. And aggressively so, egregiously so in predominately black
precincts. Can we see the next chart please? The next chart on pages 1
through 3 and you can just scroll it. If you look at this chart first
the first several pages are the high number, the top number of
precincts, top 100 precincts with the highest percentage of straight
party voting. If you look at the last two columns, it says percent SP,
that’s the percent of straight party voting and then the final column is
the percent of black turnout. Again correlation, you can see the high
correlation between straight party voting and the percent of black
turnout in the top 100 precincts. And that would be pages 1 through 3 I
think it is. If you scroll through pages 1 through 3 those would be the
top 100 precincts. You see the high correlation even at the end of the
first 100 precincts you’re just getting to some 60 and 70 percent
numbers. Mostly in the 80% range. Then pages 4 through 6 you see the
precincts with the lowest, the low, the lowest 100 precincts where
straight party voting occurs, those percentages. Again even those
percentages in the 38% range and going down and then the low.</p>

In some instances almost no percentage of black voter turnout in those
precincts. So, there is a high correlation between straight party voting
and the participation of black voters, and eliminating straight party
voting will result in a significant racial disparity. Mr. President, may
I ask Senator Rucho a question?
[speaker changes]
Senator Rucho do you yield?
[speaker changes]
Yes
[speaker changes]
Senator Rucho, my question is were you aware of the disproportionate use
of straight party voting by black voters as you were considering this
revision in the bill?
[speaker changes]
I was never aware of the chart that you have before you. I have
confidence in every voter in the state of North Carolina to choose
people that they believe are the ones they wish to vote for regardless
of party, and also I'm very concerned about the fact that a lot of the
non-partisan and down ballot candidates are ignored and that is really
not the way we would like to have a democracy occur in North Carolina.
[speaker changes]
Follow up, Mr President?
[speaker changes]
Mr. Rucho, do you yield to another question?
[speaker changes]
Yes.
[speaker changes]
I was wondering given this information, and there is probably even more
information available about this correlation, are you willing to
reconsider the elimination of straight party voting as you see the
significant negative racial impact it may have, and then the resulting
longer voting times in these precincts where 80 some percent of the
people in the precinct will be taking seventeen times longer in the
state elections to vote than would currently be the case in our present
voting situation?
[speaker changes]
I don't agree with your premise, and secondly I don't look at race as
who's going to vote, what we're trying to do is make sure we have an
equal opportunity for every single person to vote and it's not designed
on race in any manner, and that's not even what we are even talking
about here. What we're saying is this is a fair, honest way to provide
everyone an opportunity to vote and that is exactly what it is all
about.
[speaker changes]
I would like to finish my explanation of the amendment, Mr. President?
[speaker changes]
Go ahead, Senator Bryant.
[speaker changes]
In wrapping up, I think it is important for you to see that there is a
significant negative racial impact in the elimination of straight party
voting, under the Voting Rights Act, even though we don't have to have
pre-clearance in our target [inaudible speech]..., under Section 2 the
issue of a disproportionate impact on black voters is still going to be
an important issue that has to be reviewed, and would still provide some
Constitutional concerns, so I'm asking the members to please vote to
adopt this amendment because of the negative racial impact and the
Constitutional and voting right issues implicated in that. But also,
because of the efficiency for all voters, 45% of white voters who will
have to take 17 times longer to mark a ballot, requiring more time etc.
and then the 80 some percent of black voters in particularly
significantly black precincts that will be taking 17 times and 7 times
longer. And for those reasons I would that ask that you would please
vote to adopt this amendment. Thank you.
[speaker changes]
Mr. President.
[speaker changes]
Senator Newton, for what purpose do you rise?
[speaker changes]
To see if Senator Rucho would yield for a question?
[speaker changes]
Senator Rucho, do you yield?
[speaker changes]
Yes sir, I do.
[speaker changes]
Thank you Senator Rucho. Senator Bryant just gave us a lot of hyperbole
about straight party voting and minorities and so forth, and I want to
ask you, as I read the section on straight party voting being
eliminated, is there anything in there that says that minorities can't
vote in the elections?
[speaker changes]
No sir, and there is no where throughout the entire bill, it is an
opportunity for every single person in the state of North Carolina that
is registered to do so.
[speaker changes]
Follow-up?
[speaker changes]
Does the gentleman yield?
[speaker changes]
Yes, I do.
[speaker changes]
As I read the bill, Senator Rucho, aren't there a total of 11 different
days that a registered voter, especially a minority voter, could go to
vote, do I count that right? Ten days of early voting and one day on
election day?
[speaker changes]
That is accurate, yes sir.
[speaker changes]
Is there anything in the bill that says a minority voter can't vote on
those 11 days?
[speaker changes]
No sir, there is an equal opportunity for every single voter to vote
during any of those.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman like to ask another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you yield, Senator Rucho?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Rucho. On the straight party voting, is there
anything in this bill on ending the straight party voting that
eliminates the party label for a partisan election? In other words, if
it's a partisan election like say a state Senator's race or a Governor's
race or something like that, if there's a Democratic nominee wouldn't it
be denominated as a Democratic nominee?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just like it's always been: Rs, Ds, Ls, and the like.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there anything in the bill that would prevent a minority voter from
being able to identify which party they wanted to vote for on any one of
these individual elections?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not a thing. Same as it is today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And... One last follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Rucho. So if a minority voter wanted to vote for all
of one party, would they still be able to identify all those candidates
and check or punch the button for each one of those candidates?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They would be able to identify the party affiliation of every one of the
candidates and vote accordingly on their wish.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. May I speak to the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Senator Bryant, I know that you weren't
suggesting that... that... the fact that I filed a bill identical to
this language for the last two years to eliminate straight party
voting... I know that you and I know each other well so I know you
weren't suggesting that I would do that for a reason of suppressing
minority votes. Because I certainly would never do such a thing. I
certainly was not aware of any data, even if it's accurate, that would
somehow keep a minority voter from voting for whoever they chose to
vote.  The reason I filed legislation in the past, which your amendment
would essentially take out of this bill that exact same language... The
reason I did that is because I think people should vote for the person
and not the party. You and I come from the same neck of the woods. The
Democratic Party has been very dominant in our neck of the woods,
wouldn't you agree to that? I think you would agree to that?  It's the
home of... the area of two governors. Jim Hunt was there, four-time
governor from my... I guess what you'd say my backyard, or maybe I'm in
his backyard, depending on how you want to look at it.  Pretty dominant.
 In fact... in fact... back in the day, Republicans used to get dragged
away from the polls and get... get... beat up pretty good if they dared
to show their face to vote back in the day. So... Some people back in
the day other than minorities also knew about voter suppression. That's
a real, recorded fact. I know people that that happened to back in the
day. And that's not right.  Voter suppression is wrong. I'll be the
first one to say that. Republican, Democrat, black, white, male, female,
whatever -- if you're a registered voter, you're legal, you're entitled
to vote, nobody should be intimidating you.  There shouldn't be any
thugs there at the polls, whether they be Black Panthers or anybody
else, keeping people from voting.  Nobody should be suppressed from
voting.  But it boggles my mind how in the world we can take the idea
that, if you're not allowed to punch one button and vote for all one
party regardless of how qualified or unqualified some of those nominees
are, that somehow you're suppressing minority votes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I take umbrage to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I don't yield for a question at this time, but afterward, Senator
Parmon, out of respect for you I'll certainly yield for a question. I
take umbrage to that. I hope Senator Bryant understands why I might get
my hackles up a little bit about that.  I think people should vote for
the person and not the party. Now everybody that knows me in this
chamber knows I'm a loyal Republican. I fight hard for my party, just
like all the... all the good Democrats do.  But there is... there has
hardly been, I'll admit it, there's hardly been an election to go by
that there hasn't been at least one Democrat that I voted for.  At least
one.  I don't need a straight party vote to pick out my candidates. And
we're going to try to slap a racist label on the idea that people ought
to vote for the person and not the party?  We've heard a lot of that
today. We've heard too much of that today.</p>

The ideal that we're going keep our elections honest and fair and that
we might actually ask people to think about who they're voting for
instead of what party is somehow amounts to racism. We hear a lot of
stuff in this chamber we hear a lot of stuff in this chamber its
probably time for us to ?? down the rhetoric get real about all this I
urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr.
President[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe that Senator Parmon had a question
for Senator Newton. Senator Newton do you yield [SPEAKER CHANGES]I
do[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. President Senator Newton I heard you
talk about racism and certainly I know how you feel cause I lived it,
worked it, tried to reverse it but my question is if you don't want to
deal with the fact that there many deals with African Americanother
people not only African American but other people being impeded in their
voting by having to go down and select by name the time element I heard
Senator Bryant say 17 times as long to vote in this state election does
that ?? just think about the time does that cause you some
concern?[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. President No it actually doesn't
because there's so many different ways that we can vote we can vote by
absentee we can sit at home and take our time, and pick all the
candidates out, I worked many polls, I seen many people walk in with the
sample ballot and work through very quickly and I've seen other people
with same sample ballot who sat there for 15 minutes trying to make sure
they had it exactly the way they wanted it. I think it gives me no
concern at all,  [SPEAKER CHANGES]follow-up [SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator I
just want to say to you while we coming here and we think we act with
authority of all knowledge different cultures in different incidence I
know many people in my community 70,80 90 years old cannot read the
complete ballot and that's no fault of their own it was a time they
couldn't read it was against the law and here again were talking about
elderly people I remember just last election taking 103 year old woman
to the polls who was frightened to death to vote for her first time so
when we come in and think that we have all the answers we need to
consider all the facts so when you say someone that's elderly  that got
to take time and go down a ballot that's inconsiderate and it's
suppressing that voter and let me tell you many elderly folk will not be
able to do it[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. President[SPEAKER CHANGES]Sorry I
thought it was a question[SPEAKER CHANGES]I did too Senator Graham
you're recognized[SPEAKER CHANGES]Speak to you in a moment drag away
from the polls poll taxes African Americans who were beaten  for wanting
to vote they were discouraged by various tactics and means not to vote
so I'm just a little maybe sensitive based on history that we have to
protect today Representative Butterfield said earlier today about her 91
year old mother that she had to be able to read the preamble to vote.
Today, you can go through the ballot and vote for the man and not the
party without changing a thing if you want to do that you can do it
today I choose to do that myself because there are some people at the
local level on the other side I voted before I want good government
democrat, republican, or independent so you can vote for the man today
and not the party.  But I think it is</p>

Representative: …intellectual dishonest to say when you look at the
facts that she brought out, that African Americans do not vote, at
heart, straight ballots fully, and that would impact their votes. I
think to say that, that should not be counted, that it does not exist,
that it is just hyperbole, is just intellectually dishonest. I think it
is, and again, this is nothing new. All we have to do is look throughout
the county and see some special proposals…
Speaker: Senator Rucho, what is your question?
Representative: Please do not call me Apodaka.
[laughter]
Speaker: It has been a long day. Senator Rucho, please state your
concern.
Representative: When is Senator Graham going to get off the speech for
Congress and actually talk about this amendment?
Speaker: Let me answer that question. Senator Nesbitt, I will be right
with you. Senator, will you stick to the amendment that is before us.
Representative: Mr. President, I am speaking to the amendment on the
floor. I do not need to be reminded about doing that.
Speaker: Continue your remarks.
Representative: If anyone is out of order it is Senator Rucho: that is
who needs to be reminded to be about order in the chamber, not me.
Speaker: Please continue with your remarks on the amendment.
Representative: I treat everyone in this chamber with respect, even if I
disagree with you, I will respect you and your opinion. I expect nothing
less from anyone here. It is a fact, based on what was presented by
Senator Bryant, that indeed Senator Apodaka, that African Americans
voted in high proportions more for….I am looking at you, you are a
friend…you did give gifts
[laughter]
Speaker: Senator Apodaka, for what purpose do you rise?
Representative: To see if will yield for a question, he may want to on
this one.
Representative: Yes sir.
Representative: Senator Graham, I heard you in your opening remarks,
when you talked about voting for these amendments, about voting ‘for the
man’ – you never once mentioned voting for a woman. I just wanted to
mention that.
Representative:: ‘Man’ in a universal term.
[laughter]
Representative: …and women.
Speaker: Continue Mr. Brown.
Representative: It is late Mr. President.
Speaker: Amen.
Representative: The point I am trying to make, Mr. President, is this:
straight party voting does divide yet another artificial barrier for
African Americans who choose not, Senator Newton, take the time, as I
do, to go through the ballot, but when going there, pull the lever
democratically to vote and get out of the way to allow the next person
in line to do the same.
Speaker: Senator Bryant for what purpose do you rise?
Representative: To speak on the amendment  second time.
Speaker: Senator Bryant, you have the floor.
Representative: Thank you Mr. President. I just wanted to clarify one
thing. I was very – I worked to be very careful when I am talking here
to you all about issues of racial and cultural difference because I know
how easy it is for it to be taken personally, or in the wrong way, but I
was very careful to use the words, “disproportional use,” “negative
racial impact,”  “racial disparity.” The reason I went to the trouble to
present the charts and tables was because I knew it was not a conscious
intention of everybody in here to propose a policy that would have a
negative impact on purpose. So, with that in mind, I presented the data.
I am not suggesting that this is a racist, in the “-ist” sense, in that
word, proposal. That is not what I am trying to suggest. I am trying to
make it clear that it has a negative racial impact so that everyone can
keep that in mind. It is the impact that would have</p>

Speaker Changes: Further discussion, further debate on the Amendment.
Speaker Changes: Mr. President?
Speaker Changes: Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
Speaker Changes: Thank you. To debate the amendment.
Speaker Changes: You have the floor.
Speaker Changes: As a preliminary manner, Senator Bryant was just
pointing out a factual matter about the use of this convenience. And it
is a factual matter that approximately 80% of African Americans use it.
Approximately 40 - 45% of whites use it. That's just a fact and it's a
racial impact to change it. You can have the most innocent purpose
intent in the world to change this but it is having a racial impact. The
way I wanted to go with my comments is to remind people how many people
use straight-party voting in North Carolina. It's 2.5 million North
Carolinians. 56 percent, the majority of people in this state, choose
the convenience of straight-party voting. What you all are saying is we
want to deny the people, 2.5 million, the convenience they choose to
utilize. My wife and I intend to vote together. She liked to fill in
every bubble. I don't. What I do, Senator Newton, because I occasionally
split my ballot too, is I will go straight-party Democrat and every time
I want to go for a Republican, I mark the Republican. My wife takes
about 10 minutes longer than I do. What you all are cosigning to the
people of North Carolina that 2.5 million take ten minutes more. That's
416,000 extra hours it's going to take the same number of people to vote
in the booth and it's going to back up that line out the back of the
chamber, out the back of the voting area. So we've compressed early
voting. We're taking away a convenience that 2.5 million North
Carolinians choose to access. By the way, 1.1 million Republicans
appreciate the opportunity to do a srtraight-ticket for you all. I
encourage you to support this amendment.
Further discussion, further debate on the amendment?

To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robertson, you may debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I, too, appreciate the data that Senator Bryant shared. It is factual
regardless of how you take it, it’s factual data. I would say as well,
based on my own family history, I have an aunt who’s 98, one 95, and my
mother’s 91. Then my experience at the precinct where I worked, that a
lot of the folk who vote straight ticket are elderly. Black and white. A
lot of those same people have to use their bibles for identification.
Black and white. Even though I don’t have the statistics to support it
right now, I would go as far to say that those are the same folks who
could not read. I know that, historically for African-Americans, like
Senator Parmon said, they were denied the right to read and to write.
Different from my own grandparents who set up schools and taught a lot
of people. There were still a lot of folks who couldn’t write and who
had to mark that X. They were excited about exercising their right.
Whether the voter is republican or democrat and they’re elderly, when
they come to the polls to vote, if they have to check every box, you are
suppressing their right as well, too. I don’t think that’s what you
intend to do, but there are a lot of older people who want to vote, but
will be frightened, who will be scared away and who will be intimidated
when you tell them they don’t have a choice to vote straight ticket. But
that they have to vote by selecting ever box. It becomes a long day for
them, it’s tiring. It’s trying, and as you get older, you will see what
the situation becomes as your body begins to break down as well. It
becomes really a challenge to you being able to get out and exercise
your rights.

I’ve listened to a lot of discussion over the last hour or so, about
voting rights here in North Carolina. One thing I think back about was
my childhood growing up over in Durham where I saw so many people who
had never been registered to vote before become registered to vote. I’d
see them in knocking on their doors some days, make sure they got a ride
to the polls because the place you could register to vote back then was
at the precinct itself. People came into the precinct. There were
situations where people had to recite a provision of the constitution or
to prove certain degree of literacy before they could vote. One thing
which I saw which I was always very impressed with, was the fact that
after they voted for the first time, after they had exercised that very
sacred constitutional right, a sense of ownership in our election
system. A sense of pride. They would almost...</p>

Some of the problems that we have had, long lines at the polls. Back in
the early 90's we were having 3 and 4 hour lines at the polls. And we
were proactive about that, and we created early voting. It was
bipartisan when we created it, it was a good thig, it solved the
problem, and voters are better off for it. And we have done other things
to make it easier for people to vote.
Now the problem you've got with this bill, I'm gonna run through these
things with you, I cannot find anything in here that makes it easier for
anyone to vote. Everything you're doing in this bill makes it harder for
poor people to vote. And when you do that, we know that will suppress
the vote. You make them stand in the line for four hours, some of them
are going to go home. They aren't going to do it. You fix it to where
they can't register close to the election. Some of them aren't going to
think of it in time, so they aren't going to get registered, so they
won't vote.
Same day registration, I don't know of a single problem that we've had
with that. And it allows somebody who gets interested in the election to
come in there and vote, and that's a good thing. If they're involved,
and people coming in there if they weren't, but I don't think there's
been any, I've not heard it if there has.
The program where we went into the schools and taught civics, and
registered young kids to vote, that's a good thing. You're teaching them
about government and about civics and their responsibility, and voting
is part of that, and let's get you signed up and then you'll be ready to
vote when you turn 18. We're not going to do that anymore. We did
financial literacy in here and I supported us doing that to teach kids
how to balance a checkbook, how to do a basic thing, but were not going
to go in and get them ready to vote. Now, but we were.
Early voting I touched on a while ago. That is not broke. It just isn't
broken. The people, What little capacity is out there in early voting,
they're going to find because they're accelerating the number of people
that use it. And it's a relatively new thing. I can't remember the first
election we had, but it was around 2000. It hasn't been around that long
and the people who try it like it.
Not using student ID's. I got to tell you, when I was listening to the
debate about student ID's and while there were 50 of these colleges, and
I was looking, and in his hand was a photo ID. But it may not be right,
and it may be fraud, and it may be that somebody didn't do it, and it's
not protected. I don't know how to tell you this, but that sounds like
big brotherism to me. Everybody out here is not a thief or a crook. And
nobody is trying to break into a polling place. So if somebody is trying
to show you a photo ID to vote, it's probably accurate. So if we're
trying to identify people, make it as easy as possible to identify them,
and get that out of the way and then let them vote.
Straight party voting, and you heard it a while ago. By the way Senator
Stein, I don't believe I would have told that if I was you, about
splitting your ticket. That is a convenience for the voters. That's all
that is. And you heard how many people use it lots of people use it. Now
you make it 17 times longer to vote when you get there.
I think and we think that you're going to create lines by limiting early
voting like you're doing. We think that it's going to be difficult for
young people to vote under this bill. We think that you will make it
much more difficult for minorities and seniors to vote under this bill.
And all of these things will suppress the vote. And I don't know in this
state, once again I take everybody at their word, but in other states
these same tactics have been used to suppress the vote. They've got that
one gal on the TV saying they got voter ID passed that going to elect...</p>
