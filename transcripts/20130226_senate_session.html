[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, to send forth committee report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, you can send forth your committee report.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate bill 16, revoke license for passing stopped
school bus.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator ?? is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President, this was heard in J2, and it
was very well vetted, we had an amendment that changed this bill.
Initially, it was a 6 month revocation of your driving license, we
scaled that back to 30 days and then there was a few other changes but
it seemed to be unanimous and I would urge for your support. Just a note
to indicate to you the seriousness of this, in '98 until 2012 we have
passed over bills and laws relative to passing stopped school buses in
increasing importance etc.  But the number of incidents of passing
stopped school buses has escalated. In 2012, 647,500 vehicles passed
stopped school buses. That indicates the seriousness of this and this
will just be hopefully a wake up call and we'll begin to reduce the
incidents of this and there's been several children killed. This will
give the opportunity for schools to put cameras on these school buses.
One of my colleagues in the senate, Senator Tucker, had mentioned to me
an organization involving county where they're presently putting cameras
on school buses and they have gotten several convictions. Senator
Tucker, I appreciated the information, I've shared that with some of the
other districts and they're very interested. I know of no opposition to
this and I would urge your support and be happy to answer any questions,
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator. Is there any further discussion or
debate? Hearing none, the question for the Senate is the passage of the
committee's substitute to senate bill 16 on its second reading. All in
favor will vote aye, opposed will vote no, five seconds will be allowed
for the voting and the clerk will record the vote. 48 having voted in
the affirmative and 0 voting in the negative, committee substitute
senate bill 16 passes its second reading without objection, will be read
a third time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] North Carolina general assembly enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing
none, all in favor of the passage of the committee's substitute senate
bill 16 on its third reading will say aye. Opposed no. The ayes have it
and committee's substitute senate bill 16 passes third reading and will
be sent to the House. Senate bill 76, clerk will read.

<p id="010:00">
Representative: …this is a.. the cord is a little short – we will figure
that out later on. My colleagues, it is my pleasure to stand here before
you today and talk about this very important jobs act. NC needs job and
America needs energy. It is the reason we have put this legislation
together. In the face of this high employment and soaring energy prices,
this is why we need to move forward with this bill. NC needs a vibrant
energy sector, and we need this economic development. Why do we have
this bill? What does it do? Well, it does a number of key things. Many
of you that were here before – remember when we passed legislation last
session for senate bill 820, which brought NC forward and started to
move us forward in the energy business. It developed our natural gas
resources. Many people do not realized that there is great potential
here in NC. There are estimates that as much as 42 trillion cubic feet
of natural gas under our feet here in NC. Now what does 42 trillion
cubic feet mean? Well, let me give you an example. This is comparable to
the [xx] in TX. This is as large, or larger, than the [xx] in AR. This
is a significant amount of gas, of energy for this state. A significant
amount of economic development potential for our state:  thousands of
jobs. So what does this bill do? It continues the work we did on senate
bill 820. What it does is set a firm date, let me rephrase that. It sets
a clear time frame of when the moratorium for hydraulic fracturing will
be lifted in NC. This date comes almost 5 months after the department of
environmental resources is required and mandated issued our rules and
regulations – five months. We started this in 2011 and it would
authorize permits to be used March 1, 2015. That is not a very quick
pace, but a deliberate and important pace. Why do we need to set this
pace? I will tell you why: because the industry – the energy industry
will not come to NC and invest all the time and resources to build this
unless they know the moratorium is going to be lifted. They learned a
very hard lesson in NY, where they have a nonending moratorium, after
they invested millions of dollars. If we want them to come sooner than
later, we have to set the stage and now and make sure they understand
that we want them to come here, and we want them to invest here, and
create jobs here. That is the first and main thing that this bill does.
The second thing it does is set the severance tax. What is the tax going
to be on this energy? This is a very important component on this bill as
well. What we have done is created a low initial tax that gradually
increases over time. If you look at the bill, you will see that the
first two years: 2015. 2016, 2017, the effective tax rate will be 1%,
and I will explain as to how we got these numbers. After 2017, 2018,
2019, it would be 2.5%, and 2020, it would be a floating tax rate,
ranging between 6- 2.5 %. That tax would depend – that price would
depend on what the price was per MCF, per cubic feet, which  is the unit
you use. Let me shorthand this and tell you what it means: if the price
is $3 per MCF, essentially, the tax rate will be 3% per MCF. The
industry thought that was very good because it keeps them moving forward
and producing, even when prices are very low, like they currently are.
So that is an important piece of this legislation. What are some of the
other things we do? In addition to tax rate, we provide additional
monies to the mining and energy commission to move forward to</p>

<p id="015:00">
develop the rules and regulations that are necessary for this to go
forward.  And we encourage the governor, which he's already doing, very
pleased to see, we encourage the governor to go ahead and move forward
on offshore production, and working with the states to the north and
south, South Carolina and Virginia, and go ahead and try to work with
the Federal government to develop our offshore resources.  North
Carolina has largest area of offshore that's available, I think it's
some 64,000,000 acres.  Consensus believes that its rich in natural gas,
and we hope that that will move forward.  Let me put a little bit of
this in perspective.  If this state had moved forward six or seven years
ago, we would've had these thousands of jobs, and we would've had this
investment, and this energy sector would have been created in this
state, and we would've had all of that during this recession.  Our $2.5
billion shortfall that we had in the last session wouldn't have been
quite so bad.  Our economy would have been moving, and we wouldn't have
had unemployment rates at 9%.  That's the reality.  If we sit back and
continue to say, let's wait a little longer, let's drag this out a
little bit more, all we're doing is pushing the jobs and the economic
development further down the road.  Let me put a more fine point on
this.  I just read an article from the Houston chronicle in the Sunday
Paper.  And it talks about an area in Texas, where the ??  is, called
Carns county, which is a very rural county in Texas.  That was a
struggling county.  And the headline reads, shale play turns Carns
county around.  At think what's important for folks to realize is that
Carns county is probably a lot like Lee county, and some of the other
counties in our state, which we believe has tremendous shale gas
potential.  In the month of November alone, more than $70,000,000 was
paid out to the various landowners, and royalties for the natural gas
that was being brought out of the ground in Carns county.  $70,000,000
in one month.  I don't know what the amount is for the year.  I don't
know what the amount will be for the two, or three or four years.  But I
know that in my home county, if there was shale gas.  I wish there was.
$70,000,000 a month is quite an economic impact.  That's what this bill
is about.  Now, at this time, I have an amendment that I would like to
send forward.  Mr. President, it should be on the desk already.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, senator.  You can send forward your amendment.  The clerk
will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton, you can explain your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  Colleagues, this is a purely technical
amendment.  The staff advised me that this was eliminating some
redundant language, and if you have any questions about it other than
that, I'm gonna have to refer to staff, but they encouraged me to run
this amendment.  Thank you, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, senator.  Is there any further discussion or debate on
amendment one?  Hearing none, the question before the senate is the
passage of amendment one.  All in favor will vote aye.  Opposed will

thank you very much.With respect to senator bill 76 i joined senator
newton and other sponsors too to positively endorse this bill with my
amendment, the amendment to senator bill 76 that i offered will further
pretend the surface and also our environment by clarifying bonding
requirements associated with the or-lean gas activities  that will carry
in north Carolina. As a point of history the first bill the primary bill
you have before you that stand before any drilling occurs before there
is any drilling exploration. The developer that is required to register
with the department and energy and natural resources also point of
historical significance is that senate bill A20 actually talks about and
actually provides further bonding in the three different kinds of
bonding in senate bill A20 .The one that i am concerned  about in the
one that is before you in traded in this amendment relates to the
bonding that goes to the  surface owners of the properties .What this
amendments provide is that it instructs the mining and energy commission
to set rules based on a minimum criteria any any additional criteria
they they may see fit including the number of wills that will be on the
surface owners properties that pee-drilling drilling condition of the
property that ackrage that will be affected by the drilling and again
any other factors on a case by case side by side basis that would be
necessary for a proper bonding ?? .In addition it states and the current
offering of the bill of that who will set that bond and that bond would
also be set by the mining and energy commission consist with the rules
that it would promo gate and based on information provide by the
developer regarding</p>

doesn't abandon the project in the middle of the way. There's the bond
that goes in favor of the state in case there's a problem with the well,
some sort of accident or something, and now there's the bond that Sen.
Barringer's- this amendment addresses, benefits the surface owner. In
addition to that, there's $10 million as you read the bill that's set
aside to deal with any issues that may occur, so that it's important for
the public to understand that the purpose of this amendment is to
clarify the surface owner's rights as it relates to the bond. I think
it's an excellent amendment, and I commend it to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if the amendment sponsor will yield to a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Barringer, will you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She yields, you can ask your question Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. So in the current- I just want to make sure I understand- the
current bill there isn't a bonding requirement as it relates to- it's in
the name of the current property owner?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I address that sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes you can, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There is a requirement, but this actually clarifies what the requirement
is. The bill just says, the original bill says that there shall be a
bond for reclamation in favor of the surface owner, but it does not say
who will set the bond, it also gives no criteria for the bond, and that
concerns me as a owner of a farm myself, unfortunately not having any of
the oil or gas opportunities, but it does give me concern because we do
need to know who's going to be setting it, at what criteria that would
be based, and also an appeals process if that surface owner is not
satisfied with the original amount of the  bond.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, do you yield for a follow up question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She yields, you have the floor Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
Does either the original bill or your amendment set a minimum bond
amount?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No it does not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator.
Any further discussion or debate?
Sen. Ford, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, to ask the member a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Barringer, do you yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She yields, Sen. Ford you have the floor for your question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President.
Do any of the three of the bonds that were mentioned in this discussion
cover the roads?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would like to ask Sen. Newton for help because I do know that the
reclamation bond with respect to the surface owners does not, because it
relates specifically to the surface owner's properties, the amount of-
the number of wells, the acreage involved with their property. I am not
aware of the road situation, may I ask Sen. Newton to assist me with
this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Newton, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes I would yield for a question.
DOT already has bonding authority for that, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate?
Hearing none,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Clark, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I rise to send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, we're still voting on amendment 2, so we have to do that first.
Is there any further discussion or debate on amendment 2?
Hearing none, the question before the Senate is the passage of amendment
2, all in favor will vote &quot;aye&quot;, opposed will vote
&quot;no&quot;, five seconds will be allowed for the voting and the
clerk will record the vote.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd like to first say what when this bill passed about a year ago,
dealing with fracking here in North Carolina, it was a balancing of lots
of competing interests and it only survived the House vote by about 1
vote, in the final analysis a veto was conducted by the Governor. There
were many communications had between members of the Senate and members
of the House that allowed the legislation to come forth. There were many
people who placed their votes on the line because of representations and
commitments that were made. Many of those representations and
commitments that were made are being undone with this current
legislation. And that gives me some concern, because I don't think that
it's a very good precedent for conducting business in many instances. I
think that</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]Then you can send forth your amendment, the clerk will

[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Walters moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Walter, you're welcome to explain the
amendment.
Thank you Mr. President.  Folks around the room today, I guess most of
us are old enough to remember the old Popeye cartoon, and you remember
one of the characters, burger today.  This bill, holding respect to the
sponsors and supporters feels a lot like Whimpy to me.  We're asking
that we accept this bill with payment to the residents, particularly of
Lean, Moor, Chatham, Wake, Durham, Granville Counties, 10, 20, or 30
years down the road.  We're asking those local governments in those 6
counties to bear a lot the costs of introducing fracking to our state.
My amendment to the bill, in essence, removes the section about taxes.
No imposition of local taxes, fees or anything else.  Hearing discussion
in 2 committees last week, I asked both committees what the status of
this was.  One answer was that the Mayan Energy Commission is currently
considering impact fees in their imposition.  In another committee, the
bill sponsor allowed us to how regardless any action the MEC might take,
that he would oppose that for various reasons.  While thinking about
that since those meetings, I've thought a lot about the impact on our
local governments, on road, bridges, on water infrastructure, and on our
schools.  And I see a number of different impacts as I look at the model
states cited by the supporters of the bill.  For instance, truck traffic
has been estimated, to deliver water to a single well site, causes as
much damage to a road as 3.5 million car trips.  That's just delivering
the water, 3.5 million car trips.  And I can't speak about a lot of the
rural roads in the other 5 counties, but I can in Durham, and that's
going to be significant damage to the local, rural roads.  State bonds
or not, are they going to be enough for us to maintain these roads.
Many of you in this chamber have served in local government, and you
know what those calls are like, when you hear that that rural road is
damaged.  And we're going to be damaging these rural roads 3.5 million
car trips.  Texas for instance, one of the model states cited by
sponsors, has already spent over $40 million in repairs, just in the
Barnett Shale region of their state.  Pennsylvania has been considering
this for some time, and their estimate on road  repair, that's in their
Governor's budget for the last couple of years, will exceed $265 million
dollars by all their estimates.  On water infrastructure, the State of
Texas had estimated that it will cost over $400 million to state and
local governments over a 50 year period to improve and maintain the
water infrastructure as a result of fracking.  What about the schools?
We hear in North Dakota, decided in committee last week to 2.6%
unemployment.  That's a laudable figure.  But we didn't hear the other
side of the coin.  As people move in to North Dakota to accept those
jobs, they're bringing families with them.  A lot of those families will
live in trailers, and these rural school districts</p>

are crowded. I don't know about your county, but in Durham, we're tired
of trailers for our school children. Those temporary trailers have a way
of becoming permanent. How do we fund the growth in our schools? What
about orphaned wells? There's a point when the wells done. And I don't
see anything here that specifically addresses the orphaned wells. Whose
responsibility is that? Hopefully, the counties will do that. Farm
production. Look at farm production in some of these states. In
Pennsylvania, the milk production in cows has dropped 18 1/2 percent in
those areas where fracking is allowed. ?? remained constant or increased
in other parts of the state. Weight production, in the area of
Pennsylvania where fracking is allowed is down 20 percent. Who makes
these things whole? Who evens these things out? Well, we've heard that
other states don't have impact fees. In fact, Pennsylvania does. Their
impact fee: 50,000 dollars for each horizontal well. I would argue
that's not enough. West Virginia, Ohio have all implemented impact fees
for their local governments.  Now, we heard from the bill's sponsor that
it ?? will end up with a patchwork of fees. Feel that it's  backdoor way
for us to block exploration. And I would say that this is just another
reason for us to take time to look at this to see how that can work.  I
can do the arithmetic. We are going to get the 26 or 33 or more than
that votes here and we will have fracking in North Carolina. While I may
not like that, I do think we've gotta consider that impact on the local
governments.  Plus, the bill's sponsor told us last week that property
taxes will increase and will cover the cost to local governments. Little
fact, did anyone look at when these counties will do their
re-evaluations? In Lee county, their next re-val is in 2013. In Moore
and Chatham, 2015. In Durham, 2016. We won't have time. There'll be too
much lag time between those re-vals and the property values going up and
being increased. Senator Newton told us last week in response when will
the jobs come.  He said as soon as this bill is enacted, the trucks will
start rolling. The damage to our roads and infrastructure begins then.
But we can't wait for the re-vals to catch up and for the property tax
to be there. But then another factor, another issue on the property
taxes; if you look, we heard arguments last week, well the property
taxes will increase. The fact that data show that they will not. In
Texas, those properties in a proximity to fracking wells and where the
lines run down 14 percent. In Pennsylvania, they're down 9 percent. So,
ladies and gentleman, particularly those of you who've served in local
government and who care about how your local governments can fund the
services for our residents, I would urge you to approve this amendment
and let us take some time to look at this and let's allow these local
governments to establish some system of impact fees. Thank you, Mr.
President.
[speaker changes]
Senator Newton, for what purpose do you rise?
[speaker changes]
to speak to the amendment.
[speaker changes]
Senator Newton, you have the floor to speak to the amendment.
[speaker changes]
Thank you, Mr. President. A couple things. One, the impact fees question
is Mining and Energy committee is studying that and the Mining and
Energy committee, if they decide that there is an appropriate need for
impact fees, I want to pose that
[speaker changes]
be clear, Senator Woodard.
[speaker changes]
I do oppose allowing local impact fees because there are two distinct
reasons and you touched on them but I want to make them clear. I'm not
sure where you've gotten your figures. I'm sure there are some sources
out there but there are two main reasons why I would oppose allowing the
local governments to have impact fees or taxes.  One, it would be a
great way to locally kill the development of the energy sector and there
are certainly some areas that would prefer to do that to keep our
unemployment at 9 percent and pretend as if the world is just gonna
improve itself.   And two, there needs to be consistency across the
state for this industry. They need a predictable environment in order to
understand what it is they're gonna engage in. For those reasons, I
don't think that this amendment is in good order. I don't think it's
offered at the appropriate time. I think we should wait and see what the
Mining and Energy Commission comes up with. It is my hope that in
2015/2016</p>

Representative: …we discuss this last year. The mining bills allow, when
a will is drilled, to basically adversely possess surrounding land
owners mineral rights. It is called cooling. What you do is take your
minerals and somebody, besides the land owner, decides what to get paid
for them and so forth, which certainly goes against what people on the
other side of the aisle think about condemning people’s property. What I
happen to think about it to, and a lot of us on my side of the aisle. It
is kind of tough when you tell people that you are pumping their gas out
and that you will let them know what they will get for it. with these
wells, I think that law was drafted back when we were talking about an
oil well, where you went down and pulled some stuff from your
neighbor’s. but this here allows you to go down and then out, and I have
seen a half a mile clearly, and I understand that now they can go out a
mile in all directions. You are talking about a two mile diameter circle
around a well where you can just pull people in and where they are
subject to just whatever the pool says they are entitled to for going in
and having gotten their resources. That seems to go against everything
that we stand for down here when it comes to people’s property. I have
not heard any… we were told that the mining commissioner would work on
that and we would hopefully get some answers. When I sit down, I do not
know who to ask a question to, but if anyone has got information, I
would like to hear it. The other thing is that we are being told that we
need to do it for jobs. I do not doubt that if we are successful, and if
everything goes as planned, that we will not create some jobs. I am
going to tell you something. You cannot sit here and ignore the
environment in the future o this state and the ability to have the great
state that we have potentially so that we can hurry up and have a job.
We are going to start holding you accountable on this jobs business. We
set aside a sales tax because we needed to get that money back into the
economy to create jobs. In a four month period, around the sunset of
that tax, unemployment rate went up almost a full percent – go back and
look. It was a loss of private sector jobs and at that time, we had been
almost at the national average, somewhere close – about a half a
percent, and we went over a percent above the national average and have
not come down yet. If it created jobs, I cannot find a net good out of
it. It was the first thing we did to stimulate the economy and the
unemployment rate went above the national average because of it, in my
opinion. I think the bureau of labor statistics showed a loss of public
jobs that ran that up over a four month period of time. So, if we are
going to create jobs, pass bills so we can create jobs, you need to
start telling us how many jobs, when we can expect them, will the
unemployment rate come down, will we lose other jobs and replace them
with these so the rate keeps going up? This is your economy. We need
some answers and we will hold you accountable. Until I can answers
about, what I consider to be two very serious flaws about this bill, I
cannot support it because I don’t think we can risk in this state we
damage the [xx] over time and lose several great communities in this
state.
Speaker: Senator Apodaka, for what purpose do you rise?
Representative: To speak on the fracking bill but I am going to get into
a little economics if I might. I am looking for my memo here on talking
points, but I do not have one – but we are going to be held accountable.

Clerk: House joint resolution 20, a joint resolution providing a joint
session for general assembly to act on the joint resolution providing
for confirmation on point of governor new members to the state board of
education.
Speaker: Senator Apodaka is recognized.
Representative:  Thank you Mr. President. Members, this just allows us
to go into a joint session as required by statute with the house in
order to vote on the new members of the state board of education. This
resolution allows the speaker and the present protim to pick the date to
have that and it looks like it will be Thursday morning at this point.
So we do need to get that voted on. I ask for your support.

Representative:  Thank you Mr. President. Members, the conference report

NC facts. Secondly, it clarifies that the new 9010 grant funding, once
obtained, shall be employed towards NC fact upgrades. That is all it
does. I ask for your support.

Representative: To speak to the conference report.
Speaker: Senator, you have the floor to speak to the conference report.
Representative:  Members of the senate, it has been about three weeks
since we debated this bill the last time. It will be helpful to discuss
what has happened in these last three weeks. We already knew that there
were five republican governors, including governor Brewer of AZ,
governor Kasick of OH, who were endorsing expanding access to healthcare
for their people. We have now heard from three more republican
governors: from FL, VA</p>

<p id="090:00">
...and today New Jersey. Governor Rick Scott, as a former healthcare
executive, who was elected because of his opposition to Obamacare.
Here’s what he says now embracing health care expansion for his people.
I think this is a common sense solution to dealing with this for the
next three years where it will give us time to think about how we can
improve the system. In other words, let’s help the economy and our
people while we improve the system at the same time. Today, Governor
Chris Christie included expansion of healthcare in his budget to the
General Assembly of New Jersey. Yesterday, Governor Bob McDonnell of
Virginia supported expanding healthcare access to his people. One of the
arguments that you all asserted three weeks ago was that we shouldn’t
expand access to healthcare because our neighboring states weren’t and
that might attract poor people to North Carolina who wanted to take
advantage of Medicare...Medicaid. Well, so much for that argument. What
else has happened in the last three weeks? Well, a central argument you
all raised was that expanding access to Medicaid would hurt rural
hospitals because it would shift people from private insurance to
Medicaid and Medicaid reimburses at a lower lever. To support that
thesis, you all cited a Harvard study that was national in scope. The
fallacy of that argument, and really, the central misconception, of your
case is that you see there being two buckets of  people, those with
private health insurance and those on public health insurance. Of
course, there’s a third bucket. 17% of  North Carolinians have no
insurance at all. Expanding access to healthcare will primarily serve to
increase the number of people with health insurance even if there is
some movement from people with private insurance to public insurance.
If somebody gets health care coverage in a hospital with Medicaid, they
will, by definition get reimbursed more than if they had no insurance at
all. Don’t take my word for it. Take the word of Steve Pizer. Steve
Pizer, is the author of the Harvard study that you all were so enamored
with three weeks ago. He said, “North Carolina has relatively high
uninsurance rates and currently restrictive Medicaid eligibility
policies. This means that new Medicaid enrollees in North Carolina will
be more likely to be uninsured than in many other states. The proposed
Medicaid expansion would be an effective means to reduce uninsurance
among the low income population.”
Well, now that he no longer agrees with you, I’ll expect you’ll discount
his opinion. Let’s not take the word of the Harvard law professor, you
cited, let’s ask the hospitals themselves. In a query from Senator
Clark, the hospitals wrote: “Absent alternative coverage expansion, the
decision not to expand Medicaid will harm your community’s hospital
ability to meet our patients’ and communities’ health care needs.
Although already struggling rural hospitals will be among the first to
manifest those harms, all community hospitals will feel the
effects.&quot;
We heard a lot that Medicaid was broken. Medicaid can, of course, and
should be made more efficient. We need to eliminate waste from the
program. Over the last couple of years, on a bipartisan basis, we have,
in a number of ways, supported efforts to eliminate fraud and waste from
Medicaid, and we must never stop searching for ways to make that program
more effective for the people and taxpayers. But because Medicaid did
not achieve the unrealistic cuts that you all imposed on them in the
last budget does not mean that the system is broken. In fact, between
2007 and 2010, North Carolina was number 1 in the nation in having the
lowest rate of spending growth of its state Medicaid program. Finally,
we heard time and again that there is no such thing as a free lunch. I
love lunch more than the next person. But I very much understand that
you have to pay for your lunch and so does Obamacare. What you’re doing
with this bill is saying that all the federal taxes that North Carolina
are going to pay to the federal government will not come back to North
Carolina. No, instead, we’ll send them to Arizona, to Ohio, to Florida,
and now to New Jersey instead.</p>

<p id="095:00">
The notion that you think you can solve the federal budget problem by
rejecting federal monies paid for by North Carolina tax payers is
entirely misguided. The impact on the federal deficit of our little bit
of share of our money, our own taxpayer money, is negligible. I expect
when we see the state budgets that you all are gonna bring forward in a
couple of months, that we're gonna send back
about the ten, ten to twenty, twenty to thirty billion dollars that we
get from the federal government for transportation, for healthcare and
education. I mean, my goodness, why should we take our own taxpayers to
help with transportation if we've got a federal deficit problem? Our
ability to solve the federal debt is a single raindrop in an ocean.
Look, we know Congress is broken. Congress has to fix our federal
deficit. But for us to reject our own taxpayer money is simply
foolhardy. By rejecting federally funded healthcare expansion, we are
failing to generate billions of dollars in economic activity when we
desperately need it today. We are failing to create tens of thousands of
jobs. We are failing to insure about a half million North Carolinians,
and as a result, we are failing to save thousands of lives. Please,
reject this Conference Report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Kinnaird what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Kinnaird has the floor to speak on the
conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I represent a very large healthcare organization,
which is a state healthcare organization. It is the organization that
takes care of the indigent, of those who have no health insurance, who
have Medicaid. And I have heard from them, many, many of them. They are
very distressed. They know what will happen to the hospitals. More
importantly, they know what happens to those without health insurance.
They show up at the emergency room. The emergency room is the most
expensive healthcare anywhere. And what we're doing is forcing our
hospitals to pay for these indigent people through the most expensive
healthcare that's possible. Our doctors have called me, have emailed me,
have written me, saying please, this is the most important thing you can
do for the health and the healthcare of the state of North Carolina.
Fifteen medical societies sent a letter to the governor saying, this is
really a very, very bad thing to do. The health of our profession and
our people is at stake at this point. The Hospital Association has told
us what will happen to not only our rural hospitals, but other hospitals
that are taking care of indigents. I urge you to vote against the
Conference Report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the Conference Report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson, you have the floor to speak to the
Conference Report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd like to just speak very briefly on behalf of the
citizens I represent. And last week I had the opportunity to meet with
quite a few of those in Guilford County, who not only represented people
who were employed, maybe soon unemployed, but also healthcare
professionals. And yesterday, with a doctor who is well known at UNC
Chapel Hill, who takes care of a lot of indigent people. And he said to
me, Senator you know what you're doing is, your gonna put them on our
doorsteps by not expanding Medicaid. And so last week, and the last
couple of weeks, we've heard from the Secretary in our Appropriations
for Health and Human Services meeting. And I appreciate the chairs, the
co-chairs, for bringing her in, because what she said is, yes the system
is broken, and we're gonna fix it by June 30th. And I think all of you
heard that. Well my other concern is if she's gonna fix it, and all of
you have confidence in her, that it's gonna be fixed by June 30th, what
is the reason for not expanding Medicaid, so that people in this state
who really need it, who can't afford health insurance, hospitals who
can't afford to take care of people in emergency rooms, what is the
rationale for not expanding Medicaid in North Carolina? I think it is
unconscionable if it, it means that we don't care about our people. We
have an obligation to, maybe,  make sure the system is working. And our
secretary that our governor hired said that she is gonna get it done by
June 30th, so it doesn't make sense...</p>

Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, yesterday, the 101st central
inter-collegiate athletic association CIAA basketball tournament started
in North Carolina's largest city, Charlotte.  The CIAA is the third
largest postseason basketball tournament in the country, larger than the
SEC, the big east, and even ACC.  The economic impact on the city of
Charlotte, we're expecting about 200,000 visitors and the impact of
$50,000,000 for hotel owners, restaurants, other small business event
management company.  It's a huge impact for the region and the state.
We have three state institutions participating in the tournament,
Elizabeth City State, Fayetteville state, and Winston Salem state, along
with four private institutions, all based here in North Carolina, which
helps bring that economic impact or state and to our region.  On a
person notes, my daughter is a member of the Fayetteville State women's
basketball team, and last night I had the opportunity of not being with
you guys and ladies, but hosting 25 of them in my home for dinner last
night, and they have a 22 and four record, and looking forward to bring
home the title.  But that aside, sports and entertainment is a huge
economic driver for North Carolina economy.  Teams like the Carolina
Panthers, the Charlotte Bobcats, the Carolina Hurricanes, NASCAR, the
Belt Bowl, and other major sporting events like ACC basketball or
football, contributes the economic economy of North Carolina.  A huge
driver, which brings over close to $1,000,000,000, all those entities
combined.  So, I just want to pause might you know that as our economy
is changing, sports and entertainment is a major part of it, and
certainly the CIAA basketball tournament in a larger city is
contributing a great windfall to our local economy in February.  Thank
you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, senator.  Any other notices or announcements?  Is there any
further business to come before the senate?  If not, the chair
recognizes senator Berger for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
