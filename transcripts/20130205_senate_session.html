<p id="05:00">
...President and to the leadership of the Senate, we truly appreciate
you giving us this additional day on the bill and it was so gracious of
you to do that, but we intend not to keep you here long on this bill
today, in return. I think we had a very good debate on this last night.
I think by handling it yesterday and today we've given the public a
little bit more time to dwell on this bill. The problem is when they
don't know what's going on in this building. And that applies to when
we're in power or you're in power or anybody's in power. We got to go at
such a pace that the public can at least be informed as to what we're
doing here.
I think we found some salient points for you yesterday to think about
and I heard Senator Berger loud and clear that we have until the end of
this session to continually deal with this matter. This bill doesn't
preclude making whatever decision the General Assembly decides to make
governing the expansion of Medicaid. And hopefully, some of the members
on the other side of the aisle will have time to talk to your folks back
home, especially these rural hospitals. We are truly concerned about
them and we think that they will be in peril if we don't do this and
certainly you need to listen to the Governor. I know it's hard
sometimes, but you just need to do it. He's got a job to do over there
and I think I heard the other day through the grapevine that Kasick had
been able to negotiate with the Feds and get some flexibility on how
they handle Medicaid and was able to go ahead and expand his. So maybe
if the Governor has some time that'll happen.
I think we need to look at the fact that if this bill passes and becomes
law we cut off the opportunity to use that $73 million that we got. The
case was made to us by the insurance department that once you say we
absolutely are not going to do this there may be the possibility that we
can not continue to access that money because we wouldn't be acting in
good faith. It was given to us in consideration of I'm not sure. Either
going ahead with the exchange or going ahead with Medicaid expansion.
Probably the exchange. And I think the Governor's concerned about that
money getting gone.
But with that said, we still encourage you not to pass this bill and
when it passes here today, if it finds a resting place to let it rest
and let's get all the information before we jump off this ledge. I think
this will be, we think this is one great opportunity for this State and
for the people of this State and all ways. It's good for the economy.
And we would encourage you not to support the bill but if you do, give
it some time. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill reluctantly, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Members, Senator Nesbitt, I
do appreciate your comments and always in Raleigh we talk about slowing
things down when we don't want them to happen. I understand that. I
guess other folks understand that, too, but that really isn't how things
work. So we're going to move this on, but one good thing we were able to
do was overnight I had staff look up a few things for me. And all I've
heard about the Affordable Healthcare Act was that it was going to be
good for everybody. It was going to make things better. And last night
we limited our debate to that difference, those folks between 100%, 135%
of Federal poverty rate. And it sounded to me like they were going to be
left out in the cold. Just without any kind of insurance whatsoever. So,
that's not the case. Let's talk about it a moment. Let's take a
hypothetical question. Say we have a family of three with one bread
winner making $24,000 a year. Now that's 133% of the Federal poverty
level.</p>

<p id="10:00">
And we all know that’s almost impossible to live off of. We understand
that, but what the Affordable Healthcare Act does do, it provides those
folks in that category with a: refundable and advanceable tax credits,
and b, and the most important part, is advanceable monies, meaning their
premiums will be helped paid for by this. So in this example, they
cannot pay a premium more than 3%. That would be $731 for the year. Now
just because you’re poor, doesn’t mean you’re stupid, and I think
families will take advantage of this, and paying $731 for your whole
family is not a whole lot to ask. So I think as we go down this road and
we get accused of forgetting the folks that can’t help themselves or are
down on their luck or whatever it may be, I can assure you on this side
of the aisle we don’t feel that. We care about those folks, but as my
son told me today when he was reading some of the articles, money from
Washington still isn’t free. That’s our tax dollars. And I did shed a
tear, hearing it from him. I never thought he would become a Republican,
but anyway, he has. But we care about folks, and I think this plan, and
with the current financial shape of North Carolina, this is the best way
for us to go, so I encourage you to vote yes. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Hise, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak to the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, you have the floor to
speak to the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the Senate, I wanted to
take just a moment to discuss the arguments put forward about how that
prohibiting the expansion of Medicare was quite so devastating to rural
health. I’ve spent some time over the evening and I’ve come to quite the
opposite conclusion. I looked over the study that Senator Brown
referenced yesterday from Harvard, and I quite frankly believe that if
we allow Medicaid to expand in North Carolina, we will destroy rural
healthcare. The study that was referenced here yesterday indicates if
you believe it is a saving grace, you would somehow believe that this
expansion from 100 to 133% of federal poverty represents the uninsured.
Quite frankly, that income group represents 9% of the uninsured. The
breakdown that this study offers of where the new Medicaid recipients
would come from indicates that 80% would come from current private
insurance coverage, 14% from uninsured, and 6% from other public
insurance. Now I talk to rural hospitals quite a bit – that’s what I
represent, and their biggest problem right now is their provider mix,
what they have of Medicaid recipients, Medicare recipients, neither of
which cover the actual cost, and the small percentage they have of
private insurers. If you allow this Medicaid expansion to go through,
you will reduce their private insurance and expand their Medicaid payer
base. It will make operation impossible. However, if we prohibit this
expansion and we allow those individuals to purchase as we’re now seeing
on a federal exchange program, for a family of four at the top end,
you’re looking at somewhere in the neighborhood of 52 dollars a month
for insurance coverage, that we can take that same population and add
them to the insurance market, which does cover the cost of a hospital
and allow them to move forward. By putting this bill in action, we can
make sure that we are making a better payer mix for rural hospitals. 11
counties in North Carolina have a median family income lower than 138%
of federal poverty. It’s $31,800 is what it’s expected to be in 2014.
You cannot operate a hospital when more than 50% of your population and
families would be paid for under the Medicaid system. It doesn’t work
and it doesn’t continue. That is why I continue to ask for your support
on this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Stine, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Senator
Hise will yield for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, do you yield
for a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The Senator
yields. You have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you agree</p>
