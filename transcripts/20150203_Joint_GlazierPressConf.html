  ...presents and everybody wants to say something so... Not everyone.
This is a press conference to discuss... We will be introducing soon,
several of us, legislation for nonpartisan redistricting processes. This
is not about the current maps. I recall the first bill I did on this
subject was 26 years ago. If it had passed with an effective date 30
years later we&#39;d probably be in good shape. But then others carried
it forward, John [unclear 00:00:37], many others, Ellie [unclear
00:00:40]. It&#39;s been bipartisan.
The idea is that in constructing districts the people with the most at
stake are probably ones who shouldn&#39;t be doing the details. It&#39;s
not about squiggly lines or maps that look bad. They&#39;re always going
to look bad because of the voting rights act, or at least as long as
that&#39;s in effect. But it is about making the process fairer. I&#39;m
hopeful that we&#39;ll be successful this time.
We&#39;re at a window of time of two or three years. In the last decade
it took nine years to resolve all of the redistricting fights, lawsuits.
This year they&#39;ve all been resolved after four years. That&#39;s
progress. So we&#39;re at a window of time where each party can look at
the situation after the 2020 census and not really know who will win.
This is the time to consider nonpartisan redistricting.
I&#39;d like to introduce Representative Charlie Jeter who is also
working on a bill to this effect.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Stam and everyone for being here. I think
you&#39;ll look around this room and you&#39;ll see a pretty bipartisan
effort. There&#39;s a couple of bills that are going to be filed.
Representative Stam has his. Senator Jackson, to my left, he and I will
file a bill tomorrow.
Our bill is a little bit different. Going to Representative Stam&#39;s
point about the first time he filed this bill in 1989, had he done taken
the strategy we hope to approach, it would have passed. Our bill
won&#39;t go into effect until after the 2030 election cycle, in large
part because it grandfathers everyone out except for Mickey Michaux.
Please don&#39;t tell him I said that.
Everyone says that&#39;s a long time out. It&#39;s 15 years. I get it
but going back, had we done that in &#39;89 it would be the law today.
To some degree I think this is about getting the bill passed. The second
thing is my bill and the Senator Jackson bill is a constitutional
amendment. It requires a vote of the people. It allows them to have
direct involvement in their decision making process of what they want to
do.
Let me make one thing certain - I like my bill but I like Skip&#39;s
bill. I like any bill that will go to an independent redistricting. We
are all here together to make sure that we change the way we draw the
lines, not because they were not done appropriately, fair, or legal.
They certainly have been based on all of the judicial decisions
we&#39;ve had. But because we think there&#39;s a better way to do it
and you&#39;ve got a bipartisan group. Some of the... You look around
this room and the areas they come from - urban, rural, republican,
democrat, conservative, liberal - every title, every brand is in this
room today and I think that should say a lot. I&#39;m hopeful whichever
or both bills get passed the senate will have an option and hopefully we
can move forward and get this done. This, to me, is a watershed moment
for North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are you supposed to introduce me?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m supposed to introduce Greer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m Greer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What we&#39;ve got here today, folks that vote against each other on so
many important issues facing our state in unity, because of the problem
that we all agree is one of the greatest problems facing our state and
facing our country which is the growing perception amongst citizens that
they cannot have a voice in our system of democracy.
If you look at my district right now, I&#39;m a democrat. I&#39;m in a
safe democratic seat. A republican voter in my district really in the
end can actually say that their vote really can have no impact on me
because they would be unable to unseat me. I&#39;ve got republican
friends across the aisle in whose districts a democratic voter could say
the same thing.
We need to have more districts where folks are elected because they were
able to build a consensus

  Amongst their voters, Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, and
unaffiliated that they were the candidate that could best represent
their collective interest. In the end, as much as it pains me to say it,
we need more legislators like Charlie Jeter. We need legislators who
were elected because they can build consensus and work across the aisle
in order to get elected, because they&#39;ll bring those same traits to
the general assembly. Conservative or liberal in politics if they&#39;re
moderate in temperament, they&#39;ll find a way to get things done for
the people of North Carolina here. If the people of North Carolina can
see that getting done, I think we&#39;ll go a long way towards restoring
their faith in our system of democracy. Unless we take actions like that
and act now, I think our system really has no hope. And so it&#39;s a
deep honor to be here with Democratic friends, Republican friends, we
might have an unaffiliated friend here also, who support this effort to
get it done because it&#39;s the right thing to do for North Carolina.
I&#39;d like to introduce now Representative Jon Hardister from Guilford
County. Jon and I vote differently on so many things, but we share a
love for cars with big engines, and also in putting our political
process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But we don&#39;t break the speed limit. Good afternoon. It&#39;s great
to see everybody. For me, this bill, well, we might have two bills or we
may have one. We&#39;re not sure, but I think we&#39;re all in agreement
that redistricting reform is necessary. For me, it&#39;s about good
government. It&#39;s about the golden rule, treating others the way you
want to be treated. Many Republicans, including myself, advocated for
redistricting reform when Democrats were in the majority in North
Carolina. It was the right thing to do then, and it&#39;s still the
right thing to do today. And I&#39;m proud to work with my colleagues in
a bipartisan fashion to achieve this goal, and I hope we can get it
done. And is, is the Mayor of Morrisville, is the Mayor Pro Tem with us
today? Yeah, we have a special guest who would like to share her
thoughts. We have Liz Johnson. She&#39;s the Mayor Pro Tem for
Morrisville, and I believe you&#39;ve been on the council since 1999.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And you&#39;re a former, you&#39;re IBM engineer systems?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Systems indeed. You&#39;ve done your homework.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, well please welcome Liz Johnson. And you&#39;re also on the Board
of Directors of the League of Municipalities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And she would like to share her thoughts on this topic.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Before I begin my remarks, I just
want to thank all the legislators that are here today for their
willingness to support these bills that we&#39;ve heard about today, and
also I want to thank all the folks that are here from the different
organizations that are in support of fair and independent redistricting.
As you&#39;ve heard, I&#39;m Mayor Pro Tem of the town of Morrisville. I
also sit on the North Carolina League of Municipalities Board of
Directors, and co chair one of the League&#39;s three advocacy
organizations. In December, the membership of the North Carolina League
of Municipalities adapted one of our legislative goals to support
legislation providing for fair, transparent, and nonpartisan methods of
drawing legislative and congressional districts. Now you might ask why.
Obviously the topic is not the typical concern of  municipal government.
The mass, the vast majority of city and town councils are chosen in
nonpartisan elections. How legislative and congressional districts are
drawn would appear to be far removed from the problems that municipal
governments are faced with resolving every day. A lot of the criticism
of the current system focuses on the lack of competitiveness of
gerrymandered districts and how the voice of the political middle is
diminished when political party is the driving motive for how districts
are formulated. These are not inconsequential concerns. It&#39;s
important to point out that these concerns also are not new. Several of
the legislators that are here today representing both political parties
have been making the case for reform for many years, but what is lost in
the discussion at times is how the current redistricting process can
split communities with similar problems and similar needs. Dividing
communities of interest can leave these communities without the strong,
unified voice that they, that they need at the legislature. It can leave
voters with similar economic interests, whether it&#39;s technology
workers in and around RTP, farmers and agricultural workers in rural
North Carolina, or the resonance of a small college town. It leaves them
split up and fractured when it comes to these political representations.
Regardless of your political party, whether it is the one in power or
the one not, having district lines drawn in ways that keep communities
of interest intact is critical for effective representation. Obviously
efforts to reform the system like this one will always have their
critics. Typically that criticism focuses

  From the fact, when it comes to politics, everyone is a partisan. We all
have our political leanings. No one is asking anyone to do the
impossible and shed those political leanings. What we are asking for is
a process in criteria set in law, that allows for and in fact demands
that the politics be set aside in a very transparent way while the
districts are being drawn. This is not impossible. It&#39;s happening in
other states. In many of those states, races are more competitive,
districts are more compact, and voters are more satisfied. Doing the
same here, we can improve public confidence in our electoral system, and
better ensure that voters have real choice at the ballot box. We can
make clear that North Carolina, we want good government, solutions that
work for everyone. Thank you very much for the opportunity to be here
today. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jeter&#39;s
trying to make up for his mistake, he was supposed to introduce me, but
he&#39;s explained that he was educated in South Carolina so ??. I
represent a district very different from the area in and around
Representative Martin&#39;s district. You could not probably create a
democratic district, given the one county requirement in the
constitution in Henderson County. But I&#39;m here because this issue
back ten and fifteen years ago, was an issue championed by Republicans,
where Democrats were ambivalent or not wanting to make it a priority.
Things have changed, and we&#39;re in a very different situation and we
really have everything has turned the other way. And what I&#39;d say to
my fellow Republicans is this was right ten years, fifteen years ago
when we were not in the majority, and it&#39;s still right that we make
sure the system works in a fair way, and we create confidence in our
voters, that we&#39;re not playing games with redistricting. So this
bill is, to my colleagues, is right for the same reasons they voted for
it fifteen years ago and I&#39;m glad to have a larger group of
Democrats join us in supporting the bill now. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
We&#39;re going to, in a few minutes we&#39;ll open the floor to
questions but we do have two more special guests with us today. We have
Mr. Chris Fitsimons from NC Policy Watch, which is a progressive
organization. And we have Mr. John Hood of the Pope Foundation, which is
a conservative organization. And these two gentlemen have had some
interesting debates on public policy in North Carolina. They don&#39;t
agree very often but they do agree on this issue. If a fight breaks out
between the two of them, I will be the mediator. But first I&#39;d like
to bring up Mr. Chris Fitzsimon of, I apologize. See, the fight has
already broken out. Mr. John Hood of the Pope Foundation. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] If Chris is from a progressive group, I guess I&#39;m from a
regressive group. [LAUGHTER] At the beginning of Shakespeare&#39;s
MacBeth, three grotesque witches enter the stage accompanied by thunder
and lightning. This is not a commentary on the people who have spoken
before or after me. You may recall that the witches end up chanting in
unison, “Fair is foul and foul is fair. Hover through the fog and filthy
air” Now MacBeth the play is about contrasts and inversions. Characters
perceive themselves to be good, yet they end up doing evil. And
characters that are clearly portrayed as evil at the beginning of the
story actually believe that they are advancing toward some conception of
the good. Now I make this observation because the redistricting debate,
the drama here in North Carolina today is also about contrasts and
inversions. When Democrats were in control, they general rejected calls
for redistricting reform while arguing that they were just following the
rules of the game that they didn&#39;t invent. Or even that the goal of
maximizing the control of the legislature by the Democrats was more
important than maximizing competitive politics because in their minds
Democrats had the answers to North Carolina&#39;s problems. And at the
time Republicans argued they thought their ideas were valuable. They
thought that the best way to decide these questions would be through
competitive elections with voters choosing a,ong viable candidates as
much as possible, having a chance of winning. They also warned Democrats
not to assume they would be in power

  <p id="15:00">
  The next time redistricting would come along. Now, for some actors in
this drama, fair is foul, and foul is fair. I think few legislators are
being disingenuous or, or dishonest. I think you speak from the place
you are and your perception of recent history, but this is not a play.
This is real life. The stakes are high. It is important for all of us in
North Carolina to get the policy right, not just to inhabit some
character that we&#39;ve been assigned to play. We can disagree about
the details of redistricting reform. In fact, we have two different
bills currently being discussed in, in file. I&#39;m sure that
redistricting reformers would welcome additional alternatives as long as
they were consistent with the principle that neutral rules should be our
tactic and competitive election should be our end. It&#39;s a principle
that people across the political spectrum can share. And with that
having been said, something wicked this way comes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think he was for foul.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m Chris Fitzsimon with NC Policy Watch. I&#39;m happy to stand
here with people I usually agree with and people I usually disagree for
an issue that we all believe is important for the democracy and the
voters. Let&#39;s remember the voters are who the democracy, our
democracy is supposed to work for. This is not all that complicated, and
it&#39;s almost been a cliché at this point, but the idea is to create a
system where voters choose their politicians, voters choose their
politicians instead of the other way around. Now we&#39;ve had in the
last several years heated arguments in this building over voter
participation and what in, what increases voter turnout, what decreases
it. There are still big disagreements about that and the courts are
deciding it, but one reason many people don&#39;t vote in North Carolina
in many races is that their vote really doesn&#39;t matter much in
November, as Representative Martin said. The congressional and
legislative race was decided in effect for a lot of people in North
Carolina when the maps were drawn. That was true in Democrats through
the maps, and it&#39;s true under the maps that the Republican
majorities have created. And this is not, let me be clear, this is not
an attack on the folks currently in charge of the general assembly.
It&#39;s a criticism of the process that both parties have used to
maximize their political advantage under the law with the districts they
have drawn. I was standing here in the 1990s with John Hood push,
pushing redistricting reform when the Democrats were in charge. I was
standing here in the 2000s when the Democrats were in charge, standing
here with John Hood pushing redistricting reform, and I&#39;m here in
2015 standing here with John Hood pushing redistricting reform when,
when, when, we&#39;re not very effective. But if we&#39;re serious about
wanting to increase the number of people who participate in our
Democratic process, let&#39;s give people more competitive races and so
they feel like their vote counts in November. Let&#39;s return some
vibrancy to our Democracy. With all due respect to the comments of some
upon the redistricting reform, this is not just about what&#39;s legal,
what the courts say. It&#39;s about what&#39;s right, giving more power
to the people of the state, not just the politicians or whoever,
whatever political party happens to be in power. So let&#39;s make
elections battle of, battles of ideas and campaigns not which precinct
and which part of which district to exclude from what neighborhood to
benefit one political party or the other. And I would submit to you
today that now&#39;s the perfect time to do it. Halfway through this ten
year cycle of redistricting. Who knows what the districts will look like
that were drawn four years ago, remember, will look like in 2020 or 2030
as we&#39;ve, as we&#39;ve heard today. We&#39;re experiencing in North
Carolina all sorts of changes. Increasing urbanization, rapid
immigration to this state, changing demographics of neighborhoods and
cities and counties. There&#39;s no way to predict what the current
districts will look like in 2020 or 2030, but I can guarantee you they
won&#39;t look much like they did when they were drawn in 2011. Both
parties should support turning over redistricting to some independent
process so whoever wins control in 2020 or 2030 won&#39;t have a built
in advantage for six or eight years. So let&#39;s give power back to the
voters. 88 members of the House courageously voted for redistricting
reform in 2011. Many of them are still here. Many of them are standing
behind me. Surely many Senators, and you can see many here, also see the
wisdom of reinvigorating our democracy and taking out a political
insurance policy for the 2020 or 2030 election. That is a good thing for
the voters to do and the politically wise thing for the elected
officials to do. So I&#39;d like to thank all the legislators who are
here supporting this effort, but let&#39;s hope this is finally the year
we set up a saner and more voter centered way to draw districts in North
Carolina. I don&#39;t think I can stand many more of these press
conferences with John Hood. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We&#39;ll take about ten minutes for questions. Please direct it to a
certain person. If you direct it to me, I might refer it to someone who
knows more about it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative, I wonder, excuse me, I wonder if Representative Jeter or
Senator Jackson could talk about the details of their plan just a little
bit more?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson? First time at the podium.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. Well, it does present a bipartisan, free
districting commission

  There would be nine members of the commission. None of them can be an
elected official. The appointments, the power to make those appointments
is spread throughout all three branches of government, so that&#39;s the
governor, the Supreme Court judge, the chief of our state Supreme Court,
and the readers of the House and the Senate both majority and minority.
There would be protections to put in, put in place to make sure that
there is both majority and minority representation, and the commission
would be charged with producing three possible maps. There would be a 45
day mandatory public comment period prior to producing any maps, but
once those maps are produced, the general assembly would have 120 days
to approve one of those maps for each the House, Senate, and Federal
House. If they weren&#39;t able to do that within 120 days, then the
commission would be authorized to make a selection based on a majority
vote within the commission. The effective date is 2028. That&#39;s when
the appointments would be made, and the first round of redistricting
that it would impact would happen in 2031.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Next question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson, can you explain why, why this would, why you would want
this to be effective not until 2028 or 2031?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, that was my idea. Chuck McGrady already told you I was educated in
South Carolina. To get it done. I think it, if I may get past all the
double speak and the hyperbole and all the things that I probably should
say here to make you feel better about it. Truth of the matter is, five
years in politics is soon, and everybody in this room is gonna be
impacted by, if we do it in five years. To me, getting it done is the
most important thing. And I firmly believe that we will gain more
traction with our friends in the lower chamber in the Senate by giving
them this option, and when I reached out to my colleagues in the Senate,
they seemed to be more amenable to the idea of this having an impact
predominantly not on anybody in this room today for the most part. But
we get it on the books, we make it a constitutional law so it can&#39;t
be changed in the future. I think those compromised positions hopefully
make it more likely to be passed in the Senate. I don&#39;t doubt any
bill could pass in the House within reason. The goal is getting it past
the Senate. To me, this is a way to incentivize the Senate to join on
board.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Next question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, following up on what he said, how do you expect the
bill that you&#39;re sponsoring to pass in the Senate when a similar
bill a couple of years ago didn&#39;t pass, didn&#39;t go anywhere
there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, times change, people change, ideas change. You work on it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any conversations with Senate leadership that might.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No. No, not this year. I&#39;ll, I won&#39;t get into details but a
couple of years ago I got a bill passed that took me 30 years to get
passed, and another one that took 38 years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
How long did the Magna Carta take?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It actually lasted 10 days before it was abrogated. Next question. John.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I suppose my question was similar in what can you, do either of
these bills have a better chance to pass in the Senate, do you think? Or
I guess the Senate is what&#39;s on all of our minds I would expect, and
that is what&#39;s the likelihood that this gets done?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That remains to be seen. Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I had the same question. I guess if we could ask Representative Jeter
and Senator Jackson their take. Is there serious concern that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Here&#39;s what&#39;s changed since last year, and I should have
mentioned this. Last session and the session before that. We were still
in litigation about the current maps, and there was assertions that
some, not all, that we couldn&#39;t make a change while it was in
litigation, or some judge might say, well, send it to a commission.
That&#39;s, that&#39;s what&#39;s changed in the last six weeks. The
litigation is over.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you want to comment on that further?

  In another bill in which all of you are going to be in a room ??
bringing on something like this SPEAKER CHANGE Well I thinks its not a
bad idea to introduce a couple of bills then have conversations about it
if want more gains more attraction, then you can perhaps merge them or
submerge them. SPEAKER CHANGE Is it for the other bill or they have
indicated they will support your bill. SPEAKER CHANGE Actually the text
of it is very similar to my 1989 bill except for the effective date.
effective date I understand the reasons for it. I don&#39;t know
I&#39;ve got to think about it. Other questions we have lots of people
up here who will answer your questions. Did I see somebody over there?
Oh I can see him. Steve Rall councilmen from Moris ville SPEAKER CHANGE
Will there ever be a way it seems like its still pitchy and its is a
long time for the legislate to look at ?? of the amendment of
constitutional amendment of the ?? besides having a way ??  15 years
SPEAKER CHANGE Well its legislation would have to have a way referendum
?? the referendum would be soon it just wouldn&#39;t take affect for a
while. SPEAKER CHANGE John: I have a question for you sir and that would
be if the referendum would happen soon but to law makers five years is a
long time ??because SPEAKER CHANGE The only thing I wanna say is and and
I don&#39;t wanna get too much caught on the ?? coz that wasn&#39;t the
purpose here today Senator Jackson and I will file our bill. Make no
mistake I think I speak for everyone up here much to their ?? Sorry ??,
Our goal is to get this done and if we&#39;re gonna provide you know
we&#39;ve difference in opinions not different opinions but different
paths I don&#39;t care which path gets passed I fully support the same
concept fully support senator Jacksonized concept. If somebody else have
got a better concept or different concept that we can get passed and we
can get it to the governor and signed then I support that concept. So I
don&#39;t want us to get too caught up in the manutore or the
differences of the bill because to me whats more importantly is this
become law in North Carolina and that&#39;s everyone&#39;s goal in this
