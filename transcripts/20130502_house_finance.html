recognize Representative Brawley five Mecklenburg 2% hospital a 17 or

no controversy that sense to me whether the bulk of the levees and jam
chairs the massive litigation quiet in the room and for sure that he was
chairman of the com port and this is of the bill to implement the
strategic transportation investment program that was laid out by the
governor is pressed off of last week it was heard on Tuesday and
transportation committee and will be discussing today in the finance
committee , indicated it does make some changes because we're changing a
transportation plan that the fuel that of the business bad bank AG of
the essentially the transportation plan under which were operating dates
to 1989 than as an example I was referring in transportation in 1989
when of trouble nine communications program consisted of a man of
quarters at a telephone calling card if I wanted to send someone text
information I wrote about 1:00 AM and found a fax machine that could
have a computer in my office that was connected only to the power of the
lows, 40 MB card of 640 K of memory Randolph’s three of the cost about
$4000 of that today and I've got something in my pocket with 1000 times
the storage that cost me about $350 lacking send and receive text e-mail
pictures access the Internet which nobody knew about 1989 the world has
changed a lot but we're still doing leads the same way we did in 1989
with the advent of new analytical techniques for bank of the
mathematical models of our roads react with the economy it's time that
we take advantage of those changes in technology so with the Logos all
have followed gentle prodding from there to be given overview of the
background will have staff explain the bill that Congress some issues
and will start taking questions that are trotting with the permission
from this chairman of the someone is alleged nice please some surf you
will just such a name for the long record in the four of concern Mr.
Chairman of GM truck and Chief Operating Officer wolf: former
transportation a less you'll probably already where north Carolina’s the
four fastest growing buys stake in the nation are that creates is some
challenges and transportation (SPEAKER CHANGES)  not all that good
growth will be uniformly spread across the state but how are we going
that our stay together and be more competitive as we move four or the
bigger challenges we have been providing this transportation services
across the state is revenue of the three major revenue sources that we
have today motor fuels taxes alone be of the season I will use tax of
two of those have been rapidly declining, especially since the recession
started one of those 60% of which comes from motor fuels tax we believe
over the next 10 to 20 years will continue to decline from early to call
Sunday at increase fuel efficient vehicles that we have so even though
where the 10th, the highest five motor fuels tax break and this in the
nation and the highest in the southeast ballet will not go to calls a
steady increase revenue but calls consumption will continue to decline
but we also believe that even with the population growth that will save
(SPEAKER CHANGES) not all that will be good will see growth in all those
revenues from early in the bee of the city's the calls were born along

Getting their driver's license and driving as quickly as they used to
and then highway use tax which will grow slowly and it'll grow slowly
based on the increase in sales of vehicles that we'll see as the economy
improves. However, none of them will make up for the biggest problem we
anticipate which is over the next 10 years, we'll see 1.3 million
increase in population, that's 1.3 million people increased in North
Carolina and over the same 10 year period, we'll see a net decrease in
about 1.7 billion in transportation revenues due to those uncertainties
with the consumption motor fuels. Then also, it doesn't include
uncertainty in our federal revenues. Right now, federal revenues account
for about 25% of our total revenue but out of that, a quarter of that is
75% of it is coming from federal motor fuel tax, 25% is coming from
general fund, federal general fund and primarily through our increased
debt to our nation. So we do believe that congress have to make tough
decisions in the future about debt ceilings, transportation in that
discussion will be at risk. So what do we do? That gap between
population growth and revenue projections is what the secretary and the
governor have referred to as the infrastructure gap that we see coming
and there are two potential solutions to that infrastructure gap. One is
what do we do with revenues but it can't be just increase the rates on
the three primary means that we have today. And the second is, before we
consider those other sources and various rates, how do we improve our
efficiency to make sure that we are responsibly showing our citizens
that we are doing every possible thing with every dollar that we have
today to maximize it's productivity and our transportation economy and
our proposal is what we call the Strategic mobility formula which is
40-40-20 which will be briefed in detail by the physical staff but it's
really a two step process. One, this bill addresses how do we be more
efficient with these resources and then the second step would be to work
with the general assembly, the industry, the mayors and the cities and
towns and the county commissioners across our state over the next 12
months and let's identify what do we do to fund transportation needs in
the future differently than what we have done in the past because we
know sustaining that will not sustain our needs. And so, based on our
analysis, preliminary analysis, on what we have currently in our ten
year plan versus what we think we can produce with this proposal, we run
something called the ?? ?? which is the transportation and economy
development and infrastructure system on all of these scenarios and we
believe that in our ten year plan, it's producing about a 175 projects
and a 174 thousand short and long term jobs, not changing our revenues
but making our parts more efficient and with this proposal this will
translate into 260 projects and about 240 thousand jobs across the
state. So significant improvement primarily because it is focused on
travel time savings across the state whether it is a travel time savings
in an urban area that seen congestion or its travel time savings linking
at local community to rural jobs center, the closest, how do we reduce
that travel time to make sure more of our citizens has access to jobs
and employments opportunity, and so with that Mr. Chairman, I'd turn it
over to the physical resource staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. ??, you have the floor, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I'd briefly go over the contents of the bill
using the summary basis for the discussion as well as the one page
diagram, it's actually two page diagram with an explanation of the new
formula. part of the bill part 1 section 1 point 1 is the ?? of the new
funding plan for transportation and investments and if you look over it,
this will explain the new formula that is in acted by this section 1.1.
if you look at the page 1 of that charge, this new formula will contain
how we trust fund revenue and federal aid funds exempted from that</p>

will be administrative costs, bond interest and bond redemption, and as
well a some exemptions that are currently in law such as federal funds,
Cemac funds, and competitive discretionary grants from federal
government, and some other exemptions you'll see listed in 1.7.  The
rest of the funds will be subject to a 40-40-20 distribution, which
you'll see on page 2 of the diagram, and be used for 3 different types
of projects, strategic, state-wide mobility projects, regional impact
projects, and division needs projects.  40% will be authorized for
state-wide projects, 40% for regional projects, and 20% for division
projects.  And you can see on this list the types of projects that are
authorized for each segment of the fund, subject to the formula.  For
instance, the state-wide interstates, national highway routes and so
forth, regional and division will include everything that's in the
state-wide, in addition to other types of projects you'll see listed.
The scoring for each segment will be 100% on the state-wide level, 100%
quantitative data on the regional level, 70% quantitative data and 30%
local input, and at the division, 50% quantitative data, and 50% local
input.  And at the bottom, you'll also notice that there are some
federal funds that would be subject to different prioritization under
the division needs tier, based on the requirements of federal law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]At this time, we're going to ask staff, can you and so
go over the fiscal impacts of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chair.  My name is Amna Cameron, and I
am staff at the Fiscal Research Division.  If you look at your packet
that includes the bill, that is a packet that includes the bill, the
bill summary, and at the end, the fiscal note for this bill.  I'm going
to start of page 1 of the fiscal note, in which there is a table that
shows the total impact to the state.  There is no impact to the highway
fund, or the highway trust fund as a result of this bill.  There are
changes to the aid to municipality program, and that is the impact you
see in the local impact section on page 1.  I'm going to move on and
cover the 3 charts with you that are in the fiscal note, so if you turn
to page 5 of the fiscal note, this chart indicates the impact to the
highway fund.  Sections 2.1 through 2.9 impact the secondary road
program, and sections 3.1 and 3.2 impact the aid to municipalities.  As
you can see in chart 1, the aid to municipalities requires an
appropriation of $53.4 in the 1st year, $48.1 in the 2nd year, and
secondary roads will largely be minimized.  So therefore, there is a
balance of $8.4 million in the 1st year, $28 million in the 2nd year,
and it'll be up to the appropriations process to determine how to expend
those funds.  Moving to the next chart, this is a chart specific to the
aid to municipalities.  This law changes it to restrict it only through
allocations from the highway fund.  Currently it's highway fund, and
highway trust fund.  And this tries to hold your aid to municipalities
monies harmless at a 5 year level.  There are indications, if you
compare the '14 and '15 fiscal years, the first 2 fiscal years in the
chart, those are based on the statutory adjustments, but the chart in
the front of the bill, those 2 numbers are different because that's
built on the base budget.  And so it's this table 2, at which the
analysis was performed, that's based on the statutory adjustments for
this year, which eliminated about $6 million in those accounts due to
the drop in motor fuel consumption.</p>

<p id="15:00">
Therefore, at the five-year point, the ?? Municipalities is held
harmless and you can see that by $806,000 at the end of the year 5. In
your packet of information is a city by city guide onto all of the
impacts to every city in this state. We will now move on to the Highway
Trust Fund in table 3. There is a statutory formula of 4.8 percent off
the top of the Highway Trust Fund that goes to administration. This
statutory formula is being repealed. It is up to the appropriation
process to determine the new amount that will be appropriated directly
for administration. It is assumed that amount will be lower. Moving on,
items 2 through 7, the Intrastate Urban Loop, secondary roads, aging
municipalities, mobility fund, and the Gap fund associated with Garden
Parkway in ?? will shift into this new fund in line 8, the Strategic
Transportation Infrastructure fund. Thank you, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, we have a . . .
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, excuse me just a minute, Representative Brawley.
Rep. Lucas, ?? your purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If we have questions about fiscal notes, should we ask
them now or later?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is that all right with you, Rep. Brawley? I think that
might make sense to proceed that way. Please, state your inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. It's a question for staff, for Miss
Cameron. And that is what does it mean in the bill summary on the bottom
of page 1 of your fiscal note when you write, I guess you write, that
the plan phases out the Highway Fund secondary road construction? Can
you give me an example of that? I'm trying to figure out how much this
plan hurts Durham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure, yes, Sir. Currently the secondary road
construction program is performed by the Highway Fund and the Highway
Trust Fund. Within the secondary road program, you have a secondary
unpaved road paving program. In this bill the construction program which
is an improvement will be limited to the Highway Trust Fund. There will
be $50 million that is appropriated in year 1 to the normal construction
program. The maintenance account also in section 2 is being broadened so
while it used to refer to secondary road maintenance, it will now have a
broader purpose to be secondary road maintenance and improvements to
capture more of those expenses. But these two accounts, the Construction
funds and the Highway fund and the Highway Trust Fund, serve the same
purpose. So it was deemed that only one fund should have these
responsibilities. The unpaved road paving will be limited to $12 million
in the Highway fund and Gen. ?? could answer best of impacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I may, a short follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Sir, you're recognized for follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm just trying to . . . I haven't been on
transportation for a while. Remind me. As an example of a secondary
road, would be what?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? Avenue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blust, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My question has to do with the repeal of the statutory
4.8 percent for administration. What percent has historically been . . .
Maybe not going back too far but say, the last 5 or 6 years. What
percent has of the 4.8 percent set aside has actually been used for
administration. Were we up against that cap or were there dollars that
we could move. I think we had moved a few times, specifically made some
transfers. I'm just wondering what the historical data is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I will need to get more analysis. The transfers that
have been made in the past have been the Highway fund administration but
that is a maximum of 4.8 and I believe it's probably around 4.6, 4.7 as
actual expenditures.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think one of the questions
has already shown one big change between this plan and the way we've
done things in the past. We currently</p>

you have a series of silos and there's money in the silos and you get
your money from the silo for the project in which it fits for example,
Whiterail project in Charlotte is part of a transit silo that comes off
the top but right now Mecklenburg County is the only county that gets
that money if there's urban loop money and you want some of that you
have to have an urban loop what we're talking about doing is going away
from silos and into transportation funding and rather than you build
what you can get funded you get funded and use it where you need it in
your area. It's a real radical ideal you get money for transportation if
you're a big city and you need commuter rail then you do commuter rail
if you get money for transportation got lots of unpaved roads you pave
your roads if you need bridges you build bridges but we're not going to
tell you what you need on the three layers on this we have state
projects that are designed for connectivity these are multi-region this
isn't just big city one of the examples I think of would be projects
southeast from Charlotte and into Anson County and directly east from
Charlotte into Stanley County. Stanley and Anson Counties are losing
population and have unemployment rates above twenty percent and part of
the reason is there is not a good road to get from ??  into Charlotte to
get a job on Sunday afternoon you can get to Wadesboro in forty-five
minutes but on Monday morning at 8:00 it takes you an hour and a half.
If you could get from Wadesboro to downtown Charlotte on a good road you
could still live in Wadesboro and work in Charlotte or work at say the
Harris Teeter distribution facility in Indian Trail in Union County near
the Mecklenburg County line that kind of connectivity is not promoted
the way we do business now. And that's one of the things we hope to do.
The second thing all projects compete on their merit not on the
political ability of the guys that like it. What's best for North
Carolina and helps us grow and as far as ma'am Frank got some stuff he
wants to add[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Iler co-chair of
transportation[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Iler you have the floor
sir[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chairman I'm going be very brief
because it's  a lot of questions in peoples mind about the word formula
is that what was the word used up to now? And so, any formula word is
going to be is not going to be the word we use until the department
begins to develop formulas in the near future and the joint legislative
transportation oversight committee Representative Torbett and myself be
chairing will yet to review the formulas in August, October, and January
and the department has assured us we will be doing this as a team effort
and we will be full informed as to what those are going to be but the
ideal is that state-wide projects are going to be whatever they are so
if you look at a chart which I think is out there saying well here's
what this region had and now here's what this region has that's apples
and oranges so  the state-wide money isn't even shown in the second part
of that chart is a break-out by region so not to worry we're going be
the formula quote the bad word I didn't want to use at all those
formulas within this will be develop and all I got to say when I finally
put together the charts I was seeing into simple numbers I started
figuring out that the connectivity piece economical development piece is
going to equal jobs and that's going to be most of the state-wide
projects as well as filtering down to the regional division and I'm not
in love with it but I really got to like what the out-of-box thinking
that's going on and I think it's going to be a tremendous asset to the
state [SPEAKER CHANGES]do we get to review the formulas [SPEAKER
CHANGES]thank you chairman Iler in the discussion on the state projects
the state projects will be 100 percent data driven and there wont be a
lot of local input things are going to be multi-county the regional
projects which tend to be multi-county projects as well</p>

Wait a minute...Wait a minute...Am I looking at...6.1...Yeah! Department
of Transportation  6.1 beginning on line 42 The Department of
Transportation shall report to the joint legislative Transportation
Oversight Committe and the Fiscal Resource Decision no later than
August 15, 2013 on the Department's recommended formulas that will be
used in the prioritization process to rank highway and non-highway
projects. And then there are additional reporting dates of: October 23,
2013, final report on highway and inter-mobile by January 1st, 2014. And
then there will be additional reports required by Section 2 and those
will all be by the General Assembly. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
If the Chair could propose one more, please, starting with line 44, it
appears there's a change dealing with the Turnpike Authority reporting
to ?? instead of the General Assembly, and I was wondering if you could
speak to that. Or, to be more specific, how that would work. And, the
Chair does not mean to put you on the spot, I was just very curious
about that change. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, I'm going to ask if anyone in Staff can address it, because I
can't. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Chair would be glad to even hold that until...I'm sorry...Mr. ??
You'd like to speak to that? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. This references projects in addition to the
listed projects that the Turnpike Authority could undertake...Before
they did that, they would have to consult with ?? according to this
provision on page 24. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, Representative Collins please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]
One question, please. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I noticed that under the Regional Impact part, it says that the funds
are going to be allocated by population distribution regions, and I
think that from what you told me this is the only one of the three
categories that this is true for because you said  the statewide, that
was not true for...Is that correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Statewide...[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm on page 4, line 12, actually line 14 is where the word 'population'
occurs. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Statewide is not population dependent, it's completely data-driven.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a follow-up...[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir, you're recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think the way I'm reading this, that if this particular division has
27% and this division has 12% of the population, this division is going
to get 27% of the money, and this division is going to get 12% of the
money in this category, is that correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
If the Chair will indulge me, Mr. Trogman would like to answer [SPEAKER
CHANGES]
Yes, sir, Jim Trogman, it's the region population, not the division, so
to that region would be the region's share of the statewide population.
The division allocation is equal share. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
One final followup. I like to vacation in Representative Tyne's district
in the Wintertime, when there's nobody there, when I can drive from
Rocky Mount to Nag's Head in about two hours if I speed a little bit,
probably shouldn't say that with the Transportation people here, but
anyway, my family likes to go in the Summertime, I made the mistake last
year of going the wrong way went up the Virginia way and came up from
Elizabeth City, instead of going the way I normally do and it took two
hours to get from Grandy on the other side of the sound there to Nag's
Head. What about areas like this that are low in population, if we're
going by their permanent population, but have a huge upsurge in their
population during part of the year? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Some of that will be answered by the formulas, but I would also suggest,
that what we're talking about is huge tourist traffic, because that's
across the whole state, and that's a big economic issue, and that's
going to fall under the state plan, anyway. Because you're going to be
coming in on US Highways and Interstates. Because that's also while the
road will accommodate a lot of beach traffic, there's a lot of other
things that will go on it. One of the things we realize, even though we
may hate it, there's an awful lot of big trucks that are on those roads,
and every one of them is full of jobs. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I may add to that, you may notice the 60% is not based on
population...</p>

and the Chair is going to extend him that chance Representative
Steinburg did you want to speak on this issue[SPEAKER CHANGES]yes Mr.
Chairman thank you with regard to the ?? bridge I would like point out
to a couple of things that as to why this particular project is
essential we are those of us in the Northeast in the fourth poorest
congressional district in the country, fourth poorest in the country the
tidewater area, of Norfolk and Hampton roads is one of the fastest
growing and most prosperous regions of the country so there is a ??
economy between these two particular items what we are trying to do is
establish a foreign trade zone using the port of Norfolk is one of the
catalyst to try and create a new gateway into North Carolina one which
will bring a great deal of prosperity to that area that has been without
prosperity for about thirty plus years so we can really change the
dynamics one of the criteria in establishing this foreign trade zone is
to smooth forward traffic there are two things that folks look at they
want areas that are using this foreign trade zone in Norfolk to be
within sixty miles or ninety minutes and that's twelve months a year, so
the traffic can flow from points of assembly back and forth the points
of assembly being in North Carolina back and forth to the port of
Norfolk so it is for four or five months a year that would be impossible
with the amount of traffic that particular region has as result of not
being an alternative road to the outer backs not to mention the health
and safety issue of evacuation and so on and so forth so from new
economic standpoint this bridge is critical for us to complete the
proposed changes to create a foreign trade zone in Northeastern North
Carolina will truly bring prosperity to a region long overdue and that
will change the dynamics for decades to come so I just appreciate Mr.
Chairman for allowing me to make those comments that relates to that
particular project in the future of Northeastern North Carolina indeed
Eastern North Carolina thank you[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, and now
interested ?? is going to ask Representative ?? Hoyt to speak to this
but Representative Bumgardner also has asked to speak on this the Chair
is going to extend him the chance to that you have the floor sir[SPEAKER
CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chairman yes sir, one thing that Representative
Tine said was that this project was within six months of the beginning
that's not true this project the Garden Parkway is what I'm speaking of
I've already introduced two bills to get rid of the Garden Parkway the
voters of Gaston County have been looking for some closure on this
project for a long time it was a centerpiece of the campaign in the last
election several elections have come and gone and every election the
voters of Gaston County said they're not interested in this project and
this project is along way from it's not approved it's not anything right
now it's just a piece of paper there has been some money spent and that
needs to stop because we're wasting money here I purposely didn't
mention the ?? bridge and the Wilmington Skyway and my bills that I
introduced to get rid of the Garden Parkway because those are not my
projects their not my district you know that's not my battle to fight
I'm here to fight for the district I represent and that's the support
I'm interested in doing thank you.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, this time
we're going recognize the bill ?? to speak to the amendment sent forth
by Representative Tine[SPEAKER CHANGES]thank you Mr. Chairman probably
in someway I got to thank you, you did me a favor. First I want to
challenge the premise of your statement that without this being a
legislative it wouldn't be built now there's been a long time in North
Carolina that would've been a true statement if you didn't legislate it
it wouldn't be built because it wouldn't been scored based on objective
criteria then as you and Representative Steinburg have laid out all the
reasons</p>

<p id="50:00">
why the project is necessary and should be built, you're making the case
for why we need this new transportation approach. That the fourth
poorest Congressional district in the nation with a small population
should be able to qualify for this road based on economic reasons that
you name and not just on how much political power you can pull together
in the General Assembly. Because the road benefits the whole state based
on all the information that you have put out. So I would say you've
given me the best argument for passing the plan, but let's don't hobble
the plan to begin with by saying well, we're gonna do the new plan, but
everybody that's got a project is going to do the new plan, but we're
still going to legislate my project. Because if we do that, we're kind
of wasting our time. We've either got to fix it or not fix it, but we
can't half fix it. So I would ask that you not approve the amendment,
but let the projects go forward, including, well, all of them, and
whatever new ones we add. Let's spend the money the best way we can, and
I'm certainly confident that a lot of the projects that people are
afraid of losing, they will get even stronger support because now it's
not just how well they can convince us. They've got objective data to
support their project, and that's what drives the state money and the
big projects like ?.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] On the time amendment, Rep. Moore, please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the bill sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. The gentleman may --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Brawley, just concentrating more so on the Garden
Parkway, as you know, we have, we're developing a new inter-modal yard
near the airport. What would be the, if this project the Garden Parkway,
how wold that enhance, or if the project was not put forth, how would
that impact not only Gaston county but the region as far as economic and
potential for jobs and maximizing our new inter-modal yard out by the
airport by Charlotte-Douglas?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rather than address the specific project of the Garden
Parkway, what I would say is that another crossing of the Catawba river
in that area is needed. It might be that one. It might another. That
decision could still be open. I don't believe that we live and die on
the Garden Parkway project, but there does need to be another crossing.
Having done real estate in Gaston county for a number of years with my
office in Mount Holly, access to southern Gaston county's hard, and that
in many cases you either cross on I-85. There's a small bridge on 29, or
else you go all the way down into South Carolina and cross Highway 49 on
Buster? Bridge. But as to the actual details on the Garden Parkway, I'm
not in the weeds that deep.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Brawley, Iredell, on the time of the amendment,
please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman, it's my
understanding these project are not eliminated. They are now a part of
the formula. And while I would like to put bills in to tell you how much
to spend in Iredell county and how much is coming to us. I think we're
all much better served, if we like the formula, go ahead and support the
formula. Leave it up to the Dept. of Transportation. Let them make the
decisions as we have set out here. They have responsibility for the
statewide decisions. Each district has its own right to argue their
position, but we leave it up to them, and I think our state will best be
served if we defeat this amendment and support the bill as is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Tine, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To respond to some of the comments that were made in
regards to the --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to speak a second time on
the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In regards to the six-month statement that I made, my
understanding is that if litigation from certain interests, that we
would be there as far as the DOT process is concerned. I apologize if I
was inaccurate in the manner in which I stated that. The other issue is,
again, and we've sort of mentioned it several, is that we don't know
what that formula is going to look like until after we've voted for the
bill. If the formula was in here and I could look at it and say okay, I
understand how these are going to be scored, and we'll meet the payoff
of [CUTS OFF]</p>

…the investment that we’ve been able to put forth at this point. Then I
would be making a different consideration in my vote. So again without
that information to be able to exactly say how these are going to go,
that’s why I’m bringing forth the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Starnes, on the tine
amendment please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m going to ask Mr.Trogden if he would offer an
opinion on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Trogden. Representative Starnes has posed an
inquiry and I think perhaps for Mr. Trogden’s peace of mind maybe you
should state the inquiry again. Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Trogden. It looks like you have a plan where
projects are rated based on the need as compared to other projects
within the state or region or localities. It seems like a good idea
because you’re trying to take the politics out of it where road projects
are assessed and funded on their merit as opposed to the political
pressure so does this begin an unraveling of what you’re trying to do?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] From the department standpoint, to do the best I can
to stay out of the middle of a circular firing squad, I would say that
we do support the broad concept to get as many projects out of statute
as we possibly can, understanding there’s a transition that we’re going
through with the ones that are already built on bonds but we have
constantly supported that position. It’s better to get them out and it’s
not because we feel like we’re smarter than anyone else in determining
the merits of the project but we do believe with the system we’re
proposing is that locals will determine their priorities that will build
from that local system then the region will determine its priorities and
when the projects do well there, they have support across the state.
It’s those decisions that are driving it. Why we’ve gotten to this point
is because we’ve had limited resources and not the flexibility to do
that, people have had to come to the general assembly because they’re
frustrated at the inability to get projects scheduled and we’re trying
to avoid that frustration and build that grass roots support all across
the state. I hope that answers your question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Wells on the tine amendment, please
state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman may speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I may be overly sensitive but when the bill’s sponsor
starts off talking about the counties east of Charlotte and their
connectivity, I would point out that Anson and Stanley have suffered
some economic setbacks but there is a county northwest of Charlotte that
has suffered more setbacks than both of those counties combined. Catawba
County’s link to Charlotte is Highway 16, which turns into a two lane
shortly after you cross the Catawba County line and remains don’t have a
direct line to Charlotte and one possible connector to the Charlotte
area from Catawba County has ended up in this bill with a black line
through it. Now I support the formula in general and I apologize for
being a little suspect of DOT but I’m in not just the NSA not just the
metro area but the City of Hickory is split into three DOT divisions. A
municipality is in three different DOT divisions. I would like to see
this language in the bill. I support this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman would the gentlemen yield for question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Wells will you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bell, he does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The direct connection you were referring to that’s
been lined out. Would you tell me which one that is?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Garden Parkway. Because the difficulty is on 16,
we’re actually going a roundabout way through Gaston County to get to
Charlotte. That’s the quicker way to get to Charlotte from my community.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] 321 to 85, yeah. That’s the way I take.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So 321 to 85 and the Garden Parkway would eliminate
some of the congestion on 85 that is creating a problem.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative do you wish to speak a second time on
the tine of…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No it’s a conversation I need to have some…

[Speaker Changes] Iler on the time of amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Just a foot note on the Cape Fear skyway. I believe we
have a couple of Wilmington Representatives here. Representative
hamilton and Davis and is Catilin in the room? I’m not sure. But anyway,
the cape fear skyway was a very expensive project concept and is
basically being rethought by the MPO for much less expensive. It was
almost 2 billion dollars in the initial concept and its being rethought
to try to come up with a lot less expensive alternative to be
recommended. Hopefully through the new formula we’ll indicate, its very
necessary to have a new bridge across cape fear river, but that was just
too expensive. We’re not considered about that coming out at all.
