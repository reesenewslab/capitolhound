<p id="00:00">
Welcome to the first meeting on Senate Finance. First of all, I’ll
introduce the Sergeant of Arms, Leslie Wright, Anderson Meadows, Donna
Blake, Justin Owens, Billy Fritcher. Thank you very much for helping us
organize, including you, Mr. King. Thank you.
Secondly, pages. Ira Strickland, Brent Jackson. Ross, where are you?
There you go, welcome. I’ve got Mark Moser, Senator Goolsby. Ok, thank
you very much. Appreciate you being here. And Alex Brown, Senator
Barringer. Thanks very much. We appreciate it and we hope your stay is
rewarding.
We’ve got a lot of work ahead of us today. We’ve got an important bill.
House Bill for. Representative Howard has done a remarkable job with
this bill and just for everyone to understand, the necessity and the
importance of this since 2009, the unemployment fund has been insolvent
according to the previous employment security commissioner. Chairperson.
And under that circumstance, we have to find a solution to solving this
$2.5 to $2.7 billion hole. That’s four times worse than its ever been in
its existence, and it plays havoc with not having monies available for
if another recession does happen to come. This bill that Representative
Howard has introduced and has passed the House, will be discussed today
and I believe that we do have some opportunity for a public hearing. If
it goes long, we may end up coming back this afternoon and continuing
it, but we want this bill to move forward so that it can go to the
Senate.
Do you want to explain anything…
First of all, House Bill for UI fund insolvency and program changes.
Representative Howard, welcome to Senate Finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As your chairman just stated, this bill did
pass the House on the third reading reading yesterday with a very good
bipartisan vote and we were thrilled. I’m going to try to be brief and
give you the important pieces of the bill and then be prepared to answer
any of your questions.
The issue, as Senator Rucho just explained to you, is that we currently
have a big debt with federal government. Actually, since I started doing
the presentation in the House, I had to change the number. Opposed to
$2.4 billion, we now owe $2.5, and this debt is pay is due the federal
government and it is due from all the employers across the state of
North Carolina. It is not a state debt. It has nothing to do with the
general fund. It is something that is total administered through the
division of employment security, but the state employers pay into this
fund. So you want to ask the consequences of the debt. Currently, this
debt puts North Carolina at a disadvantage with respect to our abilities
to recruit and bring in new jobs into the state of North Carolina. The
first question that new employers that are looking at North Carolina,
one of the first questions that we’re being asked, if we relocate into
North Carolina, do we become an immediate debtor, and the answer is yes.
You can see why folks would be a little bit reluctant and it certainly
does not make us competitive with the states that surround us because
they do not have this type of debt, so we’re five steps backwards in the
beginning.
This is a proposal and it offers an alternative to the current repayment
plan which has a final payment date, currently, of 2019 at best. I say
that because we have no assurance that the interest rate that the
federal government is currently imposing against this debt will remain
stable, so it could fluctuate and it could be further. This puts tax
increases on</p>

<p id="05:00">
the ?? is putting tax increases on all of the employers.  This is the
schedule for repayment of the debt to the federal government.  They
impose the addition feudal tax increases on all of our employers.  It
wasn’t our choosing.  They put the numbers in place against each of the
employers.  So if you want to ask what does this bill do?  This bill
will achieve total repayment of the debt by the last quarter of 2015, it
could move to 2016 but we believe we will have the debt, the 2.5 billion
dollar debt paid in full and we will also a billion dollars in or pseudo
benefit fund which makes us solvent and stable.  We worked on the bill
for many months and I’m going to stand here and tell you it’s not
perfect but we did the very best that we could bringing all the moving
parts together and every change, it’s like dominos, if you have a change
it effects all the other pieces of the bill.  Nobody loves this bill so
it pretty much makes it a good bill because everybody hates it but we
have had nothing but 100 percent cooperation from all of the players,
all of the stake holders that have come to the table with us with few
exceptions.  The bill does a lot of things and I’m going to highlight
the major components of the bill we have an employment security reserve
fund is the dollars that go into that fund is the twenty percent surtax
that all of your employers are paying and that's been pretty loosely
managed for lack of a better word note,  no fingers being pointed here,
but we're now going to restrict the uses of that fund and the fund will
cap at fifteen million dollars on amount of the interest paid the
previous year, remember we are paying interest on the debt every year.
We've paid for two years and so any excess funds in that security
reserve account will immediately be swept to the federal government to
help repay the debt.  We also found that there's a worker training trust
fund in training and employment account.  We found several little
accounts sitting in the division of unemployment and we eliminated those
accounts and we are transferring all of the balances of those accounts
to the ?? as soon as this bill is passed.  We found as a special
employment security administration fund that had sixteen million dollars
in it, and we are moving ten million dollars out of that fund again to
pay toward our debt.  The financing charges and changes that you’re
going to see with this bill.  I want you to think of, I’m a semi farm
person, three silos, pseudo tax, feudal tax and the surtax.  Three silos
of money.  The feudal tax a federal tax should be forty two dollars per
person per employee per year.  This is where the federal government has
come in and increases that twenty one dollars per year per employee
until the debt is paid, That’s a feudal tax.  That fund can only be used
for one purpose and that is to administer the program all across the
nation.  We are a donor state.  We send our money to Washington and we
get a little piece of it back but again we can't change that we can't do
anything about that.  The second silo that</p>

<p id="10:00">
I want you to think about is the SUTA tax, that's the state tax. And
this is the fund where the benefits are allocated from. This is the fund
that we are in a deficit and we are being required to borrow $2.5
billion dollars. The SUTA tax they are increasing that contribution rate
by .06 and moving that formula starting at .06 low end and it moves
right on up to the high end. So employers are being asked to contribute
more into the SUTA  fund. Then there's that 20%, third silo, that 20% of
that the, that's a surtax and that's the amount that each of your
employers are paying in addition to the FUTA tax, the SUTA tax and the
surcharge, that 20% surcharge has been in place for many years and
again, we've used it for things that were maybe not correct but that
stopped. That will be used for that one purpose only now. And once we
have one billion dollars in our account to pay benefits and to pay
interest, that surtax is going to come off. If we fall under the billion
dollars, that surtax goes back on. There's an automatic trigger there.
Business and industry everybody knows about this, everybody is in
agreement.
There's three groups that have a special federal cutout, it's the
Cherokee Indians, the tribe, and let me say upfront, they're doing the
right thing. They're paying everything that they're supposed to pay and
I wish everybody was doing likewise. But the tribe, all your cities and
your counties and the state of North Carolina uses a special option and
the option being that they do not pay any SUTA tax, they are removed
from that. And when they have claims against, their employees have
claims, then they choose an option to reimburse the fund. We have
changed that. Instead of using a credit card and riding on the backs of
all of the employers across the state, and we're one of them, so it is
what it is, they now will post 1% of their taxable wages in an escrow
account for lack of a better word, that will be a withdrawal account. So
they have money in their account when the claims are paid. They will
true up that account once a year so they will always have 1% of taxable
wages in their account.
They will not be using a debit card opposed to a credit card for just
simplification. Benefit changes, now I'm sure you all have gotten a
couple of emails in the last few days about the changes in the benefits.
That is a piece, one piece of a change that we are making. And it's a
small piece. And I hope that at some point in time that folks will begin
to look at the entire bill because it's much  bigger than those benefit
changes. We looked at other states and what they were doing and how they
were operating, one of the changes that we made was to reduce the
maximum duration of benefits from 20 weeks, currently it's 20 weeks, 26
weeks sorry, and we're going to 20 weeks. We understand that overall 16
weeks normally is the time that people need to be on the unemployment
but things are different now because of the economy. That is on a
sliding scale, it's attached to the other...</p>

rate for this state and will be reviewed twice a year to adjust those
number of weeks. Anywhere from a range from 5 to 12 to all the way to
the 20 week max. Another piece of the, of the bill is the calculation of
the weekly benefit amount. And in the past that formula was changed and
it's based on the average of the last two quarters worked. That's was
the bill will do. Currently we are calculating those benefits on the
highest quarters. We're going back to the average, average wages in
those quarters. The maximum benefit set will be $350 dollars opposed to
the formula that is currently providing $535 dollars. North Carolina if
you're looking at the bill curve we are well outside that curve. We are
the highest maximum benefit state in the southeast. Somebody asked well
how did you come up with $350. We simply took the seven surrounding
southern sates, the states around us. You add them together and divide
by seven and that comes out with an average. And that's where we came up
with that $350. There's other pieces in the bill. There's some program
changes, partially benefit we will have a disregard of 20% of the weekly
benefit allowance rather 10%. There will be a waiting week for all new
claims. We will remove the waivers on that waiting week provision. The
extended base period has been repealed. The extended benefit triggers.
We kept those triggers. We retained the two optional triggers, but we
will only extend emergency benefits if they are 100% federally funded.
Attach claims, if you haven't heard that word I'll quickly tell it what
that means. Employers and I'm telling you that everybody's bought in to
this and everybody knows what it is and if you think it's not pain and
bleeding from the business community there is. Attached claims, many
businesses use this as a business model. They have their best chef at a
seafood restaurant and they, business gets a little slow and say they
tell that chef you know business is slow I'm gonna let you have six
weeks or eight weeks layoff, but I want you to come back, so I'm gonna
keep myself attached to you as an employer to that employee. The
employer files the forms for unemployment. The employer files it. He
means, that means that the person, the employee, does not need to do a
job search. He can not be compliant with all of the rules and
regulations that everybody has to adhere to. He can go in six weeks and
ask for an extension of another six weeks. There's been many cases where
that has extended for three or four or five months continually with an
extension. The other employers across the state are paying for those
benefits to that for that employer. So we did make a provision for the
employers. If you want to use attached claims we're putting in a
provision. You must have a positive credit balance in your account and
it's limited to one time per employee not more than six weeks. We
believe that's fair. This qualification is based on each application for
the benefits. We have substantial fault has been eliminated and there's
a provision that talks about good calls.</p>

<p id="20:00">
how an employee can leave his employer and still draw unemployment
benefits. We removed all of those provisions with 2 exceptions.  We
retained domestic violence, if a person leaves employment because of
domestic violence, they're still eligible to draw the unemployment
benefits. And under the spousal relocation, if it is due to a military
reassignment, we retain that. That spouse can travel with their husband
or wife, and draw the unemployment. The definition for suitable work has
been clearly defined, and that definition is any work. Any work after 10
weeks of ?? benefits, that pays 100%, 120%, of the current unemployment
benefit. Mr. Chairman, that is the summary , I'll be glad to try and
answer any questions, or I can go further.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Howard, excellent job.  You are- you've explained it very clearly,
and definitely pointing out that this is designed as a re-employment
fund and not an unemployment fund of course, and then another point you
made, and  I'd like to reiterate, there was a misconception but this is
all paid for, every penny, by the employers of this state. And  it's not
like a employee benefit, so that being said, members of the committee,
do we have any questions that we can help get the answer here?
Sen. Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
Rep. Howard, I want you maybe just to touch on real quick too about the
amount per employee that the employer will have to pay at the end of the
way the bill's structured and what that will be as well if the bill does
not pass, then and just one other point I'll just mention as an
employer, last year I had to send in a check for an additional $3000 and
here a few weeks ago, I had to send in this year's check, it was an
additional $6000 dollars. So as far as employers go in the state, I can
tell you we're already feeling the impacts of what's going on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, and I hear that from all across the state. I will tell you
quickly, that North Carolina businesses have paid, have paid in $126
million in 2011, and $189 million in 2012, in ?? tax, additional ?? tax.
Now the strange part is, we still owe $2.5 billion. So what you could
quickly calculate, we have paid these extra taxes of $126 million and
also $189 million, we had made a dent in the principal, and that was to
apply to the principal. In addition to that, we have paid interest
payments on this debt of $162 million. And each day, when we open for
business, we pay out more in benefits than we are taking in. So we're
under water with the debt. It is necessary that we do some other
adjustments other than just put the taxation totally on the business
community. As Sen. Brown said, the normal amount of ?? tax should be
$42. That $42 is escalating by $21 each and every year until this debt
is paid. It goes to 63, 84, 105, all the way to 189, and that's where we
stopped our chart, hoping that 2019 that that would be removed. But
folks, that's each employer is paying this amount of money for each
employee. So if you- even if you're a small company like I am, 5 times
that amount, but what about 5,000 times that amount? Now that's getting
really serious</p>

<p id="25:00">
The money for the employers across the state. And we believe that these
are competing dollars we’re sending North Carolina employers’ dollars to
Washington D.C. Not a dime of it is being spent in North Carolina. So,
if the employers are relieved of this tax burden, this additional tax
burden, they’re gonna be able to hire more people, create more jobs, but
as long as they are continually paying out excessive taxation to repay
the debt, they’re not going to be able to do that. And, Mr. Chairman, a
very important part of the bill that I did want to focus on, was the
division of employment security. That over in commerce we also have
workforce development. And those folks are, have been at the table with
us. They know our objective. We want to put people back to work. Now I’m
be the first one to say, I know some of the deadbeats and you do too.
They’re happy as a clam to sit at home and draw unemployment. But the
majority of the people of North Carolina want a job. They want to go
back to work. And that’s the focus of workforce development. You can no
longer be incarcerated at central prison, and there was 131 of those
folks over there, that had access to the public phone. And every week
they used that public phone and called into the division to report
themselves able and available for work. We’ve stopped that. This fraud,
there’s abuse in the program. We have made provisions in the bill to
recapture those fraudulent payments, those improper payments. To bring
those dollars back into the state of North Carolina. But the workforce
development is on board with us, and once you have filed your claim,
there will be a face to face interview with a workforce development
counselor. That counselor will assess your skills, and if you need
training or retraining, we’re gonna put you over there and provide that.
These opportunity of matching a job with a claimant is gonna be the
objective of this, another objective of this bill. We want to put people
back to work. When this fund was created in 1935, part of the definition
said “short-term”. A short-term bridge from unemployment to
re-employment. That’s the objective. It was never meant to be long-term,
or to become a program that folks actually become dependent on. And
that’s what this bill will do. There’s a lot of other pieces in the
bill. And, Mr. Chairman I’ll be glad to ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman I’ve got Senator Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, Representative Howard. I think everybody knows
anecdotes of people who may not be looking to get out, find that job as
quickly as they could. But I agree with you, that the majority of people
who are drawing unemployment don’t want to be doing that. They want to
get back to work. They want to provide for their families. They want to
have that pride that comes from work and be able to feel good about
themselves when they’re at the dinner table with their families. And I
guess the concern I have is that more than half of people who are
unemployed, it takes longer than 26 weeks to find a job. 54% are
unemployed beyond 26 weeks. And so if you’re cutting back the weekly
benefit to 12 to 20 weeks on a sliding scale, we’re not recognizing the
fact that it is hard for people to get a job. There are 3 unemployed
people for every 1 position that’s open, and we also have very uneven
unemployment. North Carolina is one of the highest unemployment states
in</p>

country 9.4%. But when you start going to some of the, you well know,
you go out into the areas outside the cities, it starts getting into
double digits, 12, 13, 14, 15%. My concern about this legislation is
that it is too punitive on people who are out of work through no fault
of their own and are working, doing everything can to find a job to
support themselves.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator Meredith.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Representative Howard, thank you for the
presentation. On the attached benefits, is there a week waiting period
on the six week attach benefits also?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Every claim has one week.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma’am. And is it my understanding that $2 billion of the $2.5
billion is because of attached benefits?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Very close, yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would it be a fair statement to say that some of the employers are
gaming the system through attached benefits?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would say they’re using it for a business model.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you. Also, on the surtax. The 20% once we get to a billion.
Will it always be 20% or after we get the billion, will that percentage
change based on looking at the model and seeing, or will business, like
myself, once the billion goes down, surplus, will it become 20% again?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is triggered to be 20, sir. That will remain constant until will
build back up the billion dollars in the fund. It’s triggered to remain
at 20. If I could…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sorry, if you have a copy, a written copy of your bill, I want you to go
to section 10 because I believe if you’ve got the same copy I have, this
is something that I believe is critical for this bill. We know that
things are going to change. Senator Stein, I understand what you just
said. There is going to be, your President Pro Tempore and the Speaker
of the House will appoint four members from the House and four members
from the Senate to be on an oversight committee. This committee will
work extremely hard, arm in arm with the Division of Employment
Security. We will be looking at each of the changes, looking at ways to
further improve the system. That is a critical piece, in my opinion, of
this legislation. Don’t sign up if you don’t want to work because it’s
going to take a lot of oversight to watch this progress through the
state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, thank you. In reference to the current taxable wages of 1%
that we’re going to ask some of the groups to start contributing instead
of using a credit card, use a debit card, will they be contributing to
the $1 billion surplus?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Members of the committee, any additional questions? Senator
Jackson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Representative Howard, thank you very much. I
appreciate you bringing this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don’t think Senator Brown actually got his question answered, or I
didn’t get the part I wanted to hear out of that. You went through where
we would be if we didn’t make the changes. Where would we be with these
changes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We will have the...we will be solvent by the last quarter of 2015, at
worst, the first quarter of 2016. If we pass this legislation, this will
accelerate our repayment of the debt and also establish our billion
dollars in the fund. We can be out of this situation by the last quarter
of 2015, opposed to 2019.

<p id="40:00">
Find balance, and we went back a little bit farther than you asked. In
1999, 2000 was $1.2 billion, but as you may recall in '02, '03, we had a
recessionary period and the fund actually in '04, '05 was negative. Then
we came out of the recession, we had a short period where we were able
to build the fund up so that in '07, '08 the fund at that time had
recovered, we had a $414 billion with a B dollar balance in the trust
fund at the beginning of this great recession.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] $4 million.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] $4 million, I'm sorry I said, excuse me, sorry about
that, I was getting real excited there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I was too.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I knew that was going to follow with the bad news,
which is the great recession hit extremely hard, we had a lot more
people laid off, more people than we customarily have laid off. And the
period, the duration has been a lot longer that people have been on
unemployment during this period. So the short answer to your question
was at the beginning of the great recession we had a little over $400
million dollars in the trust fund.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just one more follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] More a statement than a question. Ladies and gentleman
I run a business with 77 employees. I went form 104 employees down to
34, so my company will be paying the highest rate at 6.84 or better, it
will cost a ton of money, but what it will do more than anything else,
it will cost someone their job because I'm going to have to lay somebody
off to be able to pay my unemployment. So with the passage of this bill,
and I will vote for it, with the passage of this bill and I understand
the necessity for where we are, do not expect employment to tick up,
because these are heavy taxes on employers. We didn't cause a recession.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I didn't set the length of time. I didn't set the
rates, I wasn't even here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I didn't spend the money elsewhere. I didn't not do
the rainy day fund but yet it's fallen on the employers back and I don't
know what happened before we got here in 2010 and that's water over the
dam but I certainly hope that this is the fix and that we will never
ever find ourselves in a position where we've got to lay this on
employers again because we're in a soft economy and so someone in my
company will lose their job because I won't be able to pay them, one or
two people, excuse me, may lose their job because I will not be able to
pay them because of taxes because taxes do one thing, they change
behavior and you have got to adjust your behavior to your bottom line.
And so with this passage of this bill I want to state that I'll be soon
running a not-for-profit business. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe what you're saying and I respect what you're
saying because I'm deeply troubled with the 31 re-freshmen members of
the house that are coming in, this is their first vote on a really
critical bill. However I will share something with you, a couple of
weeks ago my economic developer in Davy county called me and asked me if
I could come over and meet with a perspective person that is looking at
North Carolina. And I will admit he had already looked at the roads and
the schools and the things that they would. The first question Senator
Tucker that he asked me was, Representative Howard if I come into North
Carolina, if I bring my company to North Carolina, do I become an
immediate debtor with your UI system? And the answer I had to give him
was yes sir. That's another piece of the recruitment efforts that our
economic developers, the department of commerce, that's a problem
they're facing. There is no magic line in this bill , it's everybody
working together. Businesses are paying more, cities and counties are
now posting their dollars. A lot of things are happening to make this
come together. Will it work? I certainly pray it will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I've got Senator McKissick.</p>

<p id="45:00">
Well thank you representative Howard for your presentation, a couple of
questions. I was wondering to what extent there were alternatives
evaluated that would impose lower tax on employers but also provide
greater benefits than 350 maximum that is shown in the bill today for
employees? Because there's a lot of room between the 535 weekly benefit
and 350 and I can logically assume that there's someplace in between
where the burden would not be quite as great on employees and likewise
if we were to look at repaying this debt over a longer term the burden
might not be as great on employers either.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you senator, to answer the question, we did not
set the repayment schedule at the federal level, that is mandated on us,
we can't change that. Where the [??] tax rate is going to increase,
congress will cut us no slack there, we have asked. One of the first
things that we looked at was trying to bond this debt and extend it over
a longer period of time as Senator Tucker just said. Our credit card is
maxed out. We have no - we do not have the debt capacity to bond this.
We looked at every option and again if you offer an amendment and that
amendment should pass that we change it from $350 to $400 dollars that's
just going to take that debt out longer. Everything that we change in
the bill will take the debt out for a further period of time. We looked
at everything that we thought we could possibly look at.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, let me ask you this, and yeah, in terms of those
individuals that have been adversely impacted do you - In know I asked
this question earlier during a committee that was considering this bill
previously, but do you have the numbers in terms of how many individuals
that received benefits since the recession came along they would have
received reduced benefits had this law been in affect at that time? And
likewise how would it affect the number of claimants potentially if you
had changed the period of time from 26 weeks down to either 20 or 12 and
that kind of floating range?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I believe that up [??] John did that model
because I got a copy of ti and I hope you got yours, the copy, to
address this that - i wish that we had made these changes three years
ago but we didn't. And so the only time frame we have in our face now is
today, to start. It's painful. Is it going to be painful? Short term
pain for the long term gain we hope. We have to fix it because as I
stated we - the employers have paid $126 million and $189 million,
they've already paid that in excessive taxes trying to repay the debt
and we haven't made a dent in it so it tells you that there's something
that is not working and we need to look outside of just forcing the
employers to pay additional tax.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One quick follow up. I mean the data which I have seen
suggested that there were about perhaps as many as 132,000 people that
would have been in-adversely impacted, and these are people that would
have been making between $30 and $50,000 dollars a year. I mean we're
not talking about anything except hard working middle income people and
perhaps as many as 400,000 would have been adversely impacted had we
changed the period of calculations. Is that the same data you've seen or
the numbers that have been shared with you? Because I think it's
insightful.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think it is and it looks the column that you really
want to, you know, it's a lot of proposals and estimates and no, I
agree, it's there, but I will tell you that there will be no change even
after July the 1st in the amount of the benefits for folks making up to
about $46,000 dollars. So...</p>

Here in an emergency state dealing with this crisis we're making
fundamental and permanent change to employment insurance that's going to
harm North Carolina's unemployed people. This is not a short term
bridge. This is not a short term solution. We're making fundamental
changes under duress. There's a old saying, never let a serious crisis
go to waste and this bill to me feels like that we're not letting this
serious crisis go to waste in order to make fundamental changes. If you
look the amendment I have purposed addresses section 12 on page 39 of
the original bill, reinstates the language of our current unemployment
insurance and mediocritive section here is section 12D on the second
page or the back page of the amendment. The intent of the amendment here
is to purpose we pay back the debt under the terms of the bill
representative Howard and his junior team have drafted. Once we've paid
back that debt we return to the unemployment insurance that we  have
today. So section 12D speaks to that this my amended section becomes
effective January 1st of the year when the federal unemployment tax is
no longer increased on businesses to repay the outstanding debt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chairman. We had a similar amendment on the house floor last night and I
quickly again pointed out to the member section 10 is the important part
of this bill. That we need to give the bill the opportunity to run and
have that committee in place. That's the committee that can recommend
the changes to you and I senator, to change those benefits. It takes a
vote of this body to do that. So members I would ask you to vote no on
this amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
agree, I think you've got provision in the bill to address it hopefully
as this thing pays off and I think representative Howard has touched on
the most important thing, your projections say that it should be paid
off by the end of 15 or 16 but that's not a guarantee at this point. So
until we know I think we've got a committee that will be working on this
as we move forward. So I would ask them to vote against the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. Mr Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Stein to speak to the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The impact on pseudo
rates under this bill is negligible. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No sir, I'm sorry
there [SPEAKER CHANGES] I said pseudo not feudo [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
understand. [SPEAKER CHANGES] My understanding that for a quarter 25% of
businesses they either have the same rate or a reduction in rate. Is
that wrong? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well there's also I believe it's a
138,000, I'm looking over at the staff from the division, I believe
there's 138,000 people that are currently at the zero rate and they will
immediately go to the new rate. These people had a zero rate for pseudo
tax. So we're reaching out and bringing those people in. It's a whole
different group of payers that's helping to resolve this. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Klegg might help you with
that. Would you comment about that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Good
afternoon. I'm David Klegg, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for
Employment Security since January the 4th. The number of taxpayers we
have right now who have the zero rate is about 30,000. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
And they will go up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So there's
a tax increase on every single person? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Every group. Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Klegg my
understanding is that the impact over the 3-4 year period addressing
this debt out of the pseudo increases applying it to new businesses is
about 20 million out of a $2.5 billion shortfall. Am I understanding it
correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
think that if you look at the pseudo tax only in comparison with the
amount</p>

Wanted to go back to Senator...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt just one moment, is that amendment out
in everyone's hands?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, would you distribute while Senator Nesbitt
discusses? Senator Nesbitt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. Just a little addition to the issue
that Senator Tucker raised. For the members, if we don't know history
we're doomed to repeat it and this one has a right interesting history.
In fact, you heard Representative Howard say that this was enacted in
1935 I believe she said, it's part of the social security act. and this
system has worked all that time until now. And it's designed senator
Tucker so that when hard times hit we do have the ability not to raise
taxes on business, that's the whole intent here and that's why you go in
debt so that you don't have to put a burden on business. And I want to
kind of say that because that's how the systems supposed to work and I'm
scared to death five years from now or ten years from now we'll be in
here saying, oh no, don't go in debt, we went in debt and like never got
out. It is designed to do that. And what happened to us here is kind of
a perfect storm in that we actually had a goal I believe of a billion
and a half is what we thought we needed to have going into a recession.
Staff can tell us what that was, that was back in the prior to this
recession.
The problem was we had such a short recovery between the last recession
and this one we didn't get there, but we actually had the taxes in place
and everything headed toward a billion and a half in a savings account
ready for a recession and this one just, I think everybody in this room
knows it hit quicker than any of us ever thought it would, it just
caught us overnight. And it resulted in higher unemployment than you
have in a normal recession, and it went on for five years. I firmly
believe the federal government should have either adjusted the program
to anticipate this in the future, or forgive some of what debt major
states had to incur to get through it because it is their system, it's
not our system. And none of that happened, and i hope that they will
because the system is not designed to withstand four and five years of
9% unemployment, and if it happens again you're going to have a problem
again.
And I kind of wanted to get that out there because I don't think, yes we
adjusted the rates for business up and down and in hindsight we had them
too low or we could have gotten to a billion and  a half quicker, but we
thought we had more time to get there so we were trying to spread it out
and do it right. But that's kind of the long term history of it and I
have to come along and raise taxes on business in the middle of a
recession is anathema [??] to this program, to me, to everybody in the
room. We just don't want to have to do that. And we're at a point where
somethings got to be done, representative Howard seems to get all the
good jobs in the house. Every time I see her she's very pensive. But
she's working at it hard and what I've got, Mr.Chairman if I could send
forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Your amendment has been distributed. Please speak.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. chairman. I wanted to send this forth
and I'm not going to go into great detail on it but I want to get this
idea out there to you. When you loo at this , this is a system that's
like a wave and you have good times and bad times and good times and bad
times. And we're in bad times right now. we still are at 9.4% I believe
and up Representative Howard's way with freight liner doing what it's
doing I understand they're going to lay off another 7 or 800 people,
those people up there aren't going to be able to get a job. You're going
to have 1000 people out there looking for manufacturing jobs that don't
exist. You've already got some of them on long term unemployment, I
believe they laid off 5 or 600 Representative Howard earlier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] They did.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That are probbaly drawing long term benefits. And we
have pockets like this all over the state that are just difficult for
people. The federal government recognized that and gave us 100% federal
money for extended benefits for another year. And...</p>

<p id="75:00">
so, meaning that we're giving another full year's emergency benefits,
taxing our businesses every year more and more and more but would not
allow us to make any change that affected the benefits in our state
plan. That's pretty much tying our hands to the back of the chair. So I
would ask, if I'm in the position to ask, members of the committee, I
hope you won't pass this. We tried, this same amendment was run on the
House side and it's with good intent, I understand it, but I would ask
you to defeat this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Howard. Senator Nesbitt, when this was all
being looked at after the revenue laws it adds a 400 million dollar
additional cost to the business community in paying that. And you might
think six months was a different but it actually added a year of longer
term, which my recollection is it would have increased the cost per
employee up to about $146 because of the extension. So, yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I would point out to you what I said. All this
is an estimate and Senator Howard, I mean Representative Howard, she
called me a Representative a while ago so I thought I'd elevate her.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You were once.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She thought you had elevated.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And we, she said, &quot;We'll pay it off in 15 or 16.&quot; We're having
to estimate when all this is going to happen. If, in fact, it results in
additional tax being payed in you could turn around at that time and
reduce the SUTA to offset it. If it's paid in it's going in to the fund.
So you could, there are a zillion ways that you could offset that
somehow into the future if that occurred.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That 400 million dollars is FUTA. It's basically the FUTA tax that is
creating the additional expense, just carrying that out another year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At a higher level.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I could ask a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But doesn't that feed in to repay our debt and then come to us when our
debt's paid off?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, sir. When our debt is paid off it stops so it doesn't generate any
additional FUTA doesn't. When the debt is paid it's, those rates come
back to $42.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sir, follow-up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I think we're saying the same thing. When the debt's paid off we
are, that tax goes away.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The FUTA tax goes away, yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But what I'm saying is, yes, the FUTA tax goes away. So we're back to
square at that point and I'm saying that other adjustments could be
made. You've got this committee in place to look for the next three or
four years. You could make a very minor adjustment here or there,
perhaps to the SUTA tax, to offset for business if you wanted to but
hopefully by this time we're going to be having good times and they'll
be better able to afford it then than they will now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's what I'm pitching, it's not complex. I'm just saying, this thing
is a wave it's not flat line and we have a chance right now that we've
got to either take or not take to pump 25 million dollars a week into
these, mainly into these poorer counties with high unemployment rates
that I think they desperately need.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You'll still have money, Senator Nesbitt, going out backdoor to continue
paying these bills from the businesses who are trying to stay alive and
trying to create job opportunities. Senator Hise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
First question, just as I'm looking at the amendment, as I see this
amendment does away with any cap on the maximum benefits that currently
exist and actually just sets that maximum cap at 2/3 the average weekly
wage.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One second, let's get this one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I told you you wouldn't believe me so he needs to ask Cindy Everett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, Ms. Everett, do you have an answer to that? Ms. Everett?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. On lines 1-12, basically what you're doing is keeping the
current law in place from July 1 of this year through the end of this
calendar year.</p>

<p id="80:00">
That's the way the maximum benefit is currently derived is trough a
formula. So the first few lines, even though it's underlined is
basically just keeping the current law in place through the end of this
calendar year, and then beginning on lines - line 18, we put into the
bill effective January 1, 3014 the change that is proposed in this bill,
which is the $350 dollar maximum benefit amount and the new calculation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise does that answer your question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll let it go.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, Senator Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. Senator Nesbitt I think the tough
part of that is the food attacks in this scenario would go from a max of
about, Representative Howard correct me if I'm wrong, but $105 dollars
per employee per year, to about $140 dollars or so per employee per
year. And because it extends it out that much longer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But isn't it 21 a year?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, it's..
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's 21 a year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] More.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My, my, sorry. It is, this is the way it's escalating
right now. It is currently $42 dollars, that's what we'd like to have it
back [??]. In 2011 we added 42 and then 21, so every year, and the
chart, my chart only goes down as far as 189 and then you would put thee
- so you're well over $200 dollars after, per employee per year, at
2019. So...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard, I think Ms. Everett might help
the answer to that question and that senator Brown alluded to. Ms.
Everett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Under the bill as is written right now it's estimated
that the fund would be positive in 2015. That means in 2016 the fueda
[SP] rate for employers would be $42 dollars per employee. Under the
amendment there would not be a positive balance until sometime in the
year 2016. That means that the fueda [sp] rate for 2016 would be $147
dollars. So the difference is it would be $147 under this amendment, $42
under your bill for a difference of $105 dollars per employee in that
calendar year, 2016.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown, did that clarify that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It does and just to follow up on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt I think you can see most of us were at
$42 dollars, we're going to be at $105 dollars, this would put us at
$147 dollars, an additional $105 with what we're already paying. And I'm
like senator Tucker, I can't tell you, I'm to the point, I send in a
check, seriously, I sent in a check a couple weeks ago for $6000 dollars
additional on top of what I normally send in, and that's going to
continue to get worse and worse for me, and I'm like senator Tucker, I'm
going to start laying people off because you don't really have any
option. You get to the point that you got to make it up somewhere. And
it comes down to people when you're in business. And the sooner you can
fix this the better off you are because it's not going to be any fun for
anybody in business. I've got 120 people, I employ about 120 people, in
Jackson another 125, in Spruce Pines I've got about closer to 150
employees, so you can just compute what that is going to cost me. And so
there's going to be a lot of pain for me I can tell you if you're
working through this thing and it's going to mean people.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you senator Brown. Any additional questions on
the amendment form Senator Nesbitt? Seeing none all in favor of senator
Nesbitt's amendment please say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed say nay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Nay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The nay's have it. Ladies and gentlemen any
additional? There are no additional? We have a motion for a favorable
report on house bill four, any additional debate? Seeing none, all in
favor of favorable report, the motion favorable report for house bill
four please say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed nay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Nay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye's have it. That concludes this meeting. Thank you
very much and thank you Representative Howard.</p>
