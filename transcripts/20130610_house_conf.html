To the conference committee on house bill 13 Senator Brock and I have
decided to do something a little bit different. This is a conference
committee but we're going to treat the committee as if it was a just a
full standing regular committee. So folks can have input on any sections
that they so choose to address. The bill went over to the Senate and
there's a new provision that was added in the Senate and so we're gonna
just try to get a resolution on what folks wanna do with the bill.
Senator Brock do you have anything you'd like to add sir?
[Speaker Change]
Well I speaking I think with most people on our side, I thought we were
gonna go through make sure where we stand on sections 1, 2, then 3 and
then find out see where we are, if we're both OK on 1, and 2, and I
think 3, before we have the questions.
[Speaker Change]
We'd like to thank Mr. Bass and Mr. Powell the House Sergeant of Arms.
And Mr. Meadows and Mr. Wilson the Senate Sargent of Arms. Any of you
all in the back don't feel like you're spectators to normal committee.
I'm gonna ask you to sign up and sign in and if you have handouts that
you wanna have provided to the committee feel free to do that. We do not
intend to resolve this issue today, today we're gonna be taking the
input from all of the committee members and those of you who would like
to add something. Then we will come back as conference committee and try
to resolve once we have all of the information. I'm gonna ask John ??
from the program evaluation division to start us off. There was a study
bill that came out of program evaluation and that bill was reviewed by
the committee on the 14th day of January, which was the last day that,
that committee was able to operate. So therefore there was not a bill
drafted that the committee would have scrutinized and debated, and sent
forward, we simply ran out of time. So I believe that some of the
provisions in this bill are tied to this. So Mr. ?? if you would start
there and then we'll back up and go back through the sections that we
need to talk about.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Madam Chair, Chairman Brock. Jeff Grimes who lead the team on
our submerged lands report is going to do a presentation on that report
and as Chairman Howard explained we did this report at the direction of
a special provision that was added in a technical corrections bill to
the appropriations act. And as a result of doing the report we made that
presentation to the committee, the committee received the report, the
committee endorsed the report, but there were no recommendations made.
We provided a number of options for the legislature to consider and at
that meeting as Chairman Howard explained the, we were directed, we
received instructions from the committee to go ahead and draft
legislation. But as she explained that legislation was not, we were not
able to get it back to the committee for the committee to do a choose
review of it. So in this case that legislation was not recommended by
the joint legislative program evaluation oversight committee. But the,
so the recommendations dealing with submerged lands, well there was
actually options dealing with submerged lands were reflected in that
amendment. And Jeff Grimes is gonna go over the findings of our report.
And he has a one page handout Madam Chair, Senator Brock.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. Grimes would you like to come forward and do you have your handouts.
[Speaker Change]
Yes he's got it.
[Speaker Change]
He's got it.
[Speaker Change]
Let the Sargent of Arms to pass those out. Mr. Grimes you can come on up
if you'd like to.</p>

<p id="05:00">
I'm Jeff Grimes, the senior program evaluator with the Program
Evaluation Division. Today I'm presenting a very brief summary of the
report titled &quot;North Carolina Does Not Track Land Submerged Under
Navigable Rivers or Know the Extent of Private Claims&quot;. State law
directed us to study in conjunction with the Department of
Administration, the inventory of all state-owned lands, and issue of
public ownership of lands submerged under navigable rivers in this
state. This report was presented to the joint legislative program
evaluation oversight committee on January 14th, 2013 where the report
was subsequently accepted by the committee. First, just a quick
background on submerged lands. State law defines submerged lands as
state lands which lie beneath any navigable waters within the boundaries
of this state, or the Atlantic Ocean to a distance of 3 geographical
miles seaward from the coastline of this state. Submerged lands can
include the beds of navigable rivers, as well as coastal waters. North
Carolina gained ownership of its submerged lands through the Declaration
of Independence in victory in the Revolutionary War. North Carolina
essentially took ownership of these lands from King George III. State -
the state owned submerged lands that were navigable at the time of
independence. In 1959 state laws said that submerged lands cannot be
conveyed away to private parties by the state in fee, however
conveyances of submerged lands by state laws have occurred in the past.
No list exists of these conveyances, and the extent to which private
parties may have legitimate or non legitimate claims to submerged lands
is unknown. North Carolina owns lands under navigable rivers, but how
navigability is defined is important. State courts have determined the
meaning of navigability for purposes of ownership of submerged lands. As
determined by case law, navigability for ownership is based on whether
the waterway could have been used for commerce and travel by useful
vessels at the time of statehood. As defined by case law, travel by
useful vessels has included one person craft with a shallow draft, which
would be somewhat similar to a jon boat today. The definition of
commerce has included floating logs one way down a stream made navigable
only due to heavy rains or melting snow. Now, I'd like to talk about how
North Carolina tracks ownership of state-owned lands, including land
submerged under navigable rivers. North Carolina law states that the
Department of Administration is required to prepare and keep current an
inventory of all state-owned land. Within the Department of
Administration, the State Property Office inventories state-owned land
as part of a database it maintains of state property. DOA does not
inventory submerged lands as a matter of course. The DOA property
database does not track submerged lands in a comprehensive manner
because records of ownership do not generally exist. It's important to
note the DOA justifies the lack of an inventory of submerged land
because it treats all lands submerged under navigable rivers as
sovereign land of the state. DOA has granted, in statute, the power to
manage and control submerged lands. While DOA has brought authority over
the management of submerged lands, the approach it takes is largely
passive. While DOA does require easements for utility crossings and some
    coastal structures, such as piers, larger docks, and marinas, it
does not require easements for many other types of structures located on
submerged lands such as dams, most water intake and outtake structures,
and any other structure that would be affixed to a river bed. In most
cases, DOA does not require leases or that royalties be paid for the
mining of minerals found on or underneath riverbeds, even in cases where
there is active mining taking place. Despite not having records of
ownership of submerged lands, North Carolina does have experience in
dealing with uncertainty over ownership. The state completed a process
to resolve private claims to submerged lands in 25 counties on the coast
 where there was uncertainty, particularly over shellfish beds. To
address this issue, in 1965 law required 25 coastal counties register
with the state any grant, charter, or any other authorization to
submerged lands by 1970. Those claims not registered were declared null
and void. The predecessor agency to the  Division of Marine Fisheries
and the North Carolina Department of Justice then worked to resolve
those claims filed.</p>

<p id="10:00">
anyone claiming submerged land had to demonstrate an unbroken chain of
title back to the orginal instrument that conveyed the land. In total
there were 14,566 claims filed. Ultimately 256 were recognized as being
valid. This process cost an estimated $4.1 million. Taking these issues
into consideration, the program valuation division identified two areas
where the General Assembly could consider taking action to improve the
management of land submerged under navigable rivers. The first set of
options would address DOA's management and tracking of submerged lands.
The General Assembly could require DOA to create a field in its property
database that specifically tracks submerged lands ownership and
easemants so that DOA could better report on what submerged lands it
does have in its database and what easements it has issued. Next, the
General Assembly could require DOA to describe utility crossing
easemants in rule making.  Though DOA grants these easements currently,
the program evaluation division found that there is no description of
the process for obtaining a utility easement across submerged lands, or
the fee for such an easement. Another option to consider is requiring
DOA to work with Deaner to develop and implement procedures for
conveying or leasing mineral deposits on submerged lands. Mining is
permitted by Deaner, but when it occurs on submerged lands, the State is
not obtaining any revenue for these materials mined with the exception
of a phosphate lease. Statutes already describe a process for leasing or
conveying mineral deposits on state-owned submerged land.  But this
process has not been implemented for the majority of mining that takes
place on submerged lands including all in-stream sand mining. The fourth
option is for the General Assembly to direct DOA to require easements
for all new structures built on state-owned submerged lands.  The
program evaluation division found that there are many structures for
which the DOA has not been requiring easements. In order to deal with
the uncertainty of ownership of lands submerged under navigable rivers,
the General Assembly could create a claims process in the 75 counties
that were not part of the coastal claims process.  Those claiming any
ownership interest in land submerged under navigable rivers could be
given 2 years to register those claims with the state. Those not
registered in that time frame would be declared null and void. The state
could then conduct a process to resolve those claims, similar to the
process on the coast. The program evaluation division estimates that
operating an office to resolve claims would cost approxiamately $550,000
per year until all claims are resolved.  The time frame for this process
is unknown because it would depend on the number of claims filed, the
complexity, and the number of resulting legal challenges. This process
may possibly proceed more quickly than the one on the coast due to
advances in technology such as online access to county tax records,
register of deeds records, and mapping programs that were not available
then. To decide whether to initiate a process to resolve ownership, the
General Assembly would have to consider the potential benefits and
costs. Resolution of ownership of lands submerged under navigable rivers
would require a costly and extended process, but the state would be able
to identify legitimate claims and all others would be null and void.
This information could be used to more activitely manage the lands under
navigable rivers and protect the state's ownership interest. I will note
that House Bill 13, Section 3, incorporates all options to improve
management of lands submerged under navigable rivers discussed in this
program evaluation division report.  This concludes the summary of my
report. The report is available online and includes a response from the
Department of Administration.  I'd be happy to take any questions at
this time.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Are there questions from any members of the committee? I thank you very
much for doing that.  Senator Tucker.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Thank you Madam Chair.  I've got a few questions. Would you allow me to
ask a series of questions?
[NEW SPEAKER]
Yes, sir.  We sure will.
[NEW SPEAKER]
Alright, thank you ma'am.  If I understand your presentation, there's
really been no adequate tracking of these land by DOA? Okay. You
mentioned in your presentation minerals?
[NEW SPEAKER]
Uh huh.
[NEW SPEAKER]
And that there's no royalty for minerals that are mined, say, in the
riverbed of a navigable water? Water is considered a mineral, is that
what you're saying as well? Because you didn't mention water and the
production of hydropower, just the flowing the water which is not
extracted, it's just used to create</p>

<p id="15:00">
I'm just trying to understand that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We were talking
about actual minerals being mined, so there is one phosphate lease the
state has, in Beaufort County; that was the only royalties the state's
receiving from minerals potentially mined from a riverbed or submerged
lands. There were over 30 instances where we found permitted mining for
sand from a riverbed, and none of those sites had any leases or were
paying any royalties. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Madame Chair follow-up? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm just trying to get my head around, so
landowners that have property on a lake that has been flooded by a
utility, their property, when it juts out into the water, and you
navigate over that property that has had a title to it, the state can,
through some sort of reformation of tracking, and by DOA and all can
claim that? [SPEAKER CHANGES]You are at liberty to answer all of the
questions, please, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So, what the state owns is
those navigable rivers at the time of statehood, so in some theoretical
case, if somebody's come on and created an impoundment since then, the
state would own the original riverbed through that impoundment,
potentially, but not all the property along that impoundment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The other thing, too, if since statehood, since King George
reluctantly granted all of this property to us through war, and there's
been title to that property on multiple occasions, and then someone
chooses, like we're talking about ALCOA, that puts a dam up there and
floods that property that had title to, is that property the state's, or
is that property ALCOA's? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I can't speak in that
particular instance, we looked at submerged lands throughout the state;
the answer is complicated, in the sense that the state would own lands
under navigable rivers, minus what could have been conveyed in the past,
and we don't have records of what may or may not have been conveyed in
the past. Most of this submerged land probably doesn't have any title to
it in the sense of a deed you would find in a county records. If you
look at tax parcels, for example, it's really challenging to determine
what could or could not, and that's why we discussed in the report
creating a claims process that would help resolve who owns what.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK, Madame Chair, I'll be trying to move quickly. So,
flooded property, that was once dry land, and then it was flooded by
ALCOA, Duke, or whoever it might be, that land has no title to the
property of the flooded land, or are you just talking about the
navigable river that you can get a canoe down?[SPEAKER CHANGES] So, if
we're talking about a property that was flooded, there probably was
title to that area before it was flooded, and I can't tell you who would
own what, other than saying the state would have potential title to the
land under the riverbed, not the whole reservoir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So
if it cost $4.1 million to track those, set up the tracking of those
submerged lands for the 25 counties, I am to assume that it's going to
take another $12 million to try to get a database that DOA can manage
this, would that be a fair statement? Or close, I mean it's a guess. I
know, but economies of scale doing 75 versus 25, but it's going to take
several million dollars, then, based on the cataloging of the submerged
lands on 25 counties , we'll have to spend $8-$12 million based on that
to get a good database for DOA. Is that correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We
looked at the process that they followed on the coast, and actually
talked with the people who were involved with that process, to come up
with an estimate what it would take to run and office that would...</p>

<p id="20:00">
These claims. And that estimate include 7 people to staff that office.
And we said it would take $550,000 per year to staff that office. We
didn't feel we were in a position to tell you what the full cost would
be because there's gonna be differences from that process. One there's
better technology now that would potentially allow the state to complete
that processing more quickly. On the other hand we don't know how many
claims would be filed, or how many claims that are out there in those 75
counties.
[Speaker Change]
Madam chair one final question.
[Speaker Change]
Yes sir.
[Speaker Change]
When you did your program eval and you know, I guess a catalyst for this
would be Al Cole because you know, Duke's a public utility Al Cole is a
private enterprise, it motivated some of this. Did you take a look? Or
did anybody on the legal side take a look at how the Montana case in the
state utility and the submerged lands there would impact the Al Cole or
Duke, progress that has this same type scenario? Did anybody look at
that to see if there was any impact on those particular scenarios?
[Speaker Change]
Yeah, so we were directed, I think I mentioned a session law before to
study the issue of public ownership of land submerged under navigable
rivers. So we worked very closely with the research and bill drafting
divisions here in the general assembly. Spoke with a number of legal
experts both inside and outside of state governments. They did look at
the Montana issue and the opinion we got from general assembly council
was that the Montana case in most respects did not apply to North
Carolina because North Carolina is one of the 13 original colonies.
Which means North Carolina got its ownership from the kings. The non 13
colonies got their ownership from the United States government because
they came after. And so the legal opinion was that we are different in
that respect.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Madam Chair.
[Speaker Change]
Other question from the committee members.
[Speaker Change]
??
[Speaker Change]
Senator ??
[Speaker Change]
Being a history buff that kind of. How are we different? Is this, do we
still royalties to the king? Or to the queen now? I mean and if we have
that memo from our staff here, I'd like to see the appropriation of
that. And is that in the study?
[Speaker Change]
Yeah if you have a copy of the full report that we issued, it is at the
very end of that report. It's on page 16. And as far as the difference
the way it’s been explained to me it’s just essentially being an
original colony that formed the U.S. government versus being a territory
that gained ownership from the United States after it was a government.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Hartsell.
[Speaker Change]
I think I can answer that sort of. The issue for non 13 colonies is what
they call the equal footing doctrine. That is to say the new states are
supposed to be on a equal footing with the old states, however in the
case of the 13 original colonies the state of North Carolina has an
individual state or colony took title to the navigable rivers at the
time of statehood period. And that's Gladstone's commentary, I think
it's Gladstone's commentary going back to 1715. However the other
colonies, I mean the other areas did not, I mean they were actually in
the case of Louisiana purchase or whatever were purchased and that title
was held by the federal government for a length and period of time
before they became states. So the navigability issue was a federal
navigability issue for them when it comes down to it later on. As a
consequence when the Supreme Court issued its decision that said you had
navigability as a such and such a time or when you had statehood for the
state of Montana.</p>

<p id="25:00">
It dealt with the time when Montana became a state but it actually got
its title through the federal government. That was not true in the case
of North Carolina. The issue then becomes… The legal term is adverse
possession. The Supreme Court said you can have adverse possession.
Title developed that over time, in the case of those non-13 colonies.
They did not say that with regard to the original 13 colonies. The
reason the difference comes down to, although there is no specific
decisions of the Supreme Court saying that, is because the non-13
colonies obtained their title indirectly through the feds and not by
virtue of being originally from the king. That’s …
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Can follow-up on the questioning. Did the State of
North Carolina lose that right in 1861 when they left the union? And
when they went back into federal control in 1865?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The title…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hartsell
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would seriously doubt that. We’re talking about a
state’s rights. I would think not. I don’t think that would have any
impact on anything. The issue is the state had title, period and the
navigability determination was the State of North Carolina’s then and
frankly still is today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. We’re going to back it up and go a
different way and see if we can just get a couple of things off the
table. House bill 13 passed the house, I believe unanimously and also
went over to the senate. I’m going to ask the committee, in looking at
the summary of house bill 13, does any committee member or anybody in
the audience have any issues with sections one or two? It becomes
apparent that it is section three and that is the change that came from
the senate that we are here to maintain and try to resolve. Is
everybody…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chair there is also a…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho. Section three and four. Yes sir. We’re
starting with section three then move to section four. So it’s apparent
that the issues to be resolved we will be dealing with section three and
section four. Everybody is comfortable with sections one and two I am
assuming. Anyone on the committee that would like to make a comment? If
not we’re going to start with the public. Mr. Paul Sherman from the
North Carolina Farm Bureau, sir. If you have any remarks we would ask
that you leave those with us and please give us your name and title.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chair and members of the committee.
I’m Paul Sherman of North Carolina Farm Bureau Federation and I just
briefly wanted to let you know that our members and  the rural
landowners are very concerned about section three of the bill. Certainly
having some experience in the coastal counties with the process they
went through years ago, I’m concerned about the time, the turnaround,
the claims process, the calls to surveys and really would just like this
particular provision thought out so that we can try not to do any harm
especially to those small landowners that don’t have the resources to be
able to go through this claims process and help educate them a little
better. So if we could possibly try to slow down before we move forward
with this so that we can protect those landowners. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Sherman if you could come back just a minute.
We’re looking for a resolution here. So do you have a proposal that you
would like to offer on behalf of the Farm Bureau, either at this time or
in the next 48 hours?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If pressed for now, removal of section three from the
bill. Resolution, I’ll certainly try to work on something and have it
back to you in the next 48 hours.</p>

Thank you sir.  Chuck ??. My friend Chuck ?? from ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Madame, Madame Chair?  Mister ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't have this button properly matched to use the
term of art. I represent Alcoa, which is interested in this issue There
are folks here from a number of counties who are also interested in the
issue. One of the points that occurred to me in looking at this bill it
basically as I  understand the staffs analysis their taking the position
that some submerged lands are owned by the state of North Carolina right
now and this would be a process to cut off the rights of anybody that
might claim it,  adverse claim, I recon in  that situation since Alcoa’s
 paid taxes on these lands for about a hundred years or more given under
105381,  they’d have a claim to a refund against the counties in that
area for the taxes they paid as would anybody else who this legislation
would cut off  because at the end of the period  they wouldn't have a
claim in their property they had  been paying and the statute allows
them to go back  for five years.  A factor I would think that the
committee would want to take in to account.  Secondly, any landowner who
wanted to vindicate his rights under this theory espoused by Senator
Hartsell’s amendment and PED would be confronted without having to go
back to 1776 to run the title search do a survey and see what the status
of their title was, whether or not they had to take land by grant from
King George or from the state prior to the time when the state was still
making conveyances.  Which would be a mighty substantial expense for a
lot of property owners who had been paying taxes on these lands, Alcoa,
Duke, progress to one side.  And then to what the end do you get out of
this? So it strikes us, and there are number of other factors Madame
Chair but it’s a lot of expense on a lot of folks, the potential
exposure of our counties to substantial tax refund claims if the PED
theory is correct and you wonder at the end of the day.  What is the
benefit of the state from going through this process?  Thank you Madame
Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   Thank you Mister ??  Larry Jones?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   Madame Chair, ?? speaker here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  ?? give us your name and who you are.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes mam I’m Larry Jones.  I live in Salisbury, North
Carolina in Rowan County. I have a farm that ?? river and high rock
reservoir. I'm very disturbed at this section three being put in their
reasonable bill at the last minute. it would incur a lot of damage to me
personally to have to file a claim with the state for land I’ve owned
for a number of years I have clear title clear deed to it.  I pay taxes
on it.  My land crosses small streams that were there for the lake was
formed so by the definition of the presentation made it would apply to
my lands so I would be forced to file a claim and I’m sure incur legal
bills, survey fees, everything else to pursue it and I don’t see for
what benefit to the state going after my few acres of land that lie
under the water would be.  It’s clear to me that this whole thing comes
down to the quest to take over the Alcoa project and I don’t see
throwing all of private landowners under the bus to achieve that, and
for that reason, I would request that this committee throw out the
section three to this House bill and return to its original state, that
was passed by the House. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mister Jones.  Ray ??  of APGI.  ?? saying
here.  Our handwriting’s not too good up here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Madame Chair and the committee I’m with Alcoa.  We
oppose section 3 were okay with sections 1 and 2 of the bill as it
stands; our biggest issue is really the definition of navigability.  We
consider it a Federal</p>

<p id="35:00">
issue. I think that’s what the PPL Montana vs. State of Montana came
down to wasn’t navigability it was a non-navigable river. The Yadkin?
River, which has come up in discussion, is a non-navigable by federal
law. It has been established by federal law and by the State of North
Carolina. They have already established it as non-navigable.
You’re putting a bill that has a lot of definitions around navigability
that conflicts with federal law. A skiff, a one-man skiff, a jon boat,
is not a steamship, which is what the Federal Court has declared
determines navigability. That’s why the navigability on the Yadkin River
ends in South Carolina, because you cannot get a steamship all the way
up the Yadkin River. That’s why the Supreme Court, or the US Court of
Army Engineers said you couldn’t, and that’s why it’s not navigable. The
bill creates a lot of issues. This claim process would most likely
result in some sort of federal lawsuit involving the State of North
Carolina and obviously Alcoa if there is an attempt to take claim of our
land, which could cost millions, not just 550 thousand dollars.
We have been doing a lot of title searches as part of a re-licensing
application. Just one other point here real quick. We have gone back to
the deeds of King George. King George gave away a lot of the lands,
including the river prior to the Revolution. That land was allowed to be
maintained by the Revolutionary patriots. Then they sold it and they
sold it and they sold it. Alcoa finally acquired it. So we own those
claims prior to the Revolution the way it came through. Some of the
State lands were sold later by the State.
The basis is, it is still non-navigable and the State can sell land and
they did in the past. We do have the deeds. We have all of the flood
rights. It’s going to be an extreme burden on us to go back. I think the
easiest thing for us to reach resolution is just to remove Section 3 and
let the bill go forward as originally drafted. Thanks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
I’m sorry. Yes, please. [crosstalk] Do members of the committee have
questions to the presenters and outside speakers. Please feel free to do
so.
Senator Hardsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
I do of Mr. Bond, if I might.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Mr. Bond, Sir, would you come back. Mr. Bond.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
I’m sorry. Yes, Ma’m.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Thank you. I believe there are some members of the committee that have
some questions for you, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Mr. Bond, we’ve had this conversation on any number of occasions
previously with regard to this, but I’d really like…you have advised as
long as three years ago that you would provide us with each of these
documents that reflect Alcoa’s ownership of the river. Can we get them?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
They’re in six counties throughout North Carolina. You’re welcome to go
there as a public member and do your title search and go find them.
You’re a lawyer, you must understand what it takes to get one. They are
there for the public to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Follow-up, Senator Hardsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
The problem is, I have gone there and I can’t find them. I don’t know
that there is that title that you’re talking about. When it comes to the
issue of navigability, are you aware there’s case law in North Carolina
that defines navigability differently, and actually declares the area of
the Yadkin River ?? north of, I think it’s…the northern line of Davidson
County is navigable anyway? Are you aware of that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
I’m aware of the different definitions that are out there. I’m also
aware of the 1937 ruling by FURK that declared that section of the river
to be non-navigable, thus that’s why it became under the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission for licensing. At the same time the State of North
Carolina declared it to be non-navigable. If you could provide us with
copies of that, that might be useful.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
OK, we can do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
I might also add that FURK's jurisdiction over this doesn’t apply unless
the river is navigable anyway.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
That’s not correct. There’s many definitions under FURK that they can
apply. You have the ability under FURK law to impound and be a licensee
if you’re non-navigable river feeds a navigable river. And that is what
they found in 1937 under the ruling that the State of North Carolina
supported that. The Yadkin River supported down-river, down-stream the
Yadkin PD River, which is navigable.  That’s why they brought us into
the Federal Energy, under the Federal Power Act of 1937.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
If you could provide us with, at least with those documents, that would
be useful. We have been trying to get them for years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
I can get them for you. They’re at FURK</p>

The federal ?? ?? Commission.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. ??, Whether or not the issue today circles itself around
those documents, the committee will ask that you do present
those to our committee for further use. Thank you, sir. Lynn Strong? Mr.
Strong, would you again give us your full name
and the group that you represent.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Lynn Strong, I am the President of High Rock Lake Association and a
resident of Davidson County. We...Okay, Thank you.
There are many onerous and I think difficult parts to this. Too many in
fact to ennumerate. I would comment that it has been
225 years, and the state can't really tell us who owns what. It's not
time for state to catch up. If documentation and contractual
law says certain properties are owned, then we should honor that. This
whole bill, excuse me, this whole bill amounts
to a land grab and a poorly phrased one at that. We sincerely hope the
committee [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Strong [SPEAKER CHANGES]
...will turn this down. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Strong, I am the sponsor of the original bill, and, sir, I can
assure you it's not a 'land grab', but if you'll complete
your comments for the record, but if we'll try to stay away from the 'he
said, she said' stuff that'd be better for
us all. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand. I encourage the committee to drop sections 3 and 4.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. Ann Brownley. Ms. Brownley, again if you'll give us your
full name and the organization you represent. You'll need to hold that
button down, please, ma'am. Continuous. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hi, my name's Ann Brownley, and I'm from Salisbury, and I'm a historian,
which I think is sorely needed in this process. I've heard so many
things that make me cringe that I certainly won't have time to go into
them all today. And I want to address Section 3. If this were something
the State wanted to do, the first thing that they need to do is
determine which rivers were navigable, and which ones weren't, because
that is something that has never been done. And, it's kind of been
glossed over in this bill. I'm not sure what you're going to do, just
assume they're all navigable or something? There are going to be a lot
of lawsuits on that. The area along the coast that's been long
established, but when you get away from the coastal area, this is
untested territory. The definition of navigable for the purpose of title
determination, is if it was used or susceptible to being used in its
natural and ordinary condition as a
highway of commerce over which trade and travel were or may have been
conducted in the customary modes of trade and travel on water at the
time of Statehood, which for North Carolina was 1789. There is a
different test of navigability for
Public Trust rights to boat, swim, fish, and enjoy recreational
activities in the water ?? ??. Let's not confuse the two. I've been
studying the Yadkin River, which I think is our key focus, since 1994,
and I can tell you there is just
a large amount of convincing information that the Yadkin River was not
navigable in 1789. Probably the key thing is that in 1887 and 1888 the
U.S. Army Core of Engineers, who are the experts on the subject,
surveyed the lower Yadkin river from the railbridge near Salisbury to
the South Carolina line and found the entire section to not only be not
navigable but not worthy of improvement. So, there's not a whole lot
else you can say after that. I really could send you a good deal of
other information. Is there some way I can e-mail information to you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma'am, absolutely, and we will have the Sargeant of Arms bring you
the contact information for our staff.[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma'am. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just think this is opening up a tremendous can of worms that's not
going to net the State much benefit, that's going to have a lot of
lawsuits, that's going to inconvenience both the State and a lot of
landowners, and just a problem that's not going to be worth what it
produces.</p>

<p id="45:00">
Thank you very much, and the Sergeant-at-Arms will be bringing you that
information. Fred McClure, I believe Mr. McClure is the Chairman of the
Davidson County county commissioners. My friend, Fred. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
 Thank you, Madame Chair. Fred McClure, Chairman of Davidson County
Board of Commissioners. We have concerns, not with one and two sections
of this, but with the third section. We have, we charge our friends at
ALCOA $1,500 an acre for that land, that's under the water, so does
Rowan County, so does Stanly County - with a total of six or seven
counties around the lake there's over a million dollars in tax every
year. You calculate that, and if you all go ahead with this, and it is
so deemed that we owe them a million dollars a year for however many
years we have been taxing them, it's going to be a real burden. It's a
real burden on the counties now, to have go back and prove ownership of
the land that's under the water. I can't see, I've read Section Three, I
can't see how this benefits the state in anyway, however it is a
detriment to our counties. It just seems that I have been involved with
ALCOA since they had the shoreline management plan talks, eons ago, and
there have been recently, in recent years, attempts by the State, some
people in the State of North Carolina, to take over that property. I'll
not mention any names, nor am I going to mention any motives, but this
appears to be a further issue of taking over the same property. If
you'll excuse the expression, this particular section, Section Three,
seems to be a backdoor method to be able to do that. Otherwise, I don't
know why we would be looking at having open comments in a session that
normally doesn't have them, but I appreciate the time, I appreciate you
giving me the opportunity to speak, and if you have any questions that
can be answered by a commissioner, I'll be glad to. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. McClure. Questions from the committee? George Everett,
Duke Energy...George. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madame Chairman, and
members of the Commission. It's clear to me that this is about as muddy
an issue as you can get. The bottom of our lakes and rivers is mud, and
that's just what this looks like right now. After hearing this
presentation, I think what I heard, but I'm not sure, about Section
Three, which is the only piece I'm speaking about, is that the water
that we flooded, the land we flooded, when we put dams in  place, is not
subject to this debate. I think that's what I heard, but it's not clear
to me. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe you're correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We
do ,of course, have dams that are put in place on a number of other
rivers besides the Yadkin. We own the lakes, and the land beneath those
lakes, and we can argue about whether we own the land beneath the river,
all along the Catawba River. But if Section Three stays in this Bill,
there are going to be a lot of people who lay claim to some of that
property that was in the original riverbed. And Duke is going to have to
go back 100 years to determine who has that claim, and how we resolve
it. The Department of Environmental and Natural Resources and
Administration, and the AG's office, are going to have to resolve this
claim. And we're all going to be tied up in court, probably for the next
100 years, that we've been in place on the Catawba already. So we oppose
Section Three of the Bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee,
do you have questions for Mr. Everett? [SPEAKER CHANGES] One question,
Mr. Everett. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator ? . Mr. Everett, if you'll come
back, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sorry abut that, George. How many dams do
y'all have for Duke? Have any idea how many dams y'all have got?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up, Senator ? [SPEAKER

[SPEAKER CHANGES] You know how many acres that lake is?  Speaking about
the land underneath the water.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do not know how many thousand acres it is, but I can
look it up in a couple of seconds and get back to you.  It's enormous.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Probably about 32,000.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That was my guess.  I was going to say 30,000.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The members of the committee, answer Senator Davis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you madam chairman.  Could somebody tell me what
section 3 is supposed to fix?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I asked if there was a staff here from research here
and apparently they are all tied up with the budget, but I'm going to
see if one of our folks here can help us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam chair, I'd be happy to brief those sections as
to what its intended to fix.  Perhaps Senator Hartsell would want to
discuss the policy but just in terms of what the sections do, they do
reflection the options presented as part of the PED report earlier this
year.  So the first section 3A directs the department administration to
modify their existing database to included a field to indicate whether
or not a property has submerged lands associated with it.  The second
part of section 3 section 3B provides that no structures may be placed
on state-owned submerged lands after the effective date of the act
without an easement that would be granted by the department
administration.  That section also explicitly states that it should not
be construed to validate or authorize the structures of any existing
structure on state-owned submerged lands.  The next section, section 3C
directs the Department of Administration to adopt rules to specify the
process for obtaining utility easements on submerged lands, and those
rules would be due no later than April 15, 2014.  The section 3D would
direct DOA to develop and implement procedures with veneer to implement
a process for disposition of mineral rights that were underlying state
lands, or state submerged lands.  The final section of section 3 section
3E would set up a submerged land claim process much like Mr. Grimes
described was performed in the 70's and late 60's for coastal submerged
lands.  This would institute a claims process for submerged land s in
the 75 remaining counties.  And those claims would need to be submitted
by December 2015 or the would be declared null and void.  I'm happy to
answer any questions madam chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you want to go ahead and ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That was a brief explanation.  Senator Davis do you
have a follow-up sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you madam chairman, if I may.  I understand what
this does, but I still don't understand what the problem is that it's
designed to fix. I'm a simple guy and I just don't see that.  Other than
being a full employment act for attorneys and surveyors.  I would like
to ask another question of somebody that would be willing to answer,
being a non-attorney.  Why is it incumbent upon individual land owners
to prove they own land instead of having the state of North Carolina to
prove that they don't?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hartsell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is maybe one that you can
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me just back up just a moment if I may.  One, what
the section does is apply to 75 western counties precisely what was
applied to the 25 eastern counties.  No more, and no less.  Water and
this,  while I'm been blamed for a lot of stuff, and am guilty of most
of it, the issue boils down to: do we control our water and the riverbed
and the public trust waters in this state?  I've been accused of trying</p>

<p id="55:00">
And to take peoples' property. And then that, and others of us in the
general, in the Senate, particularly have been accused of that. That's
not the issue. Fundamentally, the public trust waters of, and, and the
flow over navigable, the navigable river beds are and have been the
property of the state since we became a state. This simply asks to be
able to inventory that. Now there, people have all sorts of claims.
There's all sorts of encroachments and that sort of thing, and they
haven't meant a whole lot for a long time, when the next fifty to a
hundred years they're gonna mean a lot more.  And the Western part of
the state where we have very limited capacity to, to utilize surface
water because we have very few dams, and we've got more people and
they're using more water. So the issue is here, simply, let's find out
what in fact we have or don't have. If in fact folks have claimed, and
we're only, we're not talking about the fully flooded areas, we're
talking about the river beds themselves, the original, the essential,
the beds to the high water mark. That's what the state has owned. We've
had any number of debates and discussions about whether or not we're
getting appropriate revenue or return on state property now. We've got
major disputes in this county about whether that's gonna happen. It
seems to me extraordinarily incumbent upon us to assess and inventory
what is in fact the property of the state. Now, if somebody's got a
claim that they own it, then that's fine. Just show the claim. We've
been, the issue has come back about Alcoa in particular. We've been
trying to get that. They say it. And they've, I've been accused of all
sorts of things, in, in fact including today ?? take something. Not
trying to take something, we're trying to establish the fact that this
was our property. If they have the property, then just show it. No more,
no less. But if it is the state's property, it is incumbent upon us to
protect the resource. Both the water and the land over which it flows.
It's not just incumbent, it's a matter of law, and by the way in 18,
sometime in the 1840s in a spring court case in North Carolina, there
was a defi, there was a definition of navi, and I'm not talking about
just Yadkin, I'm talking about the rest of them. That's true. And, we
actually defined what navigability was, and what it wasn't, and where we
could do this and where we couldn't. And in the 1880s, the state of
North Carolina, and it said essentially the general assembly we could
define that. Furthermore, in the 1880s, the state of North Carolina, and
by act of this general assembly, declared the areas from the south of
the Yadkin itself, South from the Davidson County line, South to South
Carolina, as navigable, as, as highways of the state. That's the
definition of navigability. There were uses for that at the time. Now,
and there have been others, right now, we have a situation where an
entity, seen in Greensboro and others, have, they built a dam, and after
the dam was built, downstream land, actually dam owners have now tried
to collect funds from the folks who built the dam went through the
entire process, because their, their, their rate, the rate of flow has
been diminished. And yet, I don't know whether they actually have a
right to block the river to do it to begin with, nor does anybody in
Greensboro, or anywhere else. That's not the Yadkin that's the, that's
the deep river. It is incumbent on us to know it because what underlies
our ability to control our water is the fact that we own the beds of the
rivers. That's the whole justification for our being able to take, and
to have control over all these things. I'm just, and I'm kinda rambling
on. I have a tendency to do that sometimes</p>

As a lawyer or otherwise. But and I still say that it is incumbent upon
us to identify and control the resources that are the states for the
benefit of of the people of the state, period. That's what we've done in
other circumstances, that's what we're trying to do in this situation.
And this particular provision came out of a study that was directed by
the general assembly. It essentially recommended that we do for the 75,
what was done in the eastern. Now there's another red herring to keep
coming up, the prospects of having to refund taxes if they haven't
actually gone back and cleared this up and made the claim against the
county to begin with, they can't do it. And in fact they have had the
utilization of this property that they can't. And there are other
rabbits that have been chased, but we can deal with that in other
circumstances.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Burr.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Madam Chairman. First I wanna thank you and Senator Brock for
having the meeting today, I think it's pretty clear from hearing from
the public today that there's a lot of concern with the section that
again it kinda goes back to the Al coal issue something that, an issue
that the general assembly has been willing to jump head first in, in the
past few years. But I think at this point at least for the house side
from what I hear there's not even an interest in sticking our little toe
in that pool, much less jumping in head first. And I think to address
concerns of those that have been brought up. I know speaking for myself
I think Representative Brown, Representative Ford who all come from that
area where Al Coal is and have dealt with this issue for several years.
It's all preference, this section not being included in this bill. We're
certainly fine with the other sections that were in your original bill
but I just don't think that we want to continue down this path and
really it would be in the best interest at this time to pull that
section three out of this bill.
[Speaker Change]
Folks we're not gonna vote, conference committee is not gonna take a
position today. We were hear for the purpose of gathering information.
Is there anyone else that would like to speak? Or anything else that
needs to be added to our amendments? I'm gonna welcome Secretary from
The Department of Administration our friend Bill Dockridge. Mr.
Dockridge sir, Senate you've got a major part in this bill. Section one
and two if there's anything you'd like to share with us we'd be glad to
hear from you. Thank you. Representative Ford.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Madam Chair. I've heard from the ?? County Commissioners and
the towns of Spencer and East Spencer and they are also opposed to
section three and would make it official if need be. I suggest that when
Ann Brown they send you the information that you go through it. It's
pretty interesting and it gives the entire history of what and where and
when the river was navigable. 'Cuz we know for instance that the Atkin
River was nothing more than a big creek originally, and covered with
full of rocks, and stones and etc., etc. So if you get a chance to read
that it's very interesting and it'll open your eyes. Thank you.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you. Seeing no other comments we stand adjourned.</p>
