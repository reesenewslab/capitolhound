Anyway, [tape blank] there are two technical, and they truly are
technical or clarifying provisions that were added. We're adding the
word substantial in one place to make it conform to some provisions in

…45 having voted affirmative and zero in the negative amendment 11 pass
the bill as amended as back for the body. Is there any further
discussion or debate, Senator Jackson what purpose you ask?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Send forward the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson you can send forward your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It should me…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. Members this amendment has three provisions,
the first provision is when the fertilizer is, pertaining to the
fertilizer fees on page 2 lines 43 to 48, when the fertilizer fees first
out as a recommendation out of the Agriculture and Forestry Study
Awareness Committee, we were aware of language that the North Carolina
League, Farm Bureau and the Department of Agriculture work it on and
this amendment basically is the compromise and supported by all three of
these groups. Provision number 2 which effects language on page 22 lines
9 through 16 I believe, 9 through 10 excuse me! This amendment clarifies
that only reclassifications that have received the petition for rule
making to the EMC by an effective government who wants to remove the new
classification between January 1st, 2013 and 2014 are effected by this
provision which simply offers a restate for all parties. And the third
and final provision, this is clarification and makes a ___[01:30] to the
Landscaping Contractor Section by removing the words, ‘All employees’
and the amendment will allow landscape contractors to employ independent
contractors, they practice which is currently widely used and I would
appreciate to support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein what purpose you ask?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President to see Senator Jackson, do you have any
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson, do you have…?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And it’s truly because I have no understanding of what it does but I
understood the first provision from your explanation, the second one
having to do with the EMC and a stand still relates to things that
happened during the year of 2013. And what does that have to do with and
who are the relevant parties and they accord with this change?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As far as I know to my knowledge there are in accord with this Senator
Stein but let me reach another statement if you don’t mind.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator you have…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, nothing in this provision will disallows future petitions to
the EMC and then to reestablish a watershed reclassification in the
future if one or more governments reach an agreement to move forward
with a new regional water supply plant.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator what purpose you ask?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator what did you have to speak for the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein I had a question about the second portion of Senator
Jackson’s Amendment and in fact it does apply to one specific
reclassification that the EMC ruled on last year and the parties
involved or not in accord with this and do not favor the amendment.
Since I have represented all of the governments involved, I have been in
constant contact with them, they do not support this like they are not
in accord with this and will be taking other action of should it pass?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator Jackson, what purpose
you ask?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don’t know I’m speaking second time from the rules but just quickly
that to my knowledge that is the only county that’s…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, speak one time and the last time was your time to speak…Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade what purpose you ask?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Senator Jackson a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson do you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson, how many areas this is apply to?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One county.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, one county.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One county is affected by this change.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And Senator Jackson follow up the question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson do you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson if this amendment passes these towns and counties can go
back and renegotiate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mam to my knowledge that is the language.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right, and make another agreement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator Jackson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator ___[04:34] what
purpose you ask?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I ask Senator Jackson a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson do you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are you aware of the current status of the negotiations between the four
governments involved with this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No Sir, I’m not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. So, you are not aware of…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator can I ask another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, one more question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Thank you Mr. President. This involves the environmental self audit

have a self audit and that’s what this amendment does. It limits that.
Actually, it says you can do it once in a two year period and not more
than twice in a five year period and not more than three times in a 10
year period. And I appreciate Senator Stein pointing that out for us and

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brock is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. Members of the senate, the first part of the
amendment that you will see is that it's a clarifying issue about when
things were published with state budget. State budget called me and
asked if we just changed the wording it would allow for a better time
issue as far as knowing which agencies have which money.  That is
clarifying. If you go to the second part of amendment which is
pertaining to the closure of certain animal waste containment basins.
Long and short of the story was that this was an old animal waste basin
years ago and it was changed because the only thing that has been in it
for years is water but it's under a constant regulation of what the old
code was, the new code. I think we've got the clarifying language that
the only thing that's been in this thing is rainwater or runoff from
rainwater. This will get it to where we can remedy the situation in this
issue. I urge your support of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do we have any discussion or debate? Hearing none. Question for the
senate is the passage of amendment 15. All in favorable vote Aye,

The provisions are largely uncontroversial and the reason we are
bringing it forward today is because one of the provisions has to do
with modifying the summer reading camps to give some flexibility to LEAS
and we would like to get that provision passed over to the house as soon
as possible so that hopefully they will act on it and the LEAS would
have the authority to make those changes. I will be more happy to answer
any questions but basically it makes some changes to the portfolio
provision, we had a good amendment from Senator Stein and the Education
Committee that provides some instruction or at least some language for
DPI as far as combining some of the parts of the portfolio. So, I would
urge to support for the bill and I will happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein what purpose you had and have some for amendment. Senator
Stein forwards your amendment locally.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein moves to amendment bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein is recognized to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. Senator Burger was very helpful in committee
and accepted one amendment and there was another one that I wanna to
bring forward to the whole body for your consideration and it has to
deal with this notion of the student portfolio, the reading portfolio.
Basically, we want other kid to be able to read by the end of third
grade and if they pass the test at the end of the year or you have
demonstrated over the course of the year that you can read so that if
you are not comfortable with the high stakes test and you do poorly but
you are showing that you can read you still get to advance. The third is
that each LEAs allow to come up with different assessments alternative
to the high stakes for single end of the year test. And there were some
changes made on the LEA assessments and this amendment deals with that
other option the student reading portfolio. If you like me and have
constituents who have children in third grade I expect you have heard
about these 36 assessments in third grade and that 36 assessments comes
from this reading portfolio. Basically, what the law says is that folks
you have to show kids, you have to show if they have met the standard,
master of the standard the level of 70% or more three different times
for 12 different standards that’s the 36. The folks from Charlotte, the
McCallum Berg Superintendent said that his third grade teachers were
spending 30% of their class time the second semester of school this year
doing nothing other than assessments meaning that the teachers weren’t
teaching and the kids weren’t learning, they were just going through
assessment after assessment and we have heard time and time again there
are too many tests on our kids, too many tests on our kids and number of
those tests are beyond our control, the Federal required these 36 tests
are creature of us, we created it, it’s in we do achieve. So, we have
the power to down that back a little bit, we did that in committee with
one amendment that allows certain assessments to measure more than one
standard. So, there are 12 standards if a certain assessment deals with
two or three, no two standards and you pass it, it actually will count
for that so gets this down from 36 to maybe 32 or 33 that’s a step in
the right direction. All my amendment does is say that instead of three
benchmarks, three examples you need two examples, that gives us from 36
tests to 24 tests and potentially a little more if some of those tests
are deal with more than one standard. So, if you have parents who are
unhappy with you for having 36 tests on their third grade kids here is
an opportunity for you to take a third of those tests off the table.
Thereby, giving our teachers more time for their kids to teach and
students more time to learn. I put this for your consideration and hope
you will support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Burger what purpose you ask?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speaks for the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Burger is speaks to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members and Senators I can’t support the amendment the reason primarily
is DPI currently has the authority to further combine the benchmarks
beyond what we have already done with Senator Stein earlier amendment,
the research, the academic research tells us that having at least three
data points is necessary in order to have some certainty as to the
validity of the results I would encourage you to vote against the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate, the question for the Senate is the
passage of amendment all in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. Five

made a few minor changes and most people would say, a few improvements,
and we were fine with that. There's nothing really of substance but I'll
just keep it short and urge you to vote to concur and I'm happy to
answer any questions [SPEAKER CHANGE] Any discussion or debate? [SPEAKER
CHANGE] Hearing none. Question for the Senate is the passage of the
house is the passage of the Senate Committee Substitute to House Bill
786, all in favor will vote Aye, oppose the vote no, 5 seconds will be
allowed for the voting, the clerk will record the vote. 33 having voted
in the affirmative and 12 in the negative, the Senate concurs and the
House Committee Substitute Bill 786, it will be enrolled and sent to the
governor. Do we have any, we don't have any pages left this week so we
don't have a chance to thank them, do we have any notices or
announcements? Any notices or announcements? Do we have a page? We do
have a page with us this is week, we have 1 left. We are thanking you
