[Speaker changes.] Meeting will come to order please. We're going to
have a full room today and so I'd ask for everyone to remain quiet and
not move around too much. I'd also ask that the Sargent-at-arms keep the
air conditioners down as low as possible for Senators Hise and Hunt. We
will get started. Our Pages have gone downhill from whose normally
sitting over there but we're welcome to have those in attendance. Our
Sargent-at-Arms Captain Donna Blake, Ed Kessler, Steve Wilson. We
appreciate their work today and you may have your work cut out for you
because we do have a full gallery. Today, we going to hear a PCS on
House Bill 998. Do I hear a motion to hear the PCS? Senator Brunstetter?
All those in favor please say &quot;aye&quot;. (Ayes.) Opposed?  Motion
carried. Senator Berger, if you'll present the bill please.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chairman. Members of the Committee,
we are back to talk a little more about tax reform. Two and a half weeks
ago, we had a bill that was passed by the Finance Committee in the
Senate, on the floor...it passed second reading...and because of some
discussions we were having with the House...and because of the
importance of moving ahead with tax reform, we pulled the bill from the
floor, brought it back to the Finance Committee to continue our
discussion. Since that time, we've participated in a number of intense
but, I would say, productive conversations with our House colleagues.
We've made a lot of progress and we've reached consensus in a number of
key areas. Today, I am presenting a further compromised tax reform plan
that resolves...resolves the vast majority of the differences that were
voiced...differences that were voiced and concerns that were voiced by
members of the House.  This plan continues to simplify our 1930's tax
code, continues to provide substantial tax relief to working families
and it continues to make our state a more attractive place for
businesses to locate, to grow and to operate. It significantly reduces
the state's personal income tax rate, it phases out the corporate income
tax rate, it cuts the business franchise tax, and it caps the gas tax
while accepting the House's position on most items in contention. For
example, it adopts the House approach on offering deductions for
mortgage interest, property tax and charitable contributions. It
continues to exclude Social Security benefits from the tax base and it
substantially modifies proposed changes effecting local governments,
rural hospitals, and non-profits to lessen and, in most cases, eliminate
any adverse fiscal impact. What does this plan do? The bill before you,
members of the committee, in the first year..the first three years alone
will put over a billion dollars of money back into the pockets of North
Carolina's hard-working families and businesses. It reduces the state's
personal income tax rate from the current maximum of seven and
three-quarters percent to five and three-quarters percent in the first
year and 5.7% in 2015. It provides a standard deduction for all tax
payers applied to the first $15,000 of income for married, filing
jointly; $12,000 of income for heads of household; and $7500 in income
for single filers. It retains the state child tax credit. It offers a
$15,000 combined maximum deduction for mortgage interest and property
taxes. It makes charitable contributions fully deductible, phases out
and then eliminates the corporate income tax by 2018. It makes
substantial changes to the business franchise tax and, I understand,
Mister Chairman, that there's an amendment that will modify the language
that's in the bill on the business franchise tax. It caps the state's
gas tax and it eliminates the North Carolina's death tax.  After months
of public....</p>

<p id="05:00">
…dialogue and weeks of negotiation, the time has come for the Senate to
move the tax reform process forward.  We believe this plan is the fair
compromise that addresses the bulk of concerns expressed by House
leadership.  We hope it is the foundation for a final agreement that
delivers meaningful and much-needed tax reform for the people of North
Carolina.  Mr. Chairman, I would ask the members of the committee you
have in front of you, a proposed committee substitute.  At the back of
the document you have, there is a comparison sheet.  This is page one of
that comparison sheet.  I wanted to go through a few things that are
here.  What you’ll see is the first column would be the House bill as
passed.  The House bill as passed.  The second column is House Bill 998,
the Senate version that was on the floor previously, and the third
column is the current bill.  I am advised that on the personal income
tax rate, the five and three quarters is in 2014 and holds at that
number.  But again, that’s a substantial reduction from the current
seven and thee quarters percent.  On itemized deductions there are
unlimited charitable contributions in this bill.  Fifteen thousand
dollar cap on mortgage interest in property taxes on real estate.
Social Security there is no change from current law.  Go the second page
you’ll see the modifications in the corporate income tax treatment
eliminates the corporate income tax over the course of five years, the
previous bill would have done that over the course of four years.  Other
modifications and changes are noted.  Does make creates the new business
privilege tax and makes changes in the franchise tax and as I indicated
I think there’s an amendment coming with reference to the franchise tax.
 On page four, if you’ll note on privilege tax changes whereas the
original bill that come out of the Senate eliminated those local
privilege taxes in 2018.  This PCS makes no change as far as the local
privilege taxes are concerned.  Sales tax changes are the rate does not
change and many of the modifications are things that were pretty much
agreed to in the House version and the Senate version to begin with.
And the big change or one of the big changes in sales taxes we did
remove packaging from the items that we continue the exemption for
packaging whereas the previous version would have eliminated over time
that exemption.  And the very last page notes a revenue loss study to
address various issues that still will need to be discussed.  Members, I
would go section by section through the bill but those are the major
changes from the bill we had before.  I would invite any questions and
we’ll try to respond to them or have staff assist in responding but Mr.
Chairman, if it would be appropriate now would be time for the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] the amendment.  Thank you, Senator ?? recognize for an
amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair.  The purpose of this amendment,
and we do have copies so I guess we need to get those around to everyone
before I begin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Member, this will be page ten, if you’d turn to page
ten.</p>

<p id="10:00">
Thank you do the members all have a copy?  So sorry  ?? make some
available in the back we’d appreciate that please.  Senator Barringer
you have the floor to explain your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mister Chair.  This amendment does several
things as he mentioned we began on page 10, line 45, what we’re going to
do is change that from removes or phases out the lower franchise tax
rate to lowering the franchise tax rate and then as you can see on page
12, lines 14 and 15 we are now going to be substituting the number 1000
and then also we’re going to be adding something to our studies about
this.  Let me explain what this does as those particular technicalities
do.  First of all it removes C Corporations from the new business
privilege tax.  It changes the minimum franchise tax from 2000 in 2016
and 3000 in 2017 to $1000.  It removes the section that would repeal the
franchise tax because until we make other provisions it will remain at
the $1000 and then finally adds to the issues for study by the revenue
laws the elimination of the franchise tax.  This last part to me is the
most important.  I’m absolutely passionate and concerned for our small
businesses in North Carolina.  This will allow us the opportunity to
determine the best way to fairly treat the small businesses in North
Carolina which are the backbone of our economic engine.  We have to be
fair and equitable to all businesses.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  There’s what it does to revenue other whether it’s
increase or decrease.  I expect its increase but wanted to get a sense
of what that was.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  This amendment would reduce revenue as we do have a
preliminary estimate of what it would be.  If you give me just a second
Senator Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you can you hold that for a second.  I can give
you a rule of thumb but I would rather the staff give you the proper
number.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I’m ready.  For the 15-16 fiscal year this would have
a total impact after the amendment you would see where this plan would
reduce revenue collections for the franchise tax of about 80 million
dollars.  For the 16-17 Fiscal year it would be about 150 million
dollars and that’s not just through the amendment that’s with the affect
of the plan as if you amend it on current revenues.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you.  Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I didn’t understand that last point.  So if we do not
pass this amendment there would be 80 million in additional revenue in
15-16 and 150 million in additional revenue in 16-17?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   Let me try.  I didn’t think they did a very good job
at explaining it.  Under the current proposal, if you just look at the
amendment.  The amendment produces revenue by about 40 million dollars
in fiscal years 16-17 and by about 30 million dollars in fiscal year
17-18.  That’s just the amendment compared to the current proposal</p>

Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Question for the chair?  Is there any requirement
amendments be revenue neutral whether here or on the floor?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  To whom?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I was asking the chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  ?? I am going to say that I don’t know how to give
you the proper answer to that.  I’ll ask the staff if they can.  You
want to know if these have to be revenue neutral?  I’m going to say of
the top of my head no but I’ll ask the staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   Questions from other members?  Senator Hartsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I have a question sir on the amendment.  My question
doesn’t  have to do with the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you.  Senator Brown?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mister Chair  I just want to clarify that’s
30 million and 40 million additional savings to small businesses as it’s
in the bill now.  I guess that’s what you’re saying?  The amendment
comes up with an additional  30 and 40 million dollars?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  You return that to ?? yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Tillman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mister Chairman.  Since we’ve not completed
the budget yet I don’t imagine that amendments would have to be revenue
neutral because we will get a bottom line figure before we complete the
budget so whether they add to or take away from the bottom line at this
point matters very little I guess at this point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Correct.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Any further questions or discussions from the
members?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mister Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Just out of curiosity what’s the bill sponsor think
of this amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  That’s a good question Senator Apodaca   ?? what do
you think of this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mister Chairman there have been a lot of questions
that were asked about the impact of elimination of the franchise tax on
C Corporations and the imposition of a flat fee.  The flat fee in some
instances lessen the adverse impact on some of those C Corporations and
give us situations where the franchise tax actually goes down but the
downward motion of the franchise tax stops at 75 per 1000 and the
minimum does not go up beyond the 1000 dollar figure.  That’s the reason
that it’s important for us to study this issue to see what the
particular impact of the elimination of the franchise tax and the
imposition of a flat fee will do to some of those C Corporations,
particularly those C Corporations that don’t have a great deal of
revenue running through them  and I think that’s the reason that Senator
Barringer felt so strongly about this amendment and the Bill sponsor is
happy with the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Apodaca.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I’m just glad we finally got to an answer.  I felt
like I was meeting with a lawyer for a moment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Senator Apodaca.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Charged by the word.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I thought for a second you were going to say you were
sorry you asked.  Ladies and gentlemen the question before the Senate is
amendment number 1.  All those in favor please say aye.  Opposed no.
The ayes have it.  Amendment passes.  We’re back to the original bill.
Any further discussion or debate on the ????  Senator Hartsell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mister Chairman.  If you look on page 3,
line 16 about deduction amount.  It indicates the taxpayer may deduct
from AGI, either the standard or the itemized deduction and from the
description that we had earlier and looking at the chart it appears that
it should be and or is that right or wrong?  That’s my question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Hartsell I will defer to staff on that.  My
understanding is that with reference to the standard deduction a
taxpayer can choose that.  If a taxpayer, and the taxpayer can then
deduct an unlimited amount of charitable contributions in addition to
the standard deduction.  With reference to the</p>

<p id="20:00">
The specifics of the mortgage industry for the first deduction, and the
deduction of the property taxes. I'm not sure in the latest version
whether that is . . .[SPEAKER CHANGES], thank you, Cindy could you
answer that?[SPEAKER CHANGES]Cindy will answer that.[SPEAKER
CHANGES]Just like under the current tax law, the tax payer can take
either the standard deduction or the itemized deduction. And I think it
may help if you look at how the three plans differ. Under the house
bill, the standard deduction was 12,000 dollars. And then the taxpayer
could get the unlimited, or the itemized deductions. Unlike current law,
where a taxpayer could take all the itemized deductions that the
taxpayer took; the taxpayer's federal return. Under all these plans, it
is more limited. Under the house version, you would be able to your
mortgage interest deduction, plus your amount you itemized on real
estate, capped at 25,000 dollars. And you're also allowed to take an
unlimited amount; whatever your charitable return was on your federal
return, you were able to take it on your state return. Under the Senate
plan, that this group adopted earlier in the month, not only was the
standard deduction eliminated, but also the itemized deduction. That
went with very broadest of all possible bases. And just had a zero
percent tax rate. This proposal is a hybrid you may say. Instead of a
zero percent tax rate, we're back to a standard deduction amount, which
is a little higher than what was in the house bill. And it mirrors the
itemized deductions that a taxpayer may take. Unlimited, the same amount
you took on the federal return, you can take on the state return. And
then you may also take whatever you took on your home mortgage interest,
and for your property tax and real estate interest, instead of it being
capped at 25,000, it's the same standard deduction amount at 15,000
dollars. I hope that helps.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, but my question
is, under this plan, any individual can take the standard deduction, and
they can take the itemized deductions as identified.[SPEAKER CHANGES]No
sir.[SPEAKER CHANGES]No?[SPEAKER CHANGES]They may choose one or the
other, just as they do under the current law.[SPEAKER CHANGES]So it one
or the other, so in reading the column to the right, you can't add the
two. It's one or the other.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Staff?[SPEAKER
CHANGES]That's correct.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Members, questions, Senator
Nesbitt.[SPEAKER CHANGES]I'm not sure who this would be to. Has there
been any agreement to the governor's office, and the revenue office as
we go forward? I see numbers on here from a billion, to one hundred
million, to a billion. But those are all based on revenue estimates. And
I don't know who's they are. Is there a consensus estimate with the
governor yet?[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Grovner[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator
Nesbitt, my understanding of the staff and the budget office staff at
the general assembly have agreed on the revenue estimates from the
various plans that have been out there. I'll defer to Barry, I don't
know if they've actually talked about this plan in particular, but it
would be my understanding that the calculations that took place would be
consistent with those calculations [SPEAKER CHANGES]Dr. Boursin, would
you care to comment?[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes,it's very important the fiscal
research division, with respect to the estimates, obviously we try to
work with the executive branch, whether it's the OSBM, or the Department
of Revenue, in getting a better understanding of the fiscal impact.
That's what you see in front of you are the fiscal research's estimate.
Just with any other fiscal estimate or fiscal impact analysis. These are
analysis of fiscal research division.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Senator
McKissing. Now you'll follow up, Mr. Boursin.[SPEAKER CHANGES]What I'm
asking about is the underlying estimate. The estimate of the growth of
the next three or four years. This is based on something. I think it was
based on three or four percent. Somewhere around there. You can tell
what this is based on. Is that, has that been agreed upon with the
governor's office? That's necessary before you can do the budget, tax
policy or anything.[SPEAKER CHANGES]The first two years, as with again,
with any fiscal impact analysis we do, we have a consensus forecast in
place, then we'll use those base lines for estimates with respect for
let's say any kind of tax law change. It's no different here.</p>

<p id="25:00">
Throughout the years we've had several options available to us. We could
take long term growth, we could use some other perimeter, such as
population inflation to grow those out years. But, there's no consensus
basis for out year analysis. Fiscal research chose to use a slightly
more conservative approach, for baseline growth, by using only the
population inflation growth numbers. Which were around 4.2%, 4.3% in
those out years as opposed to long term growth averages of 4.6%, 4.7%.
But, again those were decisions made by fiscal research division. The
only consensus we have with OSBM is with the current buy in ?? forecast.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Do you have a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
If I could, what is that consensus estimate on this year and next . . .
On the two years of buying in?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The growth estimate going into 14'-15' is at 4.5%.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Berger, I have a serious of questions,
I guess I want some clarification upon which you can help me with. Some
of the items you've talked upon, others you have not. Of course, I
gather with the corporate taxes you're now I guess, reducing it and
stepping it down completely to elimination in 2018, it won't be the flat
tax that was recently proposed, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I believe the difference between this bill and what was originally
proposed in the Senate version of the bill was that in the Senate
version of the bill stepped the tax down over 4 years to zero. This
steps it down over 5 years to zero.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Five years to zero?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yep. Other than that I think its basically the same.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
All right. Now, let me ask you this, in terms of . . .
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Is this a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Follow up, please, yeah. There was a credit for low income housing, how
is that being changed and revised? It looks as if there are some
limitations which are being established and an ultimate phase out of
that credit? It appears on page 2 of the summary.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator McKissick . . .
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Perhaps staff could help with that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Right. I think that that would be helpful. My understanding is that
there are some changes with that and if Ms. Averett could help us with
that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The credit for low income housing.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes, Sir. On the credit for low income housing, the bill puts two
different limitations on the credit. The first is the same limitation
that the House put in its version of the bill, which is it limits it to
housing located in tier one and tier two counties. What this bill does
in addition to that limitation is to say, whatever credit amount you
receive, you calculate, it's going to be eliminated over 5 years.
Whatever your credit amount is in 2014, you get 100% of it if it was in
tier one or two. The next year, whatever your credit amount is, you get
75%, the next year 50%, the next year 25%, until 2018, it's eliminated
along with the corporate income tax.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Okay. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Follow up, Senator McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
So, it would be eliminated completely. So, if low income housing was
being built it would be eligible outside of the tier one and tier two
areas that it would not be eligible for any type of relief whatsoever.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
No, Sir. You're correct. Not beginning with the 2014 taxable year.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Now, what are we doing with manufactured housing, so I can be clear on
what's being proposed here now, as it compares to what was originally in
the Senate version of the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Did you hear the question?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
For manufactured housing, yeah. Of course, that's on page 4 of the
summary.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes, Sir. There is no difference between this version of the bill and
the last version that you had before you, earlier in June. It increases
the tax rate on those to the state rate, and the state rate right now is
4.75%.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Follow up, if I could.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Will that also fall into the category of the modular housing, as well?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Okay. Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Now, what are we doing with service contracts? It looks as if we're
moving around some of the requirements</p>

in that. That presently, what the bill would do is allow a phase out of
the current exemption that some folks have for paying sales tax.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And your second question, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No,
sir. That's all I have. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Tarte.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair. A question under section ??
seven under the sales tax refunds. If you can clarify for me as I read
this and a few people have been asking questions. We've included the
University of North Carolina healthcare system as part ?? making the
definition that is part of the state agency and the clarification I'm
seeking is to know that as I read this there is no exemption of any
component so the entirety of the UNC health system would be included, is
that correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? answer that ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is my understanding. Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If I could, Mr.
Chairman, just for purpose of clarification, I had neglected to mention
this, on the sales tax issue for non-profits, that is one of the things
that we had a lot of questions about and the original bill basically
provided for a phase down of the refund. And that phase down actually
went down to 100 thousand dollars and there were a lot of concerns about
rural hospitals and small colleges and this version of the bill
continues the phase down of that refund, but the phase down stops at I
think it's 2.8 5 million dollars. So the net effect is that for all
rural hospitals, they will receive the full refund and for practically
every private university in the state, they will receive the full
refund. And I think an entity would have to spend about 40 million
dollars in taxable items in order to exceed the 2.8 5 million dollar
amount that the bill stops at. And it takes us four years, I think it
is, to get to that 2.8 5 million dollars. Again, in the spirit of trying
to work towards some consensus, this is a significant movement away from
where we were before  and a significant movement towards the position
that others have expressed and a significant movement towards,
hopefully, reaching some compromise on this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator Stein. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. With
the last version of the bill, we had a one page chart that showed the
actual dollar consequences of each change that isn't in this version. ??
I guess, question for staff is to when that will be available because it
was through seeing that chart last time we were able to realize that
there was a more than 200 million dollar hit on hospitals and Senator
Berger just talked about moderating the impacts, but I don't know what
the cost of hospitals are from the changes from what we have here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I'm sure staff will be happy to provide ??
when they can that sort of information and a sheet very similar to the
last one. Thank you, sir.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] And then a follow up
comment. It does have the summary consequence of this and it ends up
taking a billion dollars out on the out years from a recession level
budget that we have in North Carolina and by cutting the income tax to a
flat tax rate has the consequence of giving a third of the benefits from
the income tax cut to the wealthiest 1 percent of tax payers in North
Carolina and I just don't think that this is a sound way to do physical
policy in North Carolina. We need to make sure we have enough to fund
the critical services and not a dollar more but this isn't the time to
be doing tax cuts down the road for the wealthy when we have a lot of
critical needs, so I'm gonna be voting against this proposal. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. Senator Berger, did you care to comment? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, what I would say is that what this plan does is
it provides an additional 600 million dollars to fund growth and
government in 2014 15. Another 600 million dollars above that to provide
growth in 15, 16. Another 800 million dollars to provide growth in 17,
18 and another almost 1 billion dollars in 17,18.</p>

<p id="40:00">
One of the big differences that many of us have on the issue of size and
government and growth and government is how much is enough. It is my
view that, this is enough. [SPEAKER CHANGES]. Thank you sir. Senator
Apodaca [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. You know I think ??
brings up a good point, the way we going now, may be the way to keep
going? I don’t think so. I think we’re going the wrong way,  when we go
with taxes. I think now is the time to change it. We have stubborn
unemployment rate, although it is going down, not going down as much as
some of our colleagues who are friends; North, South, east and west. So,
now I think is the time to do a change. You do a change when things are
getting better so you won’t see them get worse as time goes on. So, I
think we are on the right path. I was talking to one of my economic
development  officers today, as a matter of fact about fifteen minutes
before we came in and he was excited about the potential by having a
cooperate income tax rate below 5 and ultimately down to zero. He said
it would help him so much in his recruiting efforts. It may not bring us
more, but it will not run others off as quick when they are start their
negotiations. That is one point they have always asked is cooperate
income tax rate. With that being said we can sit here and pick it to
death or kick it down the road a little more, but I would like to move
for a favorable report to the PCS as amended unfavorable to the other
PCS that we saw earlier.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir, we actually
have three more people ahead of you ?? ,but I’m going to jump across a
few senators just  so you can speak  ??  [SPEAKER CHANGES] I did not
realize I was jumping in front of anybody, but while on the subject of
hospitals I wanted to ask a question because senator  Sanders and I were
looking at the bill and the conversations that we had about these
proposals, were very consistent with what Senator Borah said, but I’m a
little concerned about language and may be something that we need to be
amended I’m not sure if I’m reading it wrong or what, but on page 22
lines 11 through 15, it does not look like the 2.85 is what’s in writing
and I did understand that was what we were doing as senator Borah laid
out, but I wanted to point that out that unless I’m reading the wrong
section or something it looks to me we’ve got our numbers wrong [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator If you look on page 21 and 22, if you add those numbers
up I think that you will see that [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mr.
Chairman [SPEAKER CHANGES]  one is the state refund and the other is the
local. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ok we are going
to hear from Senator Cook and then Senator Woodard, then we going to
bring this thing to a bud. Senator Magisic I may just hear from you but
thank you sir. Senator Cook   [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Borah over here
   [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Cook [SPEAKER CHANGES] Wonder if you share
with us what you believe the economic impact of this legislation will be
in the future specifically more toward our business position as relative
to other states and that sort of thing.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well in some
respect. Thank you Senator Cook. To build on what Senator Apodaca said
in many instances I think corporations that are looking to grow, expand
into another state, may not even be looking at North Carolina because
they look at our tax rates. We have for years understood that we have
the highest marginal income tax rates in the Southeast and the highest
cooperate tax rate in the southeast. That has translated to us having
the highest unemployment rate in our area so it is our expectation that
by not making ourselves more competitive with reference to those rates
but actually moving ahead of our neighboring states in those rates and
ahead of many other states that we will help fuel growth in jobs and
those jobs are important. I have said to a number of folks that; If you
don’t have employers you not going to have employees and it’s our belief
that what you do with plans such as this is you make North Carolina
friendlier to employers. Making it friendlier to employers makes it
easier for us to have more employees and that translates into jobs.</p>

Sir, Senator Walters.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and this may just be for my edification, but
back to the UNC healthcare exemption, is the East Carolina University
Healthcare System considered a State agency?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms, Ms Everett?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is currently considered a state agency under East Carolina University
and it’s currently receiving the exemption. Only the UNC Healthcare
system is currently receiving a refund as opposed to an exemption.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator Nesbitt?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I’m going to have to speak based on my
understand of this. It doesn’t mean it’s so. And please correct me if
I’m wrong, but when you get into these sales tax exemptions, if I’m not
mistaken Mission Hospital up there that covers all the mountain counties
basically gets $16 million from that. They also have some of the
highest, one of the highest numbers of indigent care non-paid people in
the State of North Carolina because they cover all those mountain rural
counties and they’re all piped in there. And we’re in a situation where
we’re not going to expand Medicaid so we’re not going to take that load
off of them. And now we’re going to just ?? I guess $13 $14 million out
of them. My chamber of Commerce sent a resolution down here saying don’t
do this, that you’ll kill our economy up there. We’re going to lose more
jobs at Mission Hospital than we can recruit in a year. And I bring that
up because, I don’t want to just talk about one hospital, there have got
to be others out there that are in the same shape we are. We’re not part
of the University system, and we’re not some great, we’re not Duke. We
don’t have an endowment, we’re Mission Hospital. We’re just up there
tending to the list. And you got to give some relief to these people
somewhere. You’ve got to help them get paying patients which we can do
to make it up. Or we got to leave them alone at least, although they
need help from where they are. So I bring that up, I don’t know if
somebody can look at that overnight and try to figure out if anybody
else is in the same boat, or if there’s some way to fix this, but
killing us up there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt, just briefly, we are regularly advised by the hospitals
that Medicaid and government pay is, is not the best pay. That private
pay is the best. It is our hope that, and most folks who have jobs have
private insurance, not all, but most who have jobs have private
insurance. It is our hope that as we improve, hopefully the job
situation in North Carolina, that hopefully that will translate into
more people who have private pay and that’ll help all the hospitals and
all the medical providers. I’ll have to quibble with you a little bit
about not expanding Medicaid because if I recall correctly, we have
already expanded Medicaid in terms of the amount of money we’re spending
on Medicaid by almost $1 billion, $1.2 billion. So we are expanding
Medicaid in terms of how much money the tax payers are putting into
Medicaid. And most of that money goes into the hospitals and into the
healthcare providers around the state. So they are receiving additional
revenue. The other thing I would say is that hospitals have many
advantages if they are organized as a non-profit. They, they have
certificate of need which basically gives them a monopoly. They are
non-profit. They don’t pay property taxes and they don’t pay income
taxes. They are, particularly the large ones, in many instances,
profitable institutions that are organized as non-profits. They pay
their executives 6- and 7- figure salaries and there is more than one
way for the state, if it’s appropriate, to fund hospitals, for those to
be funded. It is our belief that funding those hospitals through the
Medicaid system as we’re doing it, is a fairer way for us to make sure
that the money goes to patient care as opposed to other things.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator McKissick. Final question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure. And ?? hospitals. First I do appreciate the fact that you’ve
raised the cap to the $2.85 million in the last year. It’s certainly
going to help the small hospitals and I have small hospital in my
district over in Grandville County. But also Durham County in my
district, which is Duke. And they’re</p>

<p id="50:00">
Get hit to the tune of about $40 million. And when you combine this with
the increase cost of their experience, and do the ?? of the
reimbursement schedules dealing with Medicaid, kind of moving to a model
that impacts them in a very adverse way. Not expanding the Medicaid
program overall is hurting them. Elimination of the Dish program is
hurting them. And this is that time they went out there just recently
and spent $200 million to the new expansions to the facilities. I
understand in the last several years you created over 11,000 jobs. If
they start taking hits to the tune of, if you were to total these things
up, and also total up costs, that they will also have to shave as a
result of less income. That they’re going to be paying that to other
private insurance companies, Blue Cross Blue Shield is out there looking
for the hospitals to pay less in terms of what they’re going to
reimburse for procedures. You’re talking about a devastating impact on a
major institution, a major employer, not only in my district, but in the
Triangle, in the State of North Carolina. So I hope that as this
proceeds, that there will be a further reconsideration of the other tax
refunds to the non-profits because it, while that money goes back to
them, they are producing jobs with those funds. They’re reinvesting it
in the communities and, and making substantial improvements that we all
reap the benefits of. So hopefully when this is all worked out in final
form, there can be some further adjustment upward to the level of
reimbursements they’ll be entitled to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And thank you, Senator McKissick. Hospitals large and small face all
kinds of challenges. And we understand that. I would say that this
version of the bill moves substantially in the direction of trying to
address some of those concerns. I think the thing that we don’t
appreciate when we see the numbers that we’re talking about, is what
percentage some of these represent of the total gross revenue of some of
these larger institutions. And we’re probably talking about less than
one percent. Much less than one percent of their entire gross revenues.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Burger?? Ladies and Gentlemen of the committee, after
a fair and deliberate debate, and upon the motion of Senator Apodaca, to
accept this PCS as amended, unfavorable to the original. All those in
favor of the motion will please say aye. Opposed no. Motion carries.
Thank you. Committee adjourned.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Very good job</p>
