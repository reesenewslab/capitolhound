  <p id="00:00">
  Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for coming. I&#39;m Representative
Larry Hall, democratic leader in the House of Representatives and
I&#39;m joined by my fellow caucus members of the House Democratic
Caucus. We&#39;re here this afternoon to talk about an issue that&#39;s
very serious and on the minds of North Carolinians from the mountains to
the coast and that&#39;s the economy of North Carolina and how do we
improve it.
Middle class wages are stagnant in this state and unemployment is
something that is felt across the state. The time has come now to ensure
we prepare to go forward and bring more North Carolinians into the
employment and workforce and move North Carolina forward with jobs for
our citizens.
We can&#39;t cut our way to prosperity. Highway trust fund shortfalls,
UNC system tuition increases, and shifting costs back to our community
will not get it done. We can return to prosperity if we work together.
There&#39;s no secret to what we have to do for us to be successful.
North Carolina has had many years where there&#39;s been a combination
of prudent spending and appropriate tax and incentives for business and
job creation.
Right now I want to introduce to you our co-chairs of the House
Democratic Caucus Committee on Economic Development and on House
Commerce and Job Development, both of them members of that committee as
well. Representative Susi Hamilton and Representative Rodney Moore.
Representative Hamilton.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Leader Hall. Thank you all for being here today. My name is
Susi Hamilton and I serve as co-chair of the House Democratic Committee
on Economic Development and on the House Commerce and Job Development
Committee.
We are here today to reiterate democratic support for job creation and
economic development programs that benefit all of North Carolina&#39;s
counties, cities, and communities. Citizens and business owners across
this great state are hoping that a bipartisan effort will come together
in the general assembly on economic development programs that will
create and protect jobs and drive the economy.
To that end, we are preparing legislation with regard to what has worked
in the past to create and retain jobs and new programs that will work in
the 21st century such as crowdfunding and new market tax credits. We are
here to reflect on what has worked, what has happened since the 2013 tax
reform took place, and what decisions should and can be reversed such as
the historic preservation tax credits under the leadership of Governor
McCrory and his staff.
We face a major challenge today in North Carolina. Recent tax policies
enacted by the majority party have resulted in a significant budget
deficit that will affect our teachers, our law enforcement agencies, and
our transportation needs. This deficit is also a major challenge to
growing jobs in North Carolina. It is the result of these ill advised
tax policies implemented by the majority party now in the legislature.
Now, in response to the budget deficit, the leadership party appears
unwilling to continue or to provide new job creating incentives because
they claim that these initiatives will cost the state money but in fact
they have helped bring jobs and increased revenue to the state over the
years. We must invest.
North Carolina now ranks 41st overall in its outcomes for its residents.
In North Carolina, the growth of low wage jobs is now 11.5% higher than
the rest of the country. Unemployment numbers may be down in North
Carolina but the wages earned from these low wage jobs make it
impossible for North Carolina families to make ends meet.
Without the presence of bipartisan policies and programs that serve all
100 counties in North Carolina, and allow our commerce department to
compete with other states, it is safe to assume continued job loss
across state lines. Take for example the 7,000 jobs that have crossed
the border from Charlotte into South Carolina in recent years and the
thousands of jobs from film and television production that have
announced relocation to Georgia. As our competitive programs are
eliminated we can expect these losses to continue and possibly
accelerate.
I&#39;d now like to introduce our co-chair for economic development
working group and vice-chair of the House Committee on Commerce and Job
Development, Representative Rodney Moore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Hamilton, and thank you, colleagues, and thank
you who are here at the meeting. My name is Representative Rodney Moore.
I represent house district 99.

  ...County.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We will now discuss how we can have some bipartisanship and have some
sensible approaches to economic development that all of us can get
behind. Prior to 2011 economic development and job creation policies
that have proven effective were the result of bipartisan efforts to
create and keep jobs in North Carolina.
There is a good reason for this. True bipartisan efforts in legislation
that is based on what is best for all citizens across the state, not
solely for ones individual party or it&#39;s beliefs. A partial list of
these programs that have been terminated or significantly altered and
damaged by the GOP; I&#39;ll just go over a few of them. Inadequate
funding for our JDIG, Job Development Investment Grant, a decades old
bipartisan program that has left us ineligible for the last 90 days to
compete for new jobs and companies coming to North Carolina.
Research and development tax benefits that was repealed in 2011 and ends
the states participation in the university research, small business
investments, and ECHO industrial park development. Renewable energy tax
credits set to expire the end of this year. Historical preservation tax
credits. 90-100 North Carolina counties has benefited from this
investment and now its gone. Port enhancement zone incentives expired
last year. It allowed for North Carolina counties to combine efforts for
industry recruitment in their regions in utilization of favorable tax
status for each job created.
Film and television production resulted in the lost of 3,000 North
Carolina jobs. Aviation tax credits are used by commercial airlines and
motorsports industries and it supports thousands of jobs with our
airlines and all the racing industries that will end in December of
2015. The lack of carefully monitored closing funds to compete in our
21st century economy.
As you&#39;ve seen, we&#39;ve lost some particular opportunities to
bring industry here because all of these things or some of these things
have been repealed or greatly reduced.
Many have joined us today, my colleagues and those on the media and
those who are listening to the sound of my voice through the internet to
provide and [unclear 00:02:42] our perspective and notify our friends
across the aisle and across the state that we are ready, willing, and
able for a true bipartisan discussion on issues and policies that will
create jobs and opportunity in all of North Carolina.
We applaud the governor and Secretary Kluttz for recognizing the need to
continue the historic preservation programs for the state that will
benefit and rural and urban communities alike. As the governor stated
from historic Concord last week, now is not the time to stop it. It is
time to expand it.
As democrats and minority we hope that the governor will reach across
the aisle to house and senate democratic leadership and find true common
ground on policies and programs with a successful track record,
including but not limited to the historic preservation program. The
people of North Carolina expect that we will work together and find a
way to continue these job creation programs for the benefit of North
Carolina. The people expect no less and we will do all that we can to be
the leaders of this Carolina comeback that has been talked about for so
long. This is the true Carolina comeback right now that you&#39;re
starting to see.
So I guess we&#39;ll take some questions. [unclear 00:04:10]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right now I&#39;ll just let the co-chairs, Representative Moore and
Representative Hamilton, handle any questions you might have [unclear
00:04:18] question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any improvement or changes you&#39;d like to see in the jobs
incentive program as Governor McCrory rolls out a new proposal? Any ways
that JDIG or any of the others can be improved upon in the future?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
JDIG is a decades old program that both democrats and republicans have
supported repeatedly throughout the years with an annual appropriation.
My understanding is that the governor would like to put more money into
that program. I&#39;m also hearing that he wants to change the name of
the program but simply it would function the same as

  <p id="10:00">
  I am told the problem with that is that you begin changing names and
jargon and industries outside North Carolina and site selection folks
outside of the United States and outside of North Carolina begin to get
a little confused. See, that’s part of the problem we’ve had in the last
several years is the public seems confused as to whether or not North
Carolina is open for business and what I mean by that is that they’re
not certain which programs are going to be extended, which programs are
going to be eliminated, which programs are going to be turned into
grants, which programs are going to go through the appropriations
process, and not understanding what the playing field looks like. It’s
very difficult for the private sector to make a valid decision and for
that reason we’ve seen a lot of industries turn and go to other states
where they have more certainty.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, is the argument, following up on that. So, is the argument then that
you can’t repeal any incentives programs because you might confuse
people? Could you talk about that? There’s one thing to have certainty,
but some programs may not be giving the state the bang that it wants
from the buck.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly. There are over 250 tax credit programs in statute in the
state of North Carolina and the public only seems to hear about the ones
that have been targeted, if you will. One of those being the Historic
Preservation Tax Credits, the Renewable Energy Tax Credits, film
credits, things, the Earned Income Tax Credit, if you will, so those
things have been sought out and eliminated or allowed to expire. But,
what hasn’t happened is a full observation or study on to which ones are
profitable and which ones are not. The large sucking sound you heard
from the film and television industry over the last several weeks since
the credit ended would be the example. Clearly, we have a burgeoning and
very successful program in North Carolina and since it closed down on
December 31, we’ve seen an 80% reduction in calls to consider North
Carolina as a place to do business and we’ve had several announcements
of existing productions leaving the state. The same is true for all 90
counties that have utilized the Historic Preservation Tax Credit over
the years. They are now seeing falling apart of real estate activities
and no interest in restoration and building their historic downtowns
because of the elimination of the tax credits. So, what we are asking is
that we be considered in the discussion because frankly we think that
the Republican Party needs the input from the Democratic Party and
frankly our votes to fully realize a true economic development policy in
this state and right now that’s not happening.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me say very quickly. If we have to have some type of bipartisan
solution, we have to have some type of conversation across the aisle.
Let me remind some of you about this great state’s economic prosperity,
if you will. The economic prosperity that this state has enjoyed over
the last 75 years has been because of bipartisan and Democratic
policies.  And so, what we need to do is get back to all of us having a
seat at the table, all of us driving this ship because it’s clear to me
and it’s clear to my colleagues in this room and across the state that
because of some of the things that the majority has done on their own,
we’re now suffering in North Carolina in various ways. We have a very
large revenue shortfall. We’re becoming less competitive with attracting
new industry here in North Carolina and so we need to have a
comprehensive broad-based policy to address some of those issues. In the
next week or so, we will be coming out with some proposed legislation,
Representative Hamilton and I, and that will talk about some of the
things that we talked about today. We’re looking at how to enhance the
programs that we have, but we’re also looking at new and innovative ways
to that we can spur the economy. Susi talked about new markets tax
credits, crowdfunding, and those things. So, all of these things are on
the table. All of these things should be included in the economic
toolbox, so that we can really have a Carolina comeback and bring jobs
and industry back to North Carolina.

  So that all of our citizens can, can prosper economically.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There are certain senators who have said all along that their, that
their philosophy is to end all these tax credit programs and, and they
let, they let several of them die last year, or, or expire last year.
What makes you think there&#39;s gonna be any type of change of heart
or, or that they&#39;re gonna go back on what they did? I mean
they&#39;re not usually ones that go back on what they do or say.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for the question. This is a representative form of government,
and the people want to see both parties coming together and finding real
solutions for the economic problems that are present in our state right
now. So if I were suggesting to any other elected official in the body,
be they Democrats,  Republicans, Senator, or House, I would say remember
who you&#39;re representing and ask them what they want to see happen.
It&#39;s not about just what the people who were sitting the chair and
have access to the button think. We must be reminded that we are a
representative form of government, and job creation is what we all
continue to talk about because that&#39;s what our constituents are
talking about, and what we are here talking about today is true
bipartisanship, not picking winners and losers. True bipartisanship to
work out a real program that benefits the state of North Carolina, just
like has happened over the last 40 years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The argument we&#39;re hearing from Republican ?? groups like AFP is
that the better way, rather than using incentives to attract jobs is
through simply cutting personal and corporate income taxes. What do you
see as issues with that argument?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, it hasn&#39;t worked. First of all, it makes no sense that we have
a lower unemployment rate in this state right now and less revenue to
fund public education and law enforcement. So clearly, if you&#39;re
looking for the equilibrium there, you gotta figure out wow, somethings
wrong in the policy. More people are working, we&#39;re collecting less
revenue to support government functions that are required. So I think
that it, it, and in addition to that, last week, the Governor&#39;s
former budget director, Art Pope, stated very plainly himself that he
was going to encourage the general assembly not to move forward with tax
reform 2.0, that we needed to let the dust settle and figure out where
we were before we implemented more cuts. And I, I think that that&#39;s
a very strong message coming from someone who I fundamentally often
disagree with. But for he to even recognize that we are in some trouble
right now I think is all the more reason for us to hold this press
conference today and to make these statements.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Before, before we end is there any other, any other member who would
like to say something very briefly? Representative Haines?
Representative Michaux? We&#39;re gonna end it right here? Well thank
you guys for, for coming. Please stay tuned. I think that in the next
couple of weeks you will see our proposal in real time and we&#39;ll be
back to answer questions and see how we can best move North Carolina
forward. So thank you.
