read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] House Bill 895 ?? Health Education Center, honor
Representative Mary Nesbitt. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca is
recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister President, members. I
never had the occasion to know Representative Nesbitt. But everything
I've heard about her she was a remarkable woman. And dedicated her life
to service of the folks of Western North Carolina state and North
Carolina. She was a dedicated teacher. And Andrew, what I found most
interesting, she had a Bachelors and Masters from Culloway. So that puts
her in an elite category right off the bat. But, she served in the House
from 1975 through 1979 and served with distinction. I asked the Senator,
Blue, if he knew her and I think it was before his time. And Senator
Allran didn't know her either, he came in right as she was leaving I
believe. She was known as a remarkable woman. She actually, from what I
can understand only had one fault. And that was a son who took over for
her when she passed in 1979, was it Martin? And I know she's proud of
you. We all are, in Western North Carolina, truly. But, I think, what
speaks volumes about Mrs. Nesbitt are the three sponsors of this bill.
And that is how well she is thought of, and still thought of in North
Carolina. And with her attention and dedication to education, we thought
the Mayheck Educational Facility would be the excellent place to name it
after. So I encourage you to support this and honor a great lady. Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate? Hearing on the
