  Senate will come to order. Sergeant of Arms close the door. Members go
to their seats. Members and guests in the gallery please silence all
electronic devices. Leading the senate in prayer is Reverend Peter ??,
Senate Chaplain. All members and guests in the gallery will please
stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Please pray with me. Lord as we bow our heads, we first want to give you
thanks and praise. Ignite these prayers with your spirit, otherwise
they&#39;re just words. Help us today, rescue from darkness, place us
into your light. Come Lord, you have set this time for us, the rotation
of the stars and the movement of the galaxies. All we do is just chaff
without your every enduring and persistent presence. Give this body for
the long journey ahead. Encourage to do good work. Bless us today, Lord
Jesus and it is in your name that we pray. Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Pate is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. President. The journal of Wednesday, February 4th, 2015
has been examined and is found to be correct. I move that the senate
dispense with the reading of the journal and it stand approved as
written.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Without objection the journal from February 4th stands approved as
written. Seems that we have a nurse of the day with us today, Marcie ??
of High Point, North Carolina is with us. Nurse ??, thank you for
joining us today and serving in the senate. At this time we&#39;d like
to say thank you to our pages at this week. Its been good at getting to
know you and spend a little time with you, and thank your service to the
senate as well. Do we have any notices or announcements? Any further
business to come before the senate? Now then the chair recognizes
Senator Pate, for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. President. I move that the senate do now adjourn subject
to standard stipulations set forth in rule 24.01 to reconvene on Monday,
February 9th, 2015 at 4:00 pm.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The motion before the senate is that we do now adjourn subject to the
standard stipulations to reconvene Monday, February 9th at 4:00 pm.
Seconded by Senator Brock. All in favor say, Aye. Opposed, no. The ayes
have it. The senate stands adjourned.
