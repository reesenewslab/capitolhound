[SPEAKER CHANGES] Committee substitute for house bill 1050 the ??
entitlement act ?? revenue laws as recommended by the revenue laws study
committee, Jullia Howard of North Carolina, you're next. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Howard, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To debate the bill, Mr. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is
recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Members of the house, I hope that everybody has had the opportunity to
review this bill. I know we had some caucus meetings and some finance
meetings and revenue law meetings and this bill has had a lot of
scrutiny. It is a rather long bill, and I'm going to try to go through
the bill section by section, and when we finish, Mr. Speaker, if there's
any questions, we have staff on the floor, with permission of the
speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objecton. So ordered. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] We will try to asnwer all of the questions, so if you have the
bill before you, there's actually sixteen parts, and this is a little
different than what you have seen in the past. Actually, we try to
normally break up true technical corrections in one bill and then policy
changes in a second bill. But in the essence of time, with this being a
short session, there's a lot of different things in this one bill, so
I'm not going to stand here and tell you that it's truly technical
because it is not. There's definitely policy changes. We will start with
part one, and folks you will find that, if you have the bill before you,
on page one, line 6 through page 2, lines 21. And that's a deduction for
the state net loss. Now this is something that we had debated every
provision in this bill was vetted in the revenue laws and had full
discussion in many of the cases, the issue was so difficult to
understand that we would send it to a study subcommittee and this being
the case on part one. The deduction for the state net loss. And this
does three primary things. And the purpose, the objective is to simplify
the calculations, and ease the administration of the corporate loss
deduction, and the effective date beginning on and after January 1 of
2015. Now the three things that it primarily does, it replaces the
corporate net economic loss deduction with a state net loss</p>
  

  <h3>015:00</h3>
  <h3><audio src="audio/chunks/20140520_house_session.015.00.mp3" preload="none" controls></audio></h3>
  <h4><a href="https://requester.mturk.com/bulk/workers/A1Q9KDI5DHPHU4">Worker</a> | <a href="https://requester.mturk.com/mturk/manageHIT?HITId=38F60IALAFGIAYK0XB53MJ620I2T0D&amp;viewableEditPane=manageHIT_downloadResults">HIT</a></h4>

<p id="015:00">
That is more comparable to the federal net operating loss deduction.
Second, it removes the requirement that a net economic loss must first
be offset by nontaxable income and thirdly it instructs the secretary of
revenue to apply the standards under 381 and 382 of the internal revenue
code in determining the extent to which the law survives a merger or an
acquisition. Moving on to part two, that begins on page two line
twenty-six through page six line ten I believe and this is the other
income tax changes and this does basically four things and the first
being it corrects the dollar amount of the section 179 expense
investment limit. Last year there was simply an error made on the 179
provision and this provision needs to be enacted just as soon as
possible since it does impact the 2013 tax returns. Secondly it also
deals with the 179 provision it allows an asset transfer prior to
January 1 2013 to receive the full benefit of section 179 expense
reduction. If you remember we coupled from the federal section on 179
expense deductions and a little bit complicated, the state taxpayer has
to add back 85% of the federal deduction and then deduct the 20% back so
this is correcting and clarifying those two provisions on 179. The third
thing that it does it clarifies the application of the standard
deduction and the $20,000 deduction for mortgage interest expenses paid
and the property tax paid on real estate. The fourth thing that this
section does it updates the statute of reference in GS105-160.2 which
imposes income tax on the states and trust. Normally states and trusts
generally receive the same modifications to taxable income and tax rates
as a single individual. Under section law 2013 remove the statutes
allowing the modifications of North Carolina taxable income and setting
the tax rate. Moving on to section three part three and I believe that
will begin on page six line forty-one through page seven line forty-two.
This is the agricultural exemption certificate and in section law 2013
316 we imposed an income threshold a person must meet to qualify for a
sales tax agricultural exemption certificate and effective for purchases
made on or after July 1 of 2014. This part simply gives guidance to the
farming community and to the department of revenue as to the
administration of the income threshold and it also allows the threshold
to be met through a three year adjustment income averaging to address
incomes of income for the farming operations. Moving on to part number
four, the prepaid meal tax and this is another part of the bill that
really needs to move forward quickly because parents are already paying
tuition and buying meal plans for college students so we need to put
this in place as quickly as we can. The section law 2013 316 repealed
the sales tax exemption for meals served to students in dining room</p>

<p id="020:00">
Legally operated by the educational institutes. The repeal of the
exemption imposes the sales tax on a transaction basis; however, in
practice meals are not always directly sold. Today educational
institutes sell a variety of meal plans that offer choices between a
number of meal swipes and sometimes called food dollars and various
colleges called them different things that tie in to their campus but
regardless of all of those things this part imposes a sales tax on the
gross receipts derived from the prepaid meal plans and makes other
changes that will greatly simplify the administrative compliance burden
and that will alleviate a lot of the confusion regarding who is the
retailer, what is the taxable transaction, and how the local tax
revenues are sourced. Again, this is a part of the bill that is very
important that we get this passed so there's clarification for the
parents who began to pay those tuition and meal costs early in June.
Moving on to part number five this is the admissions and I believe you
will find this section on page ten beginning on line eight through page
fourteen line number three. In section law 2013 316 change the taxation
of live events and movies from the gross receipts privilege tax to a
state and local sales tax. It also expanded the sales tax base to
include other attractions for which an admission is charged and the act
list five exemptions from the tax. The committee received numerous
questions regarding this part of the bill and tried to address all of
those questions and concerns and again this was also sent to a
subcommittee of the revenue laws and that subcommittee revenue
recommendation of streamlining and limiting the number of exemptions was
the simplest way to ease the confusion and ensure that similar events
are taxed the same, regardless of who sponsors those events. Moving on
to part six I believe you will find that on page fourteen line five
through page seventeen line twenty-four. Under section law 2013 316 we
expanded the sales tax base to include the sales price of a service
contract and this part simply removes some of the confusion and gives a
very clear definition of a service contract and it addresses the
concerns of the taxpayers related to who must collect the tax and how to
administer refunds of the sales tax on service contracts that are later
rescinded. Part seven is the retailer contract provision and you will
find this on page seventeen line twenty-six through page nineteen line
thirteen. Many of you have at least heard about special provisions that
some of the big ?? stores have such as Lowes and Home Depot and they
will do a contract if you're replacing your windows. You buy the windows
at the store and you are also contracting with that same store to
install those windows for you so this clarifies what items are taxed to
the contractor whose doing the installation and what items that you are
taxed as the final consumer and we have finally clarified that, that
doesn't make any enhancement or decrease in any tax revenues but it
certain clarifies..</p>

<p id="025:00">
for the Department of Revenue. Moving on to Part 8 and these are other
sales tax changes and you will find this on page 19, line 15 through
page 23, line 4. And, this part simply addresses various sales tax
issues concerning the expansion of sales tax and it also addresses sales
tax issue concerning the taxation of accommodations from some
conflicting language with the Department of Revenue over the past few
years. This has, under this Section 8, there's actually three separate
provisions. The first being, actually dealing with occupancy tax. The
bill provides that a private residence or a cottage rented for fewer
than 15 days that is listed by a real estate local or agent is subject
to the sales tax and occupancy tax. And, beginning in 1984, the
Department of Revenue interpreted the private residence exemption to
apply only to residences but was not listed with a real estate agent.
In 1998, there was a memo by the Association of Attorney Generals that
supported this interpretation. Then in 2012, the Department simply
arbitrarily changed it's intetreptation and issued a notice indicating
that sales tax exemption applied to a private residence rented for fewer
than 15 days regardless of whether or not it was listed with a real
estate agent. So, that eliminated the sales tax and also the occupancy
tax in one ??. That was never the intent and we are simply going back to
correct that provision. The second part of Section 8. This says the
sales tax refund for sales tax paid on video programming and pipe
natural gas. Historically the state sales tax refunds was allowed to
non-profits and local governments has not been applied to sales tax paid
on utilities and that simply corrects that provision and makes that
clear.
The final piece of Section 8 is exempt from sales tax. Fifty percent of
the sales price of a manufactured and modular home. And the ?? to this
issue in depth that December of 2013 and decided that the fair thing to
do was do a 50% collection on these two products because under the
Section Law of 2013 we have manufactured homes was made from 2% with a
$300 cap to 3.5%, excuse me, 4.75% and increased the rate on the modular
homes from 2.5 to 4.75. This sales tax exemption became quite clear to
us that you're dealing with a modular home or manufactured home and not
more than 50% of the product as a whole would be included in the
material. And, again, we are not taxing services so we felt that was a
fair provision to clarify and make that retroactive.
The last thing is that we are moving on a very obsolete little provision
that would provide newspapers tax in the same and remove obsolete sales
tax exemptions for sales from vending machines of one cent sales. And, I
don't think that we see any of those in today's market. Moving on to
Section 9, you will find this on page 23, line 6.</p>

<p id="030:00">
Page 28, line?? 11, this is the Excise Tax changes.  The committee
recommended various changes to Alcohol, Tobacco and Motor Fuel Excise
statues at the request of the Department of Revenue and tax payers.
Part 10 is the Tax Law Compliance changes. These are requests that were
made from the Secretary of the Department of Revenue requesting the
committee to consider enhancing it's tools to improve the compliance
with revenue laws.  This part increases the budget for locator services
fees and suggests the renewal of the ABC retail permits to past
compliance laws.  And this is no different than what retailers must do
that sell lottery tickets so all of those go hand in hand.
Section 11, this is the property tax changes. And you will find this on
page 30, line 11 through page 35, line 22.  This part provides for
central assessment of mobile telecommunication equipment by experienced
public service company appraisers at the Department of Revenue.  And in
the current law, the property is locally assessed by each county.  And
this change is supported by the mobile telecommunications industries,
the Department of Revenue and also the local government.  This part will
become effective for taxable years beginning on and after July 1 of 15.
On Section 12, is the Privilege License tax changes and the Revenue Law
Study Committee has been presented with an overview of the local
privilege license taxes system for basically the last 11 or 12 years.
Simply did not take any action to address this issue.  But to start with
the system of taxation has been considered very outdated, inefficient
and very arbitrary method of raising revenue largely because it places a
tax burden on only a limited portion of businesses.  And there was no
set way to calculate the privilege tax. Some cities counted the number
of employees, come cities counted the square footage of the business,
and then some cities chose the gross revenue tax provision. So the
committee made the recommendation in the past, out of the committee,
that changes will be made.  So effective July 1 of 15 this part repeals
the current Privilege License Tax and replaces it with a broader tax
base and a flat tax rate of 100 dollars up to 100 dollars per business.
Although many cities may levy a Privilege License Tax less than on a
dozen received measurable OF revenue from it.  Many of your cities have
opted not to impose the occupancy tax.  But we were SEEING and have good
records to indicate that a business has the option of locating within
the city limits or not.  And if they are in the city limits they are
first paying city tax, county tax, and then occupancy tax.  Remember
these are the businesses that create your tax base for your cities.  We
were seeing the many businesses looking at the taxing scheme and they
have chosen, when their leases expire, that they are simply going
outside of the city limits and they are leaving a blighted area.  You're
seeing it in many of your cities with a lot of open storefronts that
[end of recording].</p>

<p id="035:00">
There's no occupant in there so that was one of the major reasons that
we made the motion that we did. You will also be reminded that a lot of
the cities did receive an enhancement with the expansion of the sales
tax under the bill that we passed last year and most recently with the
agreement with Amazon that will also enhance the revenues of your
cities. Moving on to the next section and that is the license plate
agent compensation and you will find this on page thirty-seven, line
thirty-seven through page thirty-nine, line twenty-seven and this in
your ?? the compensation for the license plate agents recognizing that
this was a new job responsibility under the tax and tagged together
program and the state began the implementation of tax and tagged
together program September of 2013 and under the program a motor vehicle
operator receives one bill and makes one bill for both property taxes
and vehicle registration and under the legislation, and this was in 2013
372, under the legislation the transaction rate for the transitional
period of the six months of the program was set at a dollar six. The
rate was then set at seventy-one cents thereafter. The legislation
directed the department of revenue study committee to study the
transaction rate that was applicable and the chair's appointee to the
subcommittee to review this changes and this part sets the rate at the
transitional rate of a dollar six and clarifies the increased rate
applies to all transaction where a license plate agency collects
property tax as of July 1 2014 and allows the retroactive portion of the
fee increase to be paid over a three month time period. Moving forward
to the next section is technical clarifying and administrative changes
and actually those are purely technical and clarifying and you will find
those changes on page thirty-nine line twenty-nine through page
fifty-one line seventeen. The next part of the bill is section fifteen
and this is the tax vapor products and prohibit the use of vapor
products in jails. This is a new concept and this is a new product. I
believe within the next two days, three days you will hear of an
announcement of a new industry, not a new industry, not new in name to
us, but a new opening of a factory in North Carolina that will provide
about close to three hundred new jobs for us and for the first time
since I've been here this industry is asking that we set the excise tax,
that we tax them so that we heard the bill in revenue loss and we had a
good long discussion and I hope everybody understands what it is. It's
the electronic cigarettes that has a nicotine component and people now
are using these opposed to the tobacco cigarettes that they've used in
the past. We were able to negotiate a tax rate, five cents per
milliliter of the liquid component. The entire product is manufactured
in the United States including the tobacco and it's all of the
components are sealed and you can't open it and put other..</p>

directly employed by military or work in jobs providing goods and

Carolina's 100 counties, contributing to an excess of 3.4 billion in

the observance of events recognizes the contributions of the Armed
Forces is a tangible and highly effective way of sustaining morale,
improving quality of life for service members and their families. And
whereas North Carolina prides itself as being the nation's most military
friendly state and whereas veterans, service members, their families,

repeated combat deployments for their nation</p>

And whereas the support of the families of service members enhances the
effectiveness and capabilities of the Armed Forces; and
Whereas North Carolina is committed to supporting and promoting the
military within the state; and
Whereas, the continued long-term military presence in North Carolina is
directly dependent on DOD/DHS's ability to operate not only its
installations but also its training and other readiness functions
critical to the national defense; and
Whereas, it is therefore of paramount importance to the future of North
Carolina to maintain the best possible relationship with all branches of
the United States military and to promote practices that maintain North
Carolina's preeminent position as the best location for military bases
and training installations; and
Whereas, to those ends, it is critical for all North Carolinians, all
North Carolina businesses, all sectors of North Carolina's economy, and
especially all branches and agencies of North Carolina's State and local
governments to acknowledge about not only the military's presence and
contributions to our State but also of the military's special and unique
requirements that are critical to carrying out its national defense
mission; and
Whereas, North Carolina also seeks to promote the economic development,
growth, and expansion of other industries within the State, such as the
agriculture/agribusiness industry, the renewable energy industry, and
tourism/outdoor recreation industry, and the fisheries industries; and
Whereas, North Carolina has a vested economic interest in the
preservation and enhancement of land uses that are compatible with
military activities.
Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Senate, the House of
Representatives concurring
SECTION 1.  The General Assembly expresses its profound gratitude and
appreciation to all the men and women of the United States Armed Forces
for their selfless service and pays tribute to those who paid the
ultimate sacrifice.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We again have the extreme pleasure of
recognizing our Armed Forces and what they do for our country. The men
and women of our Armed Forces do things that most civilians wouldn't
even consider doing. They're on call 24 hours a day. They get paid the
same amount of money whether they work two hours or 24 hours. They give
of themselves unselfishly in our defense to make sure the United States
of America remains a free, viable country throughout the world. We owe
them more than you'll ever be able to pay them. Many of us here have
served. And you know what I'm speaking of. The price of freedom isn't
free. For those of us who have defended freedom, we know its costs all
too intimately, and it is something most of us don't ever want to face
again. But we are fortunate in that we have men and women who
continually take up the cause to ensure our freedom. To ensure that our
citizens can get up every morning and be comfortable in the knowledge
that our country is safe. They go about their business. They don't have
to worry about any intrusions on our shores. It is something we have to
be eternally grateful for. It is something, as I said earlier, that you
cannot pay for. The sacrifices given by the Armed Forces, the National
Guard, the reserve units are just not compensatable in any way. We must
keep them in our minds. We must keep them in our hearts, and keep them
in our prayers every day to ensure that we stay free. To ensure they
know that we do not</p>

CHANGES] The Gentleman’s recognized to debate the resolution. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you very much, Mister Speaker. The Gentleman from Onslow,
Representative Cleveland, talked about many folks in this chamber who
have served. There are a couple of us I’m thinking of, Representative
Whitmire, who still are serving, but I also want to talk about an
important angle that maybe sometimes goes unnoticed. Representative
Cleveland talked about the sacrifice that those who are serving make,
and there’s not much scarier, Representative Cleveland knows, than going
off to war, but one thing I can think of that might actually be scarier
is sending a child off, and I want members to know and I want North
Carolinians to know that we do have a few members here who actually have
children serving in the military. I’m thinking of my friend
Representative Pittman, and Representative Moffitt and probably several
others out here, and I just want the folks of North Carolina to know, as
they send their children off to war, that we also have some members here
who are making that sacrifice. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Horn,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Gentleman’s recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Speaker. One August the 8th of 1962,
I learned three words that have forever helped me achieve any success I
may have had in life. August the 8th of 1962 is when I raised my right
hand and swore allegiance to the Constitution of the United States, to
uphold and defend, and put on a uniform for the United States Military.
Those three words I learned that day were “Sir, yes Sir,” translated
“Ma’am, yes Ma’am.” Those three words have been an invaluable help to me
the rest of my life, and I would encourage all of us to probably make
more use of them. The lessons of the military are many, broad and
important. The opportunity to serve your country just kind of does
something for you. It kind of does something for you when the flag comes
by. It kind of does something for you when you see a man or a woman in
uniform, standing straight. I’m so happy to see how we now treat our
military. It wasn’t always that way. When I left for my first overseas
assignment, first of two, there weren’t many people standing around
waving goodbye, and not everybody with whom I left came back – at least
not standing up – and not everybody came back with all their pieces and
parts like they left, and not everybody received us particularly well
when we returned. I’m so happy that that has now changed and I am so
honored to honor you all. I, although born in 1944 – don’t do the math –
I’m not a member of the greatest generation, but I am a member of the
grateful generation, and I am grateful for your service, the lessons
I’ve learned, and for the opportunity to honor you today. Mister
Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not,

transferee is allowed to take the remaining deductions on the 2013 tax

how refunds are calculated and to clarify that the gross receipts derive

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, this is a very straightforward
amendment. We actually discussed this last session and we had your full
support. I hope to have your support again today. This is reinstating
the debt set off provision for our university healthcare system, UNC
North Carolina healthcare system as well as the ECU health facility
practice plan. What it does, is it allows those two institutions to be
able to collect past due debt that's more than 120 past due without
having any payment arrangements made via a individual customer's tax
returns, state tax returns or any lottery receipts that they may
achieve. This is, at it's current form without them being able to
continue to allow themselves to go through this debt set-off process to
reclaim these past due debts, it is a 13.9 million dollar hit to our
university system, going all the way to a 15.7 million dollar hit
through year '17-'18. This is a vital portion of keeping our university
systems whole and I hope that we can support this amendment and move
this forward. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask,
thank you.

the universities, it's actually revenue enhancement to the universities

does go to offset some of the cuts that have had to happen to both ECU
and UNC in the education and health and human</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House. I rise
today to what I'm, this amendment would do would be to remove the
section on vapor products from the Omnibus tax bill. The reason that I
rise to ask you to support this is because I serve on revenue laws study
committee and we covered every bill that has before us in it's entirely,
fully vetted, within this Omnibus bill except this particular bill, this
section. This bill was brought to us last Tuesday before we reconvened
on Wednesday and it was presented in the committee by the industry. No
one else was invited to speak or was there to speak because when I left,
apparently the committee, it hit the airwaves that this bill was before
us. This is a huge step that we're about to take in North Carolina and I
do think that it merits the debate as a separate, stand-alone bill. And
I could go in to why but I do think that, several things, this product
that we are talking about, and there will be lots of debates around it
because it's going on around the country, right now in other states. The
industry came and said, &quot;tax us at five cents the vial,&quot; and
when they presented to us they said, &quot;a vial is compared to the
equivalent of a pack of cigarettes.&quot; So put that in perspective, we
charge, we tax cigarettes at 45 cents a pack, we will tax this vial on
the e-cigarette at a nickel. That's a loss of 40 cents for each pack we
don't sell, we are gonna lose 40 cents. That's just an issue and it's
more complicated and, yeah, there are other components to that. That's
the physical piece. If you're gonna raise your hand to vote for a tax on
a nickel, a nickel on this product, why not raise it a little higher? Or
why not go to, like in North Carolina, we have the lowest percentage,
the wholesale price, of tobacco and tobacco products at 12 and a half
cents. Other states have taken this industry, the e-cigarette, and they
have taxed it at anywhere from 80 to 95 cents on the wholesale price.
It's a fiscal issue. If we're gonna tax something are we doing it to our
greatest advantage? Yeah, a nickel is great for the industry, of course,
that's low, but what about those revenues in North Carolina that we
potentially will lose and this could bring in. The other piece is the
policy. The FDA has not ruled on whether this is, this should be a
regulated industry</p>

<p id="070:00">
They are in the process of looking at it, and do we want to jump out
there ahead of all the other states and clarify and classify in statute
that this vapor product is not a tobacco product when indeed it was
defined that it is a tobacco product? Is it a better product for
smokers, for consumers? Maybe. I don’t know. They’re not required
because they’re not regulated to reveal to disclose, or rather to reveal
to us what is in the product. So far as some of the chemicals that have
been identified, of the 65 compounds that are found in the e-cigarette
arsenal, 26 are listed on the FDA established list of harmful and
potentially harmful substances. Are young people going to be lured in by
the word “vapor product” when “vapor” can innocently mean it’s a water
product, that you’re just smoking vapor, when we know and have been told
and it is in your bill summary that it is defined as a derivative of
nicotine? So at what point? I’m a very health-conscious person and I’m
all for preventive measures, and before we just arbitrarily say “This
sounds good. 5 cents, it’s a little bit of revenue,” the industry wants
it, but have you really stopped to listen and think about what the
impact’s going to be? Have you talked to people within the healthcare
system? I’ll tell you that they’re… I just, I don’t want to belabor
this. I’m asking you to reach down and think this through. These omnibus
bills, Representative Howard did a great job of going over everything in
here, and that it was fully vetted through the committee process. This
particular Bill was not. The Committee voted unanimously on – the
Finance Committee did on Thursday – to pull out the apportionment piece
of a bill section in this omnibus bill because it really needed more
work. It needed more understanding by members. We unanimously voted. I
brought forth this same amendment and it was defeated 14-14, but there
were people that have come up to me afterwards and said “I didn’t know
that piece was in there.” I’ve already had someone reach out to me, and
maybe someone’s bringing that amendment forward – I don’t know – but
there’s apportion in there of transporting. This affects businesses.
They get a rebate of 2 % if they deliver these goods in a timely, safe
manner. Well it says “tobacco products”. Well they want vapor products
added to that, so there’s an impact there on the fiscal. There are all
sorts of moving targets. I’m just asking that we take this Bill… if
we’re going to move and support this industry, let’s do it proudly, and
let’s do it in a stand-alone bill, and let’s answer all those questions
so that the consumers in this state and particularly the young people…
there’s still some ambiguity here that we may have… we have two bills
now. Well we have one that we passed last year that Representative ??
and Representative ?? worked on, and that was to make it illegal to sell
these e-cigarette products to minors. Well we clarified in the statute
that that is a tobacco product. Now we’re coming along and saying they
aren’t tobacco products in this Bill. I think there’s a lot of
clarifying language that has to happen, a lot of debate, but at this
point, I’m not sure that I can support moving this forward in the
omnibus bill from a policy standpoint. I’m not sure that I’ve been
convinced that this is good policy. Maybe I want to be. I’m not
convinced that it’s good fiscal policy. Maybe I want to be, but is there
a better way? Can we charge more? Can we collect more, and more revenues
when this state is hurting? If you’re going to raise your hand on a tax,
make it count. And the third is the health component. What is the
impact? What is it that our young people, adults are going to be
inhaling into their system? What is in that vapor? I ask you to please
support this amendment and have it removed from the omnibus bill, and
let’s move it back to committee and let’s have it fully vetted, and
let’s make it a stronger bill than it is right now. Thank you, Mister
Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative ??, please state your purpose.

I admit to the same flair reaction last week when I read the initial
language in this budget bill as Representative Carney and I owe
Representative Howard an apology for being upset that I was kind of
being sidestepped a bit on some of the language here. As I begin to work
on the bill a little bit and try to figure out how to make it better I
came up with an amendment that's been agreed to by the health advocates
for the most part, nobody's happy with everything, and the industry
advocates for the most part. And I think it's a cure to the movement
that addresses Representative Carney's concerns that I'll speak to next
but I do not support her amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Howard please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker and I regret having to stand here
and debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The lady has recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker, sorry. I regret having to go
against the grain of my good friend Representative Carney but the 2%
discount is not applicable to the provision as written that was
mentioned and it is an alternative to tobacco, smoking tobacco, and we
looked at many other ways to have an intake of nicotine. Many of my
friends who are trying or have tried or have quit smoking, there's
something called a nicotine patch. You buy it over at the pharmacy, you
pay sales tax on it and that's it. There's a nicotine gum that people
chew, direct hit of nicotine. I'm sure my pharmacist friend back there
understands these products better than I do. Right now these electronic
cigarettes are being sold in North Carolina. A new and different product
is going to be announced in the state of North Carolina in the next few
days. I believe a safer component of an electronic cigarette is going to
be announced in North Carolina. Right now the only thing we can do is
collect a sales tax. Comes in a little plastic box. We are putting this
provision in the bill for the excise tax. We are going to be able to
collect, without the provision in this bill, we are not going to collect
the excise tax. It's not a lot of money, it's 1.4 million dollars, but
without passing this in this bill we are not able to collect that
additional excise tax so with all due respect to my good friend
Representative Carney I ask that you vote no on this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Glazier please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To speak to the amendment Mr. Speaker
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman has recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you very much Mr. Speaker. I stand, and first to
thank Representative Howard for an extraordinarily excellent
presentation on the full bill which was really very helpful and staff
are doing that in our caucus as well. But I do, I want to talk about the
amendment and support Representative Carney's amendment for several
reasons. First, I was part of the group with Representative Stam
actually and Representative Folgium last year that looked at an attempt
by the industry to try to create definitions that would have bound us
in. And to the industry's credit, they were part of a negotiation team
that did what we were supposed to which was to find a compromise and the
compromise as you recall had two components to it. The first  was to
make sure that we barred the product from children and to call it what
it appeared to be which was a tobacco based product, but second to
realize that what we didn't know was a whole lot more than what we did
know and to punt on the tax issue to really study it, to see what was
happening in other states, to see what the FDA was going to do, and to
try to figure out..</p>

<p id="080:00">
In what tax category, if any, this product should be. Well I think that
was a good compromise and my recollection is it passed pretty close to
unanimously in the house and became law. So we've lived up to the first
part of the bargain but now with very little time for everybody to look
at this issue and quite frankly with more questions unanswered than
answered, we are about to put it in a category, tax it, and on top of
that as Representative Howard said we're going to have a new product in
four days and we don't know what it is or what it's content is but we're
going to tax it before we can figure out what we're taxing. That to me
just doesn't make any sense in the rush to judgment even if we will lose
a million dollars. I'd rather lose the million dollars here and get it
right, both for the consumer, for children, and for the state than put
something into law that we know will be very difficult to change and let
me give you just a few pieces of data in support of this. The electronic
cigarettes right now, there are about 200 companies in the United States
that produce but only about five make up 80% of the market and I suspect
that's not going to change a whole lot. Wells Fargo a few months ago
estimated the e-cigarette market at two billion dollars in the United
States so assuming that a significant portion will emanate eventually
from North Carolina, losing a million dollars this year to get it right
probably in the scheme of things is not a big issue because we're
looking at a big issue that we need to make a very good health policy
and tax policy decision on. Their bill says we should tax the product at
five cents per milliliter as I recall. The advocates on the health side
want us to come closer to making it an equivalent to the forty-five
cents. I'm not sure either side is right, in fact I suspect given the
advocacy on both sides that like many things, somewhere in the middle is
where we ought to end up but we don't know enough to know that. There's
an interesting point made in an industry article that I think has to be
taken into account and it says think about the reason that you're
taxing. The typical rationale for taxing in the tobacco realm is to
recover the societal cost of those products and if anything there should
at least be, maybe for this product, a different category that speaks to
the fact that e-cigarettes are different than tobacco products. They may
be, they may be not. Part of that is we don't know what's in all the
contents and we certainly don't know the contents and how to label them
on a product that's coming out in four days that we don't know what the
product is. And so at a minimum, the waiting until we can at least get
some data and figure that out, particularly when the nation is divided.
There are a number of states holding back waiting to see. There are a
number of states that are taxing at different states and Minnesota's
probably the one that's gone the further. There are a number of states
that are looking to call it a tobacco product, nine of them actually I
think so far, and I think there are four that call it something else. We
ought not be in a rush to judgment here and all I think Representative
Carney's amendment says is this tax bill with the exception of the issue
we're all having or a bunch of us are having with the license issue, the
privilege issue is pretty well thought out in a consensus bill. This is
not a consensus item, not right now and at least we ought to say let's
put this off for a policy decision and a tax decision when we have the
information and data in front of us which may not be this session, it
may be the long session, or maybe it can be later in this session
depending on how long we go at least to see what's happening. But what
ought to be clear at least from all the data we have is that we know is
a whole lot less than what we don't know and for that reason
Representative Carney's amendment makes extraordinary good policy sense
and I would urge the body to support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Pittman please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman has recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. First thing occurs to me is as I
read the bill as it stands, there's nothing there that prohibits raising
the tax later on. This is a place to start and I think it's good enough.
Plus I would say that, as far as I understand, we're talking about a
legal product and as an old country boy that used to hang tobacco when I
was teenager, worked for some good people, I think we've kicked the
tobacco industry around enough and maybe we owe them a little deference
so I think this is enough of a tax to get started with, if you want to
raise it you can do it later.</p>

your purpose. Representative ??, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is
recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. I rise to support Representative Carney's amendment. We really
are not ready to vote on this bill. Especially my concern has to do with
the low tax. Of course we can raise the tax sometime later. Do you know
how many years it took us to raise the tax on regular cigarettes? Years
and years and years, and we still haven't raised it enough. It still
needs to be raised to be more equal to what other states are doing. What
happened when we raised the tax on cigarettes? Not enough, but some,
teen smoking went down, as it has in every state where they've raised
the cigarette tax. There's evidence that e- smoking electronic
cigarettes lead to regular nicotine addiction and smoking regular
cigarettes. We don't need to go down this road again, we've been there
already. Let's vote yes on this amendment, get this provision out, have
an adequate debate on it, hear from all the parties, and make a
reasonable decision based on good information. Vote for the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stone, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Speaker, ?? Dr. Folgum for a question? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Doctor Folgum, does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes
I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do we
have any indication that this product causes cancer or lung problems, or
anything connected to the cigarette industry? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Nicotine
is an addictive product in certain concentrations, but we do not have
any indication that this is a cancer-causing product, like cigarettes
and other mostly tobacco products. No, that's the truth. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Wells, please state
your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I expect it would be impossible to talk about tobacco in a
general assembly in North Carolina without a lot of emotion getting
involved. In the prior eight generations of my family are buried in Red
Clay Hills, that weren't good for much else but tobacco. And I didn't
have many family gatherings that didn't involve a discussion of the
fields or the barns, or even that I got to ride in the occasional sled
in drawn by a mule from the fields. But I made great efforts to avoid it
as soon as I could because I didn't like the nature of the heat and the
sweat and all the work that went into it. So I chose another industry.
And that's one I want to talk about. What we're debating is does our
nicotine delivery device need to be battery driven with a vaporizer or
have a fire on the end of it? A burning fire. Fires cause problems.
Here's one: instead of going into the tobacco industry, I went into the
furniture industry, and spent ten years in a furniture factory. Back in
the 80s we had a little issue caused by the state of North Carolina. The
furniture industry still has an issue, this one caused by the federal
government. If you, anybody here, God forbid, goes home tonight and
falls asleep with an on-fire nicotine delivery device in your mouth, and
burned yourself to death, whose fault is it? According to the federal
government, it's the fault of the sofa manufacturer. So that industry
has for decades struggled with how do you make a furniture product that
is affordable and comfortable, fashionable, and fire-proof? And it
really can't be done! But the fire-proof thing keeps hanging in there.
We're still dealing with that. I come from a community called Hickory.
Furniture's a big deal. We've lost 30,000 jobs in that four-county MSA
since 2000. Those were manufacturing jobs and more than a fair share
came from the furniture industry. We're still struggling with this whole
issue of how do you make flame-proof households? We're not going to do
that. Should there be a spread in pricing between a nicotine delivery
device that is battery driven and doesn't burn, and one that is on fire?
In your house, around your kids, in your car, tossed out of your car
window and starting forest fires? How do we want to do that, and should
there be a spread? I think there should be a price spread. I think we
should encourage people to use device that's not on fire.</p>

?? So I oppose this amendment.
[Speaker Changes]
Representative Samuelson please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes]
To Speak in opposition to the amendment.
[Speaker Changes]
The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[Speaker changes]
You know when your last, people gradually sort of take all your points
and I’ll have to admit representative Whales, that one about fire safety
was my last one.  But I do want to sort of just summarize one, is the
misconception when people have talked about the equivalency between a
pack of cigarettes and the patch that their selling on the vapor
products, they’re talking about equivalency in nicotine. Not the
equivalency in tobacco, not the equivalency in anything else. So it’s
the equivalency in the nicotine which, as representative Howard brought,
up you can get through patches, you can get through gum, all sorts of
things. So let’s don’t get confused with that comparison of a pack of
cigarettes to these vapor products.
Another thing that was brought up was you got a sheet here on all these
states that are considering it. I went through with someone else and my
understanding is of the list, 10 of them decided for right now that they
actually wanted to wait and see what other states were going to do. And
so it’s not like we’re falling way behind these other states in fact,
when it comes to tobacco products, we've usually been in the lead. We've
usually sort of set the standard so I think that that would make sense.
I think only Minnesota has actually done one at this point. As
representative Howard also brought up, right now, these products are
being taxed no differently than everything else.  It’s a sales tax. Now,
I’ll agree that they’re not as dangerous, from what I can tell, as
regular cigarettes, but I also agree that I don’t think they’re just
totally benign, and we ought to have some sort of tax on it. So when you
go back to the argument that Representative Glazier brought up about the
comparison of five cents versus forty cents right now its zero. If we do
absolutely nothing it’s zero. So let’s go ahead and put something in
place. Put the five cents on there. If we do decide later that because
of some action that the feds take, I’ll remind you the feds are
notoriously slow, if they actually do make a change that impacts what
we've done, there’s nothing to stop us from coming back and reflecting
that in future sessions. But for right now I think we need some sort of
recognition that this is a different product. I think the five cents
proposal is fair and relevant based on what we’re doing, and we are a
state that, in the tobacco industry, has lead the way, and I think it’s
time for us to do that on this. I urge you to vote against the
amendment.
[Speaker Changes]
Representative Wilkins please state your purpose.

The speak to the amendment Mr. Speaker
[Speaker Changes]

[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
I really didn't think I had a dog in this fight until I started
listening to the comments. I’m not sure we’re getting exactly what it is
the amendment trying to do. The amendment is not about being fireproof.
I’m not sure it’s about addiction. I think the amendment is about
transparency. And if you want to walk away from here at the end of the
summer, or whenever we’re through, and say I took a swing for
transparency, then you’ll vote for this amendment.  Thank you.

Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Last year we considered the bill HB 864 that morphed itself into the
Senate bill 530. This was about prohibiting sales of e-cigarettes to
minors. We had a long discussion at that time in committee and on the
floor about pros and cons of what this product was.  As far as waiting
till more clarification occurs we can wait and more products come out
and pass more bills and be back here in special session.
The FDA is now considering in the comment period specifically how to
regulate these products nationwide in regards to labeling, milligrams
per cc of the product. The interesting thing was heard when this thing
was discussed in the finance committee was the staff said the average…..</p>

taxation on this unit and as a sole equal, as far as usage is concerned,
a pack of cigarettes would be in the 30 cent range. So we're not talking
about 5 cc's total tax if we tax it under this new regimen. I did not
understand the implications of what we were trying to do with this
finance committee bill. I thought it was in conflict with the bill we
passed last year in regards to calling vapor products a tobacco product,
which we did. This seemed to say it wasn't a vapor and tobacco product
int he same sentence. My amendment cures that, I think, it calls it out.
It says it is a tobacco product for the purposes of both social policy
and taxation policy. It is a new product. It can't be taxed under the
same regimen that we do with excise taxes on, for example, chewing
tobacco and snuff, cigarillos, cigars, and cigarettes because it's not
that. It is a cartridge ?? liquid that contains nicotine that's used up
as we've heard, by putting it in an electronic device that heats it up
and turns it into a vapor. It ain't perfect but it sure beats smoking a
cigarette and that's what we're after. Whether this leads to more
addictions and more cigarettes I just don't think the data will show
that. There's some danger here but there's a lot more danger than not
doing something. The amendment length is due to the conforming nature of
the language that's required to make sure it conforms with the tax
policies that we want to have it conform with, with all the things that
are in that particular section of the bill, but it simply says that
vapor products are tobacco products and this is for the purpose of
sales, direct sales, vending machines, and internet sales. Now, we're
getting all kinds of products into this country from outside our
country, like China and so forth, and some of these things are a little
suspect about how much nicotine they contain per cc and so forth and I
think the Clean Drug Administration has that pretty much under control
about what they're gonna demand be revealed on the package. So I ask for
your support and I think this is a good amendment. I think it cures my
questions, at least, and help many others that has ?? of the industry
and as I said most of the health advocates think this is an improvement
on the situation and I ask for your support.

mister speaker there's also a second portion to re-write to say that a
business that manages rental properties, that the individual rental
properties will not be considered a separate location for the purpose of
privilege license tax, but only the office that does the rentals, the
actual homes in which people lived are not location taxable.  This is
designed to nail down with certainty that a privilege license will only
be collected from businesses within the town limits of a city that does
it. And the history from this is that--I got a very interesting database
from a WSOC reporter Alisso Lados said it had spent 350 dollars to buy
all the data from the city of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County.  I knew
there were businesses in my home town of Mathews that were paying
privilige licenses to the largest city in Mecklenburg county, often at a
considerably higher rate than they were paying to the town.  What I
discovered with negotiations back and forth with said city to make sure
information I had was accurate that 440 business in Mathews and Mint
hill pay a privilege business license to the largest city in mcklenberg
county.  In Mathews, its higher than Mathews charges, in Mint Hill,
there is no privilege license tax, the only one they pay is to the
largest city of Mecklenberg county. There are also several towns in the
north of mcklenberg county. Huntersville has never charged a tax,
Cornelius used to but now they no longer. Their businesses pay a
privilege tax to the largest city. Davidson businesses pay both. In
Pineville they also pay.  If it stayed within Mecklenberg county this
just might be a fight among sisters but--the phrase used sometimes to
describe North Carolina is that it spreads from Murphie to Manthea.
Well in Murphy three other businesses in Representative West's district
are Charlotte privilege business license, I'm sorry I didn't mean to say
them but the largest city in Meclenberg county.  Also representative ??
are two of the businesses in your district that pay a business privilege
license in fact 82 of 99 businesses in North Carolina have business
paying for the privilege of selling to people that live in the largest
city of the state. For instance representative Hamilton Katlin and Davis

Speaker, members of the House, I rise because I've heard no one talk
about the harms to cities in terms of the financial impact of this bill.
 In the House Finance Committee there was a staff that prepared document
that showed between 14 and 25 millions of dollars that would be lost,
state-wide, to cities.  That the Privilege License Tax has multiple
problems in the way that it is implemented, I don't think anybody really
disagrees with that in this chamber. But over the years when we have
done things as a house and as a general assembly to have some impact on
the financial situation of our cities, we have strived to set the bill
in a way that is called a hold harmless bill, a bill that in other words
does not harm the city in terms of their financial situation.  With the
change in the privilege business license to a limit of a hundred dollars
per enterprise, we do not hold the city harmless.  I ask my city to
provide some data on what will happen to the city with the exiting
system of nor raising any city that's taxed by 50, and Max said</p>

Maximizing the tax at 100 dollars. And if we do that in this bill as it
looks like we're inclined to do, there will be an impact of 2.2 million
dollars for Durham alone. Durham should not have to take that kind of
hit. I wish revenue laws had developed a bill that showed ways in which
the privilege tax could be cleaned up and raised revenue for our cities.
And it's not just Durham. It includes Hickory, it includes Lumberton, it
includes High Point. Those are among the top seven. All of these cities
and many many more are hurt by the fact that the privilege tax has not
been set up in a way to hold the cities harmless. I think that's a big
mistake. It's a reason enough to vote against the bill. I encourage
people to vote against the bill, because I think it simply is unfair to
our cities, that we do not hold them harmless when we make a change.

that offer still remains open. I will tell you at ten minutes to one
today, we received a proposal from the league, and I will certainly
encourage and work with the senate once the bill goes over to the
senate. We simply did not have time to look at their proposal ten
minutes before we came to the floor, and we will continue to do that,
sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Raleigh, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mr. Speaker. I recognize the concerns that Representative Luebke has
raised. I do want to address those with two things. First, the effective
date of the changes is July 1st, 2015, so there will be more than a year
before this goes into effect. Discussions of ways to hold cities
harmless will have ample time and we will have the long session to
explore it. But also, as you probably have gathered, I really dug into
this issue and with a large city close to mine, they've gone through an
exercise recently called add-deletes. They've taken their property tax
and other sources of revenues and they put some into services, some into
debt service, and something called paygo, which is an accumulation of
money to spend on capital projects without having to borrow money. The
paygo account is funded by more than the total amount of receipts from
privilege license, from property tax revenues. But part of the service
funding is all privilege license. And we're told that if the privilege
license goes away, services must be cut. I would submit that's not
really accurate. Priorities have to change. And it's a fairly easy swap.
You take 18 million dollars of property tax out of paygo, put it in
services, you take 18 million dollars of privilege license out of
services, put it into paygo. If we take the privilege license away and
don't replace it with additional money, it does impact some of the
capital projects that they would like to pay without borrowing money.
But it does not require the loss of a single firefighter, a single
policeman, a single ambulance. So this is a manageable situation, for a
fiscally prudent city council. And it is a manageable situation for this
body to negotiate in good faith with our cities, to help them continue
to provide the services they need to. And I would ask your support for
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Wells, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the bill as amended. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. There's an interesting twist in this.</p>

<p id="115:00">
...poll, privilege tax idea. If you support the sales based privilege
tax, you support a tax on food purchases by poor people. How it works is
this: the cities, some cities, a few cities, have greatly expanded their
privilege tax reach and they have started taxing businesses, locally
based locally located business, based on their sales. When it comes down
to business there's not much higher sales volume than a grocery store, a
store that sells food. They have the high sales, they probably have the
lowest margins of any, it's all about volume. That's why they're
bombarding us with ads in the papers and the television, come shop here
they need that volume, they don't make much margin. So it's only common
sense that if a local government hits them with a twenty or twenty-five
thousand dollar tax they have to pass it on to the customer, but I took
it beyond common sense. I actually asked how a North Carolina based
chain how they dealt with it and they pass it on to the customer. Their
aggravation is not that they have to pay it, they're just passing it on.
The big aggravation is they have to figure out how to tax the customers
in one city and not tax the customers in another city so they end up
with cost and varying prices across the cities of North Carolina so it's
an aggravation but the people are still footing the bill.
Now we have a convoluted tax system, we've made great strives in
improving it but we're not through it with it yet, at the state level
and at the local level. Like the finance chair, I've talked to the lig,
I've talked to city managers, I've talked to elected officials. What do
we do to fix the mess of the local tax system? And I haven't gotten a
lot of responses, but I'm still open for that conversation. But what we
don't need to be doing is taxing food purchases by poor people. As a
state we've elected not to tax food sales so even a rich guy can go into
the fresh market and buy a $20 steak and not pay a sales tax. We do
allow the locals to apply the local 2% tax on food purchases, but we
have specifically stated in the general statutes that even that 2% is
not subject to purchases by folks on food stamps. The lower ?? lines,
our lower social economic tiers, if they're eligible for food stamps
they are not subject to any sales tax on their food purchases. But what
if it's a hidden tax? What if that $25,000 tax is buried in the price?
It's not on the bottom of a receipt, it's not measurable, it's just up
in the price. We can't exempt poor people from that kind of tax, they're
just stuck with it. So what we're saying is even though the state of
North Carolina has decided not to tax food purchases, even though the
state of North Carolina, granted with some encouragement by the federal
government, has allowed the local government, the county governments to
tax food purchases, we're still allowing the municipalities in this
state to tax food purchases by poor people. Passing this bill will
eliminate that, I urge your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative ??, will you please state your purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To peak on the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  The gentleman has recognized to debate the bill as
amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Members of the house, I've spoken with Chairman Howard
and it's my understanding, and as she stated on the house floor this
afternoon, that there's going to be an ongoing discussion about how we
can address the issues that local governments have. I have three
municipalities in my district that will be impacted if there's a $100
cap, there's two municipalities in my district that really did not use
the privilege tax as a revenue source. I served as a county commissioner
from 2000-2008 and in 2002, the state of North Carolina withheld
three-hundred and fifty million dollars from cities and counties. We
came down and it was fairly apparent there was nothing we can do to stop
the state from taking those dollars and at the end of the day there was
a fix that was created so it's my understanding that that's in process..</p>

…Support this bill this is because I think if we get together in a good
faith effort we can obeys the concerns of local government and create a
privilege tax, a business tax, it’s consistent across the state and
treats all businesses fairly and it does not have some of the
aberrations that have been noted here this afternoon.
