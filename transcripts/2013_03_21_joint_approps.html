Every body grab seats, so we can get started we have a full agenda.
While everybody is grabbing seats I’d like to thank our Sergeant in Arms
for being here today Carlton Adams, Bob Rossi, Young Bay, Joe Crooke,
Antwone Marshall from the House. Kent Lewis, Ernie Sherylls, Steve
Wilson, Ken Kirby from the Senate. We also have as Pages Zachary Taylor,
Shelby Latent, Addison Starnes and Lydia Cuener from the Senate and I
think we got some House, Issac Weatherhill, Steven Adreas, Hanna Darrell
and Deidra Logan, we appreciate all of your service. Obviously, the item
on the agenda today is the presentation of the Governor’s recommended
budget. I’d like to call on the State Director Art Pope please. Members
what I would like you to do is hold your questions, until after the
presentation is over we’ll take them at that point in time. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, members of the Joint Appropriations
Committee for the House &amp; Senate and members of the public and for
citizens of North Carolina who listening in. I am Art Pope the State
Budget Director for the Governor Pat McCory. It is my honor and duty to
present the budget recommended by Governor Pat McCory. We hope that this
provides a solid blueprint, any state budget at any point in time is a
snap shot in time. So, there is information in here that was up to date
as of last week, some it may have changed this week and as more
information is gathered and as the General Assembly goes through its
deliberative process changes will be made in the State Budget. In fact,
Governor McCory will recommend changed in the State Budget because as we
get more information changes in revenue, changes in state needs, we need
to act on that more and better information. Governor’s budget is based
on the 3 E’s, efficiency, education and economy and those are all
interrelated and mutually supporting. As we have a more efficient
government, will our savings make our governments better operating, then
we could provide more support for education, and it’s not just how much
money we spend on education, that of course is important in our State
Budget, but its how well you spend it, how efficient that is. In turn,
the better state government operates, the better education
opportunities, for both our young and for our adults seeking better
employment or seeking employment after they lost a job, then the economy
will improve and if the economy will improve, then we’ll have resources,
more state revenue for education. It becomes an upward spiral, rather
than a downward spiral. This budget does start the rebuilding process,
it provides a foundation, the General Assembly and the previous
administration, you faced harsh short falls in revenue which has caused
you to cut back in operating budget from the operating budget first.
That has been spending down on the states financial reserves and
postponing repairs and renovations, capital expenditures and other
needed projects. We’re now in a very modest recovery, modest revenue
growth, so it’s now the time we start building those financial reserves,
investing in repairs and renovations and infrastructure foundation of
the state, that’s what this budget does, It maintains and enhances
reserves in excess of $900 million. It will allow North Carolina to
continue to hold its AAA bond rating and it leaves an un-appropriated
balance of $131 million unspent at the year 2013-2014 and while the next
year is always more speculative it leaves $332 million for second year
of the biennium. That’s only a very small margin of error, only 0.6% for
change in revenue or change in expenditures at $123 million out of a 21
billion budget, so that’s another reason to have those reserves. This
budget authorizes no new debt and it authorizes no tax increases. It
almost authorizes no fee increases, but there are few specific fees
through out the budget, for example on Marine Fisheries, but there’s no
major fee increases. Fee is not used as a major source of revenue in the
general fund. The budget spends 9% less per capita than 5 years ago,
when state the population has grown over 560,000. The budget grows
responsibly [consistent] from [inflation] 1.5%</p>

<p id="005:00">
below the overall economic growth anticipated for this coming fiscal
year 2013. This is a budget that both lives within its means, pays down
its debts, and literally sets asides funds for the next rainy day.
With the general fund availability, this General Assembly wisely set
aside $213.4 million and unappropriated funds from last year that’s
carried over this year’s beginning credit balance. We anticipate over
collections from this year of $102.6 million and that was based on the
forecast there would be more revenue received come April 15th because a
great deal of income was accelerating into 2012, people realized,
bonuses, dividends, capital gains, accelerated earned income into the
lower tax year 2012, lower federal tax year which will realize more
income at the beginning this year. But that was an acceleration so
actually anticipation was going to be less income next year than it
would have been otherwise. Even though we’ll see an increase in revenue
in April, this incorporates that projection, and of course you’ve got to
start the budget sometime, so there may be more money in April 15th, but
you know you don’t want to wait until April 15th to get the state
budget. This anticipates reversions of 2012-13 of $125 million. That is
a realistic number that we’ve been using for about a year.
One of the reasons we need that is for the Medicaid funding require for
over expenditures and access of the authorized budget for Medicaid this
year which, with adjustments during the current year, applying rebates
and refunds received from the federal government from applying
additional funds that we do have, that still leaves a shortfall of $123
million which needs to be address by that appropriated funds and other
funds. Now, that $123 million incorporates a number of $100 million for
this current Medicaid budget being over. The Health and Human Services
and State Budget Office briefed the General Assembly about two weeks
ago. The HHS committees and Appropriations committees, that the range
for the Medicaid overage in excess of its budget will be a minimum $70
million and up to $130 million. We’re using the middle number now of
$100 million and that was based upon how much over budget the Medicaid
expenditure in what’s called the check write was actually here today.
That number may go up to $130 million, it may fall back to $70 million,
but we hope it stays within that range, but we have the financial
ability to accommodate even if its higher. Again, this is where we’re
working on a snapshot. You will have more information as you go through
the Appropriations process and before we enact the bill exactly what the
final dollar amount is going to be. We transfer to the savings reserve
account $200 million, now that remaining beginning credit balance. We’ll
talk more about that later. Then transfer the balance to repair and
renovation of $117.9 million.
Now later, you’ll see when we talk about reserves, we have the repair
and renovation fund at $150 million and if you look at the second column
for fiscal year 2014-15, you’ll see only $130 million for transfer to
savings reserve account. This budget is so committed to the savings and
reserve account and the repair and renovation that below the line
appropriate money for the general fund to bring that up to $200 million
for both years for savings and reserve account and $150 million for both
years of the repair and renovation. You’re only seeing the part coming
out of the beginning credit balance. We do those allocations to make up
for the Medicaid shortfall, the credit balance actually comes down to
zero. We then start with the revenue base on the existing tax structure,
that’s $20,567,000,000, that’s based on the consensus forecast, we’ll
see more details on that. That does include conformity and decoupling,
partial conformity, partial decoupling with the internal revenue code
based on changes at the end of 2012. Where revenue changes, we do
incorporate and repeal of the estate tax, which is legislation moving
through the General Assembly and the governor does endorse. There’s
other funds in transfer which we will address later in the presentation.
And then we have repeal the transfer for the public school building
capital fund. Some of you know who were here in 1985, that’s the first
year that a portion of the corporate income tax was allocated to the
public schools facilities fund rather than going into the general fund,
but every single time, there’s been a decrease in revenue or a great
expenditure and that money’s been retained to the general fund. The last
four years in a row, for the last two previous sessions of the General
Assembly, that money has been kept in the general fund under Governor
Perdue in the previous General Assembly votes.</p>

...must report back to the general assembly next year. That's a total
reference budget of $20,601,000,000 this year and $21,334,000,000 next
year, which leaves $130,000,000 in unappropriated analysis. Last year,
the general assembly left $213,000,000. This year we're only leaving
$131,000,000. That's after adding almost $900,000,000 bi-annium but also
the amounts for the rainy day fund, the medicaid reserve fund, and the
disaster relief fund so I think you'll see this is a very prudent
financial budget. Next, you'll see what is also probably a very familiar
slide to you, the general fund appropriation class sub-committee and
education is still the largest part of the state general fund budget:
56%. Health and human services with medicaid comes in second. Just as a
reminder to the public and I know members of the general assembly know
this, the total state budget is over $50,000,000,000, with almost
three-fifths coming form the federal fund and from other receipts. So
this year's total state budget is $49,599,000,000 compared to last
year's total budget of $51,634,000,000 so we have a decrease primarily
due to the federal funds for total budget. There's no adjustment in the
federal funds for sequestration. We don't have detailed information yet
from the federal government and on sequestration and what its impact may
be. Of course, that may be changing legislatively. Generally, somebody
does have oversight and responsibility for the federal block. That's the
other portion of that. Again, that's additional information we hope you
have and that we have to work with you and recommend to you any change
and adjustment of the based on federal legislative action. On the total
state budget of $26,000,000,000 that is a slight increase of last year's
total state budget of $22,000,000,000. Again, for inflation and
population growth, I think that  you'll see, it's a very responsible
budget that meets our needs. Next, we're going to have the highlights
for public education. I want to thank the state Office of Budget
Management and staff. They're responsible for everything that's good and
correct in this budget. I'll take responsibility for any errors and
mistakes which we will quickly correct as soon as we identify them. I'd
like to thank David Young, who's the Deputy Budget Director and andy
Willis, who have the title of Chief Operations Officer. As most of you
know, he is my immediate predecessor as State Budget Director. As I said
yesterday, Andy could've retired right after transition and left for
greener pastures but he's decided to stay on as a true public servant of
the state. Now, I'll turn this recitation over to the responsible senior
budget officers for each of the sub-committee areas, starting with
Elizabeth Growerstein for education.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And as she comes forward, I'm going to remind members that we're going
to hold questions until the presentation is completed. Please just keep
track of them and we'll deal with your questions at those point.
Elizabeth?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We'll turn to slide 9. This begins the public
education budget highlights . You'll look at the total spending
requirements for the 2012-2013 budget. That total's $11.1 billion. The
recommended budget will increase the total spending requirement by 1.5%
in the first year of the bi-annium and 3.2% in the second year when you
include the allocation of the statewide salary reserve funds. The
highlights at the bottom of the slide: the budget allocates $43 million
from the education lottery funds. These funds will be directed to
enhancing digital learning experiences for students, for third-grade
reading achievements, or other high-priority instructional areas. In
addition, $28 million is directed to continue the implementation of the
Excellent Public Schools Acts. These funds are needed to provide the
summer reading camps for third-graders as well as the reading plans for
parents as directed by the act. The budget also focuses funding for
teacher assistants in grades K-1. It provides sufficient funding in
those grades to provide a teacher assistant for every 17 students, which
is the same ratio for teachers. It reduced the remaining teacher
assistant funds in the amount of $17 million. The highlights of the
community college system budget begins on slide 10. The 20...</p>

'13 authorized total spending requirements of $1.46 billion will
slightly increase by 3/10% in the first year and 9/10% in the second
year when you include the allocation of the statewide salary funds. At
the bottom of the slide, this budget recommends $16.8 million each year
of the biannuum to provide funding for the higher cost instructional
programs in the community college system leading to more  immediate
employment. In addition, an expansion of $28 million over the biannuum
is provided for the high need technical education equipment in the
community colleges. The budget also funds enrollment in community
colleges based on a 2 year or current year average versus the 3 year
rolling average. This budgets their enrollment closer to the actual
level of enrollment and there is a $20 million savings for this item. In
addition, the budget is reduced $15.2 million for part time employment,
benefits for part time employees who do not earn retirement or medical
insurance. Turning to slide 11, these are the highlights in the UNC
system budget. The 2012-13 authorized total spending requirements in the
university system totals $4.2 billion. When you include the allocation
of the statewide salary reserve funds and the repair and renovation
reserve funds the budget slightly decreases by 0.9% in the first year
and is essentially flat, or 1/10% increase in the second year. Some
highlights of this budget include implementation of the UNC Strategic
Directions plan that was approved by the UNC Board of Governors. The
budget provides $63 million over the biannuum for the implementation. It
also provides $50 million from the repair and renovation reserve to
provide repairs at UNC facilities. There is also a management
flexibility reduction across the UNC system of $110 million and the
budget does increase tuition for non-resident students 6% at most
campuses and 12.3% at select campuses with lower non-resident rates than
their peer institutions. Mr. Chairman, Pam Kilpatrick will now come
forward to present the DHHS budget. [SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Thank you,
ma'am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning Chairs, members of the committee.
Pam Kilpatrick, I'm Assistant State Budget Officer for Health and Human
Services and for General Government, so if you may I'd like to start my
presentation with slide 12 in your handout. The Department of Health and
Human Services total budget is recommended for the biannuum going
forward at approximately $18.5 billion in total requirement. Of that,
$13.7 billion is receipts, largely federal funds, $4.75 billion is state
appropriations, second year recommended appropriations grows to $19
billion. $14 billion in receipts and close to $5 billion in state
appropriations. You can see the comparison with the prior year actual
expenditure and comparison with the current authorized budget, so the
rate of change in the first year of the biannuum in total spending is
5.2%, 1.2% overall in state appropriations in the first year. 5.6% in
the second year. In terms of a dollar value, that change in the
recommended budget in 2013-14 compared to the authorized budget is just
over $58 million and the change in the second year of the biannuum is
$263.6 million. The budget for DHHS includes Medicaid, Health Choice,
Social Services, mental health, public health, child development</p>

early education, vocational rehabilitation, central administration,
which is the secretary, the DIRM activities of the agency, budget
controller but also includes the office of rural health, aging services,
and services for the blind, deaf, and hard of hearing. Overall, DHHS
represents 23% of the state's general fund spending. Most of the DHHS
spending of state funds goes to medical assistants. The totals you see
in your handout include both the medicaid program, and the health choice
program. Overall appropriations to those 2 budgets, $32 billion, or 69%
of the department's total budget. And mental health represents 15%, or
roughly $700 million in state appropriations. Then all of the other
agency's services and programs represent the remaining $800 million, or
16% of total DHHS spending. For illustration, this is the 2013-14
recommended budget, or the first year of the biennium.
The governor's strategy around developing a medicaid budget was to
essentially try to shore up the medicaid rebates, which is medicaid
budget the way it is today, without policy changes, to look at some
short term strategies for containing costs in the medicaid program, and
to mitigate risk by establishing the medicaid risk reserve. The
governor's budget includes funds for changes in enrollment, consumption,
mix of services, mandatory cost increases, and yes, there is intact, in
terms of enrollment, due to the woodworking effect from the affordable
care act. So know that there is no medicaid expansion in this budget,
there is impact from the affordable care act.
So the first line item to give you the overall for medicaid is a base
budget for medicaid. It differs somewhat from the authorized budget in
the current year beacuse it is adjusted to take into account the one
time actions of the general assembly. So if there was a one time
appropriation for a particular item in the money report for in the
current year, then that was adjusted and reflected into this current
base. So we start with this base budget of about $3 billion, and going
forward the first element of change is the rebates, and if I may, I'll
just run through a couple of facts about that rebates for services
number. So the biggest driver in the rebates cost of $185 million and
$390 million is the enrollment growth. Enrollment is the biggest driver
of spending, how many people come on board. Presently medicaid enrolls
about 1.5 million folks. At any point in time, at any month, we have 2
million enrollees. But because people come on and off the rolls, overall
enrollment in the program is about 1.5 million people per year. So the
enrollment growth in the governor's budget is 4.5% in the first year,
7.2% over authorized enrollment in the second year. Consumption, mix of
services, represents in that 185 and 390 about 3 million in the first
year, 14 million in the second year. What that means is the predictions
or assumptions of how people will consume services, how many times
they're going to go and have a hospital outpatient visit. How many drugs
they'll consume, how many chiropractic visits they'll consume. That's
the second piece in consumption and mix, and then one of the larger
drivers after enrollment is cost changes where the medicaid program
really doesn't have the ability at present to control the costs. Those
would be where the federal government sets a rate, where rate is tied or
indexed to a medicare reimbursement. Drug prices, where there's
manufacturer's increases in the budget. So in that category of change
will then our rebates for services number up there, with approximately
$56 million state dollars in the first year, and $178 million in the
second. And then working down this chart, we have contracts and
settlements, $29 million each year. That's essentially where the agency
contracts for prior authorization, utilization review, claims payment,
that's where there is a cost increase in this budget as a result of the
numbers of people served in the medicaid program. The increases column,
typically we refer to that in our budgets as expansions, but we didn't
do that for this presentation because there's not a medicaid expansion.</p>

serve as the state match to complete the MMIS implementation, which is
the Medicaid claims processing system. In addition, I had mentioned
previously, you saw this in the Medicaid slide, 4.8 million dollars
state appropriation directly to Medicaid so that they can implement the
audits and edits for proper payments once the system comes online. It's
scheduled to be functional July 1st of this year. The budget identifies
36 million dollars in non-Medicaid savings throughout the budget,
through administrative reductions, accurately budgeting receipts, and
identifying state dollars that are budgeted into programs and services
that perpetually are reverting and are used for other purposes. So they
are proposed in this budget to be restored to the general fund for
availability to support what we identify as the current service needs
within DHHS. After all the adjustments to DHHS the budget increases, as
I mentioned on the first slide we looked at, 58 million dollars in the
first year, 264 million dollars in the second year. Page 17, we'll move
on to the area of general government. So the general government agencies
are listed for your reference. These are the infrastructure of state
government services. The prior year actual expenditures, 887 million
dollars and 402 million in appropriations. Our current authorized
budget's slightly higher at 413, almost 414 million dollars. The
Governor's recommended budget going forward funds the general government
agencies in total a decrease of 1.5% in the first year of the biennium,
4.7% in the second. As you can see there are receipts adjustments in
this area that help contribute to reducing the need for state
appropriations in the area of general government by an overall, I'm
sorry, there's an overall adjustment of 4.4% in the first year of
appropriations and just under 1% in the second. Overall, general
government spending represents 2% of the state's general appropriations.
General government priorities in the Governor's recommended budget, 10
million dollars to compensate victims who are verified victims of the
state's former Eugenics Board Program which involuntarily sterilized
North Carolinians during the 20th century. The Governor's budget
restores approximately $600,000 to state appropriations each year so
that folks can enjoy and visit the Tryon Palace historic site. The
budget appropriates, recommends an appropriation of 17.7 million dollars
for a combined total over the biennium to continue developing and
implementing the Department of Revenue and the state's tax information
management system. 3.4 million dollars is recommended to complete the
implementation of a new core banking system for the state. This began
with an appropriation by the General Assembly for the current year and
this represents the balance of appropriation needed to complete the core
banking system upgrade for the Department of Treasurer. And finally, I
highlight general government, the budget funds a two year NC Government
Efficiency and Reform Project in seek year. It is referenced here but I
believe it will also be covered since these funds are proposed to be
appropriated into a state-wide reserve but it seemed germane to point it
out in the context of general government. So that concludes my
presentation and I turn it over to my colleague Mercidee Benton.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, and Ms. Benton comes up, we're going to, there's a lot of numbers
coming at you. We're going to pick up the pace a little bit so there's
plenty of time for questions.

service improvement for citizens that conduct business with the devision
of motor vehicles in support of the governors efficiency and
transformation in state government priority. Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  Thank you. Mr. Pope. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I will go
fairly quickly because of my southern accent so there will be more time
for questions, and I’ll hopefully be articulate. This summarizes the
reserves which you have already and mentioned. And remember, this comes
partly funded from the general department of procreations and partly by
the credit balances at the beginning of the year. Over the biennium,
over the two years, this increases reserves, non operating reserves by
967 million. Which, 600 million was this years fiscal responsibility,
which already mentioned was the same reserve account. 400 million for
the medicaid reserve account. 180 million for disaster relief reserve
which spent now 20 million. This applies knowledge of hurricanes with
north easters, tornados, ice storms, mud slides, in Western North
Carolina. The infrastructure reserve is 367 million over the biennium,
300 million for repair and renovations which I’ll give more detail in
just a second. 67 million for information technology, which I will also
discuss. When you add the end of the year balance unappropriated 131
million to 967 million. That’s 1 billion 098 million, One billion
dollars, set aside over the biennium, not for operations, but for the
financial and infrastructure to the state which is much needed. For the
savings reserve account, originally it was suppose to be 5 percent of
the state budget, as you can see from the pattern of the blue lines of
what the actual balances were. We’ve had a bust and boom, a bust and
boom, state revenue, state government. So, when the boom came, the
general fund, the savings account built up. When bust came, it was spent
down. Reserve was later changed to 8 percent in 2006, then another bust.
So, if this recommended budget is adopted, the savings reserve account,
the rainy day fund will go up to 800 million dollars. Which, will be a
historic high, with its previous peek of about 760 million. That’s still
only 4 percent of the general fund budget, half way to the 8 percent
goal. Where the reserve for information technology, this is partly
funded by, mostly funded by the general fund, but we also have the
e-procurement fund balance of 8 million we are going to utilize for
this, for e-procurement related activities. There’s over a billion
dollars spent on information technology through out state budget. This
does not ?? work towards the effort for the key needs of the information
technology, simply to fix broken systems to keep us up to date. And,
Chris Esse’s, I believe, has a committee meeting later today, and will
go into detail. Chris Esse’s our chief information officer. Repair
renovation information fund against against the balance of 300 million
dollars, over the biennium at 150 million dollars a year. I think, it’s
important to note when you see the balances, this is the most we have
been able to set aside for repairs and renovations since 2007, 2008.
This is long over due. Quick note on the division between state
government and universities. Generally, the rule has been 50 percent for
state government, 50 percent for state universities. However, in the
discussions with the university, we discussed the issue that the
university has what has been called overhead receipts or facilities
administration fees. Basically, when they receive grants part of that
becomes receipts to the university that reimburse them for their cost.
The university then sets this aside for new buildings, new projects, new
facilities. And our recommendations to the university is that part of
those facilities fees go back to the general fund. Facilities that
generate it then for there repairs and renovations. So, that is why our
recommendation, the governors recommendation is 100 million for state
government, and 50 million for repairs and renovations to the
university, and they look to those facility fees to actually use them to
actually renovate and maintain facility to generating fees. Even after,
50 million dollars this is more money than the university has had since
2008 for repairs and renovations. Reserves and salaries and benefits, we
have already discussed this, and including the compensation study. It is
pretty straight forward, it what was requested for the health plan, and
the retirement contribution. I will mention briefly, in ?? the
government efficiency and reform. This is directly modeled after what is
called, the government reformat ?? committee in the 1990’s and the,
Governor Martins efficiency study in the 1985, has utilized.</p>

Staff resources is used, outside contractors, volunteers from the
private sector to really drill in depth over the next 2 years more so
than the McCory Administration has been able to do in the last 2.5
months, 10 weeks and come back with recommendation to the General
Assembly both in the 2014 short session and then in the 2015 session. We
would like to do this in partnership between the State Budget Office,
Fiscal Research, ?? performance ?? division, the state auditors and
again volunteers from the private sector. So this is overdue, I'll be
glad to talk more about that during questions. To answer a question by
the chairman, I said I would be fast and I was but thank you very much
for you time allowance to give you this overview. Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Pope. Members, what we're going to do is take
questions. I'm going to give you a few ground rules for the questions.
Although this is an appropriations based budget meeting, we will take
questions from any member of the Senate or House who's here and present
and interested. I will probably limit you to 1-2 questions once we get
started so we can get as many people in as possible and then if we have
extra time towards the end and there's some additional questions that
will be fine. I believe that Representative Dollar would like to lead
off. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I have a question that you all could just get
back to the committee on and that is I think it'd be good for all the
committee members, House and Senate, to have a breakdown on how the
Medicaid money, the total Medicaid money, is actually spent, in other
words what portion of that is in mental health and then what are the big
categories in mental health and where the money is spent. On the medical
side of the house how much is hospitals, how much is dental, how much is
long term care and the major categories of long term care and the like.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman we will do that and just as a remember
especially to the general public, what you see in the recommended
budget, in this overview, are primarily the changes from previous years.
That $575 million ?? for Medicaid, those are the net increases. That's
very much appropriate for the appropriations committee, going to the
base budget, how the remainder of the, how the billions of dollars plus
already in the budget are spent, and again that's hopefully where NC
Gear will drill in deeper over the next couple of years. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, and members when I do call on you if you'll identify
yourself too that'll probably help since we have such a big room, but
Representative Avila you're next I think. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Marilyn
Avila, House District 40, Wake County. On slide 14 where you highlight
the state medicaid risk reserve in the unlikely event that we don't
spend all that money, is that an accumulative amount that it doesn't
revert back, it stays and grows? [SPEAKER CHANGES] For the first, for
this biannuum, the recommendation is that it accumulates so it'll be $90
million the first year and if that's not spent it's $90 million the
second year for $180 million. We hope at that point in time for the
second budget recommended by Governor McCrory that it does not have to
be increased so if it's not utilized and it's stable at $180 million we
will leave it at that. What you didn't ask about the savings reserve
account, on the other hand the savings reserve account will need to be
increased until we hit that 8% cap. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Michaux. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Representative Michaux from Durham
County over to your right. I've got a couple of questions Mr. Chairman,
two areas. First is a very short one. The first is where do you reach
your reduction in the Medicaid monies, you've got a $99 million
reduction in Medicaid. Can you sort of give us an outline of what those
reductions are. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would want to, are you talking about
on the expenditures side or where the net savings are made? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] On the expenditures side. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will ask Pam
Kilpatrick to come forward and answer that. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Michaux, let's see. They are itemized in the budget book,
but beyond that let me walk through, there were 6 reduction options
included in the governor's recommended budget. I'm going to speak on a
worksheet but they're probably also in a different order in the
governor's budget book. Reductions in hospital outpatient cost
settlements is one of the reductions, about $35.7 million a year from
that. Mental health drugs which is, mental health drugs are the last
class of drugs within the Medicaid program that don't have a prior
authorization for a brand name drug. The governor's budget recommends
bringing this class in line with all the other drug classes within the
budget. It is the number one category of prescription expenditures in
the medicaid budget.</p>

And I'm looking through the budget, and I see where you cut any of our
programs, $21 million. you cut $10 million out of the North Carolina
Rural Center.  Am I to assume that number nicely plugs into the request
for eugenics funding, but what was the though process behind that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The North Carolina Rural Economic Center is probably
the unique program in the United States.  It was started in 1995 under
largely guidelines that Governor Jordan, after a Republican Governor
Martin was elected.  The Rural League Development Center does a lot of
good projects, and however is not directly catted to the General
Assembly or the state.  The projects that money still leads, the Rural
Economic Development Center, with $120 million in cash balance on which
it's applied to, it still funds the Rural Economic Development Center.
I've got the balance of the funding on a sheet, but it still funds the
Rural Economic Development Center.  Also, what it does again, is reduce
the funding to a third party non-profit, not eliminates it, but it makes
more funds available for the general fund.  And as part of the overall
economic commerce, we used to have a program called the Job Development
Senate Grants, J-DiSG, it has increasingly consuming a large part of the
general fund budget, it's going to arrive to $60 million this coming
biennium, and you've got to get the money from somewhere, so the Rural
Economic Development Center specific grant program, competing with
JDiSG, and other projects that recruit industrial businesses.  Also,
while this in not in the budget, the Department of Commerce, when we
propose in submitting an all plan reorganization for the department, and
the economic development job creation efforts, a more flexible public
private partnership, I think that will further address the needs of the
rural counties for their grants and needs to get the infrastructure they
need to be competitive, so they can break the cycle and attract more
industry, have a stronger ta base, which in turn will generate the
revenue and fees to further improve their infrastructure and get more
jobs.  Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Pittman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank your Mr. Chairman.  I noticed on page 3, the
repeal on the estate tax, and I would say, I'm over here, sir.  To your
right.  There is no one more in favor of doing away with the estate tax
than I am.  however, in the Agriculture Regulations Committee last year,
we tried to run a bill to do that.  And it was explained to us that the
relationship between the federal estate tax, and the state estate tax is
such that as we reduce ours, the federal government increases theirs to
make up the difference.  They just take it anyway, so if we did away
with ours, the federal government would stand up, taking that same
amount.  So, it seems to me, unless we can prevail upon Congress to do
away with the federal estate tax, we're not really going to benefit our
citizens, and it's going to damage our budgets. So I'm wondering, does
the Governor have any plans to try for maybe trying to prevail upon
Congress to get rid of the federal estate tax at the same time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Respectfully, congress did that at the end of 2012, as
part of their legislation for the fiscal cliff.  Part of that compromise
that Congress passed addressed the changes in the federal estate tax
law.  There used to be exactly, as you referred to, up till this year,
that basically North Carolina had what we called a pick-up tax.  Because
what a North Carolina taxpayer paid on their inheritance estate was
offset by a reduction of the federal tax.  That pic-up is no longer
allowed by the state with the new legislation, so that's why it's now to
be an additional tax on top of their federal tax, if we did not repeal
it.  And that's why the Governor recommends we change the law at this
point in time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, sir.  I didn't hear about that, and I'm glad
to hear it.  Let's do it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Mr. Pope, I'm right behind
you, okay?  I see under commerce, on the regional economic development
commissions, that deduction of $389 million.  Is that part of the plan
with commerce to reorganize?  Because I think that's pretty much all the
state dollars going to those commissions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]No it's not.  All the dollars, I think it averages out
to about 25%, averaging all the dollars, but yes, that is an
anticipation of the Department of Commerce's reorganization.  And as my
understanding, the Department of Commerce had discussion with the
regional partnerships before recommending that as a reduction.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Robinson.  Over to your left, Mr. Pope.

[SPEAKER ROBINSON]  Page 10.  If you look at education has an overall
net change of $284,000,000.00, can you explain that? Exactly where are
those changes? Where are those reductions taking place and...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson, is your mic keyed?  I think we have
people having trouble hearing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't know what's going on.  Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, just speak as loud as you can.  We usually have
your mic blocked, I'm not sure why.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think Senator Apodaca did that.  He don't wanna hear
me from yesterday's session.  Okay, can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Page 10 of the Governor’s Budget, there is a net
change for a total education of $284,000,000.00 in reductions over
public education, community college, university assistance.  Can someone
explain where those reductions are, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes, ma'am.  The page 10 is actually for the
community college system only and it did receive a reduction.  In part,
it received the deduction because it has a declining enrollment.
Enrollment jumped-up in peak in 2009 to 2011 as expected during the
recession and mass unemployment.  The good news is a lot of those
individuals have received their associates degrees, their professional
training, and have moved on, hopefully, into an employment place.  But,
because unemployment is still a major challenge in this state, we took
money from reducing the enrollment, including changing the formula for
calculating enrollment, from a three year average to a two year average
to more accurately reflect that enrollment and reinvested that money in
additional funding for what is called the Tier One Courses.  Which are
the courses for job training, professional associates degrees, for
health care, technology, information systems, and increased that funding
without reducing what's called the Tier Two for general education.  We
also increased funding for $14,000,000.00 a year for a total of
$28,000,000.00 for the equipment and facilities that teach those job
related courses.  Rather than that being prorated throughout the
community college system, we want that to be allocated by the community
college board on the greatest need where it best provide job training.
So there is a net reduction in the job training, excuse me, in the
community colleges but primarily due to enrollment decrease of
reallocating money to those, primarily those, two areas.  Likewise, as
you go back to Y10 for the UNC system you'll see a 5.4% reduction in
general fund appropriation.  But, as usual at this stage of the budget
process, the sal-reserve is separate from that.  It is put in reserve
amount til its allocated to the agency but when the sal-reserve is
allocated to the University that amount comes down to 1.6%.  But, also,
the Governor did recommend, on nonresident students, a tuition increase
that will realize $62,000,000.00 in receipt to the University.  So
that’s $62,000,000.00 is a reduction the general fund appropriation.
Then we're dealing with the general fund appropriation budget so that's
why it shows that decrease.  The University receives that money so when
you add in that $62,000,000.00 then the University's total budget will
be the $2,659,000,000.00 versus last year’s $2,663,000,000.00 which is a
reduction of $4,000,000.00 or just a fraction of a percent.
Furthermore, if you look- this is in your budget book, it’s not a slide-
but if you look on your budget books at page three oh nine (309) for
table 6B, you will see that’s the University's history of appropriations
plus tuition receipts.  I heard a comment that the University has
suffered $400,000,000.00 in cuts over the last two years.  Well, on the
general fund authorized appropriation for '10 - '11 budget was
$2,595,000,000.00 where last year's authorized budget was
$2,663,000,000.00 for a slight increase of $68.4 million.  When you add
the authorized tuition, the proceeds from tuitions, you'll see that the
state budget for the state funding through tuition and appropriations
went up from $3,725,000,000.00 to $4,021,000,000.00 or a $295.6
increase.  So the universities do have enrollment increases to soar with
those small funding increases, yes, but I do think we did a good job of
prioritizing any funding the University did fund their strategic plan
initially and again the University is retaining all its other recent

[Speaker changes.]...rise 65.8% cumulative increase on resident
students.  They only raise tuition on non-resident students 26.8%,
likewise for graduate students, resident students have seen a 67%
tuition increase since 2007-8 but non-resident is 27.2% so given the
large residential increase, the governor did think it was appropriate
for the reasons I've already stated to have a 12% increase this year at
the top level...12.3 at the top level.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you for that answer.  Hopefully we can keep
some of the students who come from out of state such as myself to remain
here and pay taxes, etc. I won't comment on that any further but let me
just ask you about the items for the pass through of funding adjustments
on page 238 of the budget. There were four organizations, minority
organizations primarily that support low wealth communities...the North
Carolina Minority Support Center, the North Carolina Association of
CDC's,  Land Loss Prevention and the Indian Economic Development
Initiatives.  It appears, based on what I'm seeing here, that these
programs have been totally eliminated from the budget, is that correct?
[Speaker changes.] I'm sorry, could you go back...I got page 238 in
front of me, could you go back...which agency?
[Speaker changes.] OK...item number four, five, seven and twelve.  Those
are the ones that I have particular interest in.
[Speaker changes.] I wanna ask...I think Pam has a detailed list of what
continuation funding is on that? I don't have that with me.
[Speaker changes.] And members, I got ten of you in the cue.
[Speaker changes.] I apologize. Could you repeat it one more time.
[Speaker changes.] Yes, item four the North Carolina Minority Support
Center, number five the Association for Community Development
Corporations, number seven Land Loss and Prevention and number twelve,
the North Carolina Indian Economic Development Initiative.
[Speaker changes.] The Support Center is only receiving a 10% reduction
so that still leaves them $2,250,000 a year...excuse me, $2,293,000 a
year; the NC Institute for Community Economic Development is receiving a
10% reduction, 200,000...that was...will leave them $1,846,000 a year;
the Land Loss Prevention Project will still receive about half its
funding, $300,000 a year...
[Speaker changes.] Representative Adams, I'll tell you what I'm gonna
do...Mr???????, can you go talk with her, show her...give her the
answers she needs...this is takin' some detail and we can move on with
some other questions?
[Speaker changes.] Senator Hunt.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you. Senator Hunt, Bill Hunt from Wake County.
Mr. Pope???????, in 2011-2012 biennium, we spent over three billion
dollars on Medicaid.  What did the federal government spend during that
same period of time?  What was our total Medicaid spending? And the
second part of the question is, how does that percentage of state
spending ??????? to the federal spending compare, over the years?
[Speaker changes.] If you will look in your budget books, at page
one...literally, under the tab revenues and budget summary, you will see
that health and human services were the total budget is  seventeen
billion dollars. Now that's the largest amount of the total budget so
for federal and state spending....federal receipts as well as state
spending, health and human services is larger than education and a major
part of that is the Medicaid budget.  To get you the detailed answer,
and again ??????????????? Representative Dollar's request, will get you
the detailed history of the division medical system, which is
??????????? Medicaid but also Health Choice.  I don't have a single
chart that gives that historical information.  Yes, federal spending is
growing in proportion with state spending. Roughly, thirty-five cents of
every Medicaid dollar by the state, sixty-five cents by the federal
government.  It can vary depending on the particular service or benefit
but that's a rough rule of thumb.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Bryant I have you next but I see you're
involved. I'll come back around to you, ok? And so Senator Kinnaird?

substantially reduce funding this associated with minority economic

advantage of address that specific questions right now has to three
items under commerce they were saying the north carolina biotechnology
center think free recently got about 17 million you do something like
$10 million more than half of their budget will offload good work
biotechnologies agree growing presence in the state something we need to
be deeply concerned about extra dissent concerned about the force's
institute for regenerative medicine would like reducing the 50% the
first year limiting the funding second year leslie biofuels it looks
like biofuels are going from 4.3 million getting a reduction in million
dollars these are items which give a deep concern particular look at the
fact they were trying to grow this economy would try to get people
employed again it's hard for me to understand with a sinner like
biotechnology would are doing amazing work out there and really
important communists are producing jobs and scrolling why we would cut
them for a from 17 million are generally bought some unit just in my
mind something is hard to understand and justify but perhaps you can
shed some light on those specific items for small for her</p>

[Speaker changes.] ...question or comment. The institutions for the
support minority economic development job creation have not been singled
out...the ?????? that you just went through as percentage...you look at
rural economic development center, the biotech center, percentage wise
there is a much larger reductions not to mention the Golden Leaf
Foundation, but we will look forward and review those in more detail.
Governor McCrory is open and ????????????? to heighten the tension and,
in fact, he's already indicated that for the Wake??? Forest ????????????
revisit that issue and look at either fully funding that or the
bio-technology center.  There's partly again the philosophy should the
state be funding specific segments versus generally benefiting the
economy job creation. There's also a discussion whether or not that
entity is work being better done at North Carolina State University
through the University Center...but that's why it was not eliminated but
there is that reduction there and we'll have that further discussion as
we go through the committee process on continuing high level funding,
current level funding, reducing it and lookin' at whether those
activities be better integrated with the university system. Likewise,
I'm sorry...what was the third one you mentioned?
[Speaker changes.] Biofuels.
[Speaker changes.] The same theory on the biofuels. It was...there's a
lot of history on the biofuels, whether that entity is the best vehicle
and really gonna result in return on the investment for the people of
North Carolina again versus university efforts and resources, gonna be
purely researched, even the application of that research???????
[Speaker changes.] I look forward to some dialogue, discussion and
hopefully some re-thinking on these significant issues.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Fisher.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chairman.  Representative Fisher,
Buncombe County/Asheville.  Thank you for the presentation and my
question has to do with the teacher assistants? In light of the idea
that we need to look at getting children/students ready to read by grade
three, I'm seeing in the budget where we have only allotted assistants
for K-1 and I'm wondering what was the thinking behind that?  And how
many jobs are we talking about here? And, will they be sort of subsumed
or whatever into the other grades somehow? I mean those...that's a lot
of jobs.
[Speaker changes.] First of all, again, it's funding for grades
Kindergarten/First grade at one classroom ????????? ???????????? leaving
LEA's flexibility if they do think for in general for particular classes
that they want classroom assistants in second and third grade. That is a
partly a policy debate on actual evidentury?????? real world results on
whether classroom assistants really add to the education in second/third
grade as much compared to first and second, first and kindergarten...the
number of overall positions, I emphasize the word positions...that are
currently will be reduced from this year is 3,200.  We do not know how
many of those positions are actually filled...because again LEA's have
flexibility to use those funds for other purposes or otherwise assign
those individuals who don't know the actual numbers. Those 3200
positions are the ???????? ?????????? Currently there are about 4500
classroom assistants in Kindergarten, another 4500 in first grade so
about...funding for those will increase to over 7000...so a lot of those
positions currently held by second and third grade classroom assistants,
they can be moved to the kindergarten/first.  Yes, there is a net
reduction of positions to 3200 versus 1008 increase in teachers...and
another increase in funding in the budget.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you and one...just one more follow-up?
[Speaker changes.] Follow up.
[Speaker changes.] Over into the JVS????? budget? We talked about
restoring some of the ability to pay our indigent defense attorneys? How
much of that former reduction is going to be restored with the budget as
it looks today?
[Speaker changes.] It's a five million dollar appropriation for a
&quot;one-time catchup&quot; and that's a substantial amount. Legal
services, excuse me, indigent defense is doing a better job managing
their costs right now so we did increase continuation funding slightly
and the issue that needs to be looked at, was not in this budget.  It's
how we provide legal service...indigent defense.  I think it's a safe
consensus is more cost effective, provides better services that do that
through public defender's offices rather than paying to assign counsels
and it is a recommendation.  Something we hope to look at ??????? if
this body's not....???????....some of the larger counties, which have
?????? ??????, local courtroom, custom, use a sign defense rather than
the......

Public defender's office that issue does need to be looked at and we
plan to look at that. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Floyd [SPEAKER
CHANGE] Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker. I'm Representative Floyd from
Cumberland County. I just want to call your attention it has been
mentioned at least twice, on page twenty-three, and this is, you had
indicated that you are in a business, and I just want to call your
attention that the governors wanted to look and revisit, remember that
the U.S. Postal Service was the key entity for us providing mail, then
came UPS and Federal Express, which kind of took away from U.S. Mail.
And it's the same thing here about the advertisement. And it has been
said that the pool is the one that paid in this activity. Many of those
individuals may just not want to pay the 75 cents a day to get the local
newspaper, than to be at the television at 11:21 to get the numbers. So
it may be a draw because they won't have access to that information as
quickly as possible, that would allow them to go out the next day and
purchase another ticket, but the pool needs that information as quickly
as possible. If it were just visited. Just look at it, and see if that
could be ?? [SPEAKER CHANGE] Fundamental debate on promoting the lottery
verses allowing the lottery, other than we didn't make the decision to
reduce the advertising. [SPEAKER CHANGE] We have four more, and then
we're going to call it a morning. Representative Brown. [SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, thank you Mr. Pope, Representative Brian Brown,
Pitt County, and looking at the modification of the hospital assessment
retention from a set forty-three million to a 28.5 percent retention,
can you give me a little more clarification on what that might mean for
our hospitals? [SPEAKER CHANGE]  The hospitals have undertook a
voluntary assessment, which in turn a part of that is used for their
reimbursement and generates more proceeds from the federal government.
It is a complex formula, what this sets forth is that instead of
retaining only forty-three million, the state would retain sixty million
of that as voluntary assessment, for a total of 100 million, nor does it
fund the Medicaid assessments. There are lots of moving parts,
especially the affordable care act, with the partial expansion in
Medicaid through the woodworking effect, and the governor is open to
working with the hospitals to figure out what is the best formula for
the hospitals, so they can recover their costs, and the hospitals
benefit from this so we're open to discussing that. [SPEAKER CHANGE] All
right, Representative Graham. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Chairman,
and thank you Mr, right here Mr. Pope, to your right. [SPEAKER CHANGE]
Sorry. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Your other right. Thank you sir for your
presentation, and I know that this has been mentioned before, but I'm
going back to page 238, and I'm really concerned with this actual
reduction of the item in, on this page that's dealing with the North
Carolina Indian economic development initiative. It seems that there is
no budget for this program. And I'm really concerned about that. It's
certainly has an impact on the seven tribes in North Carolina. They do
great work. And they do promote economic development and support within
the tribes. And it seems to me that the message here is not a positive
message to our tribes. And I'm concerned about that. Moving forward I
hope we'll reconsider that. And show some interest in promoting some
economic development within our tribes in North Carolina. Thank you,
sir. [SPEAKER CHANGE] ?? We'd be glad to revisit that. It's 86,000. But
86,000 is important to the recipient. And that's why we go through this
appropriations process. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Members what we're going to do now, Mr. Pope we have
three other folks with questions. If you could hold your staff around to
answer those offline. That would be Representative Cook, Representative
Faircloft and Senator Davis, who were patient enough. But we just could
not get them fit in today. I want to thank everybody for their
participation. If you are a member of the Senate Appropriations-Based
Budget Committee we will be cranking up at 10:15 to review an important
piece of legislation. Thank you everybody for your attendance, we are
adjourned.</p>
