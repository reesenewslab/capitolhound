starting with public bills, conference reports for adoption, House Bill
614.  Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 614:  North Carolina Agriculture and Forestry Act.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hello Mr. President.  Members of the House took our bill that we sent
over to them, and the conference report basically come [sic] back on we
changed in the last section on the attorney fees for both the plaintiff
and the defendant, the judge could determine if they were to pay, and
that’s basically what it done [sic] and it also changed the date that
this bill will become effective when it becomes law.  And I would ask
for your support and be glad to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any discussion or debate?  Senator Jackson asks that you adopt
the Conference Report.  If there is no further discussion or debate, the

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 998, Tax Reduction Act.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any discussion or debate?  Senator Berger, for what purpose do
you ask?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hey Mr. President, just…we had a full discussion yesterday on this; I
think everyone had an opportunity to say what they wanted to say; I
would urge you to vote yes on the motion to adopt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Berger urges you to adopt the Conference Report; is there any
further discussion or debate?  Hearing none, the question before the
Senate is the motion to adopt the …
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McLaurin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  I’d like to speak on the bill, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McLaurin, you have the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much .  I agree, Senator Berger, we did have a very good
debate yesterday about this bill, and it’s an important bill, no
question about it, and I think that everybody here certainly
acknowledges that, and we’ve worked very hard on it over the last few
months.  You know as I thought about this last evening, each of us kind
of comes to this place with different life experiences, different
perspectives on how we think North Carolina can be a better place to
live, a better place to work, a better place to educate our children and
raise our families.  My perspective is frankly based on a business
perspective.  For over thirty years I’ve been a part of the business
community; I’m very proud of that, and, despite what some may think, I
think that everybody in this room agrees that we need to do what we can
to support our business community.  They are the ones that create jobs,
they’re the ones that help keep our economy growing, and we need to do
what we can and certainly, being able to remove and reduce tax burdens
is certainly something very positive.  And I’m very proud of that
business experience—I’ve worked for a large corporation for over twenty
years and now currently I manage a small business with about forty
employees. So I know what it means to grow a business.  I know what it
means to have to sign my name on a bank note and be responsible for
paying that note back.  And I know what it means to create jobs, because
I’ve done that and I’m proud of that.  My concerns, however, about the
tax plan are related specifically to the small businesses across the
state of North Carolina.  I'm not gonna [sic] try to cite a whole lot of
research except I did receive some information from our non-partisan
staff that I think is relevant for all of us to think about as we move
forward and implement this plan and I think there’s some very good
features in this bill.  As you know, this tax plan does eliminate this
fifty thousand dollar deduction on small business-related income that
was implemented last session.  Those businesses that … [end of data]</p>

<p id="015:00">
Received that income or that tax deduction just received it really this
year as a result last 2012 business related income. So large
corporations under this plan certainly are going to benefit and I think
there is a positive to that no question about it.But many of the small
businesses we all know, our S corporations, Sole proprietorship's,
partnerships, they are not subject to that corporate income tax rated,
because they pass their income through to the business owners who are
taxed as individuals on their business income. According to our staff,
under this plan 60% of those small businesses or three hundred and
ninety thousand returns would actually see a tax increase under this
plan, and the amount would average about eleven hundred and fifty
dollars. When you put all that together it comes to over four hundred
million dollars. Only those filers, as I understand it from discussions
we've had or I've had over the last day with fiscal research, only those
filers who have over two hundred and fifty three thousand in business
income would see a tax decrease. I know many small businesses who have
incomes much much less than that.So I'm concerned about the impact of
this tax plan, only small businesses. Many have said that that deduction
that was given last session would lead to creation of jobs. If that's
the case then maybe we need to give it a chance. Cutting the corporate
income tax is a good thing, but I want to help the small businesses who
are the bread and butter of our communities. And I'm sure this tax plan
will accomplish some positive things, but for our small businesses, I
pledged to them as I talked to them over the past last months and said
I'd support a fair and balanced tax plan and I'm afraid they are going
to come up on the short end, the small businesses, in many cases. So I
have many concerns about the plan and I just want to voice that today
from the floor. Thank You
[Speaker Changes] Mr. President
[Speaker Changes] Mr. President
[Speaker Changes] Senator Apodaca what would ? your eyes
[Speaker Changes] Senator Rucho yield to a question please?
[Speaker Changes] Senator Rucho do you yield?
[Speaker Changes] Yes sir
[Speaker Changes] Senator Rucho I want to turn the clock back a couple
of years. I know you are getting old, your memory's not good, but do you
remember a time when the whole back row voted to rip that fifty thousand
dollars out of the budget that we gave the small break, the break to
small businesses. Am I correct?
[Speaker Changes] On many Occasions
[Speaker Changes] Follow Up
[Speaker Changes] Senator Rucho do you yield?
[Speaker Changes] So that was more than one occasion they voted to do
that and railed quite eloquently against it. Is that not correct?
[Speaker Changes] Yes sir. And I think the most important part is the
fact that you need to look at not just the rates, but you need to look
at the fifteen thousand dollars and all the simplification that's being
done. You need to look at the entire package to determine it's actual
tax liability and I don't believe that Senator McLaurin will actually
see that tax increase that he is describing. Again, its the first step
towards making it better, and we look forward to him joining us in
future efforts to make it better for all large and small businesses and
the individual tax payers.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Tillman ? what would ? your eyes
[Speaker Changes] Mr.President who ask Senator Mclaurin a question
[Speaker Changes] Senator Mclaurin do you yield?
[Speaker Changes] I certainly do, thank you
[Speaker Changes] I don't think you were a part of the crowd who voted
against that because I don't think you had the chance to, however your
party did. If we were to restore that, would you vote for the budget, I
guess is what I need to know since that seems to be your only concern.
Tax reform, excuse me. not the budget that's another day.
[Speaker Changes] Sir, that's a difficult question to answer, I would
want to take a look at, but I think that's a very positive question to
ask and I certainly would want to take a look at the positive impact
that would have on our small businesses, yes.
[Speaker Changes]Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator
Nesbitt what would ? your eyes.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. President, to speak on the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Nesbitt has the floor to speak to the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. President, and I appreciate Senator
Apodaca's point of view on how that fifty thousand came about. My
recollection is the last time we tried to take it off for millionaires
and people in very high income tax brackets that were getting it because
there was just no showing that it could be done. But nevertheless with
this tax bill, the whole front row is voting to do away with it.
That....</p>

<p id="020:00">
The point of Senator Mclaurin's statements to you. I listened to the
debate  yesterday and left here and thought about it a little bit. I
couldn't quite figure out in my mind why there was so much enthusiasm on
your side. Your people were speaking loudly and vociferously about that
tax package and I was wondering if we had missed something.  I picked up
the newspapers today and read them and I don't think we missed anything.
You said it loud enough and long enough to get everybody's attention and
they looked at it and the conclusion around the state is much the same
as ours was. This just doesn't hit the mark. I had a very wise man send
me a little statement today that I think is appropriate here. Its
attributed to Abraham Lincoln. &quot;You can fool some of the people all
of the time and all of the people some the time, but you can't fool all
the people all the time.&quot; We've done this four times now and we
know that you said this is just the first step and you intend to do
everything else you tried to do later and I think the public knows that
and your scaring them to death.
[Speaker Changes]
Senator Apodaca
Thank you Mr. President, members  you can fool some of the people some
of the time, sometimes you can fool them for one hundred and forty years
 but they wake up eventually and they come through. I think I said
yesterday during my remarks that I didn't care what the New York Times
wrote I cared what the wall street journal wrote and I'll be doggone if
I didn't open a wall street journal up this morning and they were
praising this package. Now I know the n and o Nashville citizen didn't
I'm shocked I really am shocked. No, I thought they would see this for
what it was, but they didn't we can hope that one day they'll see the
light. but the other thing is this morning some of us had an interesting
meeting with secretary Decker of commerce and she put it all in
perspective for us. She said last night at their home she received three
phone calls from three companies ready to come to North Carolina because
of our tax package. So I guess that's why were a little giddy.  I guess
that's why we're excited. I think what we did was the right thing and
it's already bearing fruit so I encourage you to vote for this.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President and members of the Senate.  We passed this bill
a number of months back. It had a long stay in the House.  They were
very doing a lot of due diligence in trying to give this city an
opportunity to do their study which they invested $150,000.00 in had it
consulted and ?? to what the best method of governance there would be
and the report came back from their consulting that an authority was the
very best way to go and with that being said there was some additional
due diligence Representative Samuelsson and Representative Bralley
worked very diligently with the members of the City Council and the new
City Manager. In trying to work out some solutions the bill that we
passed has been altered. We've gone from 13 to 11 members as was
recommended by the study. There were also some changes...&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

<p id="030:00">
In the selection of the members of the, 11 members of the committee,
again the county surrounding it because of the regional approach still
had their one vote, one member on there. City Council had 2, the mayor
had 2, county commission in Mecklenberg County had one and there was one
at large, a member as selected by the group. There were some provisions
put in there, being concerned about the fact that the new authority
would be required to honor all of the contracts that the city was
obligated to perform so that there was no question about the fact that
everything that was owed would be there and there was some questions
about whether if and when any type of compensation was to occur for the
fact that they transferred it from the city to the authority. There was
a mechanism to establish that level of that provision for any type of
compensation. It really is a good bill. It is something that will
guarantee the future of the Charlotte Airport, which is a very critical
component, not just for the city and the region but for the state of
North Carolina. We have a large number of fortune 500 companies in our
state that have the luxury of flying from Charlotte to anywhere in the
world. That gives us a tremendous opportunity to attract top-level
businesses to our state, along with that tax reform package we just
passed today. But also what it does is it will allow us to grow the
intermodal park or intermodal yard and many of you don’t know this as of
yet but as soon as that Panama Canal operations are finished, a lot of
the Canal traffic will end up either going to Charleston hopefully to
Savannah, Wilmington and Norfolk and then in to Charlotte as the inland
port, for the entire east coast. That will mean huge dividends to the
state of North Carolina, and jobs and in revenue, including Charlotte
and the entire region and the entire state. The future is very bright.
It allows under that authority who are very competent individuals in
aviation, logistics, and in handling airport bonds, finance, and legal
issues. They’ll have a board of directors that will provide first-rate
advice for the new director. I will tell you, members of the Senate,
this gives the Charlotte Airport the best chance of growth for the
future and would urge you to support this bill and it will provide
certainty and nothing breeds better business and climate than certainty
in how we operate. That low-cost hub will be maintained. That’s the key
component of the entire airport. And that will allow us to continue in
that and actually improve upon it, with efficient business policy. I do
urge you to support this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Graham, for
what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the concurrence
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Graham has the floor to speak to the
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. I stand today on
behalf of the citizens of Charlotte, the owners of Charlotte Douglas
International Airport. Ralph Ellison, the invisible man, said that if
you want to see how something’s going to end, you just take a look at
how it starts. Senator Berger yesterday mentioned, he said it several
times since I’ve been here that facts are stubborn things. That while
this chamber’s not a court of law, he basically said that facts should
matter. And I agree. Charlotte Douglas International Airport started in
the 30s with a dream by our former mayor Ben Douglas, to build an
airport not only for the city of Charlotte but for the region. A
regional airport. And that’s what we have in Charlotte today. In January
of this year, when this year started, the beginning, Charlotte Douglas
International Airport was humming along, fulfilling its mission,
providing air travel not only for the citizens of Charlotte, for the
region. For the region.</p>

Enterprise Division of the city of Charlotte, the city has grown that
airport to the 6th busiest airport in the world. According to the city’s
financial officer, the value of that airport is somewhere between $3.5
and $4 billion, that the citizens of Charlotte invested in, first
through general obligation bonds and later the revenue bonds. The
regional impact of that airport is $12 billion. In January, in the
beginning, there was certainty about the future of the Charlotte Douglas
International Airport. Independent consulting found that, “Charlotte has
been a spectacularly successful airport in most regards, including its
low-cost service, quality and prudent financial management.” Whether you
agree with the Enterprise Division for the city, or you want an
authority, no one can disagree that the Charlotte Douglas International
Airport has been efficiently run. It’s effective, it’s efficient, and it
serves the region. It was stable in January, no conflicts at all, in the
beginning. The city of Charlotte should know that they shouldn’t take
this personally because, this year, this general assembly has really
picked on cities a lot, not just Charlotte. Taking over the Ashwell
water system, changing the way Wake County School Board members are
elected, taking away authority of cities and towns to relegate their
boards, prohibiting cities from implementing stronger environmental
rules than the state and, just recently, telling cities the type of
insurance benefits they can provide a woman. The city of Charlotte
shouldn’t take it personally, but this is a pattern of this general
assembly, picking on cities. This is different. This is significantly
different. This is Major League Baseball and, right from the very
beginning, no one can answer a very simple question: what’s wrong with
the operations at the Charlotte Douglas International Airport that
warrants a governance change? Why would we intentionally break something
that’s working, that is effective, that is efficient? In the beginning,
the mayor and the city council didn’t even know that this bill was
coming. Then they started hearing whispers about something in the city
of Raleigh concerning Charlotte Douglas International Airport. The
Charlotte Chamber of Commerce, the business community, knew nothing
about this bill until they started hearing whispers about something
happening in Raleigh concerning Charlotte Douglas International Airport.
Our regional partners and our regional partnerships, Union and
Mecklenburg, Cabarrus and other surrounding counties, no one ever
complained about the service, the effectiveness, the efficiency, or the
regional cooperation on the part of the Charlotte City Council, in
reference to the Charlotte Douglas International Airport. Not one. No
regional disturbance. No one talked about transparency. There was no
transparency in reference to this issue, from the beginning. This issue
was supposed to be</p>

Brought to our attention because business leaders said they wanted a
change. No business leader has stood by this proposal that I know of,
and claimed it as their own, and explained to the community, in a public
way, why this governors change was needed. I serve as chairman of the ??
delegation and I've been here eight years, Senator Clodfelter longer
than that. And we have a tradition of bringing local bills to our
delegation meetings, not for an up or down vote, but for courtesy and
consideration. This bill when it left here in the beginning was never
heard by the ?? delegation, by the bill sponsor, never attended a
meeting, never presented this bill in the beginning. This bill in, the
beginning, came through this chamber though two committees, the Rules
and Finance, and its flight time was less than 55 minutes. Seventy years
to build, support, invest in the airport by the citizens of Charlotte
and 55 minutes to take it away. The state treasurer gave her comment. In
the beginning our partners, and they are a great partner, US airways
said they knew little or nothing about this squabble that was happening
in Charlotte, about whether or not we should have an authority or it
should be an enterprise of the city. That we are neutral. Here we found
out that executives were swapping emails about this bill a year ago. In
the beginning, sixty five percent of the citizens of Charlotte, by a
poll by the Charlotte Observer, opposed an authority.  The people who
payed for the airport, the people who invested in the airport, the
people who own the airport, and share the airport with the region since
its inception opposed an authority. The former mayor of the city of
Charlotte now our governor in response to that New York Times editorial
said something very telling. And I quote because I want to be factual,
because facts matter, &quot;My reforms&quot;, and I'm quoting,
&quot;have stepped on the toes of the political right and the left who
are vested in the old ways of doing business.&quot; now hear this.
&quot;But in my fourteen years as mayor of Charlotte I learned that it
didn't matter whether a good idea came from a republican or a democrat,
what mattered was whether it solved the problem and did so at a cost
taxpayers could afford&quot;. What problem are we trying to solve with
this bill? And how much will this cost the taxpayers if things go awry?
I served with the governor for five years as a member of the Charlotte
city council and I can tell you if the democrat majority had tried to
take away the Charlotte-Douglas international airport when he was mayor
he would be fit to be tied, he would be screaming and hollering
defending Charlotte-Douglas international airport. Governor I'm asking
you to defend Charlotte-Douglas international airport today. In the
beginning</p>

His predecessor Republican Governor Jim Martin, had something to say
about the airport situation in Charlotte. And I quote Jim Martin, former
Governor of the state of North Carolina. Quote, it smells. Unquote. It
smells. And it’s amazing half of Charlotte and Mecklenberg County
delegation is trying to take this thing away, Martin said. Martin said
here, it’s written a backer of an independent authority, telling them to
back off. The city was blind-sided, he said, and supporters still
haven’t built a consensus that they are convincing public, then it
reasons to make a change. He says, how is this a local bill? The
Governor ought to be veto it. He ought to at least try, he said. He
knows who built that airport. It wasn’t the state, unquote. The bill was
bad when it left there. When it landed in the House, it got a lot worse.
Now my colleagues in the House talked a little bit about the Charlotte
way. How we conduct ourselves in doing business. And she said the city
council was not dealing the way we do business in Charlotte. The
Charlotte way. The end is in the beginning. There was no trust. There
was no transparency at the very beginning, with this thing. The
Charlotte way is that there was a problem right from the very beginning
that community leaders, business leaders, elected officials, airport
advisory committee, all would have gotten together from the beginning to
solve the problem together. That’s the Charlotte way. It’s not solving
the problem at the end, saying we’re going to come together and solve
the problem. Pardon the pun, but the plane had already left. The end is
in the beginning. So here we are, at the very end, about to bring chaos,
confusion and uncertainty to a twelve [AUDIO LOST] billion dollar
enterprise because well, I don’t know why. Because it’s an effective,
efficient, well-managed, well-organized enterprise, owned by the
citizens of the city of Charlotte. The bill as it is written and amended
in the House would make the transfer effective immediately. Like once
the speaker signs it and the president signs it, it becomes law and
takes effective immediately. Like maybe Thursday. With a whole host of
unanswered questions. Too many to go through today. And I dare not ask
anyone to answer those questions because as Senator Berger said, I don’t
want opinions, I want facts. And that’s going to take time. It’s going
to take some due diligence. It’s going to take an opportunity to do some
research. That’s reason enough to vote not to concur. The transfer takes
effect immediately. There is issues in reference to insurance. The bill
says that the insurance is transferred with the bill. Well you know the
city can’t do that. The insurance carrier has to do that.</p>

a whole host of issues that has to be answered in an effective and
efficient manner to  protect the region. The city of Charlotte under the
Fox administration, the McCoy administration the ?? administration, the
Gann administration . Democrats and republicans alike have supported,
invested and took care of Charlotte Douglas International airport. All
have invested in that airport and it pains me today, as a former member
of the Charlotte city council, to see it go away. To see  the citizens
who own it literally lose their investment. Generally when someone takes
an ownership or a governs change there is a problem. Now with all the
glory remarks and accolades that goes to the airport and they are all
well deserved, any twelve billion dollar enterprise is going to have
some issues and problems. And when issues and problems show their heads
the city council fulfilled their fiduciary responsibility. they took
care of business. They made the investments that was necessary. We talk
about the yard being built. We were talking about that yard when I was
on city council ,when Dan was on city council. We're now building it
today. Runways, towers, concourse areas. Billion dollars of investment
by the cities of Charlotte on behalf of the region. Ladies and
gentlemen, I ask you not to concur. [Speaker changes] Mr. President.
[speaker changes] Senator Clodfelter for what purpose do you rise ?
[speaker changes] to make a motion under rule twenty nine. I have sent
forward my statement reasons. [speaker changes] Thank you Senator. is
there any other discussion or debate? Senator Curtis for what purpose do
you rise ? [speaker changes] Mr. President, the surrounding counties
initially had concerns about their airports being involved in this
authority. all those concerns have been addressed so I commend the bill
to you. [Speaker changes] Senator Rucho , for what purpose do you rise?
[speaker changes] Just to debate a second more time. [speaker changes]
Senator Rucho has the floor to speak a second time[speaker changes] I
think it's important and Senator Berger alluded to them yesterday and
I'll clarify that facts are pesky little rascals and the reason being is
Senator Graham says that tit was sprung upon the city council and the
like and he fails to understand  and is probably not knowledgeable of
the fact that representative Brawley and I spent a four or five hour
session at the ?? fire department with the commissioner Howard,
commissioner Mitchell and the mayor and the then manager discussing this
issue well in advance of the time that this bill was submitted forward
and they asked can we get a copy of this and just to set the facts
because facts are little pesky rascals especially if you don't talk
about them when they're supposed to  be discussed but yes we forwarded
it to them and commissioner Howard asked can I share this with the other
commissioners and yes we'd like it so that we can have a chance to
discuss it and the next thing we know we get a call from one of the TV
stations saying how this is there. Apparently there was no desire to
talk any further about this. They just felt that it should be in the
media. so i think its important to understand that an effort was made
prior to the bill being submitted, afterwards to try to find some common
ground. I think alot of it was established. The other fact was that
senator graham talks about all the other administrations mayor Gant, Ben
Route, Myrick, McRory. Each of them treated that airport with the
ability to say &quot; we're going to let</p>

job in doing so no thanks to our city Council people because none of
them know anything about aviation of business for that matter, but they
managed it as far as he was concerned, and then the results were
evaluated in the performance of the appointment measured and that's why
goes in ministration, said there's no reason for us to get involved with
the micromanagement, but then all of a sudden this last initiation comes
in and starts telling the experts in operation of the airport how to run
and how to hire and who to put people in those places in regards to
finance eighteen, police, fire and you know that rather than allowing
the store and the experts in operation to do the job they have done well
for many years of this administration under the Fox decided they will to
micromanagement and under that concern. there were some changes, and
maybe not in the best interest of the airport in the low-cost top. I
will say to you that this is the right decision for the long-term future
of the low-cost hub airport is long as we remain low cost. we will have
American Airlines will i.e.. US Airways American and other airlines
coming in allowing us to have eight hundred plus flights out of

that the young man jumped the fence at the Charlotte international

without problem sat in the wheel well of a dying that shut off valves on
thirty thousand feet from the sky and as a result, the city of
Charlottesville 's fiduciary responsibility by making sure that every
passenger every client that anyone who came to that airport would save
by providing additional police protection. now maybe you has Aaron, I
was there like that, but the city at False ministration to fill their
fiduciary responsibility. I know with some certainty, there was some
financial issues that need to be cleared up in the city of
Charlottesville, the fiduciary responsibility of providing a layer of of
financial support for airport director to ensure that the state him at

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise, do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hise, I've been scrolling through here and I haven't had a
chance to check it completely. Does this affect what appointments the
County Boards of Commissioners have on the boards of these larger
management care organizations and is it reducing the numbers they will
have per county in some way?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No. What this specifically references is, there was a separate
governance change that went through the legislature last year. This was
designed for a time period to deal particularly with Smokey Mountain and
Western Highlands, who were in the process of merging, so that they
don't have to create brand new boards separately under the new structure
and then if they merge, have to create a new board a second time under
the new structure. This allows them to hold off on that process and keep
their current boards until they merge and then they'll have to be under
the new structures.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Thank you Mister President and members. This is a consensus bill from
all the stakeholders. They got together, I think. Those of us who live
with underground utilities often see all the paint on the roads
identifying where telephone lines, gas lines, electrical lines. I don't
know what other kind of lines they bury but it seems to be multicolored.
This is an agreement reached with all the

CHANGES]Thank you Mr. President, thank you members. I think this is a
good bill. I heard it in committee. I think there's have been a lot of
bills that we've taken up here in this chamber here from the House and
sent a lot of good bills to the House from the Senate, specifically
wildlife bills. But for some reason, the House, in its infinite wisdom,
decided to take the Wildlife Penalties Bill, that this body passed 48-0,
and decided it wasn't good enough over there that they needed to insert
a constitutional amendment into it, which is something we haven't even
considered or debated. So this time, Mr. President, I would like to send
forth an amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator, you can send forward your
amendment. Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Newton moves to
amend the bill.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Newton is recognized to explain
the amendment.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Members, this
amendment simply takes the bill that we passed 48-0, the Wildlife
Penalties Bill, which was an agency bill, and inserts it into this bill
as well. I think it's an appropriate subject matter to insert it. It's a
good bill that should have been passed in the House and so I hope you'll
support this amendment and we'll go ahead and take care of these
important things for our states. I'll be happy to answer any

Sen. McKissick: I just wanted to bring to the attention of my colleagues
here something I came upon today in the newspaper dealing with a
wonderful facility we have over in Durham called the Durham Performing
Arts Center. And it's really become a unique jewel for all of North
Carolina. And of course they've had a polling done by Poll Star, which
is a national organization that looks at all these entertainment
facilities throughout the United States, and of course, the number one
entertainment venue for ticket sales was Caesar's Palace, out in Las
Vegas, followed by Fox Theater in Atlanta, but number three was the
Durham Performing Arts Center. And last year I guess they had over
11,200 season ticket holders, they had 50 sellout shows, 187
performances, and my gosh, just a long list of shows that would probably
top anyone's list in terms of entertainment.
Since you come here so regularly to Raleigh, and we are part of this
body, the Durham Performing Arts Center is only about a half-hour drive
from here, the parking is extraordinary, and it's very, very reasonable.
I would encourage each and every one of you, try to make one of the
events, try to make one of the performances, whether there's a Broadway
show, or it's a comedy show, what have you, it's a wonderful facility,
and I'm proud to have it in Durham.

purpose do you rise?
Sen. Tillman: Point of personal privilege.
The President Pro Tempore: Senator Tillman has the floor for a point of
personal privilege.
Sen. Tillman: This for you city folks is a German Johnson tomato. It's
probably the best-tasting tomato, it has less acid in it than the other
tomatoes. Rick Gunn, his staff, and at Rick's initiative brought all
these cases of tomatoes and the white loaf bread, because on a tomato
sandwich, you've just got to have the white bread, and he also brought
the mayonnaise and the salt and pepper was provided by somebody and the
water.
You may or may not know that the Germans brought, the Johnson family
from Germany brought these tomatoes over to America in the, I guess,
late 1800s, Senator Gunn, and since then they have been all over the
state now, but they started in the great county of Alamance, and I
farmed them, and I raised these tomatoes and a few other thinks until I
went broke farming, but they really do taste great, so I thank Senator
Gunn for doing that for us.

The President Pro Tempore: Senator Rucho, for what purpose do you rise?
Sen. Rucho: A point of personal privilege.
The President Pro Tempore: Senator Rucho has the floor for a point of

Sen. Bingham, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President.
I just wanted to also mention to all of you that Sen. Jackson had our
cantaloupe and watermelons today and he's not here, and I'd hate to have
him left out. But we appreciated that too, I'm sure all of you got a
taste of it. Thank you much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Nesbitt for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Nesbitt has the floor for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

I just wanted to thank the Republican party for lunch today, and Sen.
Gunn and Sen. Jackson did an outstanding job, but we didn't hear an
announcement for tomorrow.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Gunn, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Moment of personal privilege?

That just shows how easy entitlements become in this Senate.
I would like to let everyone- Thank you, it was a privilege today, and I
just want you to know that we went through 770 tomato sandwiches today,
and those tomato sandwiches did not get and sliced by themselves, so Mr.
President, if I may, in addition to the great LA's Debbie ??, Karen
John, from Sen. Meredith and myself along with interns Rebecca Bradley
and Daniel Gunn for myself, and Sen. Hise, I have some folks in the
audience from Alamance county that came down here today to help us out,
and if they would, I'd love to have them stand and recognized. I've got
Tori Apple, she's my full time and loyal for some reason real estate
assistant, Tori, Wendy Lunsford and her son Al, our dear friends from
Burlington, and my loving, caring  wonderful, smart, did I say loving
and caring? Wife Gail Gunn is also in the audience. Give them a big
hand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do we have any business to come before the Senate.
If not, the chair recognizes Sen. Berger for a motion.
