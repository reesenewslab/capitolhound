Messages from the House, the Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Messages
from the House. House Joint Resolution 1030, a joint resolution honoring
NASCAR and the inductees of the NASCAR Hall of Fame. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca’s recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mister President. Members, I move the rules be suspended to the end that
House Joint Resolution 1030 honoring NASCAR that was just reported, and
be brought to the floor for immediate consideration. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection, we will put House Joint Resolution 1030 on the
calendar. Hearing on House Joint Resolution 130, the Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] House Joint Resolution 1030, a joint resolution
honoring NASCAR and inductees of the NASCAR Hall of Fame. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Apodaca’s recognized to speak to the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister President. Members, we are under a
time restraint here to get these gentlemen to the Governor’s mansion, so
understand it was debated fully over in the House. You probably learned
more than you wanted to know over in the House, gentlemen, but we’d like
to welcome you to the Senate, which we consider the upper chamber and
where most good work’s done in ?? That being said, the motor sports
industry in North Carolina contributes 5.9 billion to our economy. That
is a good number. We’d like to see that number continue to rise, as it
does yearly, and we’d like to thank you for that. NASCAR, or the racing
industry in North Carolina, directly or indirectly accounts for 24
thousand jobs, so that makes you one of the major employers in the
state. We’ve seen success with NASCAR; we saw that with the last
contract they signed with NBC and Fox, going forward another ten years.
Senator ?? and I met with the folks earlier, and we were amazed at how
technology has been brought forth with NASCAR and how it’s reached into
different areas of life, even from dealing with concussions in other
sports, what NASCAR has done with the technological advances they have
made going forward. This year the Hall of Fame will be doing inductions,
and I don’t know the exact date of it but I believe it’s within the next
couple of weeks. Is that correct? And we’d like to honor those folks,
and I’m going to ask the Clerk, if he would, to name the folks going
into the Hall of Fame when we’re finished here. We did want to open it
up for debate but due to time restraints we’re not going to be able to,
so… we good? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I can recognize them from here. I have
the names, Senator. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So with that being
said, I want to thank everyone for attending today, and I hope you had a
good visit with us, and please come back anytime, and we do appreciate
what you do for North Carolina. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Senator. Is there any further discussion? Hearing none, Senators, we’re
going to take two votes back-to-back. The first will be electronic vote
for the new Senators with us here today. We’re going to do a five-second
vote on that electronic vote. The green button is yes and the red button
is no; I’m sure you’ve been well-trained on that. And then we will go to
a voice vote after that, and I will ask everybody to please stand when
we go to the voice vote, and we will read a second time. So House Joint
Resolution 1030, the Clerk will read a second time. We already read a
second time; don’t have to do that anymore. We’re going to move right
into the vote them. If there’s no further discussion, the question
before the Senate is the passage of House Joint Resolution 1030 on its
second reading. All in favor vote “Aye”, opposed vote “No”. Five seconds
will be allowed for the voting and the Clerk will record the vote. 49
having voted in the affirmative and 0 in the negative, House Joint
Resolution 1030 passes its second reading without objection. It will be
read a third time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any
further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question before the
Senate is the passage of House Joint Resolution 1030 on its third
reading. All members please stand. All in favor will say “Aye”. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] “Aye.” [SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, “No”. The “Ayes” have it.
House Joint Resolution 1030 passes its third reading and it will be
enrolled. Members, you can be seated.</p>

Speaker: Senators, upon the motion, of Senator Tom Apodaca, of Henderson
County, the chair is happy to extend courtesies of the gallery to our
Nascar special guests. They include Brent Duer, Nascar Chief Operating
Office and Richard Childress, owner of the Childress Racing and
Childress vineyards. And we’d also like to welcome our Nascar Hall of
Fame inductees. We’d like to ask all of you to stand please while I
introduce you, and if you could, just kind of raise your hand as I
introduce you, all inductees as well; Jack Ingram, Bobby Allison, Rusty
Wallace, Junior Johnson, Dale Inman, Ned Garrett, and Dale Garrett.
Rusty Wallace you were my favorite when I was a kid, and all that, all
that means is you’re really old now. [Audience laughter] Congratulations
to all of you. Thank you for joining us in the Senate and we look
forward to you induction into the Hall of Fame. Thank you so much.
[Applause]
Speaker: Senators, upon the motion, of Senator Tom Apodaca, of Henderson
County, the chair is happy to extend courtesies of the gallery to, and
is honored to recognize some very special international visitors with us
today. The North Carolina Secretary of State office is hosting a group
of legislators and parliamentarians, from the Republic of Moldova. Many
of you are aware that in 1999 North Carolina formed a bilateral
partnership with the Republic of Moldova and for fifteen years we have
engaged in academic, cultural and economic development and scientific
exchanges. So we’re delighted to have with us today three
parliamentarians from the city of Chiscinow in Moldova. George Mokonu,
Committee for cultural education, research and youth, Egor Vrinya,
Committee for  Environment and Climate Change, Simian Gistrenuk,
Committee for Environment and Climate Change. I hope you’ve enjoyed your
time here in North Carolina. We thank you for joining us in the Senate
today and welcome.
[Applause]
Also, Senators, upon the motions of Senator Apodaca, of Henderson
County, the chair is happy to extend courtesies in our chamber today to
U.S. Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Special Agent Steven Gillis. He’s
from Charlotte, and his bomb dog Carley, is with him. They conducted a
sweep of the chamber today, so Senator Apodaca may blow up but the rest
of us are probably fine. So thank you very much, Special Agent for being
here today.
[Applause]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Tomorrow morning at 8:30, the Appropriations Committee will be meeting
in rooms 643 in LOB.  Please bring the governor’s budget that you should
have on your desk in your offices by now I would hope, to the meeting if
you would.  Thanks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other notices or announcements? Senator Blue, for the purposes of
your eyes.
Well, Senator ??, you have a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator ??, do you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator ??, about a month ago, the principal clerk and I talked to a
parliamentary delegation from Nigeria, a congressional delegation from
Nigeria.  One thing that had interested them was our history with the
Legislative Services Commission especially back in the 80s and 90s. They
raised an interesting question to us.  They wanted to know why it hadn’t
met in 15 years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So I see that it’s scheduled for a meeting.  I think ’99 was the last
time that it had met, but I see that it is scheduled for a meeting
tomorrow and I would simply inquire because I look at the membership of
it and I’m glad that Senator Berger has appointed Senator Walters to it.
 But given the subjects that it deals with, and in this case it’s
looking at the building rules and things involving the use of the
building and decorum around the building.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you know if there is going to be a similar effort in the house to
have cross-party representation, that the make-up that comes from our
computer system says it’s a committee that’s totally populated by
Republicans.  I just wanted to make sure that there is an alternative
viewpoint, or at least competing viewpoint or a cooperative viewpoint,
depending on the perspective that the democratic members take on that
committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue, I appreciate that question.  When we look back at 1999, we
noticed that it was totally the majority party appointed to that
commission, but we did take it when we did it.  It is my understanding
the Representative Paul has been appointed in the House as of a little
while ago and we did put, as far as I know, two members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much.  I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue, do you know another question?</p>

<p id="15:00">
I appreciate that since I didn't do any of the appointing in '99. I
guess there was a reason that they stopped a meeting but it must be
something monumental if fifteen years later we need to reconstitute it.
Would you agree?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But I'll let you know after tomorrow.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll look forward to it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further notices or announcements?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick for a purpose hereas[?].
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of personal privilege
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick has the floor for point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I know it was announced earlier today that we were going to adjourn
today in honor of Senator Nesbitt and since I always thought of Senator
Nesbitt as a very close and dear friend and a colleague in this chamber
I just wanted to say that all of those that attended his funeral, and I
these attended, the funeral was attended by a wonderful group of members
of both chambers here and likewise of both parties, that it was a real
tribute to him as a member. It was somebody who was viewed consistently
as a person who had outstanding integrity, somebody who would reach
across party lines, somebody who spoke for the common man, someone who
had an intrinsic sense of values that caused him to understand the needs
and concerns of everyday people. He was frequently referred to during
his homecoming service, or funeral, as a mountain man but most
importantly as a popularist. And since we are today adjourning in his
honor I would have felt remiss if I had not said that he was certainly
one of those people who established a very high bar in this chamber and
across the hall when he served in the House as well. Someone who
unselfishly sacrificed of his time. Somebody who really did not hesitate
to stand up in whatever committee he was in or on the floor of this
chamber to share a perspective that frequently would have not been
articulated, a voice that would not have been heard with passion,
commitment, concern, and principle values. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other notices or announcements? Senator Curtis for a purpose
hereas[?].
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Curtis has the floor for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My fellow members, I want to report to you about ?? law, if you recall
it's a law that increased the penalty for child abuse in North Carolina.
This bill was introduced in the Federal Senate by Congressman
Pittenger[?] and it passed the Federal House several weeks ago and
passed the Senate last week and is expected to be signed into law by the
president within the next few weeks. So I think it's a great thing that
this law started here in North Carolina and now it's going to go all
across the nation. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator. Is there any further business to come before the
Senate? If not, the chair recognizes Senator Berger for motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. I move that the Senate do now adjourn in
memory Martin Luther Nesbitt Jr., subject to the receipt and re-referral
of messages from the house and the Governor and the referral and
re-referral of bills and resolutions to reconvene on Thursday, May 15,
2014 at 10:30 a.m.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Motion is the Senate do now adjourn in memory of Senator Martin Luther
Nesbitt of Buncombe County and subject to the stipulations stated by
Senator Berger to reconvene Thursday, May the 15th at 10:30 a.m.,
seconded by Senator Hunt. All in favor will say &quot;I,&quot; opposed
&quot;no.&quot; The &quot;I's&quot; have it. The senate stands
adjourned.</p>
