  House will come to order. Seriously! [laughs] On behalf of the Senate, I
wish you all a happy April Fool&#39;s Day. The House will come to order,
and members, just so you&#39;ll know that there was equal time given, I
had the opportunity to gavel the Senate into order also, so we thought
we&#39;d mix it up a little bit today. Members are asked to take their
seats, visitors will retire from the chamber, sergeant at arms will
close the doors. Members and all visitors in the gallery are asked to
please silence all electronic devices. Today&#39;s prayer will be
offered by Lynn Taylor, who is the legislative assistant to
Representative Raleigh. Would ask all members and would ask those guests
in the gallery to please stand for the prayer and remain standing for
the Pledge of Allegiance. Miss Taylor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We&#39;ve been
a free people living under the law, with faith in our maker and in our
future. I&#39;ve said before that the most sublime picture in American
history is of George Washington on his knees in the snow at Valley
Forge. That image personifies a people who know that it&#39;s not enough
to depend on our own courage and goodness. We must also seek help from
God, our father and preserver. Those remarks were made at a White House
ceremony in observance of the national day of prayer by Ronald Wilson
Reagan. Let us pray. Our heavenly father, we come before you this
beautiful spring day, pausing in our busy schedules, bringing our cares,
our fears, our praises and petitions before you, for you are good. Your
loving kindness is everlasting and your faithfulness is to all
generations. We acknowledge you are the lord of all the earth and we are
your people, the sheep of your pasture. We are mindful of the work
before this assembly and the great responsibility they willingly
shoulder. May the women and men appointed for this time look for truth
and enact righteous laws, that we might live in the peace and harmony
that result. We ask for your guidance and your wisdom to accomplish the
tasks set before this body, and then the courage to stand steadfast and
follow your ways that will make North Carolina a leader, strong and
prosperous, a shining light of hope. We ask your hand of blessing and
your protection, for unless the lord builds the house, they labor in
vain who build it. In the name our your son we pray, amen. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of
America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman from Harnett, Representative Lewis is recognized for motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, the journal from March 31st has been
examines and found to be correct. I move that it stand approved as
written. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis moves that the journal
from March 31st be approved as written. Those in favor will say aye.
Those opposed no. The ayes have it. The journal is approved as written.
Members without objection rule that 12D is suspended. Members, if the,
would ask the House come to order and pay head to the announcement that
I&#39;m about to make. We, the chair&#39;s about to read in a number of
committee reports and it is the intention of the chair that most of
these bills, other than the rereferrals, be added to today&#39;s

  On behalf of Representatives Brockman, Blust, Faircloth, Hardister,
Harrison, and Johnson of Guilford County, the Chair is honored to extend
the courtesies of the gallery to members of the Greensboro City Council
and the Guilford County Board of Education. If you all would please
stand so that we could welcome you to be with us today. On behalf of
Representative Richardson of Franklin County, the Chair is happy to
extend the courtesies of the gallery to Mr. Joe Nadglowski, President
and CEO of the Obesity Action Coalition, who gave a presentation this
morning for legislators on the obesity problem in the U.S. With him are
Sumeira Kashim and Brenna Sculley, staffers of Women in Government,
which has sponsored the presentation. Would you please stand so that we
can welcome you? Thank you for being with us today. On behalf of
Representatives Insko and Meyer from Orange County, the Chair is happy
to extend the courtesies of the gallery to the mayor of Chapel Hill,
Mark Kleinschmidt. If you would please stand so that we could welcome
you. And on behalf of  Representative Floyd and Representative Lucas of
Cumberland County, as well as Representative Gill of Wake County, the
Chair is happy to extend the courtesies of the gallery to the Phi Beta
Sigma Fraternity, incorporated on the legislative Sigma Day, which is
today. Glad to have you with us, gentleman. For what purpose does the
gentleman from Cumberland, Representative Lucas, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a moment of privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Cumberland has the floor for a moment of personal
privilege. The House will come to order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you for recognizing my brothers from Phi
Beta Sigma Fraternity, Incorporated. Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity was
founded the year 1914, by three distinguished gentlemen on the campus of
Howard University. Since that time, the brotherhood has grown to
practically every HBC U in the country, as well as fraternities on many
of the majority campuses around the country. Since its inception,
they&#39;ve always maintained a mission of culture for service, and
service to humanity. That is what they thrive on. Their colors are blue
and white, and whenever you see blue and white around where they are,
with their insignia, you may expect distinguished manhood. Our
fraternity has always been grounded in moral fortitude. We know of some
of the negative aspects that have been going around the country relating
to various and sundry fraternities in recent times, but you won&#39;t
see that, and I say that with tongue in cheek--we haven&#39;t yet.
Hopefully you&#39;ll never see that with Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity. I am
proud to call them brothers, and indeed I appreciate the opportunity to
share with you some of their exploits. Mr. Speaker, you might recall one
of my brothers and his service on the Board of Governors, Dudley Flood.
You might recall that. Thank you very kindly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, on behalf of Representative Robinson, the Chair is happy to
extend the courtesies of the gallery to Major David Anderson of the
Caldwell County Sheriff&#39;s Department as well as his son, Jesse, and
his wife, Julia. If you all would please stand so that we could welcome
you today from Caldwell County. Glad to have you with us.

During a luncheon earlier, I understand that the President Pro Tempore,
Phil Berger, announced that both you and him had reached a conclusion on
the budget for this session, and want to get confirmation on that, Mr.
Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We have. We&#39;ve been working on the budget
for a few weeks. We&#39;ll probably have it on the floor today for a

will be recorded as having voted aye on the previous bill. The gentleman
from Rutherford- Does the lady from Orange wish to be recorded as having
voted aye as well? The lady from Orange, Representative Insko, will be
recorded as having voted aye. The gentleman from Rutherford,
Representative Hager, has the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Guys, what this bill does is take four
trustee appointments- It&#39;s a local bill. Let me say that again:
local bill. Takes four trustees from the Board of Education and moves
them to, the appointments, to the County Commissioners. And the reason
we&#39;re doing that is because we have significant dollars right now in
maintenance issues. Up to ten million dollar issues right now. We have
about fifty thousand dollars in emergency funds we need to invest into
the college. All that money has to flow through the County Commissioners
via the county residents. And we have had- I&#39;ve got an email just in
the last week, two of our students being injured because of heat
exhaustion because AC units weren&#39;t working. So we have a situation
on the ground, that we need to move these trustees and we need to fund
this and we need to get folks to have some fiduciary responsibility. In
the bill, you&#39;ll see that I have moved four appointments, one to the
Polk County, which is in Chris Whitmire&#39;s district, but it&#39;s a
multi-county district. One to Polk County and three more, which gives
them a total of seven in Rutherford County, but requiring four of those
appointments, two to be business people within the counties.

motion.

The gentleman&#39;s motion is properly made. The gentleman has the floor

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House, what I&#39;m asking
to do is, we received from the Senate a Senate Committee Substitute for
a House bill. It was referred, as is customary, to the Committee on
Finance. We, after conferring with both the minority leader and
Representative Luebke, who I consider to be the senior finance adviser
for the minority ??, would like to hold the bill back. I would then add
it to today&#39;s calendar, move not to concur, and ask the Speaker to
appoint conferees.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there objection to the motion? For what purpose does the gentleman
from Durham, Representative Hall, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to support the motion. I ask that the members support the motion.

The gentleman from Harnett moves that House Bill 41 be removed from
Finance and added to today&#39;s bill for immediate consideration. Those
in favor will vote aye, those opposed will vote no, the clerk will open

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker. Members of the House, I thought long and hard
about this bill, and it&#39;s nice to make it convenient for our
hospitals, but you know, I asked them when they were up here one day,
standing and lobbying for this. I said, tell me why you can&#39;t at
least have the notary part of this. If you can&#39;t find the witnesses,
that&#39;s fine, but when the person&#39;s checking in, make sure you at
least get their perspective before they have surgery and you have people
that are checking them in that for $100 a year, I believe it is, they
can become notaries. And then you have it from the horse&#39;s mouth,
from the person who is going through that surgery what they want for
their direct, their directives. They told me that would cost too much
money. I&#39;m sorry. Lives are more important than $100 a year for a
hospital. I&#39;m all for my hospitals, but I&#39;m also about making
sure that we don&#39;t pick strangers from somewhere but we actually
have a notarized signature from the person who is going through that
surgery. They&#39;re the ones who need to tell you what that should be,
not after they&#39;re on their deathbed, but that could be done at every
one of these check ins when you check into the hospital. Every one of
those people can be notaries there, and it&#39;s not gonna cost the
hospitals that much money. I cannot vote for this bill unless we at
least have the notary portion of it. Thank you.

For what purpose does the gentleman from Rockingham, Representative
Jones rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker, ladies and gentleman of the House. I know that
when we talk about such issues as the end of one&#39;s life it&#39;s a
very emotional issue. I just wanna say that I never would have signed on
as a primary sponsor on this bill if I thought that the reason for it
was for the convenience of the hospitals. I know that many of you in
this room are like me, that you have no doubt been a family member of a
dying loved one, and that&#39;s a very difficult time indeed in the very
best of circumstances, but for the patient and for the family of, of the
patient, I do believe that having an advance health care directive is
something that everyone indeed should get. Not for the convenience of
the hospital, but that the wishes of the patient and that the wishes of
the patient might be carried out, and that it might able to be done in a
way that doesn&#39;t often tear families apart. And so when I read this
legislation, I thought that it was a good bill. Is it a perfect bill? I
don&#39;t think so. I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t know if there are many
perfect bills that, that are in existence, but I do think this. There
are 46 states that don&#39;t require what we require. Only three other
states do, and if you are a patient that had an advanced health care
directive carried out in one of those 46 states and you come to North
Carolina,  your wishes will be carried out, but if you lived in North
Carolina, you don&#39;t get that same opportunity. Now I understand the
opponents can say and I agree that the majority is not always right, but
I also think that for something this important, that if passing this
were so terrible and invited all the terrible problems that we&#39;re
hearing, I don&#39;t think that 46 states would do it. And so ladies and
gentlemen, we can agree to disagree, but I just want you to know that I
never would have signed on for something that just would have been for
the convenience of the hospital, and I think most people that look at
this issue would not think that that&#39;s what this is all about, that
that&#39;s the motivation behind the sponsors of this bill or that&#39;s
the motivation behind this bill. So ladies and gentlemen, you vote your
conscience. I think this is a good bill. I think this is something that
we should be encouraging people to be able to get an advanced health
care directive and so I will vote green. Thank you.

And I was opposed to this bill and but I decided to talk to some experts

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, I heard this echo what Representative Pendleton
said, “This is an area out of my expertise I don’t serve on the judicial
committee.” So when a bill like this, it’s clearly very important and
very sensitive for people we love and we care about. I send it out to a
few attorneys that I know of my district that I respect and got their
feedback from different folks and everyone came back and said that this
is a very reasonable approach and there is not a problem with this. So I
will be supporting this and ask you to do the same, thank you.

Well, I didn’t talk to any attorneys but as a family nurse practitioner
for 28 years and a registered nurse for 40 someone who had both of the
tough conversations with patients and their families about advance care
directives and also nurse people do their deaths I would say to you that
these are tools that are very necessary for families for making it
easier for people, to make their wishes known, it’s a good bill, I
planned to vote forward and I urge you to do the same, thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If this discussion doesn’t do anything else it should point out to all
of us the importance of having this done long before you reach that case
where you are in the hospital with the terminal illness and have days to
live. We should be doing anything we can to encourage health providers,
attorneys, anybody else who is working with clients to encourage them to
get this done early, not we seem to be really, really emphasizing and
what’s done in the last few hours but we need to do everything we can do
to encourage and to be along before that. I will say that I work in a
financial services industry and every year we have to take more classes,
fill out more forms, sign more disclosures and everything to make sure
that we are not defrauding our clients in anyway and that there is no
way possible that they can be defrauding us or the government or anybody
else. Consumer Protection seems to be moving in one general direction in
every field that I work at least and I can do anything that makes fraud
easier to perpetrate which looks like it’s me that’s where we are going,
if this is whether it’s intended or not kind of an anti-Consumer
Protection bill and so for that reason I will voting it.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, except for course living will when I will debate
that but I have some problems with it, advance directives are a good
thing pretty much and it’s good to encourage people to do some of those
things but this bill is not about encouraging to get those things done,
it’s about removing an important safeguard against fraud or other ill
intensions. And therefore, I urge you to vote no so not remove that
safeguard, thank you.

For what purpose does the lady from Mecklenburg, Representative

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As a healthcare provider and I know everyone here knows that I’m a
healthcare provider and the last work I did was in hospitals care. But
more important than that is my mother died and we had to get a Power of
Attorney in the hospital, she was in Presbyterian Hospital and I
obtained what from outside to come in and notarize the Power of
Attorney, which I did not see a big problem with. When my husband came
home with ?? he had his real, he had his advance directive. So I see it
as a safety net for me as well as a healthcare professional because when
I look at that chart I don’t need to look for just two signatures I can
look for that notary seal that says that, “This person is chaseable that
sign those documents.” So I’m wondering at this point what am I gonna be
looking at when I go to that chart now, two signatures that I cannot
choice anywhere. So I’m not supporting the bill, thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think representative Stam has, I see why you were
hesitant on your amendment. I do like your amendment. It would make the
bill, if it does pass, a little bit better. But yet I agree your point
was currently the notary notarizes the person executing the document,
the patient, as well as the two witnesses. So we know who everybody is.
If we were given the choice of a notary or two witnesses, and we choose
the two witnesses, who knows who they are, and they only require
signatures. So at least with this amendment, they have to get two
signatures and some kind of address,  but we still don&#39;t know
anything about who they are. So I would support the amendment as as
better than nothing.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman will be recorded as having voted no. The
gentleman from Cumberland, representative Glazier is recognized to
debate House Bill 187.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister Speaker and members. This is a bill
that passed out of House Judiciary unanimously sponsored by
representative Horne, representative Faircloth, Representative McGrady
and myself and what it basically does is provide that a person who
commits the offense of cyberstalking, if the person knowingly installs
or places a tracking device without consent and uses that device to
track a person. This is a bill that&#39;s passed now in eleven states.
We modeled it after Virginia. And what&#39;s been happening is GPS has
been used on occasion to track by perpetrators to stalk and track young
victims in isolated areas, or spouses if they are in domestic violence
situations, and this says that&#39;s going to be a crime. There are
exemptions and we have worked pretty tirelessly, all of the sponsors and
J committee chairs to create exemptions. There are two amendments
pending. One by Representative Stim that I find support that deals with
an issue that we tried to get right the other day and there is a
technical amendment as well that I have and I know of no opposition to
the bill. Mister Speaker if you would like me to run my amendment
I&#39;d move on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to send forth his
amendment. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier moves to amend the bill on page
2 lines 25 through 31 by rewriting those lines to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister Speaker. Members yesterday we worked
with car dealers and used dealers association and we put an amendment
together to make sure that they could number one track their own fleet
and number two track circumstances where they are a creditor and someone
hasn&#39;t fully paid. So they knew where

  property was we consolidated them, but that&#39;s a mistake. We need to
separate them back out because of the consent issue. I know of no
opposition, it&#39;s simply breaking it back out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on the amendment.
If not, the question before the House is the passage of Amendment 1 sent
forth by Representative Glazier. Those in favor will vote aye. Those
opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the vote. Representative
Holley, does the lady wish to vote on the amendment? Clerk will lock the
machine and record the vote. 117 having voted in the affirmative and
none in the negative, the amendment is adopted. For what purpose does
the lady from Surry, Representative Stevens, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, I agree with
Representative Glazier that there&#39;s not really a lot of objection to
this bill, but I think there are some unintended consequences. Based on
the way the bill is currently written, I may consent to put a GPS
tracker on my car, but I loan it to my sister or my friend. Does that
mean they&#39;ve consented to be tracked? Or am I now having a criminal
offense because I have this GPS tracker there and my friend is driving
the car? I just think there&#39;s some unintended consequences. If
it&#39;s a domestic situation: there&#39;s not violence, we haven&#39;t
separated, but I&#39;m suspicious my husband might be cheating, and
I&#39;ve got a GPS tracker on my vehicle. It&#39;s titled to me, or
it&#39;s titled jointly to me and my husband. Is it now a criminal
offense that I&#39;ve used this GPS tracking? I think it&#39;s just not
clear enough on consent by whom. Is it consent of the owner of the
vehicle? Then you&#39;ve got the problem with the domestic violence
situation: my husband may own the vehicle, but I&#39;m trying to escape
from him. So I think there&#39;s probably still a little bit more
confusion with this bill. Representative Glazier was willing to work
with me on it, but I&#39;m not 100% sure how to fix it either. So I just
ask us all to take that consideration in as we proceed with this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake,
Representative Stam, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To offer an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to send forth an
amendment. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam moves to amend the bill on page 2
lines 18 through 22 by rewriting those lines to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Wake has the floor to debate the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. We did see in Judiciary 2
another unintended consequence, and this amendment fixes that. It&#39;s
not technical, but it&#39;s minor. I would suggest to Representative
Glazier that we object to third reading so that we can solve any other
unintended consequences, and if he doesn&#39;t object I will. But this
amendment would address the probably rare situation. It&#39;s on page 2
line 18 to 22. It rewrites the exception where a parent or legal
guardian can track that person&#39;s child. Well then there&#39;s an
exception to the exception if that parent or legal guardian is subject
to a domestic violence protection order. However, not all protective
orders are either true or correct. You may have got one ex parte or in a
big brawl and it may be that you have custody of that child yourself and
you should not be prohibited from tracking your own child just because
in some collateral proceeding maybe that you didn&#39;t even know about,
somebody got an order on you. So we&#39;re adding the words therein
&#39;Unless the parent or legal guardian subject to the order has
custody of the minor.&#39; Minor amendment, hope you&#39;ll support it
and the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do either of the gentleman wish to debate the
amendment? For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland,
Representative Glazier, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, and I completely agree with
Representative Stam. I think it fixes the issue that he was concerned
with yesterday, and encourage everyone to vote aye on the amendment. And
I agree with him that if it passes second, and hopefully it will, that
I&#39;ll object to third so that Representative Stevens and I can look
at the word consent. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McNeill, does the gentleman wish to
debate the amendment or the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have a question on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on the amendment.
If not, the question before the House is the passage of Amendment 2 sent
forth by Representative Stam. Those in favor will vote aye. Those
opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the vote.

  see if Representative Stam will yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Wake yield to the lady from Surry?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I wasn&#39;t in the committee as these bills were heard, so
please forgive me. There is some provision in civil contempt, though,
that if you&#39;ve met the condition prior to ever coming before the
judge, then you completely escape punishment, even though you&#39;ve had
contemptuous behavior. Is there another way we can deal with that kind
of contempt, where the court can&#39;t hold you in contempt if you
violated the order, but.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In that case, they would be purged of their civil contempt. Now maybe
they could be accused of criminal contempt for delaying it, but once
they&#39;ve done it, they&#39;ve done it. Just for historical curiosity,
the worst case of civil contempt was when some city fathers and mothers
in Missouri were ordered by a federal judge to raise taxes. And the
civil contempt--they were held in--whatever--it was like they would
double everything every two days. It was wild. But anyway, this just
gets the law back to where it was when Leo was a young man.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Mecklenburg, Representative
Bishop, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask a question of Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Wake yield to the gentleman from Mecklenburg?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do I understand that you&#39;re saying that the only way then to impose
civil contempt sanctions would be to imprison someone?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield to an additional question? Let me ask you this,
Representative Bishop. Would the gentleman like to redirect his question
to gentleman the from Cumberland?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Be glad to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Cumberland yield to the gentleman from
Mecklenburg?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
How would the court impose a contempt penalty that is aimed at procuring
compliance at an organization, if not by a per-day fine?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me, and I apologize, I was engaged in the past bill and a discussion
with the Speaker, so I&#39;m not sure what Representative Stam said, but
I&#39;ll give you the history that I hope answers the question. The law
is for 100 years, actually, or so, been clear. The statute&#39;s clear,
we thought. And the statute says the only way to deal with civil
contempt is by imprisonment. There&#39;s never been a case until a month
ago in North Carolina that ever allowed a fine for civil contempt.
It&#39;s only for criminal contempt. And the statute&#39;s really clear
about that. And all the Institute of Government training of Superior
Court and district court judges for years and years, and we went back
and looked at them since 2008, have been clear and that&#39;s been the
advice given, but a judge in one case, in a domestic case, sort of went
off and did a fine that was to be given to third party, and it
doesn&#39;t really matter the facts of that case, and sort of
aberrationally said, well in rare case you might have this, and allowed
it, sort of without relating to the statutes. And a number of lawyers
and writers said that changes the law that&#39;s been the case and
we&#39;ve learned since law school and that we teach. So this is to go
back and say the statute that says now that the only way you can deal
with civil contempt is by imprisonment is, we mean what we say. And you
can&#39;t be issuing fines. And there&#39;s no, there was no opposition.
Your point about how you would get an institution to, is, I think the
easy way is to say institutions don&#39;t run just as institutions. They
run by their officers or their directors, and if I think a court had to
do it on civil contempt, they would go that route and have to imprison
order to compliance, the particular official or officials involved. But
usually they don&#39;t have to because they have the choice in most of
those cases of going criminal or civil, and on criminal you can
obviously issue the fines. So I think that&#39;s the problem. Here they
went civil, and did something that really should have been criminal
contempt, which would have given them the authority. But they didn&#39;t
do that, and so we&#39;re saying in civil, you really can&#39;t do
fines.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I learn something every day.

Representative Lewis, the House Bill 364: A bill to be entitled an act
to clarify the conflict of interest provisions for certain commissions
and to modify appointments to several state boards and commissions. The
General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Harnett, Representative Louis has the floor to debate
the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, House Bill 364 that you have before you I will be
as brief as I can. We have been reviewing the child court order in the
Coal-Ash lawsuit, we agree with many of the courts conclusions, excuse
me we disagree with many of the courts conclusions and have appealed it.
However, we have identified certain points raised by the court and their
order regarding executive order, executive orders and legislative
service on the certain boards that we can fix while remaining
incompliance with the court’s order and the North Carolina Supreme Court
rulings. The bill has two provisions; the first one clarifies the
requirements regarding executive orders in the statues creating the
Coal-Ash Management Commission, the Environmental Management Commission,
and the Coastal Resources Commission. The clarification takes out the
requirement that the Governor issue executive orders regarding conflict
of interest and provides that the Governor may issue criteria regarding
conflicts of interest. Of course all these board members remain subject
to the Ethics Act but with this change the Governor may decide to
require additional disclosures giving the sensitive nature of these
particular commissions work. Part two, it brings three boards and
commissions into compliance with a ruling in Wallace v Bone which is
1973 court case, which says that rule that legislators could not serve
on certain boards and commissions. Statutes regarding the North Carolina
longitude data systems board, the Domestic Violence Commission, and the
Governor’s Crime Commission are revised to clarify that legislators may
not serve on these. Just to be clear as it was asked yesterday the
legislature is not yielding any of this appointment power it is merely
acknowledging the court order that the legislature cannot appoint a
legislator to fill the spot, it must be a member of the general public.
I would ask for your support please.

members of the joint municipal power agencies to enter into support
contracts and to issue bonds to pay the costs of projects that are sold.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chapter bills will be noted. Gentleman from Harnett, Representative
Lewis is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister speaker, earlier today I filed with the clerk a resolution
amending the temporary House rules. I respectfully request that the
resolution be assigned a number and that it be added to today&#39;s
calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there objection? Hearing none, so ordered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister speaker.

For what purpose does the gentleman from Guilford, Representative Blust

Does the gentleman from Harnett yield to the gentleman from Guilford?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, mister speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is it your intention, then, to not even go through the rules committee
with the permanent House rules but to bring them directly to the floor
today?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blust, as I was going to explain when the Speaker
recognized me. All we&#39;re doing is, it&#39;s on your desk. All
we&#39;re doing is changing certain dates that members have requested be
changed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. All right. That&#39;s fine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Representative Blust, we were, and I believe you&#39;re gonna do
this for 481 too, is that correct? Do you prefer to have the first
reading on that, it would be that intention that these bills do go
through the rules committee, but we&#39;re trying to move the process
along. Without objection, it is ordered that the rules are suspended so
that House bill, House joint, House resolution 480 have its first
reading today. Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lewis, House resolution 480, House resolution to amend
the temporary rules of the House of Representatives concerning certain
requests in filing deadlines to increase the number of public bills a
member may file, and to change the crossover deadlines.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The, just a moment. House will be at ease. Members, to make sure the
body understands this procedure, the gentleman is gonna, is gonna move
to adopt this, this resolution. This is the one that simply changes the
dates and changes the bill limit from ten to fifteen. It makes no other
changes. There&#39;s also the permanent rules that will be considered in
the rules committee either today or tomorrow, whenever the rules
committee wants to call that meeting. So is there discussion or debate
on the gentleman&#39;s motion for adoption of House resolution 480?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Guilford, Representative Blust
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Perhaps this is just an inquiry of the chair. Given that next week is
spring break and a lot of bills are piling up as bill filings go
forward, might it not be appropriate to leave the crossover deadline as
it is, or even extend that a, a week too, because that&#39;s gonna be a
lot of bills piling up very quickly for the final three weeks of April.
I just wonder if that&#39;s something we should consider.

Representative Blust, I believe that we&#39;re operating under the April
30 date as the crossover date presently. We haven&#39;t adopted, well
let me understand, this date applies to Senate bills. This is the date
by which Senate bills must arrive to the House. It doesn&#39;t change
what the Senate, about, what the Senate requires for House bills coming
there, so we need, if we&#39;re gonna move it, which frankly I&#39;m
amendable to, we need to reach an agreement with the Senate for a
different date. Right now, the agreement is for April 30, but we would
not unilaterally want to extend our date without the Senate also
extending their date. But I have no objection to doing that, but we, the
biggest thing right now is we need to get these other dates squared away
so that with the spring break coming up. Further discussion, further
debate on the motion? For what purpose does the gentleman from Johnston,
Representative Daughtry rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment. Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Daughtry moves to amend the bill on page one, lines 22.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Johnston has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members we, I&#39;ve served here a long time and when the Republicans
were in charge, we always had the ten bill limit which I thought was way
too many and to increase this to 15 is adding 600 bills

  ...and that is a lot of bills that could eventually become laws on our
citizens.  I think it&#39;s very important that we look at each bill
carefully to make sure it&#39;s a good idea and that it works. I think
adding six hundred more bills to the pile of bills we already have is
way too many and I hope that you would vote for this amendment to return
it back to ten. Thank you.
[Speaker changes] For this.. For what does the gentleman from Harnett,
Representative Lewis, rise?
[Speaker changes] Mr. Speaker I appreciate the gentleman from Johnston.
[Speaker changes] To debate, the gentleman is recognized to debate the
amendment.
[Speaker changes] My apologies, Mr. Speaker.  Thank you.  I appreciate
the gentleman from Johnston offering this amendment. I want to tell the
members how this proposed amendment came about. I think all members of
the chamber whether or not you&#39;ve been ecstatic with the bills that
have passed out of this chamber so far
would acknowledge that speaker Moore has worked hard to be inclusive and
empowering of the members of the body. We received a request from the
minority party to raise the bill limit to twenty. Representative
Daughtry is correct. It has been at ten since the Republicans have had
the majority. The rationale that Representative Hall, I hope it&#39;s
with the gentleman&#39;s permission, that I can speak, that I can
attribute this to him, the rationale that was given to the Speaker and
to me was that with a fewer number of members, they would like the
opportunity to register in and make statements of policy and bills,
whether or not those bills are passed or not. It&#39;s a simple
compromise. Just raising the bill limit from ten to fifteen,  it&#39;s
neither plausible nor even thinkable that everybody in here is going to
go and run and file an extra five bills, but there may be some who need
to do that. With all due respect, I would ask that you please defeat the
amendment.
[Speaker changes] For what purpose does the gentleman from Johnston,
Representative Daughtry, rise?
[Speaker changes] To speak a second time.
[Speaker changes] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment a
second time.
[Speaker changes] This limit does not include local bills nor agency
bills. These are just ideas that people in this body have and if you
talk about six hundred more ideas we don&#39;t need to put that on the
people of this state. Its-It&#39;s a bad idea and I hope you&#39;ll keep
it at ten. That&#39;s plenty of bills. Ten bills with a hundred and
twenty that’s one thousand two hundred bills to be heard in this body.
That&#39;s enough work for us to do this year. Thank you.
[Speaker changes] For what purpose does the gentleman from Guilford,
Representative Hardister, rise?
[Speaker changes] To debate the amendment.
[Speaker changes] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[Speaker changes] Members, I think this is a good amendment. I think a
ten bill limit is sufficient and therefore I&#39;d ask you to vote for
it.
[Speaker changes] For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham,
Representative Hall, rise?
[Speaker changes] To speak on the amendment.
[Speaker changes] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[Speaker changes] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate the concern right
now for brevity and limiting the number of bills to ten, but at the same
time, I hope that we&#39;re going to continue the effort to let members
have good ideas. Some of the bills we file become bills that the
majority party takes and use. That&#39;s fine. We are about trying to
get the ideas out and get them discussed and have that opportunity.
Certainly, every member is not going to file fifteen bills. We know
that. Some members are more active in certain areas of expertise than
others. We should not inhibit them and keep them from contributing to
the state. I understand if there was a possibility that we would all
exercise that limit that might be a problem. We know our experience is
that&#39;s not what happens. So, again, we will feel fifteen bills would
be sufficient to give people in certain areas of expertise,
specifically in areas of concern for their area of the state that have
specific problems, as well basic needs, that this would satisfy them. We
ask that you defeat the amendment. Let&#39;s go ahead and keep it at
fifteen. Give people an opportunity to bring this ideas forward and if
you decide they are not worthy of your support we can vote them down or
if they are worthy of your support you can take them and use them to
help
North Carolina.
[Speaker changes] For what purpose does the lady from Surry, --Stevens,
rise?
[Speaker changes] To speak on the amendment.
[Speaker changes] The lady has the floor to debate the amendment.
[Speaker changes] I want to speak in favor of Representative
Daughtry&#39;s amendment. As a person who has already clearly filed
about twenty bills, we have a procedure in place for those people who
have more ideas. I have received tokens from various members of the
committee. If we look at the number of bills that are filed today and
divide by ten, there&#39;s a whole lot of bill tokens still out there.
We can...

  Keeping an idea alive knowing one day the majority might change. And
many of these bills, if you work on them over several years, you improve
your own bills that you file. And I just think it&#39;s one of the
things you win at the ballot box as a member. You can come down here and
you can file bills and you can tell people hey, I ran on this and I
filed a bill to do it. They wouldn&#39;t hear it, but that&#39;s just
the way the system works. Now I&#39;d even go further um, and I think
this is a good compromise at this date to give people five more bills.
I&#39;m not planning on filing mine. You, you get a different
perspective in the majority, but I wouldn&#39;t even, if it were my
brothers, I wouldn&#39;t even have a bill filing deadline because that
could, that could prevent this, this absurdity we see where bills go
over from other houses and they&#39;re stripped, Senate bills are
stripped here and an absolutely completely different subject&#39;s put
in it. Where&#39;s the bill filing deadline for that? So there are ways
to get bills filed well after the deadline in, in many instances. And to
some extent, this is a fiction with the tokens. And I just think we
ought to, we ought to  grant this important compromise that the
leadership has worked out and vote this amendment down. [SPEAKER CHANGE]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Gaston Representative Torbett
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGE] Ask the minority leader a question please.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Does the gentleman from Durham yield to the gentleman
from Gaston? [SPEAKER CHANGE] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGE] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Minority Leader. I, I&#39;m not skeptical
or anything, but this is evidently brought forward with a purpose and I
was wonder if there was any kind of time factor. Do, are you just now
under, trying to determine that somehow this is sequestering a voice or
has this been an ongoing thing since the beginning of the session? Why,
why, why today for example? [SPEAKER CHANGE] Well the amendment came
forward today at the uh, pleasure of the rules chair. We discussed a
matter that&#39;s been ongoing in discussion since the start of session
and um, as you, as you may recall, we didn&#39;t really get consulted
uh, on this when it was made a ten deal limit. So that was never our
desire and uh, was not something we willingly uh, agreed to. [SPEAKER
CHANGE] One follow up, Mr. Speaker. Does the gentleman from Durham yield
to an additional question from the gentlemen from Gaston? [SPEAKER
CHANGE] Yes, mister. [SPEAKER CHANGE] He yields. So you could attest
that there was no trigger in recent days or recent counter dates that
might have brought this on? [SPEAKER CHANGE] No, this was a request and
a discussion that was being had from the start of session. [SPEAKER
CHANGE] Thank, thank you, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGE] For what purpose
does the gentleman from Harnett, Representative Lewis rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGE] Mr. Speaker, I&#39;d like to ask that the amendment along with
the bill be temporarily displaced. [SPEAKER CHANGE] So ordered house
resolution as well as the amendment is temporarily displaced. House Bill
273, the clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Representatives Jackson and
Glazier, House Bill 273. A bill to be entitled on that to clarify that
the provisions regarding deferred prosecution and conditional discharge
of convictions of H and I felonies and misdemeanors under structured
sentences do not apply to convictions of impaired driving and to clarify
that offenses involving impaired driving cannot be imposed. Johnson is
my client in next. [SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman from Wake,
Representative Jackson is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I&#39;m not gonna
take very long. I know we&#39;ve got an upcoming very long debate. The
bill was pretty self explanatory. There are two provisions under the law
where you end up with not having a permanent conviction. One is the
conditional discharge and the second is the expungement law. I don&#39;t
believe from my reading and my memory when we passed these bills that we
intended that DWI be allowed to be discharged or expunged. However,
I&#39;ve handed out something to you today that shows that there are
other attorneys in this state who believe it can be expunged and based
that on the fact that we listed what offenses weren&#39;t eligible to be
expunged. And by not listing DWI, we basically gave our implicit consent
to expunge DWI. This bill would fix that.  I&#39;d be happy to answer
any questions, but didn&#39;t want to take much time today. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Further discussion, further debate. If not, the
question before the house is the passage of House Bill 273 on its second

that that&#39;s when this bill was going to come up, so I got one of

a very simple bill. We have a couple of counties that have this in place
right now. We&#39;re merely adding Currituck to Brunswick and Dare
County and this is to remove abandoned vessels from the, the canals and
so forth that exist in Currituck County and it&#39;s not only, just like
folks abandon houses, they also abandon their boats. And they&#39;re in
these canals and they&#39;re becoming navigational hazards, as well as
unsightly neighborhood distractions. So, that&#39;s what this bill is
all about. It passed unanimous in the committee today and I will answer
any questions that anyone might have and, excuse me for the

Whitmire, Pendleton, and Salmon. It was heard today in the House
Homeland Security Committee. Many of y&#39;all may know that when an
Army Reservist or a National Guardsman is called to active duty by the
President, to federal active duty, they have under federal law,
protections for their job when they come off active duty. When a member
of the North Carolina, excuse me the North Carolina National Guard is
called to active duty, a state statute protects their job when they come
back off of active duty. But the little quirk, a little bit of a
loophole in our law, a North Carolinian who happens to serve in an
adjacent or other state&#39;s National Guard, say in South Carolina,
Tennessee, or Virginia. If in South Carolina, Governor Haley calls them
to state active duty, they&#39;re technically not protected under North
Carolina law. So all this bill does is clear up that loophole so a North
Carolinian serving in another state&#39;s National Guard, who is called
to state active duty by another

[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representatives Bradford and Stam, House Bill 174, a
bill to be   amend and exchange certain notice requirements and
protections for tenants of real properties in foreclosure and to allow
the purchases of real property under option contracts to purse monetary
damages separately from summary ejection proceedings or other amendments
to the Homebuyer Protection Act. ?? North Carolina ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Which member is handling this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman, for what purpose does the gentleman from
Wake, Rep. Stam, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]  Mt. Speaker,Representative Bradford will handle the
first part of the bill, and then he’ll ask you to recognize me for the
second part.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman from Mecklenburg, Representative
Bradford, has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To give you a little bit of
background, I practiced property management for a living, and so I
worked for the landlord. Well, in 2009, the government enacted a piece
of legislation that protected tenants from landlords that went into
foreclosure. That was a very good piece of legislation and it actually
expired, or sunset, December 31 of last year. So House Bill 174, a part
of that bill is to take the piece of federal legislation which is now
expired and codify that into North Carolina law. Now because the federal
government was working quickly during a time of recession to put
something in place to help tenants who were living in properties for
landlords who were going into default so they would have a place to
live, they had a lot of double-talk language, so we used this
opportunity to make this language more clear. and we also added some
other things to make it, I think, a better bill. Most certainly, one
thing that we did for example was under the federal language, a bill had
to be what they call ‘bona fide,’ or a lease excuse me had to be bona
fide. And bona fide really didn’t say anything other more than it had to
be reasonable rent, market rent, it couldn’t be with a relative. But
what it didn’t say, for example, is that a lease had to be in writing.
So you could imagine trying to do something with a tenant when they say
they had a lease in writing. So this bill actually adds a provision that
the lease has to be in writing. Another thing that we did in this bill,
and this happens a lot, sometimes when a landlord is going into default,
they get very upset at the bank. I don’t think that’s justifiably
something they should do but they, it has happened. So what they’’ll do
is they’ll go sign, and I’ll be a little facetious here, but they might
sign a ten-year lease with the tenant—just because they knew that the
bank would have to honor a ten-year-lease with the tenant. So I do not
think that was reasonable, so this piece of legislation only allows, or
only requires a bank, to honor a lease for no more than one year. So
that’s another area where we tried to clean it up. A third thing that
this piece of legislation does that the federal act did not address was
in situations of extreme danger or habitability. If a bank forecloses on
a property and its unsafe or unfit, the old legislation it was very gray
as if to a bank would have to invest twenty, thirty thousand dollars to
make a property habitable just because a tenant may have a lease of
three, four, five hundred dollars a month. This piece of legislation
would allow a bank to not have to make it habitable, therefore releasing
the tenant without any recourse against them whatsoever. This piece of
legislation also talks about lease purchase options. Lease purchase
options under the current statute today, if you are a landlord and you
have sold a property in a lease purchase situation, essentially if the
tenant, or the buyer, stops paying you, you have to go to district court
to argue that they’re not paying their rent because the tenant or the
buyer can argue that there is an equity position. Well, you can imagine
this is very challenging because if you&#39;re a landlord and a tenant
is using district court, and they keep getting appeals, it may take
months—six, seven, eight months. So what we’ve done here is this piece
of legislation still preserves the right for a tenant to pursue claims
regarding equity. We have not removed that right from a tenant. But what
it does is..

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senators Randleman, Daniel and Newton. Senate Bill 78, a bill to be
entitled An Act To Revive That State Correctional Officer May Carry a
Concealed Weapon When Off Duty. General Assembly of North Carolina
enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Randolph, Representative McNeil, is recognized to
debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is a simple bill. In the general statute,
most people are excluded from concealing... carrying concealed weapons.
Over the last couple of years the Legislature has exempted several
people from that: judges, magistrates, district attorneys, assistant
district attorneys, investigators for district attorneys, etc., etc.
This task adds one more class of people, which is off-duty correctional
officers, to that list of exemptions. I would appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the lady from Iredell, Representative Turner,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to share some other comments from Senator Randleman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. The officers are not to consume alcohol or have any unlawful
controlled substance in their bodies, and cannot have any alcohol or
unlawful substance in their bodies. Sorry. These individuals are
required to have completed their training and standards through the
Department of Public Safety, which consists of 120 hours, including 26
hours of handgun training, at which point they&#39;re certified
correctional officers. It is supported by the Department of Public
Safety, and badly needed by our state correctional officers. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Guilford, Representative
Faircloth, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that nothing has changed as much in the past twenty or thirty
years as the danger that correctional officers face now, compared to
what they used to face. Primarily because the way prisons are run has
loosened up quite a bit, and that&#39;s good — they were awfully brutal
at one time — but they have loosened up in order to incorporate as good
a living conditions as possible within the correctional institution. But
in so doing, a lot more freedom is given to the inmate, and a lot more
ability to interact with other inmates and with the correctional
officers. We&#39;ve also, during that time, seen the growth, both on the
street, but particularly in the correctional system, of gangs. And these
are gangs that aren&#39;t just a bunch of guys that just make a lot of
noise. These are folks who will actually kill you. They will actually
threaten to do it, and they will actually do it in many cases. These
correctional officers are placed by us in a position of ensuring that
those gang members act properly within prison, and are as orderly as
they can possibly be. But from time to time, one of them will have
contacts outside, and will threaten a correctional officer, and give the
order out to do harm to that officer, and I don&#39;t want our state
employees, that are trained very well in the correctional system — not
paid very well, but do a great job — I don&#39;t want to give them any
more dangerous situation than they have already, and I think we can help
their situation by allowing them to carry a... properly carry a firearm
as provided in this bill, so I do urge your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Vance, Representative
Baskerville, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Question for the bill sponsor.

  Think about the training and the hours that the correctional officers
had to go through. This, the bill measures meet the firearms training
standards of the Division of Adult Correction of the Department of
Public Safety.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I am familiar with BLET, basic law enforcement
training that the officers have to go through to get on the sheriff’s
department to get on the police department. Is ..is that the same thing
as what’s in this bill that these folks have to go through, the BLET
training? I don’t know if you would know that. That’s why was trying to
get it to the bill sponsor. I’m just not, it’s not a getcha, gotcha

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. This might be a better question for

[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Let’s try Representative McNeill maybe?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Does the gentleman from Randolph yield to a question
from the gentleman from Vance?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Would you restate it again? I think I understand it,
but just to make sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I like the bill. I want to make sure that the folks
have gotten training dealing with firearms. I know about BLET training,
basic law enforcement training that the cops and the sheriffs have to go
through. Is this training here that’s in the billI, talking about
training by Division of Adult Correction, it that BLET training or
something, you know, substantially similar to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It is substantially similar. I don’t think it is quite
as lengthly as is the basic law enforcement training, but it is more
than concealed. As I remember, and I’m speaking off the top of my head,
I think the, the training in the academy for firearms is 26 hours and
then they have to re-qualify every year. Most concealed weapons classes
are around eight hours, and once they get that they don’t have to go
back ever again. So, it is,  it’s somewhere between concealed and BLET.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not the
question before the House is the passage of House Bill, excuse me,
Senate Bill 78 on its second reading. Those in favor will vote aye.
Those opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the vote.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The ayes have it, and Senate Bill 78 passes its third
reading and will be sent to the Senate—strike that, will be enrolled and
sent to the Governor. Members, the Chair is about to recognize the Rules
Chair for a motion pertaining to the calendar. Just for those of you who
are following this, where we stand. The bills that have yet to be done
for the day
are the following. We still have Senate Bill 181, which is the Wade
County Commissioner’s District’s bill. The chair believes there may be
just a little bit of discussion about that bill. Uh, House Bill 255 was
referred to Finance. And then House Resolution 480, which had been
temporarily displaced. There’s also the third reading to House Bill 174.
Does the lady still wish to leave her objection—Representative Stevens.
Does the lady wish to withdraw her objection to third reading?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No sir. We’re working on a little amendment, just
clears up something else for me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The, very well. The bill will remain on the counter
for third reading. So where that takes us, members, is we have four
bills that are eligible to be added to today’s calendar. These are bills
that were read earlier, and I’m going to go back and if members want to
withdraw their objection they can and if not the Rules Chair will make a
motion to add the bills to the calendar. The first one was House Bill
95, which is the tribal ABC bill. Is there objection remaining to that
bill going on today’s calendar? Hearing none, the bill will be added to
today’s calendar. House Bill 195 which is the biosimilars bill amending
the North Carolina pharmacy practice to allow for substitution of
interchangeable biological products. Is there objection remaining to

detention facilities, enter the local food bills. Is there still
objection to those? There is objection. Okay, the gentleman from, from

  Is to get on the cutting edge of innovation, in the pharmaceutical /
biotechnology world, to prepare our state for really what will be a
burgeoning market in biosimilar and interchangeable biosimilar
treatments. This is going to be a boon for physicians, for patients to
be able to access these types of treatments as they are approved by the
Food and Drug Administration. The first one that will be an
interchangeable biosimilar to be approved by the FDA, we anticipate that
later this year and it’s a product that’s under development right here
in North Carolina. The benefits of this legislation and what is being
done are potentially enormous. Savings for patients in the health care
system, the Rand Corporation estimated a ten year savings nationally in
health care of some 44.2 billion dollars. The Generic Pharmaceutical
Association actually projects savings over the course of the next ten
years with just the first ten, excuse me, first eleven most likely
biosimilars to enter the market at some 250 billion dollars. So the
savings estimates are substantial. We have a number of states have
already acted this year, and are in the process of acting just as North
Carolina is acting hopefully today, here in the House. The
pharmaceutical industry, including those who are working on biologics,
those working on biosimilars and those working on those products that
will be interchangeable biosimilars are all in agreement with this bill.
We have support from a variety of pharmacy benefit management companies
and of course the area that was probably most of interest with respect
to negotiation was with our pharmacists since this is their practice act
that is being amended. They have put in a tremendous amount of work, all
the stakeholders have been at this table for days and weeks and months,
literally, and they have worked out the section of this bill and are in
agreement with notification provisions so that clinicians, the
physicians can be aware if a interchangeable biosimilar in the future is
actually given to the patient or provided to the patient, that that
information will be back in the hands of the physician, the prescribing
physicians. This bill also in the spirit of compromise, we put a sunset
of October first, 2020. So that this General Assembly can come back and
make sure over the course of the next five years that things are
operating as we intended them to operate. Again, what this bill does it
puts North Carolina right up there in the forefront of our development
of our biotechnology industry, and most importantly to be able to access
these interchangeable biosimilar treatments for patients which over the
long haul will save us tremendous amounts of money and provide better
outcomes for patients, and again Mr. Speaker, I believe if you would
recognize Representative Martin and then Representative Avila for some
additional comments and explanations of the bill and then we’ll
certainly stand ready to answer any questions members may have. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Martin of Wilkinson is recognized. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Two quick things. For members here that
have additional questions or interest, I want to draw your attention
that I sent an email out to all House members with some of the terms and
some additional information on the bill that you can look at on your
computer. Secondly, I’d like to go ahead and register an objection to
third reading, based on some input I’ve had from folks who want to make
sure they clearly understand this and I appreciate them allowing it to
be added to the calendar today for discussion and I think with
additional information then we’ll get a full debate. So if you could
register that. This is a great bill for North Carolina

  Carolina, it does a lot of really positive things, as Representative
Dollar pointed out. First of all, it&#39;s going to be good for our
patients and people who are suffering from some of these diseases that
we are able to have innovative technology and innovative treatment
options. And this will secondly significantly reduce the cost of having
that treatment, which will be good for patients for availability. And
also good for our state and national budget, as a significant amount of
that health care cost is borne by government and also by industry. And
third, this is a jobs bill for North Carolina because, as you know, the
pharma industry and the biopharmaceuticals are a huge segment for North
Carolina. We&#39;re one of the top producers in the country. The first
biosimilar that was approved by the FDA, which March 6th was the first
time this product was approved, is manufactured at Wilson at Sandoz, a
division of Novartis, who have the most biosimilars in the world. This
is innovation taking place. A lot of the research and innovation is
happening in North Carolina, and we want to promote that. Many
legislatures around the country are dealing with this issue because
it&#39;s innovative products. And we need to update our standards as the
FDA is making them available. it is a very high standard for the
substitution that the FDA approves. The reason that we have the
notification is these act differently than the generic. They are not
exactly the same. I think Representative Avila is in the best position
to give more detail on that. But from a safety standpoint, physicians
need to know if a person is reacting differently and exactly what they
were given, if they are given the substitution, since they&#39;re not
exactly the same. This is a great jobs bill for us and I hope that you
will support it. If you want to look at that information, we will all be
happy to take your questions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

Speaker. This gets a little confusing with the terminology that sounds
similar. But it&#39;s extremely simple if you think of it as three
levels of medication. Your highest level would be your biologic. That
would be your equivalent of a brand name. Then you have a biosimilar,
which is a similar drug, but it differs quite a bit from the biologic
and is not within the FDA range of where they would allow it to be
substituted. That is the biointerchangeable. And that is the one that,
through testing, the FDA has agreed that will be, there are none on the
market yet, but it will be interchangeable with the biologic. And a
pharmacist would be allowed to substitute that, similar to the way they
substitute generics in the small-molecule medicine right now. What
we&#39;ve actually done is take a proactive stance to protect our
patients in the state, simply because the difference in these drugs,
even though it is slight with the biointerchangeables, it&#39;s still
different enough that it could react quite a bit differently from one
patient to the next. And when a doctor prescribes a medicine, he needs
to know that that patient is going home and taking that medicine.
Because if any kind of reactions take place, they need a record of that
so that they will learn as we go forward as to what can be
interchangeable without issues and make any modifications that are
necessary. I see it as more in line with the Patient Protection Act
simply that the physician making the prescription knows when a
substitution is made and will be able to follow any adverse affects or
positive effects in substituting drugs. I would please ask for your
support on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Martin of Wake is
recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to
see if my friend ?? would yield to a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does
she yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, first of all I&#39;m
real supportive of this and excited about what this could mean for North
Carolina&#39;s economy and for our patients getting cheaper drugs. But
as a patient who sees my doctor and gets a prescription from my doctor
who tells me she&#39;s prescribing me, and give me, and I hope I use the
term correctly, the biologic name here. Under this bill I would go to my
pharmacist, and the pharmacist would be allowed to give to me a
biosimilar drug? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No. No. It would have to be a
biointerchangeable. They are the only ones that would be allowed to be
substituted. They are the ones that would receive the

  —Adcock is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Adcock]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I&#39;d like to debate the Bill and ask the
Bill&#39;s sponsor a question, If I may?
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
Does she yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Adcock]
Actually, I think it&#39;s Representative Dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Dollar]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Adcock]
Thanks for the great explanation, Representative Dollar. I did have just
a clarifying question. So under this new Bill language, would..... If a
prescriber —and by the way, there are more prescribers than physicians.
Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and nurse-midwives all
prescribe— So if a prescriber notes on the prescription, &#39;Dispense
as Written&#39;, is it true that under this proposed language that in
order to dispense a bio-interchangeable, the pharmacist would have to
call the prescriber and get permission to do so, if this Bill were
passed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Dollar]
Well, if it&#39;s &#39;Dispensed as Written&#39;, then it would be as
written, but if a biosimilar—an interchangeable biosimilar—would be
given to the patient by the pharmacy, the notice requirement requires
that to be sent back to the prescribing physician. Now, in terms of
refills, that would not be— well, refills doesn&#39;t really describe
the types of treatments we&#39;re talking about, but— but just in
conventional terms, refills would not require that. And I think it&#39;s
very important to understand that the language in this Bill has been
very carefully negotiated and worked out. Folks all across the country
have had discussions, everybody has been at the table for multiple
negotiating sessions, we have support from the Medical Society, we have
support— I mean, we had a rheumatologist here today that&#39;s one of
the experts in the field nationally, in support of this Bill. The
pharmacists are now neutral on the Bill. Their concerns in the
notification section, word-for-word, have been satisfied. And I think
it&#39;s also important to understand that pharmacy— as far as I know,
most of the major— certainly the largest pharmacy benefit manager in the
country was here, today, in support of this legislation. Obviously,
notification issues are something that they wanna take into account. And
I would also just add, since I&#39;m standing up here, is that
they&#39;ve been doing this in Europe for a while, and they have seen—
pharmacy benefit folks tell us that they&#39;ve seen a thirty percent
[30%] drop in cost. So, again, this is to the benefit of the patients,
and it&#39;s gonna be to the benefit of the healthcare system, and
it&#39;s gonna lower our costs as a healthcare system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Adcock]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
D&#39;you yield for a follow up, Representative Dollar?
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Dollar]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Adcock]
Thank you, Representative Dollar. I appreciate the amount of work
that&#39;s gone into this, and the fact that there&#39;s precedent
before us. My question&#39;s not in non-support of the Bill, or its
objective to save patients and the system money. But my question is
this: As a prescriber myself, when I write I have to take the action to
check &#39;Dispense as Written&#39; on the prescription because I want
my patient to have one particular drug. And that&#39;s what the
pharmacists, by law, now must dispense to my patient. If I write
&#39;Dispense as Written&#39; for a brand name drug, even if there&#39;s
a generic available, that pharmacist has to fill the brand name drug
unless he or she calls me, and says: May I substitute this generic?
—Which often I say yes, unless there&#39;s a good reason. In this case,
my question is: With the proposed language, if a prescriber has
designated &#39;Dispense as Written&#39; on their prescription, is it
true then that the pharmacist must call the prescriber ahead of time,
before they dispense the medication? Because afterward, letting you know
afterward does you no good, if you disagreed with that. And as the
prescriber you have the right to designate which medication you want
your patient to have. And I would just also add that I support
Representative Glazier&#39;s request for patient education to be part of
this language. I think it&#39;s terrific what&#39;s in this Bill, to
require notification in the patient&#39;s medical record that they have
then given one bio-interchangeable instead of another, but I think the
patient deserves to know as well. Because I know, as a prescriber, when
I talk to my patients about the medication that I&#39;m putting them on,
I usually talk to them about a certain drug. They go home, or they get
to the parking lot—

  <p id="175:00">
  and they see that that&#39;s not the drug they were given they&#39;re
gonna have questions.  Pharmacists are in a unique position and a very
well educated position, should talk to the patients about the fact that
they&#39;re taking drug A instead of drug B.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well
it&#39;s my understanding, and I would defer to Representative Martin to
give a more definitive answer on this particular issue.  She&#39;s been
working on this but it&#39;s my understanding if it&#39;s as given as
written then it would be as written.  I believe that&#39;s your
question.  The other thing I think people need to understand is these
are very specialized medications.  Most of these are running through
specialized pharmacies but, Mr. Speaker, if you would recognize
Representative Martin [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will [SPEAKER CHANGES] maybe
be able to better respond [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will recognize
Representative Martin but before that, the pages are free to go for
today and come back tomorrow for a exciting day.  Representative Martin
of Wiltson is recognized.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Just to offer clarification on the question.  So there is still an
option for the prescriber to say &quot;dispense as written&quot; which
means as written and no substitution is allowed just like today, just
like a generic.  So if you prescribe &quot;as written&quot; then
there&#39;s no substitution allowed.  Now it also the bill does not
change the ability for a biosimilar so now if it&#39;s not
&quot;dispense as written&quot; and there&#39;s a biosimilar which we
had the first ones approved, that does require advance notification.  So
the current law is, the state law currently requires a pharmacist to
contact the prescribing clinician before substituting a biologic for a
biosimilar, which is expected to be cheaper.  So that is still evolving
and we just now have the first biosimiar, so we do not have the
interchangeables, but it is coming and it&#39;s a marketplace that North
Carolina will participate in and we&#39;re hoping to be set up for.  So
once, if it&#39;s not &quot;dispense as written&quot; and there&#39;s an
interchangeable, that&#39;s when there&#39;s the notification at the
back end. Now I have reached out to staff on the questions about patient
notification and I suspect that that&#39;s currently in the Pharmacy
Act, but we&#39;ll clarify that to see if that&#39;s just something that
we&#39;re not changing.  Thanks.  [SPEAKER CHANGE] Further, further
debate?  If not, the question before the house is the passage of House
Bill 195 on it&#39;s second reading.  Those in favor will

  Gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ladies and gentlemen this amendment effectively
cuts the bill. The whole point of the bill is to allow the counties, the
county jails and everything to look for the best prices, to be able to
purchase locally. To be able to purchase their fresh fruits and
vegetables from a local farmer. That&#39;s the whole point to get a
better price. They will never exhaust the bidding prices, we&#39;re
talking about food here, there&#39;s always going to be people that are
going to be willing to sell the jails food. The point is to allow them
to get it cheaper by possibly buying locally and being able to buy from
some local farmers, things like that. That&#39;s the whole point of
these bills, so please vote no on this.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Further discussion, further debate on the amendment? If not, the

Very briefly and thank you, Mr. Speaker. Again, I just wanted to call
the body&#39;s attention to the fact that we&#39;re now going to a no
bid process, I appreciate Representative Speciale&#39;s reference to the
fact that will be looking to get fresh fruits and vegetables locally.
Again, I would point out there is nothing in this bill that requires
that or references that, or in the process that&#39;s now set out to
assure that. So, I understand that intent but that&#39;s not what
we&#39;re voting on today and that is not the limitation that is being
put to these sheriff&#39;s in these situations. Again, I hope you would
consider that, I reference it several weeks ago when we passed that
first bill that this would end up being a statewide phenomenon and we
kind of all turned our backs on it. Here we are and we&#39;ll see
several more of these. So, again, please recognize that we are not
assuring local participation, we&#39;re not assuring any fresh fruits or
vegetables, healthy eating, or any of those things. The only thing that
we&#39;re assuring is that the sheriff has un-feathered ?? to whoever he
wants. Thank you.

The gentleman from Wake, Representative Stam, is recognized to debate
the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  This is a--sort of a--technical bill
so--lets&#39;s just--oh, wait a minute.  We had two and a half hours of
public input and discussion in Election Law Committee yesterday, but for
the information folks--that was actually the fourth time we&#39;ve had
public input in this process.  Also, I&#39;d like you to know, before I
get into the merits, that on your dashboard under &quot;Related
Documents&quot; are the maps in question as well as the maps for
Representative Gill&#39;s amendments--so we didn&#39;t have to kill more
trees to put them on your desk--but you&#39;ll find them on your
map--dashboard.  The bill itself changes the way of electing county
commissioners for Wake County.  It&#39;s probably interesting to know
that the last time this was ...

  Speaker changes: significantly change 1981 without a referendum and the
1981 change actually reversed the referendum 1961 we have come to fix
here section one of the Bill increases the commission from seven to nine
members ?? i had no objection from anybody for increasing the number
from seven to nine i feel sorry for Representative Jones i believe they
had eleven members for some board up there county that had a population
?? in the last couple of years so that&#39;s not really controversial
section 1 b was taken to income puts ll the other party will be up to
2016 it will continue to range some of lot districts  in 2016 for two
years instead of normal 4 year run and that large for what the bill does
mainly is gradually does to out lodge i have seen wanna do that for 31
years let&#39;s just suppose in the stay house if we elect ll of us ??
actually some of the people suggested that  wouldn&#39;t that be
terrible when that be horrible aided ?? large in are  ?? residential
districts where the seven commissioners live but they voted on county
wide i believe Representative ?? from his party at be elected under that
scenario back a few years even he was younger at large election ??
illness it&#39;s a small town or small county because at large election
submerge the view of any kind of minority ?? they dont give true close
representations close to the voters and frankly i have herd very little
objections ht this bill proposes district bill election from ?? which
says what the district would be is we didn&#39;t become innovative the
drafters of the bill ?? we id let&#39;s not be innovative ?? that we
have for a school board no 1 secondly it would be much easier it would
much easier to board of minister to administer because overall ?? for
the some time for same number of sets but not the same time you have an
infinite number a balanced style in the various ?? just think about that
?? might have two different county commissioner candidates running in
that press set two school board candidates the preset official the party
official would need  computer to figure out to walk down the street to
who running there these districts have hardly been approved one yer go

  This amendment not only ensures that representatives live near their
constituents, it also makes it easy for voters to know which districts
they are in, and who represents them. Folks, I&#39;m not in favor of
redrawing any districts. But if we have to do it, let&#39;s do it fair.
And let&#39;s make sure that we&#39;re doing it in the best possible way
so that our citizens and constituents can make sure that they&#39;re
represented by people that they know, if that&#39;s what you want, and
that they live close to their representative. So I ask you to support
the amendment. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank the gentlelady. Those wishing not to speak on the amendment, would
you please turn off your lights? Recognizing the gentleman from Wake
County, Representative Stam, to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Briefly, I&#39;ll ask you to vote no on the
amendment. If the lady were also proposing to change the school board
districts, which have not yet gone into effect but will go into effect
in 2016, I would have fewer points to argue against her. But since she
only proposes to change the county commission districts, here are four
quick points: One, her amendment is bait for a lawsuit. For reasons I
explained earlier, the districts we proposed have already been approved.
Second, her amendment would create infinite confusion by candidates,
election officials, but especially the voters, because they would be in
so many different districts at the same time as their neighbors, it
would be almost impossible to educate voters correctly. Third, she
mentions the, that it&#39;s less of a deviation in population. And you
can always have exactly no deviation, as we&#39;re required to do in
Congressional districts, and as a result, Congressional districts are
gerrymandered even more. Because of that feature, you have to squiggle
even more. But deviations are really irrelevant, because that is based
on the 2010 census, and Wake County has grown, I don&#39;t know the
exact number but probably 200,000 people since that census. So the
deviations are irrelevant. I mean they&#39;re irrelevant to whether
these are fair plans. The legal question about permissible deviation has
already been answered by the federal district court, which says that the
plan in effect for the school board is within permissible limits. And
finally, she argues partisan motivation, and I will just, I won&#39;t
argue that except exhibit one fact, and that is of the nine districts,
five of the districts have more Democrats than Republicans, four
districts have more Republicans than Democrats.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentlelady from Wake County, Representative
Holley, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Wake County has grown, and it&#39;s huge now. And before long, it&#39;s
going to be one big metropolitan area. But in the interim, we are
looking at this, and representatives get a bill. Her amendment is clear.
It has really easy-to-read lines, it does not split precincts, it takes
a long hard look at this, and it&#39;s fair. You know, I ask that you
please vote for this amendment. It would at least allow part of Wake
County, those of us in here, to have an input in that redistricting.
Thank you.

For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham rise, Representative
Michaux?

To debate the amendment.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;d like to disabuse your mind from one or two things that
Representative Stam said. He wants you to believe that the school board
districts that have been drawn and are in court now, that they are the
law. They are not. Those, that decision handed down by the district
court, is on appeal. So nobody knows what&#39;s going to happen with
that particular map. He thinks it&#39;s going to be upheld, the district
court&#39;s decision. I think it&#39;s going to be overruled. And the
reason I think that that decision is going to be overruled is simply
because of a case that has come down recently from the United States
Supreme Court, which overturned, in federal district court and

[SPEAKER CHANGES to Clerk]
Representative G. Martin moves to amend the Bill on Page One [1], lines
ten [10] through thirteen [13], by deleting those lines.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
Representative Martin, you may proceed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative G. Martin]
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Members, Senate Bill 181 has started a
healthy conversation in Wake County. It&#39;s a good thing for our
citizens to start the process of discussing how we govern ourselves, and
see that as we&#39;ve grown significantly and seen significant change,
is there a better way by which our County could govern itself. Members,
in North Carolina, our system gives the state great power over our
municipalities and counties. But, of course, as the saying goes,
&#39;With great power comes great responsibility&#39;, and there is, of
course, a need to be very careful and judicious in how we, as the state,
exercise that power over our local governments. Yesterday, in a somewhat
similar debate, the gentleman from Rockingham, Representative Jones, set
forth two arguments in favor of his Bill to change districts. One of
which was that the proposal was unanimous amongst members of his
delegation. And the other argument was that the Bill had a provision for
a referendum. Members, currently the BIll before you that changes
districts in Wake County meets neither of those two criteria. It is not
in its current form unanimous at all amongst members of the Wake
delegation, either in the Senate or the House, and it doesn&#39;t have a
provision for a referendum. Now, this debate that is going in Wake
County, that, as I said, I do think is healthy, has barely had a chance
to move far forward. However, our Wake County Chamber of Commerce has
weighed in. They&#39;ve acknowledged some merit in the Bill, and even
announced support for some provisions of it. But nothing that, quote,
&quot;It could have significant impact on our quality of life, and
continued economic development,&quot; they specifically have asked that
the voters of Wake County have the opportunity to vote on this proposal.
In the past, in fact, other proposals have come before the voters of
Wake County, for changes in their government, and the last several times
the voters of Wake County have actually adopted the legislative
position. It may very well be the case that they will do that now. But,
in any case, I would ask that you extend the same courtesy, the same
right, to the voters of Wake County that you have to other counties,
similarly situated and facing bills like this, and allow my people to
have a vote on it. The Amendment before you, very simply, would put a
provision on the ballot in 2016, asking the voters of Wake County if
they wanted the County Commission Districts to track those of the School
Board Districts. I&#39;d ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
Representative Bumgardner, for what purpose to do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Bumgardner]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. On the amendment awhile ago— I was sitting here
napping, and when I woke up my light was green and it needed to be red.

Would you change it please?

Representative Bumgardner, will be glad to do that. Welcome back!

Speciale.

Recognizing the gentleman from Wake County, Representative Stam, for
what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Stam]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
You may have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Stam]
And, as before, briefly. There&#39;re two reasons why I would ask the
Body to defeat the amendment and not agree to it. First of all, one is
just— irony. Our current system was imposed by the Legislature in 1981
and it reversed a referendum that had taken place in 1960. But the
second reason is more practical. Because sometimes, ah— referenda are
appropriate and sometimes they&#39;re not. But the effect of this —and
please remember that this change will be phased in, so that three out of
the five people elected in 2016 will still be elected at-large, so after
the 2016 election, we&#39;ll still have seven at-large commissioners and
only two district commissioners. It doesn&#39;t really go into effect
until 2018, so to be effective for about 2019. Well, the effect of the
amendment is to have a referendum in November of 2016, so that it&#39;s
not really in effect—

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The question before the body is the amendment offered
by Representative Martin of Wake County, ?? Representative Hall, for
what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You may have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] With great
deference to my good friend Skip’s age, I would like to bring up and
reiterate one point that my colleague Representative Martin mentioned,
and that is that just yesterday this body voted yes to change the
election laws for a Republican member’s county district. And the main
difference in that bill, he mentioned it earlier, but it was that my
good friend from Rockingham County wisely gave the citizens of his
county the ability to approve the changes by referendum. And my friends
across the aisle all voted yes on that idea yesterday, so I hope you
also vote green and yes today on this amendment and extend that same
courtesy by referendum to my county. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All others
wishing to speak on the amendment. Seeing none, all those in favor will
signify by voting aye, those opposed no. The clerk will unlock the
machine. [PAUSE] The clerk will lock the machine. The amendment does
fail with 45 in favor, 61 against. The amendment fails. Back on the main
bill. Any others wishing to speak on the bill? Representative,
recognizing Representative Tillman from Wake County. Sir, you have the
floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I wish to speak on the bill. Since I’m the only
member of this body that’s ever been a Wake County Commissioner, I want
to talk about my experiences with it, and why things need to change.
Years ago, 23 years ago when I ran for County Commissioner, I really
enjoyed, it was hard because we have a huge county not in population so
much but in land area. It’s about from end to east, from Zebulon to ??
about an hour drive so it’s tough campaigning county-wide. But the hard
thing about it, back then a congressional district on average in North
Carolina had about 600,000 people. Today with a million, it’s 710,000
people, so it’s gone from when I ran to one congressional district to
one and a half congressional districts and most people have a hard time
raising, during the summer I ran 80 to a hundred thousand dollars to
run. And you can imagine if you took I think we’ve got 11 House members
in Wake County, how much money we all spent and our opposition spent
when running for County Commissioner you can’t run if you can’t raise 80
to a hundred thousand. The price of median Wake County is even higher
than Charlotte Mecklenberg. So I, I don’t, I hate we have to change it,
because I really like campaigning in Zebulon and Wendell and the little
towns, but it just has come to the point that very few people can afford
to run for County Commissioner anymore. With these districts, which are
sort of like Mecklenberg has done, they raised their board from a few
years ago from seven to nine members. They have three at-large and they
have six districts. So I just wanted to speak on it. I don’t of anything
else to say. I hate, it just can’t be done anymore but I don’t feel like
it’s fair to people that are going to run in the future. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman from Wake County, Representative Martin, for what
purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very
much, Mr. Speaker. Members, I just wanted to talk about a few additional
problems with this bill. The proponent of the bill talked about this

  The gentleman from Mecklenburg, Representative Brawley, is recognized
for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I move that the House do concur with the conference
report, and would like the opportunity to explain the report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If this looks familiar, you have seen it before. We passed House Bill
41, which was the Revenue Loss Technical Corrections bill, which failed
to pass in 2014, because in the Senate it was turned into, well, House
Bill 1224. The same thing happened this year. And it came back with some
additional verbiage related to the revenue, or the IRC bill. After
passing Senate Bill 20, we no longer need to address the IRC update. The
purpose of the conference report is this is the quickest way to restore
a bill to the original state of the technical corrections bill, and get
it to the governor&#39;s desk. And that is because there are some
time-sensitive issues in here that would not have been time sensitive if
we had passed it in 2004. But if it looks familiar, it&#39;s been
through committee in the House and we&#39;ve approved it before and I
ask that you approve it again. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the motion? For what purpose does
the gentleman from Durham, Representative Michaux, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;d like to ask the gentleman a question
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Mecklenburg yield to the gentleman from Durham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield to the esteemed gentleman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can you tell me what I&#39;m about to vote on?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will be happy to go through all the technical corrections again if you
would like, but they are. Essentially, we passed House Bill 41 about
three weeks ago. We are restoring House Bill 41 to the state in which we
passed it three weeks ago, and removing all of the things the Senate
added.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate? If not, the question before the
House is the motion to adopt the conference report to House Bill 41.
Those in favor will vote aye, those opposed will vote no, the clerk will
open the vote. Representative Steinburg, does the gentleman wish to vote
on this bill? The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote: 109
having voted in the affirmative and two in the negative, the conference
report for House Bill 41 is adopted and the Senate will be so notified.
Members, would direct your attention, there&#39;s a bill, I&#39;m going
to read the title to it that we&#39;re looking at adding. There&#39;s
three bills we&#39;re looking at adding. The Chair believes they are not
controversial, but just to let the members know, there&#39;s a bill,
I&#39;m going to give you the short title: House Bill 308, which is an
Act to Amend the Laws Pertaining to Medical Support and Health Insurance
Coverage Relating to Child Support to Align State Law with Federal
Guidelines That No Longer Include the Provision That Employer-Provided
Group Health Insurance Is Automatically Considered
&quot;Reasonable.&quot; This is a bill that passed out of Judiciary III,
was re-referred to the Committee on Insurance. It is the opinion of the
Chair that the bill does not need to go to Insurance, therefore the
Chair is going to strike the referral to Insurance and deem the bill
calendared but not necessarily for this evening. Is there objection to
the bill being added to this evening&#39;s calendar? Hearing none, so
ordered. For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland,
Representative Floyd, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Inquiry of the Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Or Representative Lewis. Would the Chair or Representative Lewis be
amenable to suspending the rules so we can go to after 10:00 to take up
all the bills?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We will not be here past 10:00. We only have three bills, so I
don&#39;t--we&#39;re going to be done shortly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is April 1, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m sorry? Oh, April first, thank you. You know, I&#39;ve been up
for long enough, I thought it was April 2nd by now, so. You got me that
time.
