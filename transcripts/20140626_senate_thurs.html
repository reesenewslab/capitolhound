Similar situation, and it has deteriorated and got worse, to the point
that that child has seizures two or three times a day. If this bill will
help address that issue, it’s got to be a good bill because I know that
family well, and I just know what they’re going through with their child
at this point. So I’d ask for you to support the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate. Senator Robinson, for what purpose do you
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have
the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank you Senator
Apodaca and others who support this. I too like Senator Brown had some
experiences a long time ago. My youngest brother had epileptic seizures
and those of you who remember back in the day when there was really no
treatment, you put a spoon in the person’s mouth, keep them from
swallowing their tongue, etc. And that’s just about all my parents could
do. And so the horror of parents not having alternatives is a terrible
thing, and so this bill moves us forward in research and I’m proud of
the fact that we have in North Carolina some of the best research
universities who can help us collect the data, look at the treatment,
see what’s working, and then move forward in terms of models that will
work across the country. So I’m certainly appreciative of the bill and I
support it, and commend it to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion
or debate. Hearing none, the question before the Senate is the passage
on second reading of the Senate Committee Substitute as amended to House
Bill 1220. All in favor will vote aye, all opposed will vote no. Five
seconds will be allowed for the voting. The clerk will record the vote.
Senator Davis, 45 having voted in the affirmative and none in the
negative, House Bill 1220 has passed its second reading and will without
objection be read a third time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] North Carolina General
Assembly enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there further discussion or
debate? Hearing none, the question before the Senate is the passage on
third reading of the Senate Committee Substitute as amended to House
Bill 1220. All in favor will say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] All opposed no. The ayes have it and House Bill 1220 has passed
its third reading. The amendment will be engrossed and the bill will be
sent to the House on the issue of concurrence. [PAUSE] Members, I
skipped over reports of standing committees. Are there any reports of
standing committees? Senator Davis, what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Send forth a committee report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Send forward
your report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. [PAUSE]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Davis of
state and local committee submits for passage House Bill 1059, Committee
Substitute number 2, unfavorable as to committee substitute but
favorable as to Senate Committee Substitute Bill titled an act to make
the larceny of Venus flytraps in Brunswick, Columbus, New Hanover, Oslo
and Pender Counties a felony, and to modify the New Hanover occupancy
tax. [SPEAKER CHANGES] As a sequential referral to finance. [PAUSE]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Member Senator Jenkins has submitted an excused
absence for the remainder of the session. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Pate, for what purpose do you rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A point of personal privilege out of order. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] You have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen, I
have been looking up into the gallery while we discussed this past bill,
and I suspect that there are some young parents up there with young
children who were very interested in seeing this bill go through. As
they make their way out, I would think it would be appropriate for us
because I believe there are some up there who probably are suffering
from this malady, and I want to salute them, and I think it would be
appropriate for the senate to salute them if they would be recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Pate and I don’t have any names but I think
you are correct. There are a number of children with primarily moms, it
looks like,</p>

we have some of the best medical research universities in the country so
what this bill does is allows our medical research universities to start
programs in order to help these children and to help them receive this
extract which is known as CBD we can get into the particulars of it but
the overall point is this is found to be very helpful to a lot of kids
where nothing else seems to help and with that being said I ask for your
support and I do need to send forth an amendment Mr president if I
might.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Send forward your amendment clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Happadonka moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Happadonka has the floor to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr president what this amendment does it just makes a minor
change to the statute to the bill right now the effective date is
October first of this bill but if DHHS adopts rules before then it will
allow the studies to start immediately upon the adoption of the rules so
I ask for your support on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Happadonka.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr president, what the bill does it gives legal protection to
families, doctors and patients who participate in these studies
conducted in our medical universities the [??] studies also give the
care givers the patients and neurologists registered with DHHS and
continually monitored to protect patient's safety we feel like this will
put North Carolina on the cutting edge of treating this type of epilepsy
so I'll be happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate, senator Davis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr president.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm sorry senator Richard [??].
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
See if senator Happadonka would deal for one question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Deal.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Happadonka just to be clear this is designed to be prescribed by
a physician as you've outlined in the bill..
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A neurologist.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A neurologist and distributed to that patient by that doctor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's correct now let me get with you on the distribution process here
it's a it cannot be given by a pharmacist because it's not on the
approved FDA drug list so yes the physician will have to assist the
families in obtaining this the exact method is there is one company that
does it on a website and it'll probably be that company.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I just a quick follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
and basically it's under the control of that physician.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes it is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate senator Davis what purpose [??].
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
to ask senator Happadonka a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Happadonka do you deal.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you senator my understanding is that this is gonna be dispensed
only through three hospitals in North Carolina is that correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir we added the fourth yesterday the BUNC chapel hill east Carolina
duke in wake forest.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Deal.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you my understanding also that this drug is in a fast track with
the FDA and they're in phase one clinical trials at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
and considering..
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
follow up thank you sir considering they're in FDA the phase one
clinical trials would you amenable to putting in a sunset to this bill
of about ten years the reason why I say that is because we do not know
what the side effects of this drug are and we won't know until these
clinical trials are complete so I'm kinda concerned that we would allow
this to be open ended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well senator like I said before we're back here every year and I think
this is something we're going to watch very carefully I mean I don't
really have a problem with it I don't know if it's that necessary
hopefully we'll be back but if you wanna present it that's fine.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis. President Pro tem seems to be geographically challenged

No more so than him recognizing Senator Tillman. (laughter) Mr.

Only want to know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Anyone interested in taking Senator Hartsell up on his
invitation? Is there further discussion or debate on Amendment one?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brock, what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] See if Senator Hartsell would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Glad to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do we normally do this, start adding people to boards?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We've actually done it on a couple of occasions over a
lengthy period of time, and the folks that are added to this board are
folks who have actually been elected to it. They just don’t take office
until December at the moment, and we’re simply adding this to kind of
correct a situation. And it has happened on a number of occasions
before, and we've added to school boards and other entities. In fact at
one time school boards in this state were elected by this General
Assembly by name.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate on Amendment one?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I mean it’s a local bill, but could you just give us
kind of a quick background of why we’re doing it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure, and I've had this conversation with Senator
Tucker and several other members of this body. We have a rather unique
situation that occurred in Cobarrus County at the time of the primary.
We had three groups, I mean two groups of three running against each
other. The two who lost ran on certain, representing one who was
appointed to the position, have sense that time sought to wreck havoc
with the budget of Cobarrus County. The folks who won want to straighten
it out, and I will say having seen the motion where they wrecked havoc,
there are more lawsuits associated with that motion and those
circumstances than you can imagine. Personnel, contract, actually even a

that, in the short term, so that kind of issue can be addressed very
quickly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate on Amendment one? Senator
Tucker, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentleman of the Senate, the original bill
was from my area, and Senator Hartsell came and talked to me about
adding this Amendment on. Last time I had a Union county bill we added
on Nash and Gaston. It’s slowed the train down and, of course, Senator
Hartsell assured me that this wouldn't slow this down, and I’m here now
to acknowledge to the Senate and to my peers that I made a freshman
mistake. But I favor his amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there further discussion or debate on Amendment
One? Hearing none. The question before the Senate the passage of
Amendment one House Bill 1218. All in favor will vote aye. All opposed
will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. The clerk
will record the vote. Senator Clark. No. Thirty-nine having voted in the
affirmative and six in the negative. Amendment one passes and the bill
is back before you. Is there further discussion or debate on third
reading as amended of House Bill 1218? Hearing none. The question before
the Senate is the passage on third reading House Bill 1218. All in favor
will vote aye. All opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed
for the voting. The clerk will record the vote. Senator Van Duyn. Aye.
Forty-two having voted in the affirmative and three in the negative.
House bill 1218 passes its third reading. The amendment will be
engrossed, and the bill will be sent to the House on the issue of
concurrents in the Senate amendment. It is my understanding that the
amendment will not be engrossed. Public bill third reading roll call.
House Bill 1139, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] House Bill 1139, state natural and historical
preservation as in ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Who is handling this bill? Senator Brock, I have you
as handling this bill. Senator Brock’s recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister President. Started reading. We
haven’t changed it from yesterday. This is just adding the land from to
the North Carolina Park system. We haven’t ran this bill</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. This bill...we had a companion bill in the
Senate and it passed two committees, but the House bill got over first.
What the bill does is allow the general assembly to establish different
utility regulatory fee for the retail services of telecommunications
providers that have elected to be regulated under the statute and will
set those rates for the '15-'16 fiscal year as a consensus bill. I know
a vote, no opposition.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodoca is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members, this is our annual UNC bill with
capital projects funded from other sources other than the state of North
Carolina. I'll be happy to answer any questions. I would like to call
your attention to one quick thing, if I might. Page 2 of the bill, line
5, has Western Carolina University, Brown cafeteria renovation - I think
it should be said that's where I met Mrs. Apodoca and it hasn't...so
far, it hasn't cost $22 million to keep her up and renovate, so thank
you, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. To speak briefly on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
These are projects that are approved by the board of governors. They're
basically from student fees and other non-appropriated funds. However,
these gifts...these fees are many times matched by private dollars so
they can piggy-back and do these projects, basically for the benefits of
the students. Things they use for student recreation, dining halls, etc.
These are very worthwhile projects. Appreciate your support.

Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, for what purpose do you rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yesterday...to debate the bill, excuse me.

Yesterday, during finance, we did ask some questions regarding this and
to be sure that there was absolutely no unforeseen liabilities to the
state of North Carolina, and everybody was assured that, that was indeed
the fact. As an aside, Mr. President, I did speak with Mrs. Apodoca and
she said it was a very dark day up there when she met Tom Apodoca.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodoca, you indicated at the beginning of the session that you
were wanting to go home, are you sure you don't want to reconsider that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, yes, I was thinking about staying this weekend. We might want
to reschedule bills this weekend, but no, I better go home and take my
punishment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chair has it on pretty good authority that Mrs. Apodoca doesn't listen
to the Senate debates.

will remain on the calendar. House Bill 267, the clerk will read.
Speaker Changes: House Bill 267, Captive Insurance Amendments.
Speaker Changes: Senator Apodaca is recognized.
Speaker Changes: Mr. President, I promise this is the last bill I'm
presenting today. House Bill 267 is brought to us by the Department of
Insurance. It's an agency bill dealing with the captive insurers, which
we approved last year. It does four basic things.: clarifies the
independent audit requirements, simplifies the deposit requirements,
provides forth formation of additional types of captives, and makes
other technical changes which are not substantial. That's basically what
it does. The Agency Bill deficits the Captive Insurance Company which
seems to be working out well. Revenue the state's already exceeded
500,000 dollars, and we've got more captives moving in. I recommend your
support.
Speaker Changes: Further discussion or debate? Hearing on the question

Bill 267 on its second reading. All in favor will vote aye. All opposed
will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. The clerk

Substitute House Bill 267. All in favor will say aye. All opposed no.
The ayes have it, and House Bill 267 has passed its third reading and
will be returned to the House on the issue of concurrence in the Senate
Committed Substitute. House Bill 366. The clerk will read.
Speaker Changes: House Bill 366, North Carolina Form Act of 2014.
Speaker Changes: Senator Jackson is recognized.
Speaker Changes: Thank you, Mr. President. Before I get into explaining
the bill, I have an amendment to send forth and it should be on the
dashboard.
Speaker Changes: Send forth your amendment. The clerk will read.
Speaker Changes: Senator Jackson moves to amend the bill.
Speaker Changes: Senator Jackson is recognized to explain the amendment.
Speaker Changes: Thank you, Mr. President. This is just sort of a
clarifying error that we omitted under section number one, and this
basically just states, if when deanor finds that there is something
wrong or a violation has been committed, they can make this information
public, and I would ask for your support.
Speaker Changes: Further discussion or debate on Amendment One? Hearing
on question for the Senate on passage of Amendment One to House Bill
366. All in favor will vote aye. All opposed will vote no. Five seconds
will be allowed for the voting. The clerk will record the vote. [pause]
Apodaca, Aye. [pause] Forty-three having voted in the affirmative and
none in the negative, Amendment One passes and the Bill is back before
you. Is there further discussion or debate?
Speaker Changes: ??
Speaker Changes: Senator Jackson you have the floor.
Speaker Changes: Thank you, sir. To explain the bill, Section One
basically allows that when someone makes a complaint that the deanor on
different things, whether it be water quality or whether it be waste
industries or whatever, that they have the opportunity to look at it and
keep it confidential. If it is frivolous, it will move no further, but
if it is not our amendment just corrected that and it will make it
public for violations. Second number two is the authority of local
government to adopt ordinances related to fertilizer. The League, Thumb
Bureau and Department of Agriculture has created this language that will
give uniformity to regulation fertilizer all across the state so that we
don't have bits and pockets all across the states changing regulations.
Section number three rewrites the landscape contractors licensing
statute. This will support our multi-billion dollar green industry by
allowing them to create a voluntary licensing board that the industry
has been working on for almost a decade. Basically, what this will do is
allow the industry to create their own commission. I fully ask for your
support on this. Section number four is the steady participation in the
Commercial Vehicle Safety Allowance North American Standard
Inspection...</p>

<p id="45:00">
Basically what this does is ask our highway patrol to look into working
more closely with this federal program that they actually have in place,
which a semi or tractor trailer has been inspected that they get a
sticker. And that’s what happens in most of our surrounding states and
they get a pass from being inspected again in the next day or so. So
this sort of gives them an exemption there, and we have that program but
it’s never been implemented very well. So we’re asking them to look into
doing that. It’s more or less a study. Section number 5 will basically
clarify the meaning of the terms planting and harvest season. This is
another federal program that we’re trying, that is in place in our
surrounding states and it defines planting and harvest seasons as
January 1 through December 31. Section number 6 amends the chairmanship
of the agriculture and forestry awareness study commission. It allows
the speaker of the House and the senate pro tempore to pick the two
members to chair the existing agriculture and forestry study awareness
commission. Section number 7 allows commission of agriculture to appoint
law enforcement officers to carry out law enforcement responsibilities
of the department of agriculture and this was sort of vetted through the
sheriffs association and it was  agreed upon that the forestry estate
fair personnel would get the same training and have the same authority.
Section number 8 is pesticide use for moles. This language came from the
department of agriculture and the wildlife commission, and they are both
okay with this. It brings our laws in the state with federally
registered labelling requirements. Section number 9 adds agriculture
facilities to the first degree trespass. It amends the statute for first
degree trespass to provide that trespassing in an agriculture facility
is a first degree trespass, punishable as a class A1 misdemeanor. With
most of our food source starting at the farms, we felt like this was a
good idea and this is something other states have started to adopt in
reference to our food security. Bear with me just one moment. Section
number 10 requires written consent to operate all-terrain vehicles on
private property. I don’t think that needs much explanation. Section
number 11 allows drainage districts to maintain ditches in buffer zones.
This clarifies in statute that drainage districts are exempted from the
buffer rules for the explicit purpose of enacting their authority and
that authority includes the construction, operation, maintenance, repair
of canals, water retardant structures or other improvements that are
under the control and supervision of the board of drainage
commissioners. Section number 12 is periodic inspections. Those taking
advantage of the federal housing finance authority program receive an
extensive annual federal inspection that goes over all aspects of the
home to make sure the owner is providing the proper safety and comfort
needs. They passed three tests on this already and if they get their
annual tests and they pass they basically do not have to do that again
for one year. In section 13, requires the building code council to amend
the building code council such that security grills are permitted at all
exits if the grills may be opened from the inside during periods when
the building is occupied by authorized persons and remain open when the
building is occupied by the general public. And section 14 is just the
effective date and basically I would like to thank my co-sponsor Senator
Bingham and Senator Brock on this and also staff, and I would appreciate
your support and would be glad to answer any questions. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Further discussion or debate. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Meredith, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, I’d like to respectfully request,
dependent on Senate Bill 9 excuse from the voting on this. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I believe the clerk has your paperwork. Senator Stein, for what
purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Senator Jackson will
yield for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jackson, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. Senator Jackson. I appreciated the
earlier amendment. On the section I think it was section 12, dealing
with the housing finance agency. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I was unaware that the housing financing agency did inspections
along the sort that a building inspector would do to make sure that the
building was built to code and wouldn’t create any health or safety
issues. Has the housing finance agency signed off on this language, do
you know? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. Senator Stein, I’m not for
sure this was brought to us and from my understanding everyone had
signed off on it, to my understanding. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up

it because it is sort of time sensitive, but it's because it's got to go

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate on House Bill 366. Senator Jackson, what
purpose do you rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Send forward your amendment, clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I thank the sponsors for this bill I'm planning on supporting this
bill...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hold on just a second, let the clerk read the amendment in.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson has the floor to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Mr. President. Again, I thank the sponsors for this bill. I
plan on supporting this bill regardless of whether or not this amendment
prevails. This amendment concerns a very small portion of section 10 of
this bill that deals with the ATVs, the all terrain vehicles, what we
would speak to commonly as four-wheelers. Basically the section does two
things in this law: It requires that a kid who wants to ride a
four-wheeler not only get verbal permission, but actually written
permission from the land-owner, which is fair and good. The other thing
it does is it lowers the standard of care, the duty of care that that
land-owner has currently to that kid who wants to ride a four-wheeler on
the farm. Right now, you have a duty of care to advise someone who comes
on your property with your permission, of any open and obvious hazards,
like barbed-wire, or cliffs, or something else that might hurt a kid
who's riding on a four-wheeler. Now what this bill does, is it...on the
one hand, raises the burden on that kid to not only get permission, but
written permission. On the other hand it lowers the protection owed to
that kid by saying that even with written permission...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
...for purposes of the duty of care, I think that puts that kid in a
little more danger. I think that if a kid comes to your property and
says, &quot;Sir, I'm here to do the right thing. Here's a little piece
of writing that gives me permission to ride on your property, will you
let me?&quot; That land-owner should have the duty, as he does under the
law right now to say, &quot;Sure you can, kid, but just so you know,
look out for the following things on my property.&quot;  That's the way
the law works now. That you have a basic duty of care to that kid. This
law raises the standard for that kid while lowering the protection for
him and that's a concern.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, for what purpose do you rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you do what Senator Jackson proposes, you own a piece of land, it may
be 35, 50 miles away, it may 500 miles away, you now got to get written
permission, that's a good thing, we've added that. But if you want a
legal quagmire, you warn him about a rock here and a cliff there and a
creek over here and you don't warn him about this big oak tree limb
that's growing out over your field and he runs into it, lawyers will
have a field day with that. If they want to ride a four-wheeler on my
property, they've got to have my written permission. I'm really good
with that. However, if I fail to warn him or my wife fails to warn him,
as we're both property owners, you're opening yourself for a whole good
bag of legal problems. For that reason, I feel like we ought to defeat
this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis, for what purpose do you rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. I think that Senator Jackson has good
intentions with this bill, but what concerns me as a dirt-bike rider
myself, if these places to ride are becoming fewer and fewer. If a kid
wants to come on my property and ride, I should be able to tell him you
can ride, and tell his parent, you can ride, but ride at your own risk.
If we put all these legal requirements on, then I'm not going to let you
ride on my property because you can sue me for just about anything. For
that reason, I would ask that you would defeat this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate on Amendment 2. Senator Jackson, for what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. I would ask that you do defeat this. This was
brought up in our Agricultural Committee and Senator Davis is right.
It's going to get to the point that sooner or later land-owners will not
allow you on there at all. This does give the land-owners a little
greater protection, but at the same it allows youth and adults, as we
just found out, to ride bikes and four-wheelers on our private property,
so I would ask that you defeat this amendment.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. I understand what Senator
Jackson is trying to do and I understand what Senator Jackson is trying
to do.
[laughter]
That's something I only attempt at humor for this moment.
[laughter]
The one thing I heard that I think this body should consider when
considering Senator Jackson's amendment, which candidly I think he
misstated what the law of North Carolina is as it relates to the duty of
a landowner. The duty of a landowner doesn't have any obligation to warn
other than of hidden dangers that he or she knows about. If you have a
bear trap 10 feet deep that's covered up for the tiger or whatever that
nobody can see that's what he's got a duty to warn on. He doesn't have a
duty to say there's a cliff over there or there might be a fallen tree
across a path. Practicing a lot of personal injury and premises
liability, I'm pretty sure that's what the landowner's duty is.
A trespasser, on the other hand, a landowner has absolutely no duty to
whatsoever. I just want this body to be educated clearly, in my opinion,
about what the law of this state is before you vote on this amendment.
Thank you.

increase fees and I've been practicing, I think, 30 years now and I
don't know any fee that's ever gone up in that 30 years. So they've
come, actually they came to Senator Rabin and I and we talked about it.
I think maybe after 30 years we should let them...</p>

recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President, members of the
Senate. This bill is the culmination of a PED study plus a work group of
which Senator Bingham served among others, and is actually the result of
about 19 years worth of work to straighten out the workers comp and
pension funds for volunteer firemen, but we discovered a number of, I
hesitate to use the word “irregularities” but there were some, and we’re
trying to get this straight, get them in a solvent position. This has
been thoroughly vetted in any number of quarters. I’ll be glad to try to
go into the specific details but I’m… well if you want them I’m glad to
give them to you, but I would just say that it’s the product of a lot of
work. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the

Speaker Changes: Mr. President?
Speaker Changes: Senator Brock, for what purpose do you arise?
Speaker Changes: I need to change my vote on both the amendment and the
final vote on House Bill 1218 from aye to no.
Speaker Changes: House Bill 1218 the amendment of Senator Brock from aye
to no. The amendment passes thirty-seven to eight. Senator Brock on
House Bill 1218 on third reading aye to no. The vote is forty-one to

read.
Speaker Changes: Senate Bill 58 clarifies Statute of Repose.
Speaker Changes: Senator Goolsby's recognized.
Speaker Changes: Thank you, Mr. President. This is a motion to concur.
We've dealt with this legislation last week and this is a technical
correction's bill to the recent clarification of our North Carolina
Statute of Repose. It makes absolutely clear that the original intent of
the Statute of Repose was never to affect claims surrounding linent
diseases or ground water contamination. It also clarifies how the
previous bill affects current cases and makes it clear that these
changes do not affect actual product liability cases. With the changes
we're once again attempting to make sure that an unclear statute from
1979 does not stop citizens in places like Asheville and Camp LeJeune
from having their day in court. Would appreciate your support of the
technical bill.
Speaker Changes: Further discussion or debate? Hearing on the question
of the Senate is the passing, I'm sorry, is the motion to concur in the
House Committee Substitute to Senate Bill 58. All in favor of the motion
will vote aye. All opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed
for the voting. The clerk will record the vote. [pause]  Forty-four

Speaker Changes: I wish to be recorded as voting aye. Sorry.
Speaker Changes: Woodard aye. Forty-five voted in the affirmative and
none in the negative. The motion passes and the bill will be enrolled
and sent to the gov. [pause] Members, this being Thursday, we want to
recognize and thank our pages for their service this week, Pages Week.
We appreciate your willingness to come and spend a week at the General
Assembly in the Senate. I hope you've had an enjoyable week, and we

announcements? Are there any notices or announcements? Is there further
business to come before the Senate? If not, the chair recognizes Senator
Pate for a motion.

adjourn, subject to messages from the governor, the introduction,
referral and re-referral of bills and resolutions, the receipt and
re-referral of committee reports, ratification of bills and the
