Ends of the students. There's no curriculum development. Most of the
teachers were pulled out during this past school year for two week with
substitutes coming int o fill in, for two weeks so they could attend
training about what to even do with the iPads. And my son is sitting
there all day long and my wife and I battle with it all the time, they
sit there in class all day long playing games because there's no control
over what's on the iPad and half the teachers taken them up and they sit
in a shelf during individual classes because teachers don't know what to
do with them anyway. So I want to comment, I mean that's just an
anecdotal example. I want to comment we really need to push hard to have
this competency and make sure that the appropriate plans and
competencies are developed and so I really think we're moving in the
right direction and I move for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] At the proper time we'll take that motion, we'll hold
it for a moment. And you're exactly right, we're trying to get the cart
- we had it in front of the horse, we're trying to get the horse back in
front of the cart. Thank you. Senator Pate, mayor Pate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, for those of you who ave
doubts about the digital age and how it can apply to education of our
children I would like to invite any of you and all of you to go down to
Lenore county, to Kingston, there is a stem middle school there and the
way they teach math they have their room set up like an office and
children go in and work collaboratively in pairs and work on their math
in front of computers and a teacher, a well trained teacher, is right
there to help them out if they have any problems. They do a wonderful
job and it's almost worth a field trip for us to go down there to take a
look and see what they do. It's really eye opening and they do an
excellent job.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for that comment Senator Pate. Senator
Davis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just wanted to add here in Green county as Senator
Pate also understands, we're able to implement a program, a laptop
program from all the students from 6th grade all the way to the 12th,
and actually we're if not in the 10th year of this we're getting very
close to it. And I can tell you having lived through that that this
effort would have paid tremendous dividends on the front end of that.
You know, what Senator Newton suggested earlier is right on track and
that's why I signed onto this and I think it's an awesome bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator Davis. Senator Robinson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair, and I want to echo that too
because Guilford county even though we've got the superintendent from
Mecklenberg, they didn't use him. So we've done some phenomenal things
in Guilford county and with the stem programs both in terms of early
college as well as the middle college but also - and if some of you did
not attend the Hunt Institute at the beginning of the year, and I see
Representative Johnson nodding her head. If you didn't attend it then
you may not understand the real application of this in terms of the
presenters who were there, who talked about how we really use digital
learning in terms of enhancing academic performance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator. Senator Barringer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. I'd like to make a comment too
from the university standpoint. I see - this is very much needed to know
what digital learning can and cannot do. I have students coming to my
classroom now that cannot speak well, they cannot communicate with
others, and I think it's because they have used technology
inappropriately as a crutch as something between them and other people.
And so any kind of training that we can give to our teachers and
educators to explain to them how it enhances educaiton but it's not the
be all end all to educaiton I think is well worth our investment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you senator. Seeing no other hands we have a
motion from Senator Newton for a favorable report. All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any opposed no. The aye's have it. And here's what we
have, now I'm going to read this and make sure that senator Stein is
happy. The motion is for a favorable report to the bill as amended
rolled into a committee substitute with a favorable report to committee
substitute, unfavorable report to the original bill. That's what we've
got and that's what you approved. Now there's got to be a better way of
saying that and I always said favorable as to the bill as amended. And
you...</p>

stop all that lawyer talk, Josh. But anyway, I guess I'll read it like
it is there. I want to thank Senator Soucek, too, he graciously backed
up and said, &quot;Look, let's work with the House and let them have
these bills first,&quot; because he had a chance, because I was going to
just go ahead and let him do it. He graciously stepped back. He's not
worried about whether his name is on that bill or somebody else's and
that's rare in this body. There's a lot of ownership and pride in bills
and so forth. Thank you, Senator, go ahead with your next bill, which is
House Bill 44.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I really appreciate the comments we heard on
that last bill because I think we're all moving along the same lines and
understanding the complexity of how valuable the technology is and how
useless or even harmful it can be if not used well. So that's the type
of vision I think is really critical as we move forward. And one of the
things with this bill that I think is critical as it looked at school
systems that are doing it well and school systems that weren't doing it
well, I saw an element in Mooresville where you had tremendous
leadership and buy-in from several sectors of the educational community;
the superintendent, having teachers buy-in, the principal buy-in, and
the community and the families buy-in, and it was a real important
dynamic that we saw graduation rates from in the 100's when you look at
the rank of the 115 LEA's, way past 100 to top 5 and when we see that
type of graduation improvement you want to look at the system they're
doing and I saw that in Mooresville. So this next bill is really along
the lines of continuing to show our intent, the importance of this,
getting as many people to buy in and start catching the vision and
working together towards it because what this really does is this really
just shows the intent of the General Assembly that we're going to be
moving towards funding. Textbook funding is going to be able to be used
for a digital learning environment for digital equipment, for digital
materials and instructional resources. This doesn't have any immediate
financial implications but it does have some very visionary ideas of
where we intend to go and I think that's part of moving us in this
direction, is everyone understands how we're going to go there and where
w'ere going and then people will start jumping on board and contributing
without us specifically directing them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well said, Senator. At this time I see if we have, we've got a motion
over here for a favorable, let's hold that for a minute, see if there
are any comments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just to understand the words, in section 1 at the bottom of page 1,
lines 32 and 33, it goes, &quot;We're transitioning from textbooks, both
traditional and digital,&quot; so those transition for funding for
digital textbooks, in other words to funding for digital materials,
including textbooks, so what's a &quot;digital material text,&quot; what
is the difference between a digital textbook, from which we are
transitioning, to a &quot;digital material textbook?&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You looking to staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm asking that to staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff might have a more specific answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, C.R. Gruptie or, I believe Gruptie is going to take that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think, and I'll have the folks that staff the Digital Learning
Commission weigh in on this, I think it's other digital resources, but
I'm not quite following. Funding for digital materials, including
textbooks and instructional resources, so to broaden the category is the
way I understood it was to be read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, part of our intentions here were to realize that when you go from
a textbook to a digital environment it's not printed material here to
digital material there. You may have some of that, where you actually
got the material from a textbook on a computer but the interactive
learning environment goes beyond the traditional definition of a paper
textbook and so we're trying to create the digital environment and that
was our intent of that and I'm hoping that that's what the language was
supporting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate Senator Stein's question. I think
that, from my understanding, and I didn't sit on this committee but just
my understanding to broaden it, you could be talking about a video of a
lesson of a certain type of experiment or mathematical problem from,
say, a teacher somewhere else at the school math and science, for
example, it could, something broader than just a textbook.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator. I think you're right there. Let's see, Senator
Robinson, I believe I saw your hand first.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, and I didn't sit on the committee either but I go back to the Hunt
Institute</p>

I do not want us to be in a position ten years from now where we've
completely gotten rid of the novels and other paper books and we're
having to legislation a little bit like the cursive writing being gone.
There's some skill sets that still need to be developed based on paper
and pencil. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Barringer, I'm glad to hear you
say that. My grand kids will crawl up in my lap and read a book. If I've
got an ipad over there, which they won't, haven't seen me with much, but
my wife particularly, if she's got an ipad there reading a story,
they're going to come to papa and bring me a book. You're never going to
get away from that. Good books you've got to have in homes and the
schools. All over. You need the shelves full of them. And nothing is
going to replace the teacher. The most effective tool you'll ever have
is a knowledgeable, caring teacher in a classroom. So, don't give me
total virtual ever in my lifetime and say that's going to do the whole
trick. It ain’t gonna do it and I think we all know that. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] And that's a great point because one of the things I noticed in
Mooresville, which is doing incredibly well, is they had twenty-first
century technology here and sitting next to them they had sixth century
technology. They had a paper and pencil. It could have been a little
chalk tablet and a piece of chalk. That type of technology, but what it
was is they were blending it because they realize one thing can't do
everything. Technology was maybe eighty percent but the need for balance
was something that was even incorporated in the most successful school,
so that's a point worth noting. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Keep in mind, this
bill doesn't force anything. It just sets a pathway and it's an intent
bill. But, the intent is good and we have a motion for a federal report.
Any discussion? All in favor, aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Any opposed? The bill passes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman,
if I may. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You gonna run those on the floor? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If I might have
one final comment? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I wanted to
acknowledge Senators Hise and Rucho for their co-sponsorship of this
legislation as well as the members of the digital learning commission.
The committee that we move forward with and their participation in and
everyone who is participating in different avenues. So, thank you for
this and I think this is a great direction for our state in education.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator. Job well done. Committee, thank you
very much and we are dismissed. [end]</p>
