their seats. Members and guests of the gallery will please silence all
electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayers Reverend Peter Milner,
Senate Chaplain. All members and guests in the gallery will please

by wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established. By
knowledge the rooms are filled, with all precious and pleasant riches. A
wise man is full of strength, and a man of knowledge enhances his
mights. For by wise guidance you can wage your war, and in abundance of
counselors there is victory. Wisdom is too high for a fool, in the gate
he does not open his mouth. So Lord we make this prayer, that we would
be wise. In Christ's name we pray, Amen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator

House Bill 870, “An Act to decrease the Duplin County Board of Education
and the Board of Commissioners of Duplin County to a five-member board,
to establish revised districts for those boards and to confirm the
redistricting requirements following each Federal census applied to
those boards.”
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. Members, this Bill basically does exactly what
the title just says. It takes it form a six-member board of education
and six-member commissioner to a five.
This is a plan that was proposed several years ago by the NAACP and that
the NAACP consented to a Federal order to accept an alternative sixth
district proposed by the then existing boards with two of the six being
majority minority. Two of these will still stay majority minority.
This Bill proposes to not only maintain the intent of the consent order
but also enhance the ratio of the minority districts from two of the six
to two of the five. This Bill also achieves the desired advantage of
odd-number boards and I ask for you support and would be glad to answer
any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis has the floor to speak to the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, just so you know,
Duplin is right down the street from me, as a matter of fact, several of
the members are part of my Wayne County delegation and I know the people
very well in this community.
I would simply say that there appears to be no problems with the map on
the surface, there were just some question in terms of disseminating
some of the information and I would share that in speaking with the
Bill’s sponsor, there’s been a commitment made to keep this moving
forward and they would share that information as soon as possible. So I
do ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein has the floor to speak to the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I think this is an instructive process. It’s clear that what
we’ve had here is that officials, both Democratic and Republican, have
sat together to work out how to set up these school districts. They’ve
involved all members of the community. You look at this map and it’s a
good-looking map.
You can see that it keeps the towns together, Magnolia, Rose Hill,
Teachey, Wallace, Beulaville, they’re all kept in the integrity of a
single district. You look at these districts, they’re relatively
compact.
This is the right outcome from the right process, and to show how good
it is all you have to do is look at this map. This is the school
districts for Wake County. There’s absolutely nothing that’s compact…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, Gentleman, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’re not on the Wake County redistricting Bill. I would ask that you
rule that he stay on the Bill at hand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, keep your remarks to this Bill, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will keep my remarks to this Bill and the way that I’m complimenting
this Bill is to contrast it and show what a good map this is by showing
what a terrible map this is. So I encourage you all to support this
bill. I ask for your support. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He’s doing it again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do we have any further discussion or debate? Is there any further
discussion or debate? OK, Senators, because this is a redistricting bill
we are going to have two electronic votes on this.
So, if there’s no further discussion or debate the question before the
Senate is the passage of the Senate Committee substitute to House Bill
870 on its second reading. All in favor vote, “Aye.” Opposed will vote,
“No.” Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. Clerk will record the

[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Tillman moved to amend a bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Tillman is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I believe it's on your, Senator iii, you've got it.  I
believe you'll find this amendment is not material to the bill, it
simply comports some omissions that are technical, to conform to our tax
law that was just passed.  And that's basically what it does. there's no
fiscal impact in the bill as the revenue folks have told us.  And
basically it's technical in nature.  I'd be glad to explain anything
that you would like.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Apodaca you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]House Bill 14, we did a few moments ago, it needs to go
back by special messenger.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]So ordered. Senator Clodfelter is recognized to explain
the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. President.  We had a good full discussion
on this bill yesterday in the Senate Finance.  The gist of what it does
is put some teeth into the 9 month deadline that the DOR has to process
refund claims, or clear up protests of additional assessments.  It has a
number of procedural changes of how the Department of Revenue handles
those refund claims, and I'm sure Senator Tucker will be glad to answer
any detailed technical questions you have about the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Do we have any discussion or debate?  Senator Canard,
for what [SPEAKER CHANGES]purpose do you arise?
To ask Senator Clodfelter a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Clodfelter, will you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I've actually had some difficulties that constituents
had with the Department of Revenue, that were pretty serious, and we
were able to clear up.  But one of the problems when I was trying to do
that, is they very much under staffed.  and I'm just wondering, is this
going to put more pressure on them when they're already under-staffed,
to try to get these through, and make the errors that were serious
errors that they made because they're so under-staffed and so rushed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Canard, one of the things that Senator Tucker
and I learned when we worked with the department on the bill, was that
they have made a great advance in.</p>

The recent months in clearing out the backlog of refund requests and
assessments that they were carrying from the prior years we felt very
comfortable in fact about the steps that the secretary has take to clear
out that backlog and now things are pretty current. What the bill is
trying to do is to assist the department and the tax payer both in the
future. So, we don’t accumulate that kind of backlog again in the
future.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kennard has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think one of the problems in our state has been in our national are
rest so we really do under staff these departments that provide a
tremendous service and I would hope that the budget riders would keep
that in mind that this is a service agency and it should be for the
staff so that they can respond. So, that’s my request to the budget
riders and I certainly appreciate that this will make a difference in
the service to our constituents, thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 269: Children with Disabilities Scholarship Grants.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This legislation has been in the works for sometime and what it does it
makes available $3000 scholarship per child per semester with those
children with disabilities and this is necessary because in our tax law
we have repealing that the tax credit that these parents have been
getting so this would replace that and will provide a setting other than
the public school, if the public school is not meeting the needs of some
of the special children this would allow them to find the school that
would best meet their need. I would be glad to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any discussion or debate? Senator Barringer what purpose you
have?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barringer has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As I said in the committee on yesterday as a foster parent I saw a
number of situations such as severe dyslexia, speech impediments, severe
ADD that it just wasn’t the infrastructure in the public school to
handle these and I also want to add that it also allows folks who would
not have otherwise been to get a tax credit to actually apply for a
scholarship. So, with that I do support the bill I think it’s a good
idea.

House Bill 565: Amend Real Estate Appraisers' Laws/Fees.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 565: Amend Real Estate Appraisers' Laws/Fees. It accomplishes
really three things, first the bill will bring North Carolina law in the
compliance with Federal Law in regards to appraisers’ licensing just for
added information there is a clause in our legislation that says that
the current appraisers’ will be grandfathered into this bill and quite a
long this time permits. Second there has been a problem…

...in the past three years with national appraiser management companies
going bankrupt leaving millions of dollars of unpaid appraisals. What
the Bill does is set aside some dollars in these management funds so
that it protects small business.
The appraisers who go out and do all the work end up losing money when
one of the AMCs goes bankrupt. This puts them in a more protected
position and helps them to survive through the tougher times.
Lastly the Bill authorizes a study related to the advisability of
establishing a permanent fund to protect those appraisers. It’s just one
of the idiosyncratic behaviors of that particular business of moving the
money from one group to another that causes the appraisers to come out.
This Bill fixes that and puts us in concert with the law. I recommend
your approval of the Bill. Thank you.

Is there any discussion or debate.  Senator pate, for what purpose your
ayes?
[Speaker changes]
Thank you Mr. President.  To speak briefly on the bill.
[Speaker changes]
Senator Pate has the floor.
[Speaker changes]
Ladies and gentlemen, the Pitt county delegation has met several times
in the past couple of weeks to try to work our way through the Pitt
county board of education.  Pitt county has 12 members on their board of
education and they serve six year terms.  They are elected six months
before they assume their office and they've been that way for over 20
years.  There's been a lot of talk within the county and especially a
lot of talk within this delegation to make some changes.  Back in the
2011 session, I was able to get a bill through that would affect it, but
it did not get pre-clearance and so we are back at the drawing table
once again.  Senator Davis and I have been working with the house
members of this delegation and it has been a lot of blood, sweat, and
tears, but I think we have finally come up with something that will work
to help mend a divided county.  So I hope that you will be able to
support the bill and Mr. President, if you would, I'd like to have you
recognize Senator Don Davis for some remarks and an amendment.
[Speaker changes]
Senator Davis is recognized.
[Speaker changes]
Thanks Mr. President.  To members of the Senate, I can tell you, you
know what it's like to pour over the issues, very complex issues and
this is one for our local community.  We were dealing with this 5 years
ago and Senator Pate continued it long afterwards and once again now
it's before us.  I want to simply say...</p>

I really commend our delegation for the hours of work that’s gone into
it. This issue, back at home, talking to residents, as well as pouring
over these issues with each other. So I start with a compliment and
thank you Senator Pate for all of your input and everything that went to
the table.  What I’d like to do is send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator you can send forth your amendment, clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis of Green moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis is recognized to explain the amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks, Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen what you see before you is
an amendment that actually accomplishes three major objectives for our
community. Number one, what it does is reduces the board from 12 to 9.
And there’s not a problem withstanding full support of that.  The other
thing it accomplishes, it preserves in the past the concerns that were
raised that were Section 2 related. It resolves that. For those southern
?? and justice they were very involved in helping us with those maps.
We’ve protect the minority voice. And the third component of this is, we
also realized the rule of urban nature and I think we’re really able to
come up with a scenario that addresses that concern while maintaining
common communities of interest. So what you see are the elements
outlined in this bill that accomplishes these major functions and then
the final, and that leads to the maps that’s before you on your desk.
And the other courts said this, that we agreed as a delegation, would be
to hit the reset button. We would all, everyone would be reelected in
2016 and from there we would trigger based on the election results, the
staggered terms. And again this is not just the work, myself, but this
is actually the work of our complete delegation working together,
conceding some points and working through and maintaining, I think, all
of our values in the end, therefore, I commend this to you and as for
your support on behalf of our delegation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Obviously this is not a perfect amendment, it is not the perfect answer
to what I see as a problem over in Pitt county, I think what we all
realize is a problem. But this is a start, ladies and gentlemen and it’s
the best this delegation could do at the present time and I would ask
for your support of this amendment and support for the bill. Thank you
very much
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate on the amendment? Hearing
none, the question before the Senate is the passage of Amendment 1, all
in favor will vote aye, oppose the vote, no. Five seconds will be
allowed for the voting, clerk will record the vote. Bryant. Senator
Bryant. Aye. 44 having voted in the affirmative, and 0 in the negative.
Amendment 1 is adopted, the Bill as amended is back before the body.
Senator Blust is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President.  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, I want to
commend Senators Pate and Senators, Senator Davis for working together
on this because they really showed that on fundamental matters you can
cross party lines to fix issues that affect our specific areas.  I
thought that Senator Pate used a telling phrase. He said that work
together to mend a divided county. And I think that that statement has
so much more meaning than working separately to divide a mended county.
And so we’ve seen two maps come through here today where people worked
collectively and together, and you got them pulling in the same
direction.  I certainly encourage others to work in this spirit, as
redistricting issues come up whether it’s this session or whether it’s
next session. . Because having been involved when both situations have
occurred, that is, people working together and people not working
together, I assure you it makes for a much better operation of our
school</p>

Thank you Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen usually during a long

events that are momentous. In this long session so far we have been able

In the same hospital on the same day and he declares that we were side
by side in the maternity room at the same time.  Now I’m still trying to
figure that one out and check that out but that may be a very real
possibility. The other momentous occasion is today we celebrate the
birthday of another member in this chamber. And it just so happens to be
my beautiful and talented seat mate, and Trudy Wade, but there is one
point that I would like to bring up and this was something that happened
in J1 this morning when someone asked what her answer was.  And the
answer she gave I have since then asked ur Research Department to check
into this. To see if the age she gave was her real age.  But anyways, I
would like to ask you to join with me in wishing Senator Wade a very
