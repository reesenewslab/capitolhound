Meeting will come to order, please. Before we get started, lets welcome
our pages. Darrin Evans from Lanore, welcome Senator Soucek, Davis
Jones, Senator Berger, Jack Hammel, Jack Lohill, Senator Foushee,
welcome. Benjamin [inaudible], Senator Berger, Jordan Boyd from the
foothills, Senator Hise. Is it still snowing up there? You still got
snow on the ground up there? Damn. What time does the sun rise? What
time does the sun rise up there in the mountains? Good. Good. An hour
later. Okay. Abigail Eisenhower, Senator McLaurin, welcome. Emily
Witherspoon, Senator Rucho, Elaine Hickman, Senator Walters.
[Speaker Change]
Approclomate. Our . . .
[Speaker Change]
Sorry, but I honestly have to do this to you. Wilson, Donna Blake, Hal
Roach, Isaac Walker, and Billy Fritzer, thank you for what you do.
Members, we are going to take amendments today on Senate Bill 744, those
amendments must be in by 1:30. So, if you plan to send forth any
amendments, please have them here by 1:30. We will have some public
comment today, when that time comes we will call you to the back of the
room and we will give each person a couple of minutes, two minutes to
talk. So, lets get rolling, our first bill today is Health Bill 230.
Anyone here going to present Health Bill 230?
[Speaker Change]
This is strictly the financial portion.
[Speaker Change]
Okay. Well, if they come forward.
[Speaker Change]
Why don't we have the staff explain the financial portion.
[Speaker Change]
We'll do that. Staff, if you'd like to go through the financial portion,
please, of H230 have at it. And, please say who you are as we go.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you, Senator Evan. I'm Patsy Pierce from the research division.
Members of the community if you'll look in the bill, it's second edition
of House Bill 230, its under section eight, which begins on line 48 of
page 3. If you want to look at your summary, that's on the back of your
page 2, section 8. It basically is just giving local school
administrative units, also known as LEA's the ability to enroll students
into the reading camps that are available to students who do not
demonstrate reading proficiency. This would give the LEA the opportunity
to enroll students who do demonstrate reading proficiency, if they're
parents would like to send them to the reading camp. But, the LEA would
be able to charge those families a fee and that fee would be an amount
equal to the per student program costs of participating in the reading
camp, not to exceed $825, and that's one line 5 of page 4. Still the
primary enrollment for that reading camp would be for students not
demonstrating reading proficiency. Local boards of education are
directed to establish those application and enrollment procedures and
that's the finance section.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Berger, if you'd like to explain the bill, please, you have the
floor.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Members of the committee this bill was heard in
education yesterday and the primary purpose of the bill is to apply some
modifications to the Read to Achieve program and the A through F grading
system. The reason the bill is before the finance committee is to deal
with the finance aspects of the bill. I'd be happy to answer any
questions. I think a lot of the provisions in the bill are provisions
that have been discussed with DPI, State Board of Education, and
Superintendents from around the state and it addresses some concerns
that have been raised.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Senator Bergere. Members of the committee.</p>

<p id="05:00">
Senator Brock. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, at the appropriate time,
I’d like to make a move for favorable report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any
other comments, Senator McKissick? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chair, and Senator Berger, thank you for bringing this bill before us. I
did have a couple of quick questions, because I don’t sit on the
education committee, and they do deal somewhat with those aspects of the
bill. I notice right now the reading camps are running from 72 hours, to
no more than 3 weeks. And I was wondering. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Excuse me,
Senator. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick.
This was heard in education, the education part. We’re discussing the
finance part of the bill today. But if you have a comment, please
continue. But we want to continue the finance portion if possible.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. I think that my comments or question would be
appropriate under either umbrella. The thing I’m trying to determine
particularly as we’re looking at the cost parameter here, I guess is up
to 825 dollars. How that relates back to the timeframe for these camps
and how we have moved from 72 hours to three weeks from the original
legislation, which as I recall was anticipated about a six week
timeframe, conducting these programs. I support the flexibility that
it’s offering, but I’m just trying to get some further clarification.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, there are two parts to that. The
flexibility is something that was requested by the local school boards.
They wanted be able to structure the programs in such a way that it was
more attractive to the teachers, that they wanted to attract to the
program for teaching the kids. The fee is one that to the extent that
there is space available in these programs, and you have children who
don’t qualify because they’ve actually passed and shown proficiency and
it may be some limited proficiency, if their families want them to go to
the reading camp, they’d be able to. But they would have to pay a fee
and it’s just setting the fee maximum amount. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow
up questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well what I’ll do I guess ?? address on
the floor ?? opportunity to do it here. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Go ahead and
ask your question now, and maybe we can save a little time on the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I doubt it, Senator, but we’ll give you the benefit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think it actually helps when you can ask questions
in committee and I would say that of any member, notwithstanding Senator
Tillman’s remarks. But I guess I was just trying to get a little more
information in terms of the educational components as well. I know that
people at department instruction superintendents were looking for this
greater flexibility and they were provided some earlier in the year. So
I was simply trying to understand a little bit more operationally how
this would actually function as it is proposed in the bill at this
particular point in time. And likewise how it gets back to increasing
proficiency. Because I thought the original proposal, which really
allowed for longer periods, might have enhanced proficiency levels. And
it’s hard to see how proficiency can be overcome perhaps in the 72 hour
period. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And Senator McKissick, as far as the details
of instruction in the program, I can’t provide that for you. It is my
understanding that that like a number of other things that would lead to
our educational professionals, it would be designed by the folks who are
adept at dealing with those kinds of things. It is though a camp that’s
legislatively to be one that has a literacy emphasis and a literacy
component, to address the real problems that some of these children may
have had because they weren’t able to pass the tests and weren’t able to
qualify for one of the alternative assessments and pass that way. So
it’s a camp that’s designed or it’s a program that’s designed to really
deal with those children who are in the third grade who are having the
most trouble with catching on to reading. And again, I think the details
of the program are details that are being worked out by the folks that
are experts in that field. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. I
guess my concern is simply I hope as they do work them out, we do
overcome the deficiencies that these students have. Because if they’re
not reading by third grade, that is a serious problem. And I think we do
need to make sure they’re reading and I guess don’t want us to give them
so much flexibility that we don’t accomplish that objective because 72
hours isn’t much time to overcome three years of deficit. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] And Senator McKissick, that is a little bit of the push pull
that we are dealing with. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator McKissick if I may, the original was I think over six
weeks it was still 72 hours. So the 72 hours</p>

maintain the same and I'll give you an example. My district in
Mecklenburg County asked that it have some flexibility so they could
attract the better teachers to come there and be able to work and it
also provided some ability to save transportation costs when you're
moving a child to that location, then, very simply you do it in what
would be 24 hours a week and doing it over three weeks rather than
extending it over six weeks for a shorter period of time during the day.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator Barringer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I have, actually, a finance question and perhaps a
follow-up. In the definition of proficient student does that include the
students that are exempt for good cause? Another way of saying that is
when we do have a student that has a good cause exemption will they be
charged to go to the camp or will they be able to go to camp without
charge?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll defer to staff on that question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barringer, the students who are exempt for good cause would not
be charged.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excellent. Follow-up sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This may not sound like a finance question but it really does have a
financial point to it. I'd like, and this is really directed to staff,
but Senator Berger if you want to take it that's fine, I would like to
know what has become of the requirement that all children be evaluated
for developmental delays within 30 days of entry into kindergarten? This
was a provision in your bill in 2012, the Omnibus Education Bill, and my
concern about this from a financial standpoint is is that we funded
these things and I wanna know what's happening with these things because
we're also looking at finance and funding again. Can staff tell me where
that stands because that is a critical piece to make this bill work.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Senator Barringer, that remains in current law, the 30 day
developmental screening. That part of the law just wasn't changed so
it's not pulled into the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My question is not whether it's still law, I understand that it's still
law, but is it being implemented and how?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barringer, that is, the day for implementation begins in the
14-15 school year. So it should begin as this school year starts in
August.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And that would be, follow-up, and that is consistent with this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, it would be consistent, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Thank you Senator Barringer. Any more comments or questions
from the committee? If not, we do have one member of the public that has
signed up to speak, Ms. Pamela Grundy from Charlotte. Ms. Grundy if
you'll let the sergeant at arms assist you please, ma'am, we'll give a
couple of minutes to comment. Thank you, and welcome.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you so much and I appreciate you giving me the chance to do this.
I do not have a third grader but I have a lot of friends who have third
graders and I can tell you, as many of you know, this has been a
terrible year in third grade, particularly because of this bill. I think
that the concern of many parents is not only to take the financial
piece, not only is this exceedingly expensive because retention and the
threat of retention is exceedingly expensive but it also, retention, as
the bill threatens, does not work. So you're gonna be spending extra
money to send children to school for another year and it's not gonna do
they any good. They may have a brief jump in their reading scores but
that will go down by the time they reach seventh grade. That's been
quite clearly demonstrated. And they will be more likely to drop out. So
this bill is not a particularly good investment on the part of the
finance committee. I think retention, again, simply does not work and
the problem with putting high stakes like retention on standardized
tests such as the EOG is then that tests become so important that it
warps the entire curriculum and that's why third grade has been a
nightmare. Because it has been completely focused on preparing for that
test because the consequences are so damaging and, as a result, the
children have lost the love of reading, they have lost interest in
school, and it is doing far more harm than good to children. So not only
are you spending more money than you should be, you're spending more
money to do harm to children. This is very clearly shown by research.
I'd be happy to provide anybody with that research and I hope you will
think very seriously. These small changes are not going to make a
difference to the experience of third graders next year. They're very
small changes, they're not gonna make a difference to the challenge that
third graders face and the difficulties they face. And again, the ones
that are losing their love of learning, losing their interest in
reading, because of what this bill is requiring</p>

and I hope you will really think about this seriously.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Ms. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the Senate, or committee, any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hearing none.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, if I may. Senator Berger, I'd like to applaud you and the
folks in education. When we took over about three years ago it was very
easy to ignore the fact that many of the students that are in the public
system can't read, even beyond third grade, and I applaud you and the
other members of the general assembly. When they passed this, primarily
because of the fact that now, at the very least,  a child, when they
graduate, will be able to read and the bottom line is if you can't read
you can't learn and that's critical to any chance of being a productive
citizen, and I say thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Senator Berger, any further comments?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, just briefly-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There, I will acknowledge there is a disagreement among some
professionals about retention but what I would say is that for years
North Carolina has practiced the non-retention policy and what we have
seen is a continuing growth of those kids who are unable to read as they
go through school. And I think it's critical that we do everything that
we can to give our kids the best opportunity for success and learning to
read, being able to read, by completion of the third grade is the one
thing that we can do, I think, to improve the situation for our kids.
And I would appreciate your support for the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Tillman. On a motion by Senator Tillman, no that's
another one, that's another one. Senator Tillman moves for a favorable
report seconded by Senator Harrington. All those in favor please say
aye. Opposed no. Aye's have it. Motion carried, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, the bill before the Senate is Senate Bill 744 PCS. We need a
motion to accept PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is not our PCS&gt;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is what?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's not our PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is not, no longer PCS, okay. So we will, do we want to hear the
financial part of that bill first? And we will be receiving, for about
three or four more minutes, any amendments and then we will cut that
off. Senator Harrington. We have, thank you. Okay. Who is going to bring
this bill forward? Senator Brown. You've been voted. You've been
elected.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, obviously I need to let staff take over from here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Possible.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, there are three types of provisions that are in the budget
bill that requires it to come to finance. There's some tax provisions,
there's some fee provisions, and there are some finance provisions. I'll
briefly go over the tax related provisions and Rodney will go over the
fee related provisions and Mark Bondo from Fiscal Research will go over
the finance related provisions. You have a summary that outlines the tax
provisions, they sort of skip around through the bill. The first one is
on page 98 in section 12H.18. It directs the secretary of Health and
Human Services to implement a Medicaid assessment for LME's and MCO's.
The amount of that assessment would be 3.5% of the non-Medicare net
payments that those entities receive and what that section goes on to do
is to provide that 65% of the amount collected will be used to reduce
general fund appropriations for the Medicaid program and the remaining
35% would be used to increase the payments made to the LME's and NCO's.
North Carolina first began utilizing these provider assessments in 2003
when it created a similar program for your nursing facilities and
intermediate care facilities and did it, the General Assembly enacted
the Hospital Assessment, as you may recall, in 2011 to enhance the
payment rates for hospitals under the Medicare program. The second</p>

<p id="20:00">
related changes can be found in section 34.6. That's in the
transportation part of your budget. That section increases the maximum
highway use tax that will apply to commercial vehicles and to
recreational vehicles. As you recall, the General Assembly repealed the
maximum tax that applies to non-commercial vehicles back in 2001 but the
$1500 and $1000 cap has remained for commercial vehicles and
recreational vehicles. What this does is increase that cap to $3000 over
a two year period. So, effective January 1st, 2015 the cap for
recreational and commercial vehicles will be $2000 and July 1st, 2015 it
will be $3000. Also, as you know, the highway use tax is imposed when a
certificate of title is issued for a vehicle. So if you have someone
that's had a car titled out of state and they move it in to North
Carolina to be titled that car becomes subject to the highway use tax.
The cap on the highway use tax for those vehicles right now is $150 and
this bill would increase that cap to $250 effective October 1st, 2014.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I interrupt for a moment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The appointed time for stopping the amendments is here so no more
amendments will be accepted. Thank you. Go ahead Stephanie, pardon the
interruption.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Last session the General Assembly expanded the base of the highway use
tax. Right now the highway use tax, which is 3%, is imposed on the
retail value of a motor vehicle. Last year that was expanded to be the
retail value of the vehicle plus any dealer administrative fees imposed
in the sale. That change was supposed to become effective July 1, 2014,
this moves that date to October 1st, 2014. And lastly, in this section,
there has been an exemption in the motor, from the motor fuel excise
task for years for taxi cabs and buses operated as part of a city
transit system. This repeals that exemption effective January 1st, 2015.
It does not appear to be highly used because I think the amount of money
associated with it is just about $70,000. I can stand to be corrected
from fiscal. The next tax related change is in section 37.1. Last
session, as you know, the General Assembly reduced the corporate income
tax rate from 6.9% to 6% for this year to 5% for 2015. And then the
statute puts in to place a trigger so that if net general fund
collections for the 14-15 year meet the targeted amount of 20.2 billion
dollars then the corporate tax rate for the 2016 will go down and then
the statute also put in a trigger for the fiscal year 14-15 that if net
general fund revenues meet the targeted amount, which is set in the
statute at 20.975 billion then the rate could go down once more. The
question is, how do you decide what the net general fund revenue
collections are? We realize they're just many different charts out
there. The bill referred us to the report that the state comptroller
puts out, the state's comprehensive annual financial report, but there
are several charts in that report. None of which are the ones that
correspond with what you, as a body, use when you put together your
availability statement and start your appropriations process. So what
this does is to line that target up, where you go to see if you've met
the target, it lines it up with the information that you have been using
to make your budget availability statements, which is the report that
the Department of Revenue puts out. And lastly, as far as tax related
changes, is in section 37.2, I believe, right under that. And that is
the modification of the county hold harmless for repealed taxes. As you
may recall, back in 2008, the state assumed the county share of the
non-federal Medicaid cost, the administrative cost, and financing that
change it repealed the third half cent local sales tax. To hold counties
harmless from the repeal of that local sales tax the General Assembly
put that each county would benefit by at least $500,000. What this does
is to be</p>

<p id="25:00">
Begin to phase out that $500,000 so by the year 2017 we will truly only
hold counties harmless. We won’t give them an additional amount and by
that point we believe there will be about twenty-four counties that will
continue to receive some type of payment from the state under this
provisions. Mr. Chairman that’s all of the tax related changes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Chairman I think that explains it pretty well.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] You ready to do the fees Senator Brown? Are you ready
for staff to take over on the fees?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Do you have a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Okay. Senator Walters.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Chair. I just would ask a question about
removing the cap or increasing the cap on the highway use tax. Could
staff tell me how much revenue that’s going to generate?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] It’s about eleven million is what I understand.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Ms. Cameron.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Chair, Amna Cameron with fiscal research
division. The commercial cap when it is fully in place at $3000 will
raise ten million annually. The recreational cap when it’s raised to
$3000 will bring in one million annually. The out of state cap when it
is fully implemented for a full year will raise $3,225,000.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Chair. I’ve got a concern about this as
we’ve talked in the last two sessions about business friendly and
everything and Senator Rucho explained it very well on several occasions
about how we need to be friendly to our businesses here in the state but
now we’re going to go back and increasing taxes on commercial vehicles
that provide all the services and construction and agriculture-related
industries across the state.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Jenkins.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Chairman. This is just a request not a
question is if we could get staff, Ms. ??? could help us with this, on
this Medicaid hold armless piece and sort of give us a before and after
schedule as to how the counties are impacted.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Ms. Johnson.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Once the phase out is fully implemented it will
increase general farm revenues by 18.6 million.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Chairman what I’d like and I’m sure Ms. Johnson can
do it is I’d like to see the schedule as how, what is the impact to the
individual counties.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Certainly. I’m sure staff can provide that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] That is available it’s out there.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you. Senator Tucker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Chair. Following up on Senator Walters’
question, this doesn’t all commercial vehicles does it? Did I understand
it to be..
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Over 27,000 pounds is my understanding.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes sir, three axles or so. So not all commercial
vehicles are taxed? Maybe Mr. Walters’ vehicles will be taxed, but not
mine.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Can I follow up on Senator Tucker’s remark?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes you may.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I assume you all the ??? will not be affected but a lot
of trucks and agriculture trucks will be. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes it is my understanding that Senator Tucker’s and
that sort of thing would not be. I think they already pay 3% on the
total price though.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you. Other members of the committee, questions?
Senator McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] A couple of quick questions here. First one, in terms
of the repeal of the exemption on the motor fuels excise tax for taxis
and city busses, you know those busses that are operated by cities. Does
staff have some type of projections as to first how much revenue is
anticipated from taxi cab operators throughout the state and then
secondly what kind of revenue is anticipated from the ???
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator McKissick we do have that number and I think
Ms. Cameron can answer that for you.

Clarify sir there is an exemption in the motor fuel tax for any type of
city or county purpose. There’s an another exemption that says when the
cities or counties hire a nonprofit to perform their transportation
services that is exempt so this applies when a city or county hires a
taxi or a private company to transport people. That’s why there is so
little revenue effect. The total revenue effect for an annualized amount
is $180,000.

[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yeah quick follow up. So it’s only in those instances
where a city or a county is contracting out of a private sector that
this exemption would apply to and that’s where the $180,000 comes from
is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Ms. ???
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] And then secondly this moves over to this issue with
the Medicaid and in particularly this hold harmless provision that we’ve
put in place.  Is it possible to know right now how many of these
counties are getting the $500,000 above and beyond I guess what they
would otherwise receive simply for hold harmlessing their expenses
related to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Ms. Duff do you have an answer for that please?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] ??? fiscal research. Yes, once a ?? is fully
implemented, forty-four counties were originally estimated to receive
the hold harmless payment. After that, twenty-four counties will still
be getting a hold harmless payment to bring them to zero so in sum
twenty counties lose the guarantee between zero to five hundred
thousand.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up if I could.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Could you provide us with a list of those twenty
counties?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes we have that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] They mostly small rural counties or what are they?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] It varies, I can provide you the list.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] If you can provide it that’d be excellent, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Further questions or comments from the committee. Okay
if not we’ll move on to the financing portion.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Chairman. Rodney Bissel, fiscal research, and I
will be referencing the long spreadsheet in your packet that includes at
the top has SB744 fee related provisions and this spreadsheet has the
fee items by ???, category. It also includes the section number in the
bill if you’d like the reference the bill. The first category is JPS
fees, the first one is the hazardous materials facility fees. This
creates a new fee for hazardous materials for persons that are required
to submit a report on their inventory on hazardous materials under
federal law to the division of emergency management. The fee will be $50
for hazardous materials and $90 for extremely hazardous materials. The
next item is ABC permit fee increases. This would increase the renewal
and registration fee for ABC beer and wine permits from $200 to $400 and
for mixed beverage permits from $750 to $1000. The private hospital
toxicology fee it would simply allow DA’s to request a fee when they
have toxicology reports done at private hospitals. The fee is $600 and
that’s the same amount that is collected when the test is done by a
local or state crime lab. The community work crew fee would allow the
department of public safety to charge a fee that’s sufficient to cover
their cost when a work crew is used to assist local governments with
work projects. The fee currently is capped at 150 so this would just
allow. Under the transportation section the first item is DMV hearings
fees. This one would allow DMV or direct DMV to develop a fee schedule
to offset their cost for administering hearings and report those
findings to the joint legislative transportation oversight committee by
December first. The next one is DOT signage fees and this allows the
board to increase fees for their logo, the logos for businesses that are
included on signage as well as tourist or directional signs so that they
can recapture the cost for those programs. Those are currently capped at
$300 and $200. Under..</p>

The MHS fees. The first one is private well water testing. This is an
existing fee it would be increased from $55 to $74 to recover the costs
of the testing and it would also add existing wells to be tested. The
state retention of the hospital gap plan assessment. This would increase
the percentage of assessments that the state retains from 25.9% to
28.85%. In the NER area, the first item is the forestry management
plans. This would implement a new fee for forestry management plan
produced by the forest service and those fees are tiered, based on the
acreage of the plan. The natural poultry improvement plan fees would
increase the fee for natural poultry improvement plan certifications.
For initial certification the fee is $50 plus $0.10 per bird. Then, the
subsequent years thats $10 plus $0.10 per bird. Finally, the last item
is commercial fishing licenses. This is increasing the amount of fishing
licenses for, we have a list of the categories here, and I won't go
through those in detail unless someone would like that. But, we have the
total amount of the fee increases here, the 26.8 Million that you see
that's the general fund impact for FY 14, 15. Then the 1.3 Million would
be impact on special funds. That completes the fee provision, Mr. Chair.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you. Thank you, Rodney. Questions and comments from the . . .
Yeah, Senator Blue.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Brown, two questions. The first, and I
raise it briefly this morning, the first has to do with the, under
transportation, the DMV hearings fee. I looked at the provision, you
don't mean that every DMV hearing would recover the full cost associated
with that hearing. Which would include salary, wherever the meeting room
where the meeting was held, the Attorney General's presence there. If
you mean that, that's strange that you're going to imposed all that one
someone who wants a drivers license reinstated and has to have an
administrative hearing to do that.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Blue, I believe what ?? can answer that for you.
[Speaker Change]
Can you speak up, please? I don't know if your mics on, brother. You
have to hold it, you have to hold it down. Thank you.
[Speaker Change]
Bryce Ball, again with Physical Research. Senator Blue, the provision in
which you are referencing is section 34.9, DMV is directed to develop at
fee schedule that is offset the cost of all the hearings it administers.
That would be a separate distinction, which are conducted by the office
of administrative hearing. But, you are correct, all of the hearing
types would be incorporated into this fee schedule, however there is a
specific reference to hearings that are initiated by the division and a
waver of the fee in situations where the initial determination is not
upheld, follow ups are.
[Speaker Change]
I look at the language and when it said, direct and indirect, I was
worried that you were really trying to get that. So, in order for
someone to get a license reinstated, a drivers license, at DMV they
would end up paying thousands of dollars if you infact you mean for them
to develop a schedule based on all of these costs. You'd have to factor
all of those in it, so if you don't mean that I wish you'd change it so
it . . .
[Speaker Change]
Maybe poor wording here?
[Speaker Change]
Yeah. I don't think that's the intent.
[Speaker Change]
Okay. The other question I had, had to do with health and human services
provision on the state retention on the hospital gap plan assessment. I
know that the hospitals, a couple of years ago worked out the deal so
that they found this unfound money for the state and were willing to
change some formula, so they were able to draw down more federal
dollars. In exchange for that, share the found money with the state, and
they signed off along with the leadership at a specific level. Are they
in agreement that you can unilaterally raise that level on them?
[Speaker Change]
Senator Blue I'm going to let Senator Hise, if he would, address this.
This is his expertise. If I could.
[Speaker Change]
As a.</p>

<p id="40:00">
Earlier this morning. I don’t think this is one the hospitals are asking
for. ?? direction of the information. Assessments under the federal
regulation are allowed to go up to a 6% assessment on each of them. I
think this would bring the hospitals to about 3%. On the assessment we
charge nursing homes and others an assessment of 6%, to get them to the
federal maximum. Hospitals have reached the federal maximum and did that
at about 1% initially, the almost 100 million added to the assessment
last year got them to almost 3% level in coming forward. So the
assessment on the hospital is less than the other hospitals and we spoke
about the LEMCO, we’re proposing starting that one at 3 ½ as well, in
coming through. So ?? over so. No, I don’t think the hospitals want the
amount the state retains to be increased. I don’t think they would ever
do that. But it’s the equivalent of saying otherwise we go in and we’re
going to change rates and reduce provider rates for the same amount to
stay within the same budget. So it’s kind of which way do you want it.
And this one’s the easiest one because we don’t need federal approval.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up to that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We made a deal
with them. They didn’t have to do it the way they did. We made a deal
and it seems that we would feel somewhat obligated to the deal and just
wouldn’t decide unilaterally that we’re going to break the deal.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would just respond
that the current assessment package that we have looks nothing like the
original package that was agreed to already. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Other
questions and comments from the Senate. Senator Tucker. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. It’s just a question, probably for
Rodney. National poultry improvement plan fees. This sheet shows it
generates about 25,000 dollars under this new fee schedule, is that
correct, or am I seeing ten cents a bird? What does that mean to me,
because we produce millions of turkeys in Union County. What does that
mean? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair,
somewhat familiar. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, over here. Timothy Dale with
fiscal research. This is a voluntary program. Essentially what this does
is it helps this program if the producer wants to elect to be part of
this national poultry plan certification process, it helps with
certification and I guess the branding of your product as well, to show
that you have a quality product. It’s completely voluntary and those
fees are based upon the numbers that are currently electing to do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just one follow up. So that means that they want to
volunteer ten cents on ever bird and they produce several million birds,
you would expect them to do that, with this fee? Is that what we’re
saying? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sure that’s going
to happen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other questions or comments? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator McKissick. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And this might be for
Senator Hise, perhaps. If you could help me with this provision here
dealing with the LMEs LCOs 3 and a half percent. What are we currently
getting from that income stream and how much would that change with this
particular provision? I see it’s going toward the general fund and
Medicaid but maybe you can help me a little bit to see what the
difference is. I know you’re very knowledgeable about these details.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The ?? assessment, and this is back to the tax side
versus fee. But the LMEO assessment assesses three and a half percent of
all the services rendered at the ?? that they would pay to the state
that would generate about 60 million dollars in the state. We then take
that 35%, put it back in, get a 35/65 match, so the exact same amount of
money goes back to the ?? that we took away from the ?? and the state
maintains the amount that I think is 60 million dollars in the budget. I
think it’s 59 million 900 thousand. So we take the funds out, when we
put them back in, we get a two to one federal match. We keep the state
portion so they’re held harmless. And since we fund them in a capitated
contract, it’s quite literally an insane method the federal government
allows to move money out and back in, and receive a match by doing so.
If we tax several hundred dollars, we pull it out, we would keep 65
cents of that. We’d put the 35 back in to increase rates. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Senator Hise. Thank you. That’s a clever idea.</p>

Members, it’s the end of that. We have one more part to go over and this
time Mark Bondo will be covering financing. Are we right on that, Mark,
please? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Mark Bondo, fiscal research. If you go to
the Senate Bill 744, page 264, section 36.12, two-thirds bonds act of
2014. Two thirds bonds are a form of general obligation debt. That can
be issued without a vote of the people. It’s based on a calculation of
the outstanding general obligation bonds that are repaid in the last
biennium. And the state has some capacity there. What this part of the
bill does is two things. Essentially it refinances some authorized but
unissued debt the state has which is non-voter-approved and thus at a
lower bond rating. It refinances that 206 million dollars as general
obligation debt, which gets a slight savings. The first year would be
about 200,000 dollars in savings and it will go up in the out years. The
second thing that this does is finance the construction of a western
crime lab in Edneyville, North Carolina. This building was planned in
2012 and then again in 2013. And that’s 15.4 million dollars, so the
total amount of debt authorized under this section is 221.4 million
dollars. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mark. Members, questions? Then we
have. You move to stop? I will entertain that motion in just a minute,
Senator Apodaca. Did you get lunch today? Okay, I thought you were a
little cranky, I didn’t know. We do have one amendment coming forward
and that was Senator Harrington, if you would explain your amendment.
Does everyone have a copy? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Does
everyone have a copy? This is just an amendment to make a correction to
last session’s MPO Ethics Bill. The amendment just clarifies that the
existing $250 fine applies to both the filing statement of economic
interest in the additional real estate disclosures. It also clarifies
that the ethics commission will report to the attorney general for
investigation. Referral to the district attorney. And ethics is here if
you have any questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Harrington.
Senator Meredith moves to accept the amendment. Is there a second?
Second. All in favor of the amendment please say aye. Opposed no.
Amendment carries. Thank you, Senator Harrington. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And now, without further discussion, we
will take a motion. Thank you, I think we have it written out so we
won’t mess it up Senator, thank you. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Curtis is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I move for an unfavorable report as to the original
bill. Favorable as to the committee substitute as amended, with
amendments to remain unengrossed and with ?? for staff to make technical
corrections. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rabin, you couldn’t have said it
any better, could you? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
understand that Senator Rabin did not hear a second from you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] We are standing at ease for a moment. The motion seems to be
correct and in order. All those in favor of the motion please say aye.
Opposed no. Motion carried. Thank you. Thank you pages and sergeant at
arms, and staff. Meeting adjourned.</p>
