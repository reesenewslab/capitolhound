180. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate bill 180, auto
insurance allow optional enhancements.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Apodaka is recognized to explain the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mr. President. Members, what this bill does, it allows insurance
companies in North Carolina, automobile insurance companies in North
Carolina to offer a special discounts and packages that we see so often
advertised on television. Currently it has to go to the rate facility
and then to the commissioner for insurance for approval. This will allow
to bypass the rate bureau and go directly to the commissioner and it
really is a consumer friendly bill and should have significant impact on
some of the rates. Where someone like Senator Brown has all his houses
he owns put together along with his cars and able to get some real good
package rates. So I encourage you to vote for this. I don't know of
anyone against this unless someone wants to pay more money. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate?</p>

senate bill 181 the clerk will read
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
senate bill 181 auto insurance young driver classification
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca is recognized to explain the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
thank you Mr President this bill converts our system from measuring the
driving experience of a young person to a age experience basically right
now your premium is based on the driving experience or how many years of
experience a driver has had this normally just affects our younger
drivers those under 19 which we all know are the higher premiums this
would convert it to a system of age just going straight to the deal so
if your under 19 your going to pay higher rates. what this does do it
makes it easier for someone that come into the driving pool that has
driving experience say overseas and they moved to the united states they
were having to pay the same rate as a 19 year old prior to this but this
will be based on age that's what it does so those who come in and have
experience in other places will have a lesser rate I recommend it to you
and also Mr President i need to send forth an amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
do the members have copies Senator?

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr president
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho for what purpose do you rise
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
to see if Senator Apodaca would yield for a question
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca do you yield
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca I wasn't able to attend that meeting unfortunately but i
just wanted to check now were talking about using the graduated driving
license and then with that experience and then going from 16, 17, 18, 19
and just basing it on age.  Why wouldn't if someone showed that they
were a very good driver didn't have citations didn't have accidents why
shouldn't they receive a better rate than just rating it on age
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho I wish you had attended the meeting because we got into
that and when you kids if you learn you should always attend meetings in
classes so you can learn things.  Senator Rucho this will have a very
little effect on the particular drivers your talking about between 16
and 19 because right now their based on experience of driving which is
zero to one two three so from my understanding there's not going to be
any substantial change in premiums paid this is just a better way to use
the age 19 and older and usually when your over 19 your a little more
mature i know in your case that didn't happen but with normal people it
does
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr President I would like to have a follow up if I may
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca do you yield
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
one yes sir
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca those words of wisdom were very enlightening but I've
got an 18 year old and if there's an increase in my rates i'm just going
to send you the bill i'll trust you'll accept that graciously
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
absolutely i would suggest you do not pay postage i don't want to see
you go any further in the hole thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr President
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird for what purpose do you rise
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
to ask Senator Apodaca a question please
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca do you yield
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do

Senator Apodaca some years ago a woman from Switzerland had married an
American and she moved to my town and when she went in to get her

Senate bill 344, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate bill 344, vintage auto inspections.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Hartsell is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President, members of the Senate.
344 addresses the issue of when out of state vehicles 35 years of age or
older and specially constructed vehicles are required to undergo a
vehicle inspection and verification. Currently, the law says that's to
take place within a practical period of time, there are however no
specific limitations and circumstances. What the bill does is specify
what those time frames might be. In that regard, having listened to the
committee that I did attend, Sen. Rucho, seemed to think the 10 days
was- that was in the bill originally might have been a little too short.
I have an amendment to send forward Mr. President, and it's in with the-
I think it's already been sent- it's up there, up front, and everyone
has a copy of it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Hartsell moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Hartsell is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President, members of the Senate.
The amendment changes the 10 days in each instance to 15 days, which I
think is a little bit more consistent with what the committee discussion
indicated, and is probably appropriate under the circumstances, it gives
everybody ample time, a little better than 2 weeks to address the issue,
and I would commend it to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Senate bill 430, clarify electric load control process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Brown is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President.
What this bill will do is exempt an installer of an electric load
control switch, which are normally placed on things like your air
conditioner, who works with public utility, electric membership
corporation, or municipal service provider from needing an electrical
contractor's license so long as the work is overseen by a licensed
electrical contractor and exempt from the installation, maintenance or
replacement of an electric load control switch by such a person and
requiring a building permit.
All the parties have agreed on it and I don't know of any opposition.

Senate Bill 520, the clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 520.
WC record full IC hearings. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Daniels is
recognized to explain the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
President, members. This is a simple bill. In the Dobbs building right
here in the Halifax mall, they have worker’s compensation hearings that
are administered by a panel of three commissioners. Currently those
hearings are not recorded. The panels make factual and legal conclusions
and I just think, this is sort of something that’s fallen through the
cracks and this bill simply requires that the Industrial Commission
record these hearings, as we do in Superior Court and District Court and
all of, most of our other courts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further

Senate Bill, we’re going to go back to Local Bills now Senators. We have
one local bill, but we’re going to read Senate Bill 317. The clerk will
read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 317, Guilford School Election
System. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade is recognized to explain the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Senators, this is a
local bill concerning redistricting the election for the Guilford County
School Board. And this encourages participation from the voters and
aligns the recently redistricted County Commissioner Districts. The
School Board election would be aligned with those districts, and it
makes the districts more competitive, giving the voters choice in each
district. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate?
Hearing none, the question before the Senate [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson, for what purpose do you
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I stand to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I too
represent Guilford County, and we recently met with the Guilford County
Board of Education and this was not one of their requests. I want to
read to you parts of a letter I received from them, and they along with
the Guilford Education Alliance oppose this bill. The letter says the
Guilford County Board of Education voted unanimously and this is a
bipartisan board on March 28, 2013 to oppose Senate Bill 317, Guilford
School Election System, and urges you to do the same. As the only
elected officials focused exclusively on Pre-K through 12 public
schools, we have been charged by parents and citizens to represent their
interests and voices on these matters. While the school board
appreciates the General Assembly’s desire to improve public education,
the board’s vote in opposition to Senate Bill 317 reflects the following
concerns. One, the inappropriate insertion of state control over local
issue, and disregard of express will of the citizens of Guilford County
during the November 2012 school board elections. Two, introducing
partisan politics into a non-partisan issue serves only to divide our
community and disrupt our school system and I have to say we have a
pretty good school system. We’ve got some things to do, but we have the
highest graduation rate in the state. Three, the proposal runs counter
to the high levels of satisfaction expressed by parents and communities
as measured by statistically valid public opinion</p>
