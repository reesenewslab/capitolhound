Informing his excellent state governor Pat McCrory that the general
assembly is organised and ready to proceed with public business and
inviting the governor to address a join session of the senate and the
house of representatives.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
counter percent rule 32A for Tuesday February 12th
Rather than introduce you today. I didn't get a chance to come over and
greet you a little bit earlier this afternoon. What we're having today
is what we call a &quot;skeleton session&quot; and I can see that the
Democratic caucus got the memo, except for two &quot;die hards&quot;,
but this session is one were we don't have any bills or recorded votes,
so sometimes on Mondays and sometimes on Thursdays early in the session
we have to convene because the constitution requires us to, but we don't
necessarily require the members to come here. Otherwise I'm sure every
member in both caucus would be here. So rather than introduce you to a
bunch of skeletons.. I thought we'd wait until tomorrow and we'll
introduce you to the full body. but we welcome you here and we'll greet
you properly tomorrow. Representative Burr, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
After two motions Mr Speaker
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? recognized your motion
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr Speaker. for First motion to move that Senate bill forward
to North Carolina Exchange and medicaid expansion the serial referral to
appropriates be stricken.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
noted.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And for the second motion, Mr Speaker, moves that house bill 16, a same
short title, be withdrawn from the committee on rules and re-referred to
the Health and Human Services committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without Objection?
So ordered.
Members, this concludes the business of today. We'll do notices and
announcements in a minute. For planning purposes, Representative Jackson
or Representative Hall if you could communicate this to the colleagues
in your caucus. For planning purposes so far we will still be on a
2:00-2:00 schedule for Tuesday and Wednesday. We're conferring with the
committee members to see if we can move up the time on Thursday. At this
time it's 1:00, but if the business of the house and such we can move it
earlier we will continue to do that. And members, Just by way of
warning,the reason that we're trying to move things earlier in the
session is because we notice as we go later we will have late Thursdays
and maybe even some Fridays, so I hope you'll be patient with us if we
move some things around that make conflict with calendars. The main
reasons for that is to use the time now to let people get back to their
districts and their businesses because as we get into April and May
these opportunities will become fewer and further between.
Notices and Announcements.
Representative Holloway, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Make an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This gentlemen is recognized to make an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We are going to attempt to start the basketball practice tonight. I know
we've got a slim crowd here but we've got the law district coming over
with their team and staff and several members have expressed interest so
we're going to practice at Peace College tonight, probably around 6:45.
Members need time to change clothes, but the key thing you've got to
remember is we've got to wait. Don't bounce any balls or shoot any balls
if you get there because we've got forms. We've all got to sign our
lives away so we wont sue if someone is injured. So, please just wait
until we all of the forms signed and the officer is supposed to be there
to take them up and they are expecting us so come on out. Probably start
at about 6:45, and we'll practice until we fall over. Mr Speaker, again
we need a little help and assistance, I know you said to draft a letter
so I am drafting a very &quot;trash talking letter&quot; to send to
South Carolina's legislature. And we need to be thinking of a date as
well that we can all do it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm looking forward to sending that to my friend, Speaker Harrol
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.

Representative Blust please state your purpose

inquiry of the chair
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Gentlemen is recognized to state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr Speaker, looking around tonight, are there any veto overrides or
anything else we can bring up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;crowd laughs&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, Representative Blust, what i noted from this was trust on the
democratic caucus that we were going to have a Skeleton Session and I
don't know what this says for all of the Republicans that came in
wondering what I had in store
Representative Ller please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For announcement.

This Gentlemen is recognized for an announcement.
