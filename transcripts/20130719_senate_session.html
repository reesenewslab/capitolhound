Senate will come to order. The Sergeant at Arms will close the doors.
Members will go to their seats. Members and guests of the gallery will
please silence all electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer is
the Reverend Peter Milner, Senate Chaplain. All members and guests in
the gallery will please stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let us pray together. Heavenly Father thank you again for gathering us
here in Your name. Thank you for the opportunity that we have to work
together towards unity. The conversations that we have here are so
delightful to you, Heavenly Father, because they remind us that we were
made for relationships.
May we complete a good work week with the confidence that you are moving
these relationships. You are moving these conversations and You are the
bedrock of them. May our disagreements remind us that not just our
frustrations are the center but our humanity and our being fashioned in
our humanity is what draws us to You who made us in Your image. For
Christ’s sake we pray. Amen.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Inquiry of the Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
With that list, Mr. President, I think we can get some real business
done.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members we’re ready to go into the calendar. Unless there’s something
further that…OK, local bills, second reading, House Bill 726, Clerk will
read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 726, “Wake County Commissioners Responsible for School
Construction.”
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hunt is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. House Bill 726 gives Wake County the
responsibility for school construction. Under this bill the Wake County
School Board would be required to consult with the County Commissioners
regarding their school real estate needs and then the school board would
still retain management responsibility for the school buildings.
This idea came from the changes we discussed in this chamber before. It
came from the North Carolina Association of County Commissioners. I’ve
been encouraged to move forward with this bill by the Wake County Board
of Commissioners.
The intent, of course, is to allow the school board members to have more
time to focus on education needs and the Wake County Commissioners, the
more business-oriented folks to be able to focus on the real estate,
construction and the site acquisition needs for the county.
Another benefit of this legislation is to eliminate duplicate
construction offices. The Wake County School Board has a construction
office and the Wake County Commission has a construction office. This
legislation would require only one construction office.
This is really just common-sense legislation, I think, to save the
taxpayers money. All of this is about saving taxpayer money. I think the
Wake County Commission has been motivated to move forward on this due to
some unfortunate business decisions made by the Wake County School
Board. It was a non-partisan issue and it was voted on unanimously by
the Wake County Boards and Commissions, Republicans and Democrats all
voted to assume responsibility of school construction and real estate
site acquisition.
I’ve had numerous counties come forward to ask to be included in this
bill but Senator Tillman told me a long time ago I should have done this
just as a single-county bill, a local bill and I don’t know why he
wasn’t more forceful, but Senator Tillman, you did a good job, I should
have done it. But we’ve had lots of counties try to get on this. I said,
“You all just run your own school board bill.”</p>

...and that’s what we’re doing here today. I appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate. Senator Blue, for what purpose do you
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  Ladies and gentlemen of the
jury...Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate. It’s Friday, Mr. President.
Normal work day for me. My fellow Senators, Senator Hunt has set forth
what he thinks, or at least what he indicates are good reasons for your
doing this. If it’s a good reason to do it in Wake county then it’s a
compelling a reason to do it statewide. School boards have a unique
place in our organization in this state.
I daresay that the overwhelming majority of you recognize the importance
of the independence of school boards and most senses, the non-partisan
nature of school boards. Where we've had problems with school boards
it’s where they've taken on partisan attributes. Of all the things in
our society, those between 5 and 18 are those that we owe the highest
obligation to and we ought to certainly remove politics from it. But if
we’re going to give school boards the ability to make a difference,
you've got to give them some power to go along with that ability.
Some of you have had experience in mergers and acquisitions and other
business transactions. Senator Hunt says that one of the things this
bill will do is eliminate duplicative construction offices. The Wake
County School Board controls and manages multiple times the amount of
property that the county commissioners manage and bill. Right now, Wake
County is considering an $800 million plus bond issue. Four years ago we
passed almost a billion dollar bond issue. The county’s construction
activities don’t come anywhere close to that.
The school board’s construction office is much bigger than the country
construction office, has much greater expertise in it. In a normal
situation, a mammoth office like the Wake County school board
construction office would be the one taking over construction. But in
Senator Hunt’s proposal, he’s having the county commissioners
construction office, which is a dwarf compared to the school board’s
construction office, swallow this will. Doesn't make sense from a
business standpoint and an experience standpoint.
He says it’ll allow the county commissioners to save money, because of
unfortunate business decisions. He gives you the one or two, maybe not
wisest decisions the school board has made, but he doesn't give you the
unwise decisions that the county commissioners have made. I’ll give you
an example that makes the point.
Earlier this year, the Wake County Board of Commissioners received a
proposal from the school board to buy an old YMCA site within the city
big enough to do a school. The kind of site that we need for the Wake
County School Board. The school board offered $825,000 for the site, the
county commissioners in their great wisdom, decided no, that was too
much to pay for the site. A site that was very much needed in the
programming for Wake County public schools. The county commissioners
decided, no they've offered 15% too much for the site, so they, in their
oversight ability, chose to authorize the school board to offer only
$775,000. Needless to say, the county commissioners made a big mistake.
A third buyer came in and offered almost $900,000 for the site,
$895,000. Considerably more than the school board had offered, but
substantially more than what the county commissioners had authorized.
These wise and sagacious old guys on the county commission, because of
their business background, aren't any smarter than the other folk making
decisions. We got business people on the school board, as in any
elective body. I suggest to you that this is just a way to play politics
with our kids. It’s a way to take away the ability to manage the schools
and do the kind of programming and public education that will enable
kids in the Wake County public school...</p>

?? To continue achieving at a high level, and so Mr. President with that
being said I would like to ascend forth a couple of amendments and the
first one, its in reverse order, the one that has 51 on it [SPEAKER
CHANGE] Clerk ?? [SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Blue moves to amend The bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]Okay does everyone have that on their dashboard? Senator
Blue is recognized to explain the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGE] And my
dashboard didn't come up Mr. President. 51 if I make no mistake is the
one that, excuse me a minuet let me come up and look at it, my dashboard
is messed up. 51, I have it thank you very much, 51, ?? ladies and
gentlemen because Senator Haunt believes  as I do that the best form of
government is a form that is closest to the people. And nothing is more
?? Then the ability to vote and so if in fact the ??citizens in Wake
county truly believe that the decisions about citing, constructing and
managing schools ought to belong to the county commissioners in a way
differently then they manage it rather then the school board, then  they
ought to be able to vote on it. All of us believe in often and frequent
elections this simply gives the citizens of wake county, who are our
ultimate bosses the ability to decide who they want managing the
physical facilities for the school systems in wake county and so it
would put it to referendum to the voters in wake county and then we
would know absolutely how our citizens here want their schools
maintained and owned I move for the adoption of the amendment, Mr.
President. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Is there further discussion or debate on
amendment one? Senator  Hunt for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGE] Thank you Mr. President just to respond I have a couple of
points, thank you Mr. President, a couple of points on senator blooms
remarks regarding the county commission construction expertise. I think
they just finished a rather good sized court house building in downtown
Reilly, I really don’t know the price tag but I knew it was
substantially under budget I think its was 20 million plus, probably
more in the range of 30 and 40 million dollars but it was several
million dollars under budget.  I don’t recall seeing that kind of
performance exhibited by  Wake country school board construction
activities. Regarding business acumen In southern wake county our school
board tried to pay 8 million dollars for a school site and some time
later… well the county commissioner refused to go along with it and
ultimately bought that site for 4 million dollars,  half price, so
that’s just a comment about the business acumen of our school board
members. About 25% of our Wake county... [SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Hunt
are you speaking to the amendment that was offered [SPEAKER CHANGE] yes
I'm getting to the expertise of the County commission, thank you Mr.
President. So my point is our electorate Gives an opportunity to vote
for county commissioners, they vote for them based on their expertise in
running the county and this is an interval, school construction is an
interval part  of county commissioners, of county activities I urge you
to ?? The amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGE] further discussion or debate on
amendment 1. ?? Is  on question for the senate is the passage for
amendment 1 to the senate committee substitute to house bills 726 all in
favor will vote Aye or oppose will vote no five seconds will be allowed
for the voting clerk record the vote. 8... Tillman no, Tillman Aye?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] no [SPEAKER CHANGE] Tillman No, Bryant aye.  9 having
voted in the affirmative and 26 voting in the negative. Amendment one
fails and house bill 726 is back before you  Senator Blue for what
purpose do you rise [SPEAKER CHANGE] to send forth an amendment [SPEAKER
CHANGE] clerk ?? [SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Blue moves to amend a bill
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Blue has the floor [SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you
very much Mr. President I thought I made a convert out of Senator
Tillman I feel like a failure...</p>

And it was a week after they had decided, the week of their decision on
the Voting Right Act and various other things, and I've had several
occasions to meet the Chief Justice and to be at various events. And as
I was driving back from West Virginia last Saturday, three weeks ago, I
was reflecting on some of the wisdom that he had expressed in his
decision about the Voting Rights Act, in Section 4, and his opinion said
that the case in 1965 or 1980 or even later than that is different than
the case in 2013. As I was reflecting on that, you know, and his point
was you need to look at things in light of how they appear at the time
rather than a totally historic context. I raised the points yesterday
that I raised because it’s ironic that the ability of elected officials,
Democrats and Republicans, to work out and resolve issues in the
counties that were covered by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, that
is through collaboration so that they bring something that is acceptable
to all of the citizens. And we saw it two times in the bills that were
presented yesterday. Is leads apart from what one would have expected of
those 40 covered counties. Wake County wasn't a covered county but the
reason I share with you Justice Roberts wisdom is perhaps if you looked
at the way decisions are made in 2013 in election activities by elected
officials as compared to how they were made in 65 or 80. You would flip
some of the counties that were cause for more intervention by neutral
objective eyes than we currently have. I think that it’s a, that we've
had two bills in this Chamber this year that affected Wake County public
schools. Neither of them was a bill that was even discussed broadly in
the community and certainly not discussed broadly in the delegations
that represent Wake County. Not a single one of them was brought to our
delegation meetings to talk about. We weren't consulted. At least, I
wasn't consulted. My constituency wasn't, and my constituent’s a
microcosm of this county, not just a black constituency, and everybody
is up at arms about it. The Chamber was up at arms and various other
entities, and I suggest to you that collaboration is a way that you do
business. It is a way that you keep things moving forward rather than
putting people at odds and constantly going after each other with
sabers.  This is a bad bill for Wake County, and I think a lot of you
know that. And that’s why you’re not anxious and clamoring to put your
counties into the same situation, but you’re willing to do it to Wake
County because we’re blindly wedded to this concept of partisanship. I
think it’s working to our detriment. It’ll continue working to our
detriment. I know that you’re going to vote for this bill, but I hope
your conscience is somewhere that will remind you later on that you
could’ve made a difference. And you could’ve had some impact on how the
largest school district in this county is going to fair because most of
you, most of you at some point think about where your kids live when
they graduate, and they come to places like this or they stay in North
Carolina rather than going up north like everybody had to do when I
graduated to get decent jobs, and that’s because of good schools. So I
hope that you will look at this bill in a broader sense than narrow way
that we tend to look at some things, and you realize the detrimental
effect it will have on Wake County, and you’ll defeat it. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate. Senator Apodaca, for
what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It is amazing to me having been here. This is my
eleventh year. The selective amnesia that has been developed now by the
minority party, and going forward, I look back to the time frame of 2002
to 2010 when I sat on that back row, and I didn't hear any of this
appeal brought forth by the folks in the front row how we need to work
together. How we need to do this, how we need to do that. So it amazes
me since 2010 we need to develop a conscience like they've had. I guess
they've just hid it that eight years. Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, I first want to thank
the environmental staff that has worked so hard on this legislation
because this is a combination of House Bill 94, that you've heard at
least three times, if not four. Actually I've heard it so much, I was up
at four-thirty this morning wondering how I was going to present this
bill. So I'm gonna tell you briefly how I'm gonna present it. It's a
combination of the House PCS to Senate Bill 112 and House Bill 94 and we
added it into the House Bill 74. Sections 25 through 58, this is a 60
section bill. I'll be happy to go through each section but I'm gonna, if
you would bear with me and I'll try and brief it as shortly as possible.
The following sections are from House Bill 94, which the Senate has
already voted out of chamber. Sections 25 through 58. The following
sections are from the House PCS to Senate Bill 112, Sections 1 through
24. The Department of Environmental and Natural Resources has approved
the following sections. Section 18, Sections 20 through 22, 25 through
33, Sections 36 through 38, Section 42, 46, 48, 53, 55 through 57. Here
are the purely technical provisions. Sections 33, 37, 38, 48, and 57.
There was two amendments added to this bill yesterday during the Rules
Committee. One was in Section 40 that defines and clarifies the term
“public entity”. And the section was added to Section 59, which actually
states that a legislative research commission may study any of the
following. Disciplinary hearings and the right to counsel under Part 3
of Article 1 of Chapter 116. The state personnel status of deputy
commissioners, industrial commission, pre-emption of certain government
ordinances, childcare provider criminal background checks, regulatory
requirements applicable to sanitary landfills, spirits or liquor sales
by distilleries to tour patrons, regulation of digital dispatching
services, and the professional employment organization. The Senate felt
like these needed to be studied and studied enacted. I will be more than
happy to attempt to answer any of your questions but to my knowledge
this is a good bill. There is some areas I'm sure that the House will
not agree with so I am pretty sure we will go to concurrence on this
thing. But I would ask for your support and I'll be glad to answer any
of the questions. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion of debate? Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Senator Jackson a series of questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We'll do one question at a time. Senator Jackson, do you yield for a
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do. I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK. Senator Jackson, I just had a chance to review this bill this
morning but if I look to page six, Section 153A449, there are provisions
here dealing with the ability of local governments, be it a city or a
county, it appears that it would prohibit them from having say
livable-wage ordinances. I know our city, the city of Durham, which I
was part of their city council for eight years, we adopt livable-wage
ordinances to make certain that when the city entered into agreements
with contractors doing business in the city of Durham for public
contracts, they wanted to make sure that the individuals that were
providing services for some of those contracts were paid livable wage,
to get them outside of the federal poverty guidelines. Now how does this
square with the ability of cities or counties that have livable-wage
ordinances to continue them? Because it would seem to implicitly, from
what I'm reading, perhaps prohibit that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson, you have the floor to answer the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Senator McKissick, the bill basically states a
county may not require a private contract under this section to abide by
any restrictions that the county could not impose on all employers in
the county, such as paying minimum wage or providing paid sick leave to</p>

<p id="040:00">
employees as a condition of being on a contract. To answer part of your
question, I think this is a fair statement that we require of our
contractors, because your standard of living I'm sure is much more than
my standard of living. And to deem what is a reasonable living wage is
certainly prone to interpretation, at best. So I think this is a good
provision in this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would it prohibit--because the next provision deals with cities, and
that one deals with counties--would it prohibit livable-wage ordinances
adopted by, say, a city council or by county commissioners that would be
narrowly drawn, purely to, basically public contracts and things of that
nature? Would that be prohibited underneath this language? It would
appear to be so, but is that a correct interpretation, or if you're
unable to answer that, then.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To respond, Mr. President, that is not, in my opinion, the intent of
this language. My understanding of the intent of this language is it is
not to force what I have just previously said, something that could be
deemed as interpretable in many ways of what a living wage is. We have
state laws that set, and federal laws that set minimum wage, and I think
everybody has to abide by those laws, and I think that's what this
section is trying to accomplish.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, for what purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask another question on another provision.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson, I draw your attention to page 7, sections 8A and
sections 8B, and I'm trying to determine exactly what it would
potentially prohibit in terms of local billboard regulations. Durham has
had local billboard regulations over 20 years, with amortization
provisions dealing with what type of billboards can be in that city.
Would this language prohibit local ordinances dealing with the
regulation of billboards?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In section A, it starts out &quot;notwithstanding any law to the
contrary.&quot; And the intent, from what I understand of these two
sections, section A and B, is that it will allow the billboards to cut
down trees that are maybe blocking them, but at the same token they
cannot cut down any more area than they can--have been currently under
the law we passed last session. But to answer your question, would it
prohibit it? It says in part B, &quot;No municipality, county, local, or
regional zoning authority or other political subdivision shall, without
the payment of just compensation as provided for in General Statute
136-131.1, regulate or prohibit the repair or construction of any
outdoor advertising for which there is in effect a valid permit issued
by the Department of Transportation so long as the square footage of its
advertising surface area is not increased.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Parmon, it appears that your microphone is on. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A follow-up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson, I guess the thing I'm concerned about is in that
section B that's referred to is whether if we have a city which has
enacted local billboard regulations which allows for amortization, which
is looking at the useful life of the billboard and saying if that's five
years, seven years, what have you, that after a certain period of time,
that would be just compensation that would fulfill any duty for,
relating to a taking, if that billboard was not allowed to continue to
be in existence. And if you're unable to answer that question, I respect
that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You're asking about amortization, and I'm not seeing anything in here
about that, so I can't answer what you're asking. So I'll pass on that
one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, for what purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask a question about another provision.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you would draw your attention to page 8, dealing with transportation
impact analysis. In the language here it would appear to state, and I'm
beginning at line 20 and of course it goes all the way down to 33, that
there would not be an ability for local cities to require transportation
impact</p>

Analysis perhaps as per the zoning process are to require the particular
applicant dealing with the rezoning or development plan to institute
traffic mitigation practices that would be recommended. Am I
interpreting that correctly or is this language that you can explain
further?
[Speaker Changes]: Mr President
[Speaker Changes]: Senator
[Speaker Changes] Motion please
[Speaker Changes] You have the floor. State the motion
[Speaker Changes] I move the rules be suspended to [??] and staff may
join Senator Jackson on the floor
[Speaker Changes] Senator Jackson
[Speaker Changes] Senator McKissick we will go and try get you some
answers
[Speaker Changes] Excellent. If you could that would be very helpful
[Speaker Changes] Senator Jackson, Senator McKissick has posed the
question. You need him to repeat it or do you have it?
[Speaker Changes] Yes sir I would well how wants it just brief me. Yes
sir, we need it repeated
[Speaker Changes] Would you repeat the question?
[Speaker Changes] The question is whether the local government could
continue to have transportation impact analysis conducted by an
applicant perhaps a rezoning request and if that showed that mitigation
factor is needed to be implemented would they be able to continue those
practices which currently exists commonly in many communities in your
state.
[Speaker Changes] Mr President
[Speaker Changes] Senator Brock
[Speaker Changes] I can be able to take that question
[Speaker Changes] Senator Jackson The question was posed to you. Senator
Brock indicates an ability to answer that question. Senator McKissick
would you direct your question to Senator Brock
[Speaker Changes] Sure. Senator Brock. Is the same question on the
transportation impact analysis ability of the cities throughout the
state to continue to have ordinances that require that first analysis be
conducted and second that implementation of the traffic mitigation
measures would perhaps be required based on the studies that are done
impact studies that might be conducted.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Brock has the floor to answer the question
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr President. Senator McKissick. Exactly
what’s happening is we have cities that are passing ordinances against
businesses that makes them hard to find a way for the employees   to get
to work. Many times these businesses that have low income or low income
wages is low revenue or low yield revenue businesses such as grocery
stores. If you are settling to make your employees provide
transportation, the costs of that runs up, which means that you cannot
have the grocery stores in Derm.  And I believe from what I have heard
from the concerns of people in Derm or the city of Derm [??] having the
privilege License tax this ordinance is putting grocery store out of the
city of derm. We are putting unnecessary cost of burden to the business
owners in the city.  And the city of derm actually asked what would it
take to bring the grocery store to derm.  And when we had a tax debate
privilege license is one of them and this is the other. We are putting
unfair burden upon business owners to field transportation for its
employees. That might be a question better suited for transit
authorities in Derm more so than putting unnecessary burden on the
business owners.
[Speaker Changes] Senator McKissick You have the floor for
[Speaker Changes] If I could, staff could provide some further
elimination
[Speaker Changes] Senator Jackson, can you respond to the question
[Speaker Changes] I will. Senator McKissick, if you look at [??] 21 this
is as good as I know  how to explain it along with staff said [??] and
[??] have done a great job in explaining  it to me is that No city may
enact or regulate  an ordinance will the regulation that require enforce
the financial, legal or another responsibility for the mitigation of the
employees  commute or transportation to or from  the employers work
place which may result in the employer being subjected to [??] of the
monetary and legal or may be the consequences. So basically in my
opinion to what your question is No.
[Speaker Changes] Senator McKissick what purpose do you raise?
[Speaker Changes] probably might ask one additional question about other
provision here?
[Speaker Changes] Senator Jackson, he appeals
[Speaker Changes] And of course the other provision is exempting mining
and energy commission for preparing physical notes because on page 26
and 32.if, I guess the question is why would we want to proceed in that
direction and not require that .It’s my understanding is that the
members of the mining energy commission would not like to have the
policy put in.</p>

...place and if we have ever listened or taken heed to what they have
requested as commissioners?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, I would like to ask if Senator Newton
would like to address this question. I think he had an amendment that
ran into this one and he may be able to clarify it much better than I.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick, you posed the question. Do you have
any objection to Senator Newton responding to it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] None whatsoever.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Newton, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, if he will restate the question, please, Mr.
President. I was not paying that close attention when he asked it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure, Senator Newton. It was dealing with the
provision dealing with the Mining and Energy Commission to eliminate a
requirement that they prepare, that physical notes be required. And it
is my understanding that members of that commission did not favor this
policy. Is that your understanding, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My best recollection, Senator McKissick, is that all
the parties agreed that that would be a way that, and no, actually I
don't recall it that way. I thought that, I understood that members of
the Mining and Energy Commission approved that. That that was a way that
we could expedite moving forward on the shale gas industry. To not have
it be bogged down with physical notes for things that we really don't,
at this point, have a way of measuring.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, and Mr. President, one final question to
Senator Jackson and his staff there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick, if you would, I had a couple of
members indicate they're having some trouble hearing you, so if you
could...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Hold the mic closer? Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That would help. Senator Jackson, do you yield for
another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jackson, I know that you have staff available
to you. Perhaps they could provide some further clarity on the ability
to have local, livable wage ordinances that might be adopted by
communities. Would that, in fact, be prohibited? Or if the staff, they
would...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [laughs] I think my answer I gave you awhile ago is
about as good as we're going to come up with here today, Senator
McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No further clarification?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Overall, there's some good portions of this bill, but
there's some portions of this bill that give me very deep concerns. It
looks as if the language here would prohibit livable wage ordinances by
communities when they might just say we want to make sure that the
employees that are hired by public contractors who are doing business
with the city are paid a certain amount because we want them to be above
the Federal minimum wage level, and in terms of the income they would
receive as part of public contracts. It would appear that this would
prohibit that.
It would also appear that when in terms of transportation impact
analysis and ordinances that may be enacted locally, and I emphasis
locally, because what's right for a major urban area in this State may
not be right for part of the rural area of this State. But it would
prohibit their ability to basically have any type of ordinances,
practices and policies that they would deem fit and appropriate. I think
they ought to have the ability to have.
Likewise, it looks to me, and I'm still not any clear about this, but if
you look at these issues dealing with billboards. I know Durham's had
billboard ordinances that have gone up to the court of appeals, and of
course they were decided favorably that allowed for basically a
prohibition of billboards within the city itself along major highways,
Federal highways, U.S. highways. And they were allowed for amortization
over time to compensate those that built those billboards.
It would appear, based upon my reading, and of course that's the
disadvantage when we don't go through a lot of discussion about these.
It kind of a compilation of many ideas in a single bill that that might
be prohibited, as well. And from what I have read, there's also some
concern about the lack of requirement for physical notes by the Mining
and Energy Commission.
So on the whole, when I look at these particular concerns, and I'm sure
there are others, and I guess kind of peruse this while I've been in the
Chamber this morning. But these kind of stuck out like sore thumbs. It
gives me concerns so I can not support the bill in whole and in total,
even though there are good provisions that are part of the bill. So I
would encourage members to basically vote against it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Kinnaird, for what purpose do you rise?

...have heard from many, many of my constituents in Chatham County about
this particular provision.  And that is that they will not know what
chemicals are affecting possibly their water, their wells.  This is a
very serious problem because we don't know.  And it is not right to
jeopardize the drinking water without having a knowledge of what
actually is in those chemicals.  Now I know that people have told me
that what this is is a formula, that they will release the chemicals but
not the formula.  As I understand from people that know the chemistry,
very often the formula is crucial.  So in addition to the questions
raised by Senator McKissick, because my constituents are so concerned
over this section I am going to vote against the bill. Thank you.

Senator Kinnaird, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird, were you aware that if we don't have this provision
that our current trade secret law would prohibit the disclosure of any
of the chemicals in the fracking process?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I am not aware of that, but what I have been told is that there are ways
to write a text, and also the energy and mining commission have spoken
on this, I mean I'm not the only one nor are my constituents the only
ones who are concerned over this.  And certainly we can craft something
which would allow them to have those chemicals disclosed in a way that
does not jeopardize the trade secrets but protects my constituents.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I ask a follow up if she'll yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator will you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird, were you aware that the chairman of the MEC has let us
know that he and the board is fine with this language. Were you aware of
that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I have not heard that, and I would like to contact them
further to find out so that I know that my constituents are safe and I
will further that.  But in the meantime, I'm not satisfied nor are my
constituents that this is a safeguard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I speak to the bill, Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  And, briefly, members, as it relates to this provision, this
is something that's been worked on very carefully with the MEC and all
the parties.  We have a dilemma here.  We obviously need to make sure
that we have a knowledge base of what chemicals are being used in the
hydraulic fracturing process.  And this is the mechanism that we do
that.  It's important that we know essentially what is being used, but
we don't really need to know the formula.  We don't know the secret
recipe for Coca-Cola even though people drink it, we don't know a lot of
things that we consume the exact, precise percentages of what is used
and the exact formula. But it is important that we know what's in it.
And that's what this process does.
The other thing you need to keep in mind is is that the state does not
need to possess the trade secrets.  If the state possesses the trade
secrets then the state is responsible for the litigation that will ensue
trying to get at those trade secrets.  Others need to keep the trade
secret; they need to keep the recipe.  We just need to know what the
materials are so that if there's ever an issue, we know what we're
dealing with.  This is...this is a similar method that's been used in
other places and this is a consensus point.  The fear-mongering and sky
is falling mentality of the radical environmentalists on this point is
just simply not founded.  And this is overall an excellent bill and this
is an excellent provision.  We need to vote for it, so I concur.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird, what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's easy to throw around terms like radical environmentalist.  And it's
easy to disparage people who are very concerned over their health and
their children's health.  I do not think that this is comparable to the
formula for Coca-Cola, which we all drink, and these chemicals, which
none of us would drink.  Thank you.

of these bills, Senator? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. To answer, Mr.

you Mr. President. Members, this is the, essentially the same bill or
part of the same bill that we already passed earlier in 695, that dealt
with foreign laws and the application of foreign laws in our state
courts as it relates to domestic matters. What I’m trying to tell you is
we’ve already voted on this and passed this exact language. When the
House got 695, they didn’t include this piece in it when they sent it
back to us in Senator Harrington’s bill. I forget the bill number, on
motorcycle safety. And, but this is already passed the House
overwhelmingly as well. So this is just a cleanup mechanism, putting in
this bill. I’m happy to try to answer any questions you have but
essentially it forbids the application of foreign laws in our domestic
courts, if those foreign laws would substantially impair the rights of
an individual here in the United States. And that’s as summarized as I
can put it. So I commend it to you, happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate. Senator ?? to what
purpose do you rise. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Will Senator Newton yield for a
question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Newton, do you yield? [SPEAKER

Newton, I want to make sure that I clearly understand this, so that our
members do too. But as I understand it, the supremacy clause of the
United States Constitution says that basically the federal constitution
controls everything in the United States. But secondary to that,
congressionally enacted laws and state constitutions. Now</p>

Do not the state constitution and the federal constitution dictate the
law that has to be used in the the courts of this country and since they
do, do they not prohibit the use of the law of any other country if it
contravenes the law as established by the United States or state
constitutions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, thank you Senator Blue.
There's no doubt about the supreme law of the land being the
Constitution and about the Supremacy clause and about congressional
acts. Unfortunately, we have judges from time to time as you're familiar
with as you operate well in the courtroom, as do I , that sometimes seem
to forget what the supreme law of the land is and sometimes make
improper rulings and this has happened on occasion. I believe it's been
documented a minimum of twenty seven cases from around the country where
foreign laws and in particular I think Shariah law being the most common
law that has been woven into court decisions that have worked to deprive
citizens and legal aliens of United States of their otherwise
constitutional rights, in the domestic setting in particular. This bill
is designed to address that and make it easy for the judges to
understand that they cant for example take a foreign judgment that dealt
with a domestic matter that maybe involves Shariah law that may work to
the disadvantage of say perhaps an american female citizen and under the
anti-feminine aspects that sometimes are applied in Shariah law work to
deprive a United States citizen of her constitutional rights as it
relates to a domestic matter. That's what this bill is about. To make it
really clear so some of our elected judges here in North Carolina don't
go start bringing in stuff that's not in our law.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let
me follow up Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir ?? Understand that I
support this law and playing a vote for it but I wanted to make sure
that there may have been some transgressions by trial courts in applying
the wrong law but the purpose of the tiered judicial system is so that
wiser heads apply the law as it's supposed to be.  And so, am I correct
that in using principles from conflicts of laws which basically says
which laws will apply that there is no case where an appellate  court in
this country has allowed any of these mistakenly entered judgments in
the trial courts to stand. That is, the appellate courts have all
reverted back to what they're supposed to and that is to follow the law
which is to apply the constitution of the United States, the
constitutions of the various states that may be involved  so that there
is no specific instant after judicial review where Shariah law has been
the governing law in any operable case in the country. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. Thank you Senator Blue. I'm glad to hear you'll
support the bill. I am not the bill sponsor. I agreed to carry it on the
floor and unfortunately I wasn't able to attend the second committee
hearing on this bill yesterday because I had to go to Rules Committee.
So I don't know specifically the answer to your question. I cant say yes
or no that no appellate court hasn't gotten it right in the end. What I
do know is and I'm sure you will recall that can be sometimes a very
costly proposition for an american citizen who perhaps had it done wrong
to them on the trial level. It may be beyond their resources to continue
to  to appeal it and quite honestly I can envision scenarios where a
trial court may allow something like say custody and a child may be
whisked out of the country or something like that before the citizen
would be able to do anything about it on an appellate level. you know,
sometimes you're gonna have to get a stay at a higher level and if you
cant afford to  carry it to that court you might have a problem so while
you may be entirely correct that all these cases we know about have been
corrected by the appellate courts in the end we still don't know that
that's not gonna cause alot of problems for our citizens in the
meantime. I think we aught to go ahead and just make it clear to the
trial courts that , don't drag this stuff into our courtrooms. Thank you
Senator Blue. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate?[SPEAKER

How is this going to be disseminated to the judges?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.  They have conferences.  And they have updates on laws.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird, every time we pass a law and it becomes the law of the
state of North Carolina I am certain that they are updated in their
conferences, and I would expect a learned jurist to pay attention to the
laws that we enact in this state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Comment. Debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I am not going to vote for this bill because I think the audience is
really wider.  And I think your answer indicated that the audience is a
lot wider than the district court judges of the state of North Carolina.
 I would expect that in the conference, and they do have conferences
where they are updated regularly on the new laws that we pass, this
would be allowed maybe five minutes.  And I imagine that the result will
be, in speculation, is, a first of all, that they'll laugh.  And
secondly of all, that they will probably be insulted.  So I intend to
vote against this law because I think it is unnecessary and the audience
is wider than our judicial system, the district court judges.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate.  Senator Tucker, for what purpose do you
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ask Senator Kinnaird a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird, I'm certainly not a lawyer.  I'm one of those normal
people that Senator Apodaca talks about.  I'm just concerned about that
comment that you made that it may be insulting to the judges.  They
certainly have been sworn to uphold the laws of the Constitution of both
the country and the state.  But does this in any way imply in your
comment that you would be in favor of foreign law or Sharia law being
used in the US?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I may respond?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that when we pass unnecessary laws, it is unnecessary.  We've
spent money on this.  We've spent time debating it.  Why are we doing
unnecessary laws when, as Senator Blue so correctly pointed out, they
are sworn, as we are, to uphold the Constitution.  Why are we telling
them something that they absolutely do not need?  As I say, I think the
audience is not judges.  I think the audience is a larger area.  And, if
I may go beyond my remarks here to say there are only fourteen lawyers
in this body, and yet we take a lot of criticism, which is unnecessary
under rule ten.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rise to ask Senator Newton a question, if he will yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton, as you're aware, this law goes beyond Sharia law because
it talks about all foreign law being considered in these domestic cases.
 And I present to you a hypothetical and ask you how it might be handled
under these particular provisions of this law if enacted.  We have a
couple married over in England.  Prior to marriage they execute a
premarital agreement or prenuptial agreement dealing with the
distribution of their assets, spousal support, and the like.  They both
are aware of the law of the land when it's executed.  One of the
parties, maybe both of them, move to the United States.  They
subsequently end up in a divorce proceeding.  Should their prenuptial
agreement executed in England underneath the laws of that country, which
ordinarily you could present testimony about and information about to
the district court judge presiding over the case, not be enforced?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's your question?  Your hypothetical?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator McKissick, I appreciate the question and I think it
will be illustrative to this body as well as to the public as to what
this bill is actually about.  As you are well aware.... [AUDIO ENDS]</p>

<p id="075:00">
The common law of England is the route basis for our judicial system in
the United States.  And our contract law is essentially similar to what
the laws would be of England, and I cannot in your hypothetical,
envision a system where two parties who, knowing what they're doing at
arm's length transaction, had a meeting of the minds and a prenuptial
agreement as you described, I can't imagine how our courts would rule
that a citizen's rights were being violated by such a contract.  Now if
that contract is on its face unconstitutional because it has, I can't
imagine what it would be but it has some unconstitutional provisions, I
suppose this law could possibly have some affect on the entrance of that
to our court system.  But considering their similarities between our
judicial system and the basic routes of our judicial system coming form
the common law of England, I have a very, very difficult time imagining
why that would be.  And I will add this, I think we could sit here all
day long, and probably until Sunday, and envision 3,000 hypothetical of
how this bill might come into effect.  I would just simply add, Senator
McKissick, we've already had this bill before us as a body, it's already
passed the House by overwhelming majority, it's passed this body by
overwhelming majority, and quite honestly, I don't see the point of
going through hypothetical exercise of how this would be effective to
our courts.  The point of it is to say that the law of the United
States, and the law of North Carolina is what we are going to apply
here, not everybody else's law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Follow up for further discussion or debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I no longer yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]He does not yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Well, my comment then, Mr. President, on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]You have the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]When this bill became before us previously, it was
basically dealing with spanning rules and regulations dealing with
abortions in this state, and regulation of abortion clinic's ability to
offer incureance under health benefits as Can Kids, or county
governments, city governments to offer health benefits dealing with a
with abortion or so, this particular side of what came before us really
didn't receive substantial discussion.  That hypothetical, which I just
posed, was based upon a real world factual situation in which I was
personally involved in, and was very much aware of.  Now we may be lucky
if we had a judge, because right now judges can't consider that foreign
law, and you can put it before them and they can consider it.
Unfortunately when sometimes we enact laws, we end up with unintended
consequences.  Suppose that coverlet comes from France, suppose that
coverlet came from China, or Sri Lanka, or where ever it may have been,
why should not the foreign law back here where it can be able to be
considered by a judge in determining the enforceability of an agreement?
 A valid binding agreement.  Sometimes we can have unintended
consequences that we do not anticipate, that we do not conceive of, and
that was outside of the realm of what was contemplated when a bill comes
before us.  That is what deeply concerns me about this.  If it was
simply about Sharia Law, that would be one thing, but it's not narrowed,
it's not focused.  It's about all foreign laws being considered in
domestic cases in the courts of the State of North Carolina. and that
it's overly broad, and the breathe of it goes beyond what I think most
people would contemplate and conceive of, and we need to be exceedingly
reluctant and careful when we take that giant quantum leap.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Further discussion or debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Wade, to what purpose do you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To ask the bill's presenter a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Newton do you yield?  Do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I yield, I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.  Senator, since I'm not an attorney and not
a judge, I'd really like for you to explain this a little bit in
layman's terms, and the way I'm understanding this, and I'd like for you
to let me know if this is correct, is it really allows the presiding
judge to have a better understanding?  This bill does?  And it might
result in a decrease number of appeals, and a speedier resolution, and
possibly less cost to the person, that is going before the judge and not
having to appeal, and less cost to the state?  Would that be the way we
could sum it up for a lay person?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Senator Wade.  Yes, I do think that is a fair
characterization of what the intent of this bill would be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Further discussion or debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. President, I would like to speak a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. President.  I really didn't anticipate
that we would debate this bill in this way for so long.  We as a state,
and I think it's common across the United States and at the federal
level frequently say that certain aspects can't be included in contracts
because they're void as to public policy.</p>

<p id="080:00">
We make decisions about that prior to hypothetical situations that occur
all the time. I think it's important that we don't try to read too much
into this bill, Senator McKissick. It basically states that the foreign
law can't deprive a citizen of their constitutional rights. That's
essentially what it boils down to. It doesn't say you can never, ever,
ever, under any circumstances, ever at any time, ever from any country
anywhere consider a foreign law. It doesn't say that. It just doesn't
say that. So this has been fairly narrowly crafted. It's actually been
debated quite a bit. We put this bill on for hearing in the J1 Committee
on two different occasions and debated it in the J1 Committee when it
was in 695 it was thoroughly debated in the House. This is not anything
that we need to continue to pound on and get a pound of flesh in this
body. I think we all know what the vote is. I would respectfully commend
it to the body and ask that we just go ahead and vote.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 652, Modified Judicial Discipline.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Before we get into that bill, members, Senator Bill Rabin is granted an
excused absence for the remainder of the session. Senator Newton is
recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. I hope we don't have as much today as with the
last bill but this is another provision that this body has already
passed by overwhelming majority in the [??] bill and I didn't look at
the vote but I believe that this body voted either unanimously or pretty
close to it in favor of that. This bill modifies the procedures that are
used for judicial discipline. The reason why it's back before us is
because one of the bill sponsors in the House did not like this
provision being added into the bill and so the House members that are in
favor of it agreed to have it be put into this bill so that we can move
forward with this. What this bill does is essentially remove from the
power of the judicial standards commission to issue a public reprimand
of a judge and that authority to issue a public reprimand now rests with
the Supreme Court. In other words there can still be a public reprimand
but the commission doesn't get to do it on their own. It goes to the
Supreme Court. It would make all the records investigations and
recommendations of the Judicial Standard Commission and hearings by the
Supreme Court confidential until the Supreme Court issues a public
reprimand, censor, suspension, or removal. In other words when the
Supreme Court makes it public all those records could then be made
public. And the third thing it does is it moves to the Supreme Court the
ability for the Supreme Court Justices to be disciplined. I know that
there is some opposition from some of the Court of Appeals judges and
members of the Judicial Commission but other than those who are losing
the authority and the control over it I don't know of any opposition. I
remind you, again, that I believe this body voted overwhelmingly in
favor of these provisions before. I hope I've addressed everybody's
questions but, if not, I will be glad to answer any that you may have.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton, make sure I understand this. If we got a judge who is
applying Sharia law and somebody takes them before the Judicial
Standards Commission then the Judicial Standards Commission can't censor
that person for not following the constitution and not applying the
proper law but it has to go through another whole</p>

<p id="085:00">
And that is somebody has to petition the Supreme Court to take another
look at this judge who's been determined by his peers to be misbehaving.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for your questions, Senator Blue. Actually, I don't think
that's right. I think what it would do, it would prevent a public
disclosure of that censure. Not that they couldn't censure them, but a
public disclosure of all of that until the Supreme Court proved it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On the contrary, I think this is not a good bill, and I will tell you
why. You were just talking jokingly about Sharia law, and of course the
point of the last bill was so the public would know that everybody is
against Sharia law. But this is very serious. There's a reason that the
judicial commisssion and a lot of the Court of Appeals and a lot of
people in the legal profession around the state are against this. For
the very reason that you took the public out several layers down the
road. Now judges are elected. This has consequences. The public, very
often, will not know, as a result of this bill, between an election and
the final disposition in this bill. This weakens the right of the public
to know what is happening with our judges. I think this is not a good
bill. I think we should vote against it. If the judiciary is against it,
we know that there's a reason that they have thought about it. And that
is that the public is removed by several layers. So I think it is not a
good bill. I think there is a good reason they are against it, and I
intend to vote against this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate? Senator Tillman, for what purpose do you
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rarely, Senator Kinnaird, do I agree with you. The more light we can
shine on the judges' behavior, you're gonna bump into the Supreme Court
every time you need to have a complaint, and then we can't ever know
what it is because it's sealed. I don't like that and I'm going to vote
against it myself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, may I speak a second time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton has the floor to speak a second time on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think it's an excellent job by a couple of people in the Court of
Appeals who don't like the fact that they can't blackmail judges into
agreeing to whatever reprimand they want to give, with the threat of
publicly embarrassing them over nothing. What you're not aware of is
that there has been a number of cases where there have been false
accusations, or twisted accusations, Senator Tillman, and a few members
of the Judicial Commission have said, &quot;If you don't accept what we
do, we're going to publicly admonish you and embarrass you, especially
right before an election&quot;, okay? This does not have anything to do
with whether or not a judge is disciplined. This has to do with, it
would be up to the Supreme Court as to whether or not that would be made
public. Often times, these censures and these reprimands are agreed to
simply to avoid it being made public, even thought the judge may not
feel that that is appropriate. But if there is something that the public
needs to know, there is absolutely nothing that would prevent it from
being made public, that all the Supreme Court has to do is approve that.
They are, after all, are the chief arbiters of discipline within our
judicial system. They're the ones that set up the Judicial Commission.
They're the ones that make the rules of court, and so I would encourage
you, Senator Tillman, to -- I understand what you said, I agree with you
that things should be made public when they need to be made public,
okay? Well, I apologize for that, if we'll lose your vote, I guess we'll
lose your vote, but it would be a mistake not to pass this. I will
remind you also that it is not correct what was proposed to you, that
the judiciary is against this. That is false. This came to us from the
judiciary. The vast majority of judicial officials want this, including
members of the Supreme Court. I commend the bill to you.

anywhere to go. I'm voting against this.

Senator Newton, as a fellow member of the bar I did not mean to imply
that the judicial branch and especially judicial standards is
blackmailing judges. I’m sure that he misspoke and I don’t want to give
you the impression that that is what’s going on.  What they do, it is a
process to determine whether  a judge has stepped out of bounds in the
way that he rules or in his conduct. Whether its ethics or other things
related to the conduct of judicial officials.  They have formal hearings
and they give and take and negotiate as you in any other judicial
proceeding to work out a deal so that they can accomplish what should be
accomplished, whether it’s getting a person to pay closer attention to
the way he or she rules, or how they conduct themselves on the bench or
other related stuff.. But  I don’t think its blackmail when the official
body that’s constituted to deal with these ethical and conduct issues
suggests that if you don’t shape up and fly right, this is what’s going
to happen to you.  It’s just part of the tools they’re using and again
I’m sure that Senator Newton didn’t intend to use the word blackmail its
just, we get a little excited sometimes when we talk cuz I wouldn’t want
you to believe that that kind of process is going on in the judicial
branch.

committee. Does this, does this make it easier to get an interbasin
transfer in any area outside of the coastal area?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir, this doesn't, and this is just for modifying those that are in
existence. This is not applying to new interbasin transfers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister president?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd like to ask the bill sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabon do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr Rabon, is there an easy way for you to tell us what the major changes
were from the House?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What the major changes were in the House? There was a, there was a
section added in the House, the final section, if you look at your bill,
was added by the House, otherwise we went right with our bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabon do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm, what, Senator, what was the impact of the final section that was
added?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The impact on that final section has something to do with the Western
part of the state and I believe it eliminates or allows the use of a
wastewater treatment and a sewer treatment in the same county.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate. Hearing none, question for the Senate is
the passage of the motion to concur in the House committee substitute,

no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. Clerk will record the
vote. Bryant aye. Newton. Thirty three having voted in the affirmative
and none in the negative, the motion to concur passes and the bill will

clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate bill 379, expansion of natural gas and propane for agriculture.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister president. Members, the report that came back on this
is, I'll briefly explain it to you, this current language will create an
economic development tool to facilitate new or expanded natural gas
service and propane accessibility to agricultural products, and it's
only for agricultural projects all across the state, so it could be in
Wake County, it could be in Orange County, it could be in Sampson
County, or it could be in Rutherford County. So it's just for
agricultural products and it does not create any new money, it just
allows the commerce department and all the economic development engines
we have in the state to utilize up to five million dollars of all the
funds available for agricultural products. And I would ask for your
support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
During this session, you've done very well. Is there anything else we
can do for the agricultural community so that, we'll be willing to stay
another week or two if not.

have done this session for agriculture. But when you go to lunch after a
while, I want you to thank me.

voted on again. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It would be taken from the calendar.
