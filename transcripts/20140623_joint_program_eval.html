Let me call PED Oversight to order. First remarks, Representative
Howard? No remarks. I have none. You have in your folders the minutes
from the June 9th meeting. What is the…? I have a motion from
Representative Lewis to approve the minutes of June 9th, seconded
Senator Hise. All in favor please say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed, no. Thank you. Next Dr. McGorty, update on
PED projects. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Good afternoon Mr. Chairman
and members. I’m Kiernan McGorty, a principle evaluator with the Program
Evaluation Division. Today I’ll provide just a five-minute status update
on all the projects on our 2013-15 work plan, and you should have in
front of you in your packet a copy of the slides for the presentation
and then our 2013-15 work plan as amended. The current work plan
includes 21 projects. These projects have either been completed, are
underway or are pending. Four of these projects were legislatively
mandated, as indicated by the asterisk next to them. The Program
Evaluation Division has completed five projects so far, which produced a
total of nine reports which were all presented to this committee. We
have six projects underway and I’ll go into a bit more detail on each of
those now. The division divided the project reviewing adult alcohol and
drug abuse programs, prescription drug abuse and programs for veterans
among three teams. If you’ll recall, in April the first team reported on
issues with the state system for monitoring the abuse of prescribed
controlled substances. The second team is developing an inventory of
state programs and services for veterans and their families, and the
third team is doing the mandated review of the most efficient and
effective ways to operate inpatient alcohol and drug abuse treatment
programs or aid acts. The project on local child support enforcement
programs is reviewing operational effectiveness and efficiency of county
child support enforcement offices, and the project on overnight respite
mandated us to determine the success of a legislative pilot that
authorized adult daycare facilities to offer overnight respite services.
Another project reviews licensor fees for occupations regulated by the
department of insurance that are not directly related to the insurance
industry. We also have a mandated project on the feasibility of a single
occupational licensing agency, and this project is looking at the
structure, organization and operation of those various independent
occupational licensing boards and considering the feasibility of
establishing a single state agency to oversee to operation of all or
some of the occupational licensing boards. In addition, this evaluation
will identify licensing boards that should be eliminated or consolidated
with another board. And earlier this month, this committee added the
personal services contract to our work plan, which is reviewing all
non-I.T. personal services contracts for compliance with state laws per
review, approval and reporting. So just to give you an idea of what to
expect for the remainder of the year, the Program Evaluation Division
expects to deliver seven more reports by the end of this year. In July,
the committee will receive the report on local child support
enforcement. In September, the committee will receive the mandated study
on the overnight respite pilot. From the three-part series on adult
alcohol and drug abuse programs, prescription drug abuse and programs
for veterans, the second report on veterans’ programs will be presented
in September and the…</p>

<p id="05:00">
A third report on Aidex will be in October. And by the end of the year
we also plan to present the two mandated projects on licensure fees for
non insurance occupations and the feasibility of a single occupational
licensing agency along with your recent addition to our work plan of
reviewing the use of personal services contracts. To update you on what
might be coming our way based on this short session the Senates version
of the appropriations act includes three studies for this committee to
consider putting on the work plan. One is a study of the ways to improve
North Carolinas medical examiners system and best practices in death
investigations. Another is the study of the benefits and drawbacks of
requiring local alcohol beverage control boards to redirect payments
they currently send to DHHS to instead send them to the ABC commission
and the purpose of those funds is for substance abuse research,
treatment, and education. And another study is on North Carolinas
shellfish lease and franchise program, looking at greater program
efficiency and effictiveness. The Senates version of the appropriations
act also directs this committee to include in the work plan a study of
the states various programs related to housing, for duplication and
gaps. And lastly, the regulatory reform act along with two other bills
directs this committee to include in the work plan a study of the
benefits that may result from the merger of Public Water Systems and
Waste Water Collection and Treatment Works. If you want to take a closer
look at the divisions current evaluations you may do so on our website
where the status of each project is listed under our current evaluations
page. For projects that are under way you just click on the link that
says weekly update to get a summary of the activities completed by the
team for the previous week. And that concludes the status report. I
would be happy to answer any questions at the direction of the chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Questions from the committee? Senator Tarte [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Just one as the freshman on the back bench, Whats the criteria
to determine which study groups we would proceed with? Related to things
on slide nine. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For you all to determine what you want
to include in our work plan? What we've done in the past is we've done a
survey of the members of the committee to have them prioritize and that
sets the order of the work plan and determines, usually we take about
twenty projects on the work plan. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So Shirley wasn't
correct when she told me she gets to decide? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It's a
matter of cumulative voting actually. Other questions, Senator Hanes
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do we have any sort of timeline on the start of
pending projects? I know some of these are starting to roll off ??? the
timeline but do we have any on the start of pending projects? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] So what we've tried to do today is indicate to you what you
should expect to hear from us by December. We are also, that slide where
I said what's happening during short session, some of those would then
become mandated projects for us that might delay the start of others on
that pending list but we'll have a better idea at the conclusion of
short session where we stand on new projects that some, there was a
slight nuance on how I presented it to you. Some of them are for you to
consider and some of them are just directing that they be put on the
work plan. And so we'll have a better idea of which of the pending
projects we would get to. If you look back at the pending projects list,
they are in the prioritization order that you voted on initially. So
that would give you some indication. And they can of course rollover to
your 20, 15, 16ths work plan cycle. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Other questions?
Seeing none. Thank you Karen. I was remiss earlier, I did not introduce
our Sergeants at Arms, let me do that. We have with us from the House
Reggie Sills, John Brandon.</p>

John? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Martha Gattison and Dave Collins, and from the
senate we have Matt Erber, Howe Roach, and Ernie Sheryl. Welcome to HW.
Thanks for all the help you give to us. I also need to recognize out
state auditor who is here with us, and for once we've not invited her to
make a presentation of her audits, but I am confident we will do so
again in the very near future and we've had some conversations about
some of that. If we try to work in sort of an integrated fashion in
doing that sort of thing. Okay, thank you. Next on out agenda is what
we're all waiting for I suspect. Mr. Joe Colletti, Deputy director of
NC Gear is here to introduce us to NC GEAR, the status and we'll open
the mater to questions at some point later on. Thank you. Mr. Colletti,
welcome. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. chairman, and Representative
Howard, other members. Also, I want to thank John Turcotte and all the
program evaluation staff for their assistance so far in the work that
we've been doing, the cooperative relationship that we've been able to
have with them, and recommending that I volunteer under the bus this
afternoon. I appreciate that and look forward to answering your
questions. Hopefully before you ask them. I am, as the chairman said,
the deputy director of NC Gear, and GEAR stands for Government
Efficiency And Reform. We were created last year in the budget and I
will go through some of those details, but I wanted to point out that
Christina Dorfhueber is leading the project from the Deloitte side,
Deloitte is a consulting company that we hired, and she's here to answer
the questions that I can't, but hopefully that's the only time that you
have to hear from her. Hopefully I can answer everything appropriately
and not stumble too much. I wanted to go into some of the why of NC GEAR
before getting into some of the specific pieces. And you have handouts
with you that have a lot of text on them that can help you understand
what we're doing. I've chosen a slightly different way to present the
information here in person. But this is using a program called Prezi, so
this is still available online at any time that you want to use it in
addition to the handouts that you have. I want to start with a quote
form C.S. Lewis and he said that we all want progress, but progress
means getting nearer to the place you want to be. If you're on the wrong
road the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive man. And
it's one of those things that we don't always want to acknowledge, but
that sometimes we have to acknowledge and that's one of the reasons that
NC GEAR was created. Because sometimes we don't event have the basic
information to tell if we are on the right path or not. And so every few
years we have to come back and take a look. Are we on the right path? Do
we have the information that tells whether we're going in the right
direction. Getting closer to the goals that we have for state
government, for the agencies, for the programs that have been created
along the way. And what becomes difficult when we don't have that basic
information is what I saw in one of the books that my son is reading for
school. It describes a company that, well, I'll just read it. It says
&quot;It's very easy to be blinded to the essential usefulness of some
of these things by the sense of achievement you get from getting them to
work at all.&quot; In other words, their fundamental design flaws are
hidden by their superficial design flaws. There are things that you as
state employees that working as one for the past 18 months, talking with
folks throughout state government. One of the things that happens is
that we're so excited when we get something to work the way that it's
supposed to work that when we're done with it we say &quot;Boy, that
wasn't even the right thing.&quot; So, how do we get doing the right
thing?</p>

<p id="15:00">
To compound that and to add one more piece to the difficulties that we
face and why we have NC Gear is that we have some significant fiscal
challenges and policy challenges facing the state. One of those is
Medicaid as you all are a lot more than familiar with. One of those is
the infrastructure that we have in the state, transportation, the state
buildings and the IT infrastructure, making sure that those things work
and are well funded and able to provide the services we need. What is
our unfunded health and pension promises to future state retirees?
That’s a large outstanding liability that we have. Then a fourth one is
our reliance on federal funds and other receipts that are not as
reliable as a source of funding, so with all of those things making
governments reform essential. Last year Governor McCrory in his
inaugural address said that we have an opportunity to transform our
culture of government through a top to bottom assessment of efficiency,
effectiveness, and customer service. The three words there are important
because efficiency is that we’re getting somewhere fast, effectiveness
is that we’re getting to the right place, and customer service is that
we’re doing it in the right way. For those of us within state government
we are also taxpayers and we want to make sure our money is being used
properly as much as anybody else does. We are customers of each other
within state government too. So when we run into bad customer service
that effects how we’re able to ?? our jobs. We know that when we provide
poor customer service that it affects the way that everybody across the
state deals. We want to make sure that what we provide, the experience
that we have with our taxpayers, with the people who come to our
offices, is the best experience that we can be able to provide. That
statement led to the budget last year and in the budget document you all
provided a description of what NC Gear should do. This is the whole
section that deals with us and it essentially asks us that without using
the governor’s term of transform, we have quite an extensive mandate and
we appreciate that. We’re asked to take a look at the statutory
authority of the entire executive branch, that’s receipts supported
agencies, that’s non state entities receiving state funds, entire
departments, similar functions in multiple places throughout state
government, taking a look at the statutory  authority, the source of
funding, the outcomes that are trying to be accomplished, the
organization of state government, internally within a department and
externally across departments, our relationship with local government
and how we provide services. Then we were asked to take a look at
opportunities for restructuring whether that’s combining things and
three specific areas that we were asked to take a look at were human
resources, information technology, and state purchasing operations and
management. From the last three months of going around to state agencies
and getting their feedback about where we should be looking, those were
exactly three of the areas that we should be taking a look at. Those
were needless to say some areas that we've heard a lot about. Our focus
with all of this effort is not about making government bigger or smaller
is about making it more effective. Again it’s providing the right
service to the right person at the right time and if we can do it with
good customer service that’s an added bonus and we want to be able to do
that. In order to be able to do that work we have an RFP process, the
legislation provided us with money for both years of the biennium and
said to hire a contractor. We went through a competitive bidding
process. We had an RFP that we issued in December. We received a number
of responses to that. We went through those with a small committed that
included Auditor Wood, included the state CIO Chris Estes, included the
state Human Resource Director Neil Allan –</p>

<p id="20:00">
And included D. Jones from the department of administration and so
Auditor Wood we thank you for your assistance with that, and it was
extremely helpful given the direction of the legislation and the focus
on HRIT purchasing. We needed to make sure we had those three groups
covered in understanding that we could address those areas and then the
auditors help was invaluable being able to understand where state
government needed help outside those areas and how we should be taking
look at the process of evaluating all of state government. And with that
process again we had a number of bids. We went through best and final
offers so that we could achieve a better direction on that and what we
felt was better use of our funds than what was originally...that what we
had originally been provided. And going through that process we chose
the Lloyd based on their experience not only in North Carolina where
they've worked with the state on a number of projects, worked with the
chamber of commerce to take a quick look at where the state could
improve last year at the end of 2012 and into early 2013. Have worked
with Mecklenburg county. Christina ??? herself has done some of this
similar work in Kentucky. The rest of the team has done work in
Minnesota. They've worked in Wisconsin, they've worked with Canada,
they've worked with a number of states in specific areas as well large
agencies and university systems. So they provided a sense of an
experience with what the rest of the country is doing and what they've
seen work in other places that can combine with what we've been able to
learn as state employees and working with the rest of state government
about where we should be focusing. And the way that we've been working
with them we brought them on in the beginning of April. And our team
within the office of state budget management we formed in November,
started bringing people on in November, and started taking a look at
state government on our own in trying to get an understanding of where
we should be focusing. And when we brought the Lloyd in we started going
to individual agencies to get another sense, to get that ground work
with them, to introduce the Lloyd to what our state agencies are doing.
And to introduce the agencies to the NC Gear process a little bit more.
And that started in April. We've met with just about every state agency
and both cabinet and council of state. We've also met with some of the
boards and specific offices in different places. We started that, again
at the beginning of April that continued through this month. In addition
this month we created a state wide assessment that gives us an
understanding of the data and the information that's available in the
state that we already know, that within state government, that we can be
able to use to provide further direction in our analysis in helping us
figure out what opportunities will actually provide, to borrow a phrase,
enough juice for this squeeze. And we have that going on. And then we
take a look, we do the evaluation based on what we've learned from
agencies, what we've seen from this assessment and from what we've
learned from speaking directly with state agencies. From what the Lloyd
has learned in other places, from looking at the academic research and
from the work of think tanks across the country and within North
Carolina left and right about what we should be doing. We'll be going
through that process and then we should have a report from them towards
the end of September that we then incorporate into the budget process
and what the governor would recommend. So this is the large picture of
it and the yellow dots on this slide are some specific places where we
interact again with state agencies to get validation about the ideas
that we've been developing. We've been able to meet with some of the
legislators as well on the way, to get your feedback and to make sure
that we're going in the right direction and haven't missed anything in
that area. So that's our current work right now is getting the
participation...</p>

<p id="25:00">
Of everybody, and the importance of working with state agencies is
making sure that, once we come up with brilliant ideas, obviously. Come
up with good design for how those ideas should be implemented, convince
you all that they are brilliant ideas and that they're well executed,
and have you pass them in legislation next year. Then we have to go back
to the agencies and make sure these get implemented. And that is a
challenge in itself, is the implementation. As you all know, whether
you're new here or have been here for 20 years, since the first GPAC
report or any of the previous ones, that there are numerous
opportunities for these things to fall apart. We've had a number of
reports end up as great doorstops we've been told. Or look really nice
on the bookshelf or really good on a desk- we're studying this. And
given the fact that y'all over the last few years because of necessity
with the state of the economy have taken care of all the easy things,
that leaves us with a lot harder task in front of us. So we're really
focusing on how do we get the ideas that we have implemented. As you may
have noticed, there were a couple of ideas that we had incorporated into
the governors budget proposal this year. And we're also working with
state agencies already on some of the specific needs that they have.
Whether that's consolidating leases and consolidating properties.
Working together across agencies when they have specific programs that
they should be coordinating, the state-wide assessment that I mentioned
before, and we also have a website which is available now for state
employees and for the general public to provide new ideas for us to take
a look at. And I'll show you that website, it is ncgear.nc.gov, and as
you can see we have a simple form, it's just explain your idea, tell us
where you think it might fit, if it fits anywhere- if you don't know,
tell us that too. We can probably figure than out. Who might benefit
from it? Ask about the types of reforms that might be involved whether
that's cost saving, improve customer service, policy regulation. And
then for state employees we also ask if they have supporting
documentation so that we can follow that up. Ask for name, email
address, and ask to indicate if they're a state employee. In the state
employee one, there's a program that's been relatively dormant, it's
called NCthinks, but that's something that, after we adopt the idea, if
we see something that's worthwhile, we will provide that as well to the
NCthinks program, which is an evaluation after the fact to see the
savings that were accomplished from an idea, and employees have been
able to receive rewards from that in the past. So we're gonna pass those
things along. In the coming months as we're going through the rest of
that work, next month we will be conducting some ideation sessions.
Ideation sessions, these are things where we'll be taking a look at kind
of big-picture questions in a few specific areas. One is human
resources. How do we, the processes that are involved in that, and the
systems, the organization and how we handle total compensation, how we
handle workers compensation, and other specific questions in that area.
What is the infrastructure of the state? One is the connection as you
all have been taking a look at it. Or time between education and the
workforce, and the entire spectrum there. So those are four of the areas
we will be taking a look at. Our IT infrastructure and the security of
that. We'll be taking a look at something we call economic dynamism. And
so how do we as a state interact with local governments and make sure
that we have a strong, violent economy, in addition to incentives. So,
those are some of the pieces that we have coming up. The report from
DeLoy that has some of the evaluations and the recommendations should be
to us by the end of September. We go through the budget process and our
final report to</p>

General Assembly is due in February of next year so that there should be
plenty of time to work that into the rest of the legislative process.
So, with that I look forward to your comments, your ideas, look forward
to continuing to work with you and we appreciate again the opportunity
to present today and to provide you some background on what we’ve been
able to accomplish and what he hope to be able to accomplish through
this process. Sir, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You Mr. Coletti and let me say just a couple of
things before we get to questions. One, you mentioned [GPAC], there are
only a couple of us here who remember [GPAC] and that was some time ago.
For the folks who are here who don’t know [GPAC], the performance audit
was done in 91-92. Lots of information came back. Lots of
recommendations, very little activity one of which was to look at GPAC
again in 10 years and it took 15 years to look at it again. With the
[GPAC2] in about 06 and as a result of [GPAC2], actually this committee
itself in this section of General Assembly was formed. So, I just as a
matter of history to you because and it’s charged with ongoing review
and I might add that it is our desire for NC GEAR and this committee to
work together in some reasonable way as we go forward and in many ways
and in conjunction with the auditor which we’ve already indicated. So,
thank you for mentioning that. Okay. Let’s start with questions from the
committee. Senator Tarte.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Chair. Mr. Coletti, it’s always a
pleasure to have you here and the folks from Deloitte.  As a former
partner at ?? and Deloitte, I have a deep appreciation for this, but
looking at the work plan you’re one week away from starting to build
your quick glance. Having done this, I’m guessing 80% of everything you
know you’re gonna give us in September, you already know the answer to.
And what I’d like you to do is share with us, if you can, some of the
things you’re leaning towards that are top priorities now and the quick
glance because I’ve been here an year and a half and I can go through a
?? of things from renegotiating the IT contract, from consolidating ERP
platforms to archiving ?? paper. I’ve done a list of probably 20 things
right here that can be significant. So, I’d love to know what the
committee or the consultants think right now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Because we’re still in process and we’ll be working
with the agencies themselves so that the ?? will be things that the
agencies are either working on or can be able to accomplish. Some of
that will be things that they already have legislative authority to do
and that’s what we’re looking at as ??. So, yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So you don’t wanna share?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Don’t have anything specific to share at this point
with you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There will be more opportunities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Plenty of opportunities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, because we meet once a month, whether we’re in
session or not. Senator Hise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What’s been the total state expenditure right now on
NC GEAR and what are your requests that we currently have coming up in
the budget for additional funding.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Within the budget was granted $4 million over the
biennium. We have spent, thinking about combined, we’ve probably through
about a million dollars.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just second part of that and what are the additional
request. I know that IT there was a request for an additional 2 million.
I was trying to see where.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Of those pieces, yeah. The IT has 2 million dollars
that it’s looking for with restructuring and with an ERP planning and
that as far as I know is the only additional request that’s pending.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Excuse me, pending before you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We may be incorporating some other IT work as well
with a small addition as much as 100,000 dollars of additional funding
on that side. But I believe that is already budgeted.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for coming in and
being here. Could you.</p>

I’m looking over the list of suggestions of… I’m assuming… are these the
suggestion from the consultant, or…? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No ma’am.
Actually, thank you for pointing that out. In April of this year, we did
provide an interim report to the General Assembly, and what Madam Chair
is looking at is an executive summary that we provided on one page that
provides a brief of what we’re looking to accomplish, and on the back of
that is a fairly small print list of what the cabinet agencies already
had underway through 201. So what we looked at was knowing that this
effort is building on the work of the rest of state government, through
the things that you all have passed, through the work of program
evaluation division, through the work of the auditor and through the
work of the cabinet and the council of state agencies, and we chose to
take a look at the cabinet agencies because we had a fairly set timeline
there. They started in January of last year and we knew what things were
new, whereas if we were taking a look at council of state, because
they’d been around, in office for longer, they have a number of projects
that are well-established and in development. So the list that you’re
referring to, Representative Howard, is actually a list of projects that
cabinet agencies had begun last year, and some of them were completed by
the time we were writing about it, and some of them are still in
progress. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you because looking at the list, I
just noticed for out of interest, Program Evaluation had made a
recommendation to sell this helicopter years ago and of course it never
happened. I don’t believe you’ve been able… you’re not going to sell it
on eBay, I don’t believe. You might. I do have… [SPEAKER CHANGES] An
additional question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re
recognized for a series. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m confident there will be one. [SPEAKER CHANGES] There may be. Are we
going to have a list of suggested savings that’s going to be done
independently by the consultant to justify…? Four million dollars is a
lot of money for the finance people, and we’re trying to determine that
we’re going to get our money’s worth, so will there be a list of
suggestions, and then tied to that list there’s going to be an actual
dollar amount that would be anticipated that we would be saving if we
had the strength to actually put it in place? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes
ma’am. In the report there will be the recommendation and a dollar
amount to go with that, and that’s one of the criteria that we’ll be
using to evaluate things as well. We want to make sure who’s being
impacted by changes, what the value of that is, and the time that it
takes to implement. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If you don’t mind telling us, how
much of the four million dollars… You said you’ve spend what, about one
million so far? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes ma’am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Could you
tell us – maybe nobody else cares but those of us on Finance care – out
of that one million dollars, how much has been paid to the consultant
and how much has been used for the staff of NC Garrett? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Well ma’am, the staff of NC Garrett is composed of two
permanent, fulltime members of OSBM who are working with us on this
project in addition to some of their other duties, and three of us who
are time-limited positions, tied strictly to NC Garrett, and we also
have a temporary position, and so we’re relatively cheap as things go,
and the consulting team has brought in a number of people to fill out
our team, to provide the…</p>

....technical background, the technical skills and the understanding of
processes to be able to accomplish what we have to accomplish in the
short time that we have. So the majority of that money has gone to them
because there's a lot more of them and they're providing a number of
services to us to fill us out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Could you also tell us what's been done to minimize
the administrative time and expense on the agencies and universities
that with all the data submissions and the interviewing with staff? Do
you have that under control?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We're working with agencies to not be too much of a
burden upon them especially given that we recognize that our timing of
requests while you all are in session is maybe not optimal. But what we
asked them to do and one of the keys with the assessment is that it is
truly an assessment of where we are, so we're asking them not to go
through too much effort to re-create things, that if there is something
that has been provided to a program evaluation, to the auditor, to
another source, point us to that data source and we will use that. If
there is, so we're doing everything that we can to minimize it and we
recognize that no matter what we do it is going to be a burden and we
appreciate everything that they're doing to assist us with this, we hope
that when we're all done, that the product of what we accomplish with
the agencies is more than worth the time and effort that everybody's
been taking.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? Follow-up Mr. Chair
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there anybody on the ?? team or ?? that has
legislative drafting ?? quite often we get these nice ?? they're
spiral-bound nice reports, color copy and they're filed in the library
and that's the end of that. Is there anybody on your team or ?? team
that literally has legislative drafting and implementation experience?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well within the budget office we have our interaction
with bill drafting and so we've been through the process and from the ??
team there are, do you all have former legislators? Yeah, they have
former legislators and they've provided some model legislation to us in
specific areas already so there is legislative language that goes with
that and my previous experience as well I've drafted model legislation
which is not exactly the same thing but yeah we have some drafting
experience.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Who else is gonna be at the table other than your
office and the consultant? Is anybody else gonna be at the table when
you're drafting this legislation when the legislation's being developed?
I mean, where's it gonna come from?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well we'll be working with the governor's staff
directly on anything that goes into legislation and anything that goes
into the budget itself would go through the Office of State Budget and
the rest of the governor's staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hurley
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. On page five you have put
priority one agencies, was that because they're so big and there's so
many questions about different things and will they all be going on at
the same time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] They are all going on at the same time, again that's
one of the reasons why we had to bring in an outside team is to help us
be able to man all of these efforts that we're trying to accomplish. And
priority one agencies yes, are based largely on size. We figured if we
go through those we've got over half the budget and we can accomplish
that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Others? I don't have this in front, are you working
with the court system or that structure in any fashion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No sir we just are looking at the executive branch so
neither legislature nor the court system.

Gram inventory we'd, they tried to do that and never got threw I'm just
curious if there's a program inventory out there that has been
identified or completed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well uh we are, one of the advantages that we have is that we are
building on a  structure that the offices state budget has been working
with agencies on for a number of years called program budgeting and so
we have uh some, some self identifying programs from uh, from every
adjacency um we have not done the type of uh evaluation of those
programs that that program evaluation would normally consider but we
have a working list of programs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. uh senator Clark.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Um miss Clay, here it appears you guys are going to be pretty lie.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We've been pretty busy so far now we'll continue from base.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Prioritize opportunities, can you amplify that a little more about how
exactly is that going to be done and who's involved.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ya that is the work that we'll be doing uh taking a look at the the
dollars that are involved. That's what we'll be at that what we.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Say we? Who is that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh oh sorry sorry uh the those must on ends on NC Gear are state
employees and and the Delore consulting team will be taking a look at
these pieces uh and then we'll be the validation comes and working with
the agencies themselves on these uh and we'll be asking for further uh
input will be comparing notes on some of those things probably with
program evaluation with the auditors office uh and others who have
experience in those in those areas.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
By chances the general assembly going to have any incite into this
process or look into this process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We would love to incite from Yelen and and and have meeting with anybody
who uh who's who's in that in those areas so on IT questions we would
like to get your feedback.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay others. um let okay. Starting to represent Howard
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wish I had more time I apologize uh for not having more time
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We can always come back
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No you don't want to do that
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No Actually you'll have. I'm confident you'll have the opportunity.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Um i just want to be sure that I understand um the intern report the
executive summary with the attachments and the thing that's in the
actual report. Is it just a rehash in of things that are already in
place? I don't I mean I'm not trying to bacher you but I I just don't
see anything that grabs that grabs you, there's no new ideas that I see
in here. Um was that the purpose of the intern report to rehash whats
already in place or already being done or already being planned.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The purpose of the intern report was to provide you with a with a an
idea of where we were going with our work uh let you know what we were
able to accomplish which at that point was uh what was that the the uh
significant accomplishment for us at that point uh learning the
processes of contracting uh within state government was bringing on the
consulting team to assist us with the rest of it and again to to put the
our work in context yes we did want to point out how it builds on the
work that's already being done and so that's that's were the existing
pieces come in.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This one final comment
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes mam
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Uh have have we spent the last year and about a million dollars um
getting everybody up to speed of whats already in place in North
Carolina so you can move forward?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No mam. The the the money uh we we brought Deloitte on at the beginning
of April uh so that there's the again the bulk of our money is is going
is in the contract uhh as apposed to the the treat the those of us on
staff uh within state government uh which is again about uh about uh
four about four staff who are signed too NC Gear uh as NC Gear to who
are with the OSBM who don't get.</p>

… against our budget, as I’ve been able to tell by looking at the
dollars, so the interim report was to give you an idea of what we were
looking at and how we were going to accomplish that, and since then,
bringing the Deloitte team on with their staff and working with the
state agencies in an intensive manner starting in April. That’s where
most of the money has been. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So when you bring your
next report that, we’re going to see new material. Is that our
anticipation, since…? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We anticipate that next February
when we have our final report to you, that there’s the full set of
recommendations that we receive from Deloitte, that we have a good
indication of where we’re going with those as well, and the steps that
have been able to be accomplished between now and then in some of those
specific areas, the quick wins that Senator Tarte mentioned and a number
of other areas. So that’s the reporting schedule that we have, is one in
this February, one next February, and we’ll be doing a lot of work
between now and then. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I say Senator Clark, but Senator
Randleman, you look like you want to ask a question, and I want to
recognize you to ask if you want to ask a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
really do not have a question but I am just overwhelmed with all of
this. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Clark. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
guess I’m slightly confused. Did you mention a final report in February
of 2013? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] What is the
difference between that final report and the final report that’s due on
the end of September? [SPEAKER CHANGES] What is at the end of September
is Deloitte’s report to us based on the work that we’ve done with them.
From that point until February, from the legislation that was passed
last year, there was a February report of this year and a February
report next year, and the February report next year will incorporate
their ideas and should be able to give you a sense of what we’ve been
able to, as we’ve vetted that through the state agencies afterwards and
with the Governor’s office, what we’ll be looking to get accomplished in
the legislative session. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So you guys…? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] We’ll be doing additional work after they leave, yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m trying to understand what it is you’re going to be
doing between September and February. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s working
through the budget process, seeing what other reorganization and how do
we actually implement this, and working on that implementation with
agencies. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And this may
be more of just a comment than others, and I think you’ve heard where
Chairman Howard and others’ questions have gone, what they’re looking
for, kind of looking for that answer. When we sit here in February, if
we get a report back that doesn’t have new directions that the
legislature has not considered, new areas for potential consolidation
and spending, savings that is a bold direction for this state, then
whatever we spend, four to six million dollars, will have been a
complete waste of money and it’ll find itself on another shelf, and so
that’s what we’re asking for, that’s what we’re looking for – not a
rehash of other things. I could not be more excited about the potential
that exists here in this process, but I think we’re already starting to
hear how this final report will be evaluated. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
I realize yours was a statement and not looking for a response, but our
intent is the Governor’s intent, and that’s why the language that he
used in creating it in his inaugural was looking to transform state
government, and so if next February you don’t get much from me, then I
haven’t done my job, and yes, we’ve wasted everyone’s time and money, so
I truly do not anticipate that at that point. This is an early request
for us to come to you, which is right after while we’re still in the
process of gathering information. We haven’t even gone into the next
step, and so that’s why I haven’t been comfortable to provide any more
explicit direction about where we’ll be going, because we still have to
figure out which of these ideas that have been brought to us are worth
pursuing and which ones will actually accomplish something, but I think
everybody that we’ve spoken with within the agencies and across state
government agrees with you that we’re here to not…</p>

... have another set of doorstops and documents that sit on a shelf.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me ask, who will be assigned to assist state
agencies with implementation of your recommendations? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m not sure that I understand the question, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well
do you anticipate a technical assistance team associated with the
recommendations that…? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Part of what will come from
this is likely… maybe an executive version of Program Evaluation which
would in that case include how do you examine things, how do you
evaluate programs, how do you implement ideas and changes and provide
technical expertise along the way? So that would be another piece that
may come from this. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is that technical assistance or
whatever covered by the four million dollar appropriation? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I don’t believe so, sir. I believe it was covered by the
legislation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes, you had a
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Now it says you’re having
information session with you’ve got 22 different agencies listed, but
then you’ve got four of them that are denoted your priority one, so the
recommendation that you’re going to bring back at the end of the year,
is that going to be a recommendation on the 4 priority agencies or each
of the 22 different agencies that you have listed? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We
were gathering information from all of the agencies to deal with the
statewide, enterprise-wide issues that we have in HR, in IT, in
purchasing and other areas. Part of what came from those, there may be
some specific things within those agencies. The priority one agencies,
given their size, are ones that we want to make sure we take a close
look at to see what we can accomplish with the departments to bring
about some change in those areas. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] So the answer, 22 agencies or on the 4? [SPEAKER CHANGES] There
will probably be somewhere in between. So we’ll be doing broadly across
state enterprises and HR and IT and purchasing and the other back office
functions that state government provides, and also to the extent that we
find things within specific agencies, providing some recommendations in
those areas on working with those agencies on how do we implement those.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Others? Senator Clark. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I have a
quick question here. If you don’t mind, I’m going to steal the language
of the Program Evaluation Division, and typically in their division,
they provide what’s called a work plan, and I would like to think that
what you’re going to provide in February, maybe we can call that a work
plan. Now that being said, are you guys going to periodically provide us
with some indication of the projects that have been completed, the
projects that are underway and some sort of idea what is to come down
the road over time? [SPEAKER CHANGES] One of the things that I did not
mention but is in your handout that Deloitte is helping us establish is
the results management organization, which is exactly that, to be able
to track the progress with what we’re recommending, track the progress
with things that are already ongoing, and provide the direction for
future work. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m going to do something a little
unusual. Our auditor has asked to ask a question, so since I understand
that the two of you have worked together some already, I’m going to open
the floor to the auditor to ask a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually
my question was to the committee. I’m hearing the conversation about the
final products and about rehashing things have happened, and I’ve also
heard a lot of conversation about savings, and the question I wanted to
ask of the committee, since I was a part of the committee that moved
forward with this project and we chose Deloitte to help, I want to make
sure that as bet I can, I can’t get involved in the weeds because I will
be the one that turns around and audits all this stuff later on, so I
won’t be in the weeds, but what I wanted to bring up and out based on…</p>

<p id="60:00">
...things I've been hearing. Is this committee going to be satisfied
with recommendations that may not result in savings, but will allow
agencies to do their job better? So therefore, you may not be able to
tie down, and one of the things I think about is when I go out to do an
audit, in a lot of cases, the agency doesn't have the data that can get
me the audit that I need. It can't give me the information that I need.
So if part of this project is basically providing the infrastructure or
providing the processes where agencies now have to report costs. You
talked about program inventories. Agencies don't even have an inventory.
Agencies don't know the cost of those programs. And so will this
committee be only looking for savings or are they looking for and be
acceptable of recommendations that will allow agencies to do a better
job of how they run their agency?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm not sure that, it's hard to answer a question for
a committee. I know how I feel about it and I think that we would like
both types of recommendations. I think that's appropriate to look at
because in the long run, while it's hard to quantify, it seems to be
that if we create the recommendations that create efficiencies in the
long term they're better both for the clients and for the state itself.
But that's my perception. I'm confident we'll have some further
conversations in that regard, too.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Which does remind me of a couple things. We've got
some very pressing problems and my question is, I mean you address the
issue of retirement and the funding of accrued liabilities and such with
retirement. Were there other very pressing problems we haven't...my
question is, will this entity be looking at some of those very pressing
problems?
For instance, Medicaid costs. Do you anticipate reviewing and making
recommendations there? Student tuition, making recommendations there or
at least reviewing? And frankly, the state's infrastructure, the roads
and the bridges, and water and sewer, or the utilities. I mean, do you
anticipate making recommendations with regard to addressing...because
you mentioned about state/local. Those kinds of very pressing and very
real problems that we know we have. Do you anticipate moving in those
directions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We have talked with the different agencies on these
specific questions, so what we end up recommending will depend on what
the next steps are. On Medicaid and on other areas, it's always a
question of how many people are looking at this and we've been going
over in some areas with program evaluation division itself on what
should we be taking a look at and what should you be taking a look at.
How do we make sure that we're not stepping on each other toes too much
along the way.
But, yes. We will be taking a look at some of the pressing areas that we
face and again, and that's why, Senator ??, HR, IT and the
administrative aspects of it are the essential blocking and tackling.
And that's why I gave the quote from the other book about the
fundamental flaws being hidden by superficial flaws is that our systems,
in may cases, are flawed in such a way that we can't provide the answers
that we want to be able to tell whether we're doing the right thing or
not.
We're addressing the fundamental data issues, the fundamental structural
issues and with that making sure that, to the extent that we can provide
something useful, and not reiterate or rehash ground that somebody else
has already taken a look at in those specific key areas. We will provide
our ideas on those.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Other questions from the committee? Representative
Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I think you have a worthy goal and it's
something that we want to encourage you to be successful in. But I don't
know how you're going to be...</p>

<p id="65:00">
… be able to complete this job with this scope in the amount of time
you’re talking about. You’ve got 20… I believe there’s 22 different
agencies here. If you did one every two weeks, I don’t know if you’d be
able to get into the DPI in two weeks. I’ve been here 20 years and I
couldn’t get into it, and so I know you’re well-intentioned, but you’ve
heard the old saying “too big to fail”. I’m just wondering if it’s not
too big to succeed. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ve heard that phrase before.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It looks like you could need to narrow your scope and
try to look at one or two agencies and be successful, and the once you
establish a pattern, you learn what you’re looking for, then you can
expand it, but that’s just my opinion. I wish you all the luck in the
world, but I’m just wondering if you’ll be able to do more than just a
helicopter view of everything that you’ve got on the table. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] That’s part of what we’re in the process of with narrowing
down. So far we’ve been gathering the information, and again, the 22
agencies helped us understand on those statewide, on those
enterprise-wide functions, that we wouldn’t want to have a solution that
works for an agency like the Department of Public Instruction or the
Department of Health and Human Services but that doesn’t work for, but
that is too expensive for, the Department of Cultural Resources or the
Secretary of State. Those are vastly different organizations, and so we
wanted to make sure that we understood the needs and frustrations of the
large agencies and the small agencies. That’s why we had to go out and
talk to everybody. When it comes time to actually provide feedback and
recommendations, our first step is doing exactly that, narrowing it down
to what can we actually provide some information on and provide
something useful on, and some of the questions that we’ll take a look at
at the start are questions that we have the data, that they’ve been
looked at numerous times before; we just need to take a look at them
again to say “This had been looked at. Either it’s been considered a
really good idea that just hasn’t happened, or we’ve looked at this
again, all the existing data, and no, it’s really not worthwhile, which
is why it hasn’t been done in the past.” So we agree with you that we’re
not going to try to boil the ocean. That’s one of the phrases that we’re
learned along the way. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And we still want to sell the
helicopter. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s right. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Clark? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Coletti, you mentioned the Results
Management Office. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] When is
that going to be established, anyway? [SPEAKER CHANGES] On the Deloitte
side it’s already in place. That’s one of the functions that they’ve
been able to bring to the table to assist us along the way. In September
we will work to transition that from them to us. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is
that going to require additional government employees, or is that going
to be absorbed by the current employees in the state government?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We’ll figure that out. I can’t answer that question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you have any idea what this organization will look
like? Two people, three people, four? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Honestly sir,
we’re in the process of going through it, so to what it would look like,
what it should look like, they may be two different answers in the
future, and when we get to September we’ll have a better sense of what
that would be. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Anything else? Anyone else with a
question? One final comment. Mr. Coletti, on a personal level almost, I
appreciate your coming and addressing us at this point in time, but I
have a little pet project that I had Mr. Yates working on for some time
and that’s called Wi-Fi on the state trains, which we’ve been trying to
get since 2011. If you could just address that in a moment… The Amtrak,
the through train, has Wi-Fi. The state trains that run from Raleigh to
Charlotte do not, and this is getting ridiculous for this three-year
delay, so if you would at least mention this to some folks because they
have the money to do it; it’s just a matter of getting it installed, and
I think it does have a very serious impact on the efficiency of the
operation of the transportation of that unit, but that’s a pet project.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I did see the article on that, and one of the projects
that we mentioned in the interim report was that we now have Wi-Fi…</p>

… the fairies, so well ask the question. We’ll ask the question again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Go figure. Do we have it on the helicopter. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. ??.
Any other questions from anyone? Thank you immensely. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Appreciate it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would like to mention that our next
meeting we currently plan for Wednesday July the 16th. There will be a
couple of reports coming back at that point in time. I don’t recall
which. Kiernan… [SPEAKER CHANGES] Child support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Child
support. Excellent, excellent. Unless there is some other comment, then
I would suggest that this meeting is adjourned.</p>
