A motion from Representative Burr to accept the PCS before us. All in
favor say &quot;aye&quot;. Alright you're awake thank you. And we are
having this presented to us by Representative Bell and Brisson.
Gentleman you have the microphone. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chairman, representatives of the committee this is a bill from Clinton
city for the use of designed build method of construction for a small
project they have there. You can see on here it's a small project that
we have and we have the city manager here if you have any questions
related to that and it's approved, agreed to by both of us and we would
appreciate your support for it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members do you have
any questions? Representatve Bell. [SPEAKER CHANGES] A motion at the
appropriate time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir, Representative
Holley. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I'm not a proponent of
design bill however this is for a small entity in a small county and
this is when a design bill is appropriate so I'm in support of this
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative, do we have any other
questions for the bill sponsors, seeing none Representative Bell you are
recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would like to move that the
PCS 133 receive favorable support favorable to the original and referred
to finance. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much, ladies and gentleman
you have the motion before you all in favor please signify by saying
&quot;aye&quot;, those opposed say &quot;no&quot; . The &quot;ayes&quot;
have it, thank you gentleman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Our next bill will be House bill 552 being presented by
Representative McElraft. Pat is here to present the bill. You have the
microphone. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman and members of the
committee, I have actually four bills so I'm trying to get them
organized here. The house bill 552 actually takes a services district,
like a water sewer district from a county and if you haven't if you've
been charging all that time and you really haven't provided that service
to them it allows that county to take them out of that service. There is
a petition and public hearing and then it allows you to take them out
it's not fair for them to have them in that service district all that
time and then not been provided those services so this allows, it was
actually my county that asked for this they have for about ten years, ok
I'll shut up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins you are
recognized to make a motion. Members do we have any questions. Seeing
none you are recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I need to make a
brief statement first, Representative McElraft I would never be so rude
as to cut you off, I was actually raising my hand so that the committee
chairman would see me and I was really enjoying your explanation but my
motion is that we give a favorable report to house bill 552 there's
referral. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Than that's it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All in favor please say &quot;aye&quot;, opposed
&quot;no&quot;. Alright representative you are welcome  to go on to
house bill 300 which has a PCS that Representative Bell has suggested or
 a made a motion that we accept all in favor say &quot;aye&quot; ok we
have the PCS before us. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much and I've
certainly been here long enough to know that when you've got somebody
that's going to make a motion then you keep your mouth shut. Anyway this
one is just a teeny bit more complicated this is to clarify what's
really already in the statutes but it just kind of clarifies, it's just
clarifying language in the statutes we have a couple of lawsuits, this
does not effect the lawsuits at all but we have property in the Nag's
Head area that is sitting on the beach and that property is right now
one judge said that the city who has been taxing that property all along
does not have the jurisdiction to go out and actually condemn that
property they said now the state has to do that it's on public trust
beach so we need to clarify in the statute that we all along have
allowed our cities not only to collect taxes from these people but if
there's an issue that they are sitting on public trust beaches in a
hazardous area that they are allowed to go and do what they have always
done in the past and condemn these properties and get rid of them so
that the state....</p>

Not have that responsibility. We also have another issue where we have
property owners that are trying to take their property all the way out
to the water and try to prevent our fire, our police and our rescue
squads from going down the beach and rescuing people during really
crowded beach times. And taking fencing and keeping people off the
beach. They want to say that they own all the way down to the property,
all the way down to the water. We.

she is, I found one of em OK. She's sponsored by Representative Tillis,
speaker Tillis. OK thank you. Members House bill 552 is not noted on our

serial referral to finance. So those of you who join me in finance will
have the pleasure of hearing that again. OK Representative you are free

motion for that to accept the PCS for. All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Before I say anything does anybody have a motion? Actually this just, we
have formed, three little towns have formed a joint agency for their
fire police protection. And individually as towns they can receive this
sales tax exemption and we would like to have them receive their sales
tax exemption as this agency.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman. For a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Cleveland I'll come back to you just a second.
Members if you look through your packet and haven't found a PCS for
House bill 179 that's because there is not one. So quit looking. OK do
we have any questions for the bill sponsor on House bill 179?

<p id="010:00">
Are there any questions for the Representative? We have one question,
Representative Stone?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, if you could finish explaining. I want to
understand what we're doing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We actually have little different split here. We have
the 50/50 with the TDA and beach nourishment. Since the state and the
federal government have gotten out of beach nourishment, we are putting
the state's burden now on our town so we have to have a way to finance
this. So we are asking for a few more dollars out of the occupancy tax
to do that. We say, what are you going to advertise if you don't have
the beaches to advertise? The Tourism Coalition's gone along with that.
They have capped it at 30 million, we can't keep more than 30 million in
there. We've all agreed with this. Our County's agreed with this, so
everybody's on board.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are there any questions? Representative Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I haven't had time to read this? Are you increasing
the occupancy tax or just changing the distribution?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We're increasing it to our six percent, what everybody
else has. We've only been five percent in the past. Everybody except for
Onslow County.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do we have any other questions? Representative
Faircloth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chairman. For the sponsor, have your
citizens had input into this situation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, they are in agreement. The County Commissioners
are all in agreement. We also have a Beach Commission, where we've been
putting this money. Actually, our citizens love this because they feel
like it's the tourists that are using the beach, and right now they're
having to fund these beach nourishment projects and so they're asking
the tourists to fund a little bit more, but because it's more of a user
fee and so instead of the state and federal government giving up their
portion of the funding. So now they're saying, &quot;We're tired of
funding. We've spent 35 million dollars we've taxed ourselves to do
beach nourishment locally.&quot; So it's time for those who use the
beach, a lot of our citizens don't even use the beach. So we're asking
now, instead of using advertising money, let us go ahead and let the
tourists pay a little bit more for the beach.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I guess the next obvious question is, have the
tourists had any input in this situation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The six percent is what I pay here in Durham, and I
look across at a hospital. At least these tourists are looking at a
beautifully nourished beach.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further questions? Representative Collins?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just one. I hate to say this, but I think I may be
about to vote for the first tax increase I've voted for in the three
years I've been here. If I understand this correctly, and I am one of
your tourists occasionally, and I do know that I pay this six percent
everywhere else I go in the state, this is a one percent increase on
room occupancy only, not restaurants or anything that the local county
people pay for. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And that would be the only reason I would vote for
this. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do we have any other question? Representative, it
looks like you've got a little legislative workout after all.
Representative Floyd, you're recognized for motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I move in favor for the PCS, unfavorable to the
original. It doesn't have a referral, does it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To finance. We have a motion on the floor. All in
favor please say aye. Opposed say no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] While I'm here, I'd like to interest you in a puppy
mill bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Your luck has just run out. [laughter] The ayes have
it. Thank you very much. Representative Jordan, House Bill 533. I'll let
you take the microphone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chairman. 533 is going through some
work to get a good PCS and I'm working with some of the important
stakeholders, Sheriff's Association, Police Chiefs, to get something
that will help my county and not upset the apple core. So I'd like to
displace that until next week if possible.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No objections, we'll displace that until next week.
And you are ready to go onto 284.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chairman. House Bill 284,
&quot;Local Contracts, Local Bidder Preference.&quot; This is an idea
you've all heard about before, taking another stab at it. And here's
why. There's a car dealer in Watauga County who bid on a contract three
fully loaded cars, to...</p>

<p id="015:00">
[Speaker Changes] County of Watauga missed the low bid by $1,000 to an
out of state dealer. So he lost the contract. There was no way the
county commissioners could do anything other than take that low bid. The
state has an executive order from 2010 that said if a north Carolina
company came within 5% or 10,000 of the lowest bid, the bid could be
offered to them, if they would meet the low bid. So the taxpayers in my
opinion are protected by this kind of policy, they get the low bid. And
the state is helped because we get the state company. This bill would
help the county because that locals dealer is a very large local
business that employees people and pays lots of perpty taxes, and yet we
just sent a bunch of business to an out of state dealer, without giving
the local officials, the county commissioners the opportunity to discuss
whether they wanted to give a local preference. So, this bill would
permit local governments to give preferences to local bidders for
constructions and ?? contracts if they so chose, so it is an option, and
the tax payers are protected because the low bid still applies. I know
that my two counties are in favor of it. The county commissioners, the
chambers of commerce in my area are for it. I had brief discussions with
the state associations, the county commissioners, the legal
municipality, they say lots of their members are in favor of it. I know
there will be opposition and there is opposition today, so at this
point, I would be ready to answer questions.
[Speaker Changes] Mr. Chair.
[Speaker Changes] We see you Representative  Floyd, and I’ll mark you
down here. We have several who have indicated they want to speak. We
will start with Representative Holley.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Chair. And I’ve spoken with
Representative Jordan about this. There are some things that I think
people don’t understand about Executive Order 50. EO50 that gives
preferences to North Carolina vendors is not a very easy procedure and
with it comes a lot of negatives. One of the main negatives to it is
that as you do to us, we do to you. And what I mean by that is, if you
are in a county that has an industry or if you are in the city or the
state of north Carolina. Lets say our furniture industry takes advantage
of EO50, and then they sell furniture to another state that also sells
furniture, that state will then add 5%, up to $10,000 to that bid, and
they’re not as competitive in that environment. Thats the pitfall of
these. Plus once you start these, you have to do it. You can’t just say
I’m gonna do it on this purchase, but the next purchase I’m not gonna do
it on. You have to commit your entity to participating in the program.
It is very time consuming for the purchasing people in the math and
sometimes the $1000 that you might have saved in one instance, may have
really technically cost you 2 or $3,000 in just paperwork and what have
you to implement. I just think that the body needs to be aware of this,
I spoke to Representative Jordan and he knew I was going to explain it a
little bit today. Thank you.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Representative. Would you like to respond,
Representative?
[Speaker Changes] Yes, thank you Representative Holley. I do appreciate
you coming to me and talking and with your background it is very
important in this kind of issue. But again, I think this is an option if
local governments want to take advantage of it, and it is only in
specific situations. The low bid from a local business has to be within
a tight range of what the actual low bid for what the entire project
was. So they can only use it in specific instances which are
specifically defined. No vagueness, there is no ambiguity here. Thank
you.
[Speaker Changes] Follow up.
[Speaker Changes] Yeah, you are very correct there. And in your county
that may not have a large industry, this may be safe. But if you are in
a county that has a large industry or a large business that is selling
property or goods or services, this is when it gets tied up. Just wanted
to make sure that's known.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Collins.
[Speaker Changes] Having noted earlier this year that in my
correspondence with one of our state departments, and I think it was
DOT, but it may have been DOR, I had to send it to a mailing processing
center in Pennsylvania somewhere, I’d like to make a motion on this at
the appropriate time.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Wilkins be recognized.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Chair. Representative Jordan is right on
target with this. And I say that primarily because I have a bill called
NC First that would make..</p>

<p id="020:00">
The state wide and rid of the need to issue executive orders. Now
Representative Jordan difference that you and I have that I took
construction totally out of NC first. And while we're on that topic I'm
going to implore Chair Warren to help me remove that red tag from my
bill so it might be heard when I'm going to exploit yours.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Stone is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Bishop Chair and also thank that our bill sponsor
Representative Jordan that I talked to has a he has a good heart and he
is trying to do the right thing. But I want to warn the members of this
committee about what you are trying to do and where we're going here.
The free market work, low bid works as much as you don't like it it
works. I've seen it in other cases the City Councilman Mayor Proten, we
tried this and essentially what you're doing is you're telling everyone
in the state that I'm not going to waste my time to bid because someone
local is gonna get it. And I know you have good intentions and everyone
back home have good intentions and I once told one of my local guys is
not my job to fix the bid til you get it. It's my job to make sure
everyone has the opportunity to bid it. And we get it for the lowest
price possible. This opens a big Pandora box and once you start this
something else will come and it will escalate. But I actually seen this
happen in one of my communities where we bid a project at 1.5 million
dollars and I had another gentleman five counties away bid for 1.2. That
gentleman called me up he was all upset cause he didn't get it. My
question for him was how can someone else five counties away be cheaper
than you? How can someone bring a crew to our town, paid hotel rooms,
buys meals and still be $200,000 cheaper than you? So when you look at
this as a small opportunity to help one guy, once you started you're
will never close that box and prices will escalate 'cause one thing for
sure nobody pays more than government to do any job in the state of
North Carolina. You can assure you that I say that I ask you not to vote
for this. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Pittman
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's alright sir, Mr. Collins the former teammate of field four of
Rocketman High School beat me to it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Floyd
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I just want to ask a question on line 22, where you have ?? of the
county. I mean could it not be counters accounted? These things?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Was that a question for the bill sponsor? Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, it maybe be a question for the staff that was the language that
was suggested to me so, to to make sure we knew which company we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But if it's state county.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up Mr. Chairman, I'm I'm just trying to just look it from a
technical stand point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would you like staff to address that question Representative Floyd.
Staff, do you want to address that question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe it is because the municipality has the authority for
contracting for the goods. The county also has the authority so would
give municipality and the county the authority, but it would the local
better would be the company or individual that is within that specific
boundary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So what you're saying then county that that the person is ?? and then
that country is contract that person must be in the county. And then if
the city contract the person must be in the city, but it seems to me
that if you're bidding and and its you're within the county both
municipality ?? of the county increases of the state so I was just
curious about it ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Floyd. Representative Adams, you have a
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair, I was just curious what this does to minority
builders bidders.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is not an issue in here there is we're not changing anything along
those lines but that not. Either positive or negative on that issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think you said earlier that there was maybe some folks here who were
in opposition to it I'd like to hear the other side if there are people
who are here Mr. Chair.</p>

<p id="025:00">
Representative Ramsey, we have marked down that there is someone to
speak on that.  I was going to let the committee members have an
opportunity to ask questions first.  I will come back to follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.  So, you're saying that if you bid low, and
you're from North Carolina, and someone from out of state bids, then
you're going to match those two together, is that what you're saying?
so that it goes to a North Carolina company?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Respond.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well that, I think that's part of executive order 50
discussion that's in your summary.  My bill specifically says that if
it's a local company, and that local company, if they are not the low
bidder, but they are within 5% or $10,000 of that low bid from a
non-local company, they're given the opportunity to match the low bid
and get the contract.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Burt, follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm just trying to understand.  So we actually would
not be accepting bids from out of town contractors then?  Sounds like if
you got a North Carolina bidder, and I'm not necessarily, opposed, to
that, but I'm just trying to understand.  If I'm a North Carolina
company, I bid low, but not quite as low as the person from the other
place, and you're going to match these 2 so that North Carolina will
guarantee to get it?  Is that right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, if the North Carolina, if the local… Let's take
Watauga County, because I'm not talking about all North Carolina overall
like the executive order.  Watauga County bid for 3 fully-loaded police
cars.  They get bids from a South Carolina car dealer, and a Watauga car
dealer.  The low bidder is the South Carolina bidder.  They bid
$100,000.  The Watauga car dealer bid $101,000.  'Cause you don't know
what the bids going to be until they are all open.  Because that is
between the range of I have in the statute, the Watauga county
commission, if it so chooses, can say to the local Watauga business, can
you match the $100,000 bid, and give our tax payers the exact same bid
that we would have gotten through this low bid process from another
state's dealer?  If the local bidder can, then the county can accept
that bid, at the low bid amount.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What would the chance be  that the local bidder would
not try to come under that?  I mean, I would think they would do it
every time in order to get the project, but…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's a-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This would be a public bill, is that correct?  Or
would it apply to my city too?  That why I'm raising the issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes, but these are closed bids until they are opened
up and everybody sees what the amounts are.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brody.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you mister chairman.  May I ask the bill sponsor
a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jordan?   If I'm a contractor in Union
county, and I bid on a project in Mecklenburg County, and I'm the lowest
bidder, but the Mecklenburg County guy then gets a chance to match that
bid, do I then get a chance to bid a little bit lower?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please answer that, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If your bid is within, if the Mecklenburg county bid
was within 5% or $10,000, they would get the opportunity to match your
low bid and get the contract, but that is where my bill stops.  There's
no additional phase after that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So you're basically saying that I have to decide what
my lowest bid is, and then submitted to the public in Mecklenburg
County, and they can decide if they're going to do it?  Doesn't that
sound like having me go through a lot of work, just so we can find some
particular price and then Mecklenburg county can then pick at it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please respond.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well now, there's no predetermined price, it's just
whatever the bids are.  If no one is close within 5% or $10,00 of you,
then you would get this bid without this bill applying.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I make a comment please on this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] With all due respect, and I know what you're getting
at is, I really got to oppose this bill.  Being in that position, it's
not a real enjoyable position to be in.  Because what you are doing is
putting in a lot of work and effort, and then just having somebody come
along and say: hey that's pretty good, I can calculate that.  I don’t
have to go through any work, pretty much so, and I can be assured of
getting the bill.  If you had in there that if something that somebody
bids, and then this</p>

be great because then what you’re driving at is the real low price, but
at this point, with all due respect, I’d have to vote against it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a question for Representative Brody.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brody?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would you take a question please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you have any idea how many hours you put into one of those bid
processes when you’re putting all your numbers together to bid on a
regular job?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
When you’re bidding on government things it takes a lot because there’s
a lot of regulation. It has to go...private, apparently this doesn’t
deal with private contract, but public ones there’s a lot of work that
goes into some of these.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So you would say sometimes half a day or more and also would that
prevent you from bidding a government contract if you knew that
potentially you would spend hours of a day putting a contract together
knowing that someone else had an opportunity to take it from you if you
were low bid? Would that prevent you from presenting your bid?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’d be true, and not only that, you’d have to go out and get bids for
certain materials and things that may require days worth of waiting and
trying to plan everything.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just briefly, all bidders would be putting in that same amount of work.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Chair is going to recognize Representative Faircloth and will note,
for the committee, that there are five other people who have...want to
beat this horse, and we do have some people, I understand, who might
want to speak to the bill. I’m going to let...the Chair is going to let
Representative Faircloth make his remarks, we will then ask for comments
from the public and open it back up for committee members. I do want to
remind you we have a pretty full schedule. Representative Faircloth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I certainly have compassion for the sponsor, I
put a bill like this in last year and I still have stripes on my back
from the lashing I took. One of them was from exactly the example you
gave. A local automobile dealer who was going to bid on two cars for the
local government gets an advantage under your bill. The local government
dealer who wants to bid on 20 other cars in other cities is
disadvantaged by the bill and that’s the noise I heard when I put this
bill in is this is a disadvantage more than an advantage to business.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, did we have someone from the League of
Municipalities who wanted to speak? No? Yes. Okay. Should always sit
closer to the mic when you’re going to do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee, I’m Paul Meyer with the League of
Municipalities. At our advocacy goals conference this year where almost
150 cities came to help advise us on the things they’d like to see the
legislature do that would be helpful to cities from the 200 goals that
were submitted, this ended up in the final 25. This was a high priority
for cities across the state because it is exactly what Representative
Jordan said which is it’s an option for cities. It’s something they
thought would be helpful to their local businesses and we’d ask for your
support on the bill, thanks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. Do we have anybody else who wanted to speak on the bill?
Representative Goodman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, if I could just make a point or two. The
maximum here is $10,000 so 20 cars would not be applicable in this case
because it would be much larger than that if I’m correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that correct, Representative?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Goodman, $10,000 is the differential.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right, but 20 cars…$10,000 is 5% of $200,000 so if a bid for 20 cars
would be $400,000, this wouldn’t apply. Am I correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, it depends on what the difference in the bids are. If somebody bids
$400,000 for…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So that’s the issue. It’s $10,000 difference in the bids.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks for clearing that up. If I could though, the thing about a local
bidder, all of these bids, local government contracts can be anywhere
from $500 to $50,000 and the local dealer is the guy, if say, for
instance, the school system, it’s the guy giving money to the PTA, he’s
donating to local golf tournaments and then gets underbid by somebody
out of town...</p>

Representative Davis, before you begin presenting your bill, do you know
if we have anybody who wants to speak to the bill outside the committee?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Ladies and
gentlemen in the audience, is there anybody that intends to speak on
this bill? Seeing none, we will release it for presentation. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Chairman. Ladies and gentlemen of the committee,
this bill comes before you sponsored by Representative Hamilton and
myself upon the specific request of the city of Wilmington. To put it
very simply, what this bill would do would be to repeal the city of
Wilmington’s Fireman’s Benefit Fund. All the funds that are presently in
the Wilmington Fireman’s Benefit Fund would be transferred from the city
of Wilmington Benefit Fund to the local Fireman Relief Fund, and then
those funds would be distributed pursuant to the general statutes. By
doing this, this would give the board of trustees over that fund more
flexibility over time to use more funds for active duty firefighters,
also to built the fund solvency, and also still provide funding to
retirees. I have Mr. Stanley Moore from Fiscal Research who’s here, who
was very patient in helping me to draft the PCS. I also have Tyler
Newman, who is the Special Assistant to the City Manager for Legislative
Affairs for the City of Wilmington here if ya’ll have any questions. I
will tell you that there was concern from certain individuals about the
language, and thank goodness, right before I walked in here I received
word that the last of those people’s concerns were resolved after
reading the latest PCS, and everybody is on board to my knowledge.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. Do we have any questions from the
committee? Representative Moore? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair.
It’s hard to get your attention over here in timeout. Very, very, very
quick question for either Mr. Moore or Representative Davis. It says
that to provide an assessment, “a reasonable amount of support”. What
would be considered a reasonable amount of support for a surviving
spouse of a firefighter? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, excellent question,
and if I may, I want to apologize to the committee. I read the report
from the old PCS, not the one that was redone and submitted last night
that I was informed this morning that everybody’s on board with, so if
you would please disregard everything I said, and Mr. Chairman, if you’d
allow me, I’ll read the ??. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You go ahead and catch up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And I do apologize, and I think that may answer your
question. What it does is what I talked about, plus when it deals with
the money, it says the balance of the local Fireman’s Relief Fund is
presently capped at 15 thousand dollars, and the bill will allow that
amount to increase by 15 thousand dollars every year until the balance
of the local Fireman’s Relief Fund reaches 105 thousand dollars. In
doing this, the retirement benefits of the retirees of the city will be
reduced beginning in 2014. The bill also grandfathers all surviving
spouses and beneficiaries as of June the 30th 2013, but does not allow
future surviving spouses and beneficiaries to receive any benefits from
the death of a retired fireman on or about June the 30th 2013. If anyone
does have anymore specific questions, I would ask Mr. Moore ?? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Moore, did you have a follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Now when you say 15 thousand, is
that 15 thousand in that pot per firefighter or across the whole fund?
That’s what I’m trying to understand. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Moore, would
you respond please? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, Stanley
Moore, Fiscal Research Division. This pension fund in Wilmington is like
a lot of the funds across the state. It’s funded by transferring monies
from the local Fireman’s Relief Funds, of which most cities and fire
departments have one, so in</p>

83 and 88 this bill was introduced and changed, which allows them to
transfer all the monies that flow through the Department of Revenue,
that insurance companies pay that goes to the Department of Insurance,
it goes out to that local relief fund. That local relief fund transfers
all the monies in that fund in excess of 15,000. Then this is used to
pay the retired firemen and the surviving spouses a benefit, and from
that low pension fund. As I understand it now, they get about $80,000
and there's about 100 retirees, so they only get like $800 a year. The,
because the, all the funds in excess of 15,000 is transferred, there's
no funds except that 15,000 that can be used for the active firemen in
the event of a disability or a death or scholarships for the kids,
whatever. So the city of Wilmington wants to increase that pot of cash
up to somewhere around $100,000, and this is the only way we could
figure out to do it, was to transfer 15,000 a year and maybe in six
years you will have that 100,000. But it will reduce the benefits for
the retired firemen and surviving spouses beginning in '14 and then it
should level out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Represent...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Experience. Representative Collins, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think Mr. Moore just answered the question I was
gonna ask. I'd highlighted the very lines that the bill sponsor read. I
couldn't figure out how a benefit was going down if we were increasing
the pot by seven times. But it looks to me we're talking about two
different groups of people, a current group and a retired group. But
that does raise one question for the bill sponsor, and that would be
what kind of blow back are you getting from the retirees about this
particular bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Not so much any concern by the retirees as by members
of the firemen. And I spent no less than two days with a member who was
concerned in my office, along with Mr. Moore and Mr. Newman going over.
I mean this is not the first version as you see it was changed as late
as last night. And as I stated before I came in, the chairman of the
board, the Fireman's Board, said that he read the newest PCS and was on
board with it and it was okay. But other than that sir, there was, I'm
not aware of any other opposition.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members with any other questions? Representative
McNeill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is for a motion at an appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It is the appropriate time, sir. The chair will
note...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I make a motion that the committee give a favorable
report to House Bill 551, with a serial?? report, excuse me, referral to
finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright. So we have a motion for a favorable report to
the PCS, unfavorable to the original, with a referral to finance. All in
favor, please say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed say no. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. The
ayes have it. And representative Whitmire, you are up for House Bill
558.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you committee members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. Sergeant of Arms, do we have the
pass-out for 558? Was it already done? There is none? Okay. Did you have
a pass-out? That's it? Okay. I had a note here there was a pass-out, so.
Representative Whitmire, did you have a speaker for this bill either?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have subject matter expertise in the room, but I
don't plan on calling on him unless we need him for a question. That's
the Executive Director of the Saltwater for North Carolina, Mr. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I see you have Representative Ramsey with you,
so there probably wont be a need for anymore undue influence. You have
the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Thank you all for hearing 558. I will be as
brief as possible to honor brevity. What we have as far as state
organizations, state entities, we have saltwater?? districts. We have 96
of them for 100 counties. We do have the extreme northeast corner of
North Carolina that has five counties rolled into one. And the purpose
of this bill is to basically allow sales tax refunds for the districts.
The good news is this, out of 96, 84 of them already enjoy this sales
tax exemption. And it's a little convoluted, they're a state entity, but
they generally will purchase under the domain of their county and it
works that way. We have 12 count...</p>

house bill 687. PSC is put before us on a motion by representative
Cullins. All in favor say aye. Representative Harterfor you have the
floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you mr chairman and members of the
committee. This bill came to me as an idea from a constituent. Theres a
non profit called Family promise located in Gilford county. What they do
is they provide temporary homeless shelters.And typically these shelters
are set up in non profits and mostly in churches. And what this is about
is these non profits are exempt from fire safety features such as
irrigation systems which are fairly expensive. But the way the law is
currently written is that these non profits are only exempt is if the
occupants are under the age of 18 or excuse me, if the occupants are 18
years of age or older. And so the problem with that is, when homeless
people show up looking for a somewhere to stay, if they have children
with them and its a parent of legal guardian and the children are under
the age of 18, then they cant let them stay there. And so my constituent
contacted me and said I would like to have this law changed. So that
when homeless people show up at these temporary shelters, and again the
shelters are temporary these are not permanent homes, we would like to
be able to admit the children as well. And so I thought that was
reasonable. I don't know of any oppositions to the bill. And I'd be glad
to stand for questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you sir. Representative
Pitman.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Point of motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Setzer. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That was the
point I was gonna make. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. Representative
Brodie. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We will get to you
representative Adams, representative Brodie has the floor right now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a quick question any of your research, did you
ever figure out why the building code prohibits people from under 18
from occupying. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe it was because of a safety
concern. Safety for the children.  But I would yield the staff, does
staff have any information on that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff can you help
out on that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe that that is correct. The
department of insurance felt comfortable with the bill as with the PCS
because it does add that the requirements for the smoke detections in
the sleeping areas. So that's an increase safety measure. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you staff, representative Adams. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you mr chair. I was gonna ask pretty much that same question about
building codes and .. so you say the department of insurance and the
fire Marshall says its ok. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes I forgot to mention
that the department of insurance is ok with this bill. ?? They wanted to
add as a provision that temporary homeless shelters must install smoking
detectors near the ..</p>

That the home builders group, knowing that they also, because of the
downturn, were severely affected by this. I didn't want to impose any
ill or harm on the community of developers.  In other words, we
shouldn't punish all for the sins of a very few.  And so, that being
said, they've agreed with me that there is not a whole lot of this issue
going on, but it does happen, and we need to find a way to rectify that
when someone does commit that sin, that there's somehow some way that
the people that are the recipients of that have retaliation, and that
they can get what they were promised taken care of.  And so that's, as
you look down, some of the key points, the bullet points, that's what
the study bill will be looking into. And hopefully we can come out with
some very effective language. Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Torbett. Representative Fisher. Excuse me. I'm
sorry. Representative Stone. You are recognised.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. I'd also like to thank Representative Torbett for
bringing this bill before us, because just last week I had the very same
scenario in my district, and I look forward to helping you any way I
can. And Mr. Chair at the propper time I would like to supply a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright sir. Representative Pittman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was going to do the motion, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright. Thank you. Representative Fisher.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to bring the member's attention to
I think what is a typographical error on item number seven. I think that
should be responsibility instead of responsibly. Little technical
correction possibly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I'm sure the staff is paying attention to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just wanted to show the chairman that I was awake.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  Representative Wilkins.

A question for Representative Torbett, and that would be that the study
that you envision would take in all areas of the state, not just certain
locales.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely one hundred and ten percent, Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, are there any other questions? Chair recognises Representative
Stone for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, Mr. Chair. I'd like to make a motion for Favor Report House
Bill 779.
The PCS favors the original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All in favor please say aye. Opposed say no. The ayes have it.  Thank
you Representative Torbett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Our next bill is House Bill 671, the Mills River de-annexation. I
understand it's going to be presented by Representative Ramsey. And this
has a PCS which we will accept on Representative Collins' reccomendation
or motion.  All in favor say aye. We have that before us. Representative
Ramsey.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.  I'm here on behalf of
Representative McGrady. I'm a poor excuse and substitute for him. This
is located in Henderson County. This bill will de-annex twelve homesites
from the town of Mills River that were erroneously in the town when the
town incorporated in 2003. There were some attempts to try to work
through this and provide fire protection services.  That has been
determined to be laborious. And so the town supports this. The county
supports this. There's a ninety day  period to allow the town to take
over the planning jurisdiction for these twelve homesites.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Cleveland, you're recognised.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, do we have any questions for Representative Ramsey on this
bill? Seeing none, Representative Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Favor report for the proposed committee substitute for House Bill 671
unfavorable to the original, and there's no report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All in favor please say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, this bill would need to go to finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright. Well then we'll just modify that to a refferral to finance. All
in favor please say aye. Those opposed say no. And we are on our way to
finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Our next bill will be House Bill 133. It does have a refferral to
finance. It's going to be presented by Representative Bell. We did that
at the beginning. Representative Fisher, I guess the Chair's not staying
awake. We're going to House Bill 857, which has a PCS, and you're going
to present that? You want the PCS. I'm sorry. Yes. I'm sorry. I'm
looking for Representative Arp.</p>

creates another method for the state or state agencies to go into
further debt without any further referendum. I'd like to know whether
that's accurate or not.
[speaker changes]
Yeah. What we've tried to do is address those concerns. We started off
addressing the contracting methods not the public financing piece of it
although it does touch on that. What we've tried to do, because I share
- absolutely share those concerns. This is not my intention to create
off book debt. No Enron deals or anything like that that we don't have.
The thing that we're trying to do is under section K. What we've done is
captured capital leases as well as operating leases if they are extended
out for long period of times and all of that. We've made those subject
to approval of the LGC as it relates to the local governments. As it
relates to the various state agencies and say UNC government, school,
something like that.  This is not a camel under the nose. I don't even
know what that means, but's not that. What we're trying to do is, we've
put in here that all other capital leases will capture the local by
going to the LGC. We feel like we've got that piece. All the other
capital leases  and operating leases entered into which would be
agencies, are subject to the approval of the treasurer and so that there
is some review. I think by very definition, any operating lease is
approved through the appropriation process and it would be captured
there. The concern is that if you enter into the contract prior to the
appropriations, what we're trying to do is still address that in the
mechanism that we have without creating another level of bureaucracy was
make it subject to the approval of the treasurer. So, what I would
humbly ask is that this is an attempt to deal with the contracting
piece. The financing side needs to be addressed separately and in 159
and I am in total agreement with a debt affordability piece but I didn't
want to bring that into the contracting side and so, we've tried to
address that and I'm very sensitive to that but--
[speaker changes]
Representative Arp
[speaker changes]
I think that the staff would like to weigh in on the answer for
Representative Collins.
[speaker changes]
This is my hero here ??
[speaker changes]
Well, let's let her talk
[speaker changes]
Representative Arp, does it state correctly that the public private
partnership piece of this bill which begins, I believe on page 6, does
actually allow for the potential for non-voted debt to be issued by the
state or a county or a city or any other unit of local government.
However, if you go to page 11, lines 43-49, that is language
Representative Arp, was referencing, with respect, to the treasurers
office would review any capital or operating leases issued or entered
into by any agency that's not subject to the LGC. The LGC would actually
review and approve any capital or operating leases where they have
jurisdiction.
[speaker changes]
Just brief follow up. What I'm hearing then is that's a possibility but
for a local ?? the LGC has veto power and for other projects, the state
treasurer has veto power. Is that correct?
[speaker changes]
Staff?
[speaker changes]
Correct.
[speaker changes]
Representative Cleveland.
[speaker changes]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I'd like to direct this to Mr. ??, the
Treasurer's office.
[speaker changes]
sure. Sir, if you wouldn't mind. There we go.
[speaker changes]
With the approval of the treasurer for this debt, you still feel that is
not sufficient to control HNC's as far as their contracting and spending
for construction is?
[speaker changes]
Well, sir, we are - we do appreciate the attempt to address it with that
inclusion. We certainly do appreciate that but we're not sure that in
every case, it's appropriate for the state treasurer to be the one to
consider this. In some cases, it may be appropriate for it to go before
council of state. In other cases, potentially committees or the general
assembly itself. The state treasurer is chairman of the ?? advisory
committee, however, and again that will be preferable to no controls.
However, there could well be agreements of this nature entered into that
will have no impact on the state's debt capacity. We'd like to have some
type of bill , study bill to distinguish out what type of agreements
need some type of approval and who would be the most appropriate body--</p>

believe we did. Question, Representative Cleveland?

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have the same concern that Representative
Burr has. We're opening the door. My understanding is at this point,
that these forms are being filled out, and they're being sent in to the
state ethics folks, and they're basically laying there. My concern is
Representative Dockham has his metropolitan area out, Representative
Floyd put his on there, when it goes to the floor, where the ?? goes to
the floor from here, more folks are going to want to do it, and we're
opening a door to something we possibly don't want to do.

Ladies and gentlemen, what we'll do is, let's talk to the amendment
first, and then we'll come back to the bill. The motion before us -- or

[Speaker changes.] Yes, sir.

[Speaker changes.] Any other...Representative Wilkins, how are you?
You're recognized.
[Speaker changes.]  Thank you, sir. Mister Chair, I think we just got
the cart in front of the horse by voting on Representative Floyd's
amendment before we really had a chance to ask a coupla' questions of
Representative Dockham. With that being said, I would like to hear what
the genesis of his bill is.
[Speaker changes.] Well, we shall ask him. Representative Dockham, would
you like to respond?
[Speaker changes.] Yes, sir...I will briefly and then I'd like to ask
Eric Churchill?????? to expand but ...I was asked to introduce this bill
by my folks back home, actually specifically the Mayor of Denton. That
way, the town clerks...people that work in the office would not be
subject to the same ethics training and laws that we are here at the
General Assembly. Unless we exempt them...your folks would have to do
that and my folks would too. As I said, there's a statewide bill coming
through the General Assembly, working its way. They asked me to do this
just in case that bill did not make it through the General Assembly and,
Mister Chairman, if Ms. Churchill could expand on that I'd appreciate it
very much.
[Speaker changes.] We will ask her.  Would you like to expand on that?
[Speaker changes.] I will try, in the thirty second version of this.
Back in 2012, the General Assembly, as part of the budget, brought all
members of metropolitan planning organizations and rural transportation
planning organizations on the State Government Ethics Act.  There's a
large group of people...the State Ethics Commission was asked to
interpret the provision to determine exactly who it applied to because
each rural transportation planning organization and each metropolitan
planning organization has two separate groups of individuals serving on
it. One group is staff of the local government and one group is elected
officials of the local government. The State Ethics Commission
determined that the provision and the budget apply to both the staff of
the local government and to the elected officials of the local
government that were serving on the MPO's and RPO's. With that,
everybody that was covered had to comply with the State Government
Ethics Act as if they were a public servant, which means they had to
file a statement of economic interest. The State Ethics Commission has
to review that statement of economic interest and provide them with
information as to where their potential conflicts of interest are. They
have to attend ethics training that is slightly different than yours
here at the General Assembly but probably takes just as much time if not
more. They also have conflict of interest provisions in use of their
position...provisions that they have to comply with. The bill would
simply remove the high point metropolitan planning organization from
that ???????
[Speaker changes.] Representative Fisher?
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chairman. I'm...I'm sort of
hesitant to support this and I guess, I know that it's a lot of work, I
know that it takes us a lot of time to...you know...fill out forms and
do our annual statements of economic interest but what I'm wondering is
do each of these MPO's...RPO's have their own set of ethics standards
that they follow?  And I guess that's a question for either staff or the
bill's sponsor.
[Speaker changes.] Staff, would you like to respond to that?
[Speaker changes.] I'll attempt. The MPO's and the RPO's members, as
local public officials, are subject to a set of criminal statutes that
apply to them in terms of contracting and using or disclosing public
information and bribery. They definitely are subject to that.  Each of
the counties and cities that would be appointing members to an MPO or an
RPO are required to have their own code of ethics, each of these
individuals would be subject to that code of ethics. As the budget
provision came into effect, each of these individuals is now, in
addition, subject to....</p>

provisions of the State Government Ethics Act as a public servant.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Pittman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. Thank you Mr. Chairman. I hate that Carl Ford's gone because he
could have addressed this better than I can, but what she was just
saying, I believe, is important in this issue. And I think that there
may, we may be seeing a lot of this come back saying we already have
standards and we shouldn't be subject to this state ethics too. I think
you're going to see a lot of that, so to me this is kind of getting the
ball rolling, so I still want to make a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, do we have any other questions for the bill's sponsor or for
staff? Representative Stone, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. From my understanding, we have a bill coming
through that's gonna address this statewide, and I'm just wondering if
the bill sponsor would be in holding off to see what the bill's going to
do statewide so we don't have a mad rush of all this coming. I respect
your decision either way, but I'm just. If we're going to do it
statewide, I'd like to know more of what's going to be in the bill, so
we don't have to come back and do all this work again. Just something to
consider.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stone, my folks back home asked me to introduce this bill
in case the statewide bill did not make it through the house.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, do we have any other questions? Representative Elmore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll speak quickly. I agree with the concerns that you have dealing with
the ethics regulation. A lot of times it is very frustrating with what
we're doing in that realm. But at the same time, it looks to me like
this is picking winners and losers on this issue. Some don't have to.
These don't have to, according to what your regs are. You gotta have a
consistent policy. If we're going that way, everybody's got to be under
the umbrella, or we look at the umbrella, getting rid of it. That's my
concern with the issue with the bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Elmore. Representative Pittman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Chairman. I move favorable report on the PCS for House Bill
527 unfavorable to the original.  I don't see a referral here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't see one either. All in favor of a favorable report to the PCS
unfavorable to the original signify by saying aye. All those opposed say
no. The nos have it. Representative Dockham, thank you. Ladies and
gentlemen please remain seated. I think Representative Brody can get us
in and out of here in record time with House Bill 421.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. This is a de-annexation bill from the town of
Marshville. It's supported by a resolution from the town. It

Representative Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a motion, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Members, do we have any questions for the bill's sponsor?
Seeing none, Representative Cleveland, you are recognized for motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A favorable report on House Bill 421 and referral to finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All in favor say aye. Thank you. We are adjourned.</p>
