what does the amendment. does that goes back to the original bill within
the no state funds will be used on the groins and that .net is the
innominate vote. okay, I I get on a motion for this discussion of that
amendment was German question me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
thank you Mister so section four have the permission of using on
appropriate state funds, which is now being put back in the bells

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
then sections it remains a section three is revealed can either you or

would it would continue to repeal that provision as a Senator Raven
explains this change in the amendment will retain section four of that
law in the log and provide no state funds. maybe Stephanie activities
related terminal groin. unless there's a specific appropriation from the
General assembly is ninety okay,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
okay all right. and you don't let us first handle this. we have a motion
for the adoption of the amendment of all available he said I suppose
they eyes have it. okay, maybe to the committee any additional questions
before I give the public opportunity to have one person said you said
yes, and perhaps a bill sponsored by some information about this for

to pursue any security projects I want to do so that they could not do
so without the having some type of holder approve financing in place for
it. everything is prohibited. you know you don't either half using

things like that to go to protect homeowners in the community from
long-term debt that might be associate waste projects list the voters
there actually decided they would take on an obligation. one. why are we
deleting that language doesn't seem to protect the citizens and
residents of these particular communities. they could otherwise be
adversely impacted with tremendous day for project which has been voted

The coastal resources committee could not issue a permit for a terminal
growing. If any of these finance mechanism would be used to finance the
terminal growing. This would remove that prohibition so they could issue
a permit for terminal growing thats paid for by these types of
financing. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One quick follow up [SPEAKER CHANGES]
follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think that we really would be protecting
the homeowners residency areas we allow them to vote on these type of
projects if they're gonna be pursued. Rather than sitting here removing
that type of restriction could have an adverse risk factor on their
local economies. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you senator McKissik that means
your time was up. Thank you I've got senator Sanderson.[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mr chair just a couple questions to Senator Raven if I might.
Senator Raven could you tell us which of the four areas received these
permits and if any of the four have been completed. None of them have
been completed the permits have been applied for ?? island ?? ocean
island and theres one more. I don't wanna give you the wrong one. And
holding ??. Basically I've been made hold sir.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow
up question. I know that in the 2011 legislation that were there some
safe guards put in place. One of them being that enough money had to be
set aside in case these groins were proven not to work that the money
was there to either remove them or whatever is that still in this
legislation?[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is included in here it was
extensively discussed with the coastal caucuses part of what we wanted
to make sure was there. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ok senator Woodwin. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you mr chairman. I guess I'm following up on both of
senators Sanderson's questions. As I understand, the four that were
approved in the 2011 legislation really were pilots. But since none have
been constructed, I guess I'm confused now as to why we wanna move
forward with any assessment or any understanding of how well they
worked. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you and I appreciate that question
because it opens the floor for me to answer. There are already two
existing terminal groins in North Carolina. One at the bridge and the
other is for the Fort Macon. The one is Fort Macon was built bu captain
Robert Ely in 1845. And its still working. He was a member of the US
Army at the time according to engineers. The one at the bridge has
stabilized Broder bridge and if it wasn't for that the Broder bridge
would probably not be present today and we would be facing another
dilemma. Now it takes times to get these in. Takes a lot of time and a
lot of hoops to jump through. North Carolina is the only state other
than Oregon that does not use these. So there's plenty of data that
terminal groins not to be confused with ocean groins do their job when
they are engineered properly and they do it well. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you mr chairman. My second question to
senator Raven would be back to the bonding requirements if one of these
fails. I guess I maybe misunderstood your answer. Is that bonding
requirement gone under this proposal would that be removed. Or is it
there and I just missed it? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm gonna let staff answer
that so ?? ?? if you would answer that please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
financial assurance language is at the bottom of page 3 this is sub
division six. The bill modifies that requirement from the 2011
legislation. Right now under current law there are four different items
listed under sub division 6. That the financial assurance has to cover.
Three of those would be deleted by the bill before you. But the one that
will be retained is that the financial assurance would have to cover the
cost of modification or removal of terminal groin as provided in the
management plan. Under the management plan if theres something thats
going wrong with the terminal groin then there would have to be
financial assurance of the modification of it to address the impacts or
the removal of the terminal groin. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up [SPEAKER
CHANGES] One more follow up. Within 6d if I'm a private land owner
within the proximity to this groin and theres some damage to my land.
Theres no guarantee theres no bond that would ...</p>

...for any damage to my property, that would be my responsibility; is
that the way I read that?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] That would be staff. Staff, please.
Staff: It does remove that requirement from your permanent application
process, that the financial insurance would no longer have to cover
restoration of private or public trust properties adversely affected by
the growing.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you.
The Chairman: Senator Stein.
Senator Stein: Mr. Chairman, I'd like to pick up the line of questioning
from Senator McKissick. And really this is on the heels of Senator
Tucker's legislation that we passed limiting the amount of special
obligations bonds we could, because of a general consensus of our
Chamber that there's benefit to society for the voters to vote on any
long-term obligation that's incurred in their name, and by deleting
section h in its entirety, on page 4, lines 28 through 34, we have
eliminated that protection for the taxpayer.
At this point there's nothing that stops a community from incurring some
type of long-term debt, without getting voter approval prior. I know
that you can use the occupancy tax; you can pay for it out of current
revenues. But I would think that this body would be very reticent to
give up that protection to the taxpayer.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Stein, I think probably, if we put it in the
proper context, that is a local issue that we're allowing them to make
the judgment to, and I think that Senator Tucker's reticent [??]; so I
think there's too different issues there.
Senator Stein: Mr. Chairman, where are we?
The Chairman: Senator Brown.
Senator Brown: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to respond to that
piece.
Now, what's happening now is that a lot of communities are moving the
inlets, taking on this type of debt already, to try to mitigate some of
the problems that they're having, so this is already happening, to do
other type of projects; it just doesn't happen to be growing at this
point.
I know at North Thompson Beach, they just did a $6 million-dollar
project to move New River inland, so they took on this type of debt
anyway; so this is already happening. This will just allow them to do it
for the growing, as well other projects.
The Chairman: Okay, I've got Senator McKissick and one other question
before... and don't try to renege on buying us ice cream, Senator
McKissick, so make it short.
Senator McKissick: Oh yeah, that's for five years down the road, if all
of you get re-elected [chuckles].
In any case, [laughter] you didn't read the fine print.
The Chairman:  That's pretty good, Senator McKissick, thank you.
Senator McKissick: In any case, simply this, Senator, would you be open
to the idea of possibly putting the language back in there that talks
about voter-approved financing. I think that was a smart provision that
was in the original law, and when you're talking about taking on this
quantity of debt, that would be impacting taxpayers for literally thirty
years, it might not be a bad idea to rethink whether you really want to
exclude that language from the earlier bill.
So maybe that's not something you can answer now, and you need to think
about it, maybe you can think about whether perhaps we might want to
have an amendment that would put that particular language back in. I
think many people will benefit.
The Chairman: Thank you. Do you want to respond?
Senator Brown: I'll respond to that. Thank you very much, and yes, I
have thought about that already. In fact, I've thought about it to the
extent that I removed the state money in the amendment, but I don't
think that the coastal people who live on these beaches in this area are
going to spend this without first talking to their constituents and what
have you, and again, it goes to local control, and we want them to be
able to move ahead and start their studies and start their planning,
without having to take that step.
The Chairman: Thank you. Senator Tucker. You had a question, Senator
Tucker, yes sir.
Senator Tucker: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I'll be brief, and certainly
Senator Brown or Senator Rabin can answer this. Just to clear the air
through discussions here, some people have said that the reason we are
changing this and pulling things out of this is because the communities
in these areas have had trouble raising the money or will have trouble
raising the money through a voter referendum or incurring that debt, so
we were removing that to give them more flexibility.
Is that what's going on now, Senator Brown or Senator Rabin? And it's
not the fact that we're trying to make it easier for them to incur debt?</p>

<p id="25:00">
Go ahead and, Senator Rabin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have, uh, had no one from the, uh, from any of the
coastal towns in my area mention that at all. I have had them call me
and thank me for doing this, but I have not had them use that as, to be
part of the conversation whatsoever.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Meredith, did you have a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Senator Rabin, I appreciate
you bringing this legislation forward. I would just like to ask one more
question and just clarify for me, if a groyne has to be removed, it's
because it's having an acid, adverse effect in the area that it's been
placed. Why would we not want the bond, if its having an adverse effect,
why would we not want the, a bond to protect public and private land
that's also being damaged. Because the adverse effect is not just gonna
be the groyne, but the area around it. Why would we not want to protect
those people?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A couple of things and I believe you read the bill
closely you will see that, that, what you're mentioning of adverse
effect has to be proven by science and not just, uh, the other deal,
just let someone say, &quot;Oh, well this is, this is damaging my
property.&quot; and then suddenly there was a liability claim. Whether
it was founded or whether it was not, there is language in here to see
that the groynes themselves can be removed if they are, by data, proven
to be faulty. Which I doubt they will be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. All right, now, I have a motion from Senator
Wade regarding a favorable report, but I have one speaker that's
registered, [Mr. LeMay?] you have one, two minutes and then we'll get
on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. My name's Rob [LeMay?], I
represent the North Carolina Coastal Federation. The Coastal Federation
is a home-grown conservation organization that was founded 30 years ago,
and has grown to 10,000 members and has offices in three different
coastal communities. The fact is that this, we were very engaged in the
conversation around the 2011 legislation. We opposed the Repeal the
Moratorium, but short of that we had a great deal of respect for the
protections that, particularly for tax payers that were put in the 2011
bill. The taxpayer protections in that bill rest on a three-legged
stool. They are the protections from local gover-, for local taxpayers
to be able to vote on, on debt before it's obligated. It was protection
from state taxpayers to require a vote of the General Assembly before
any state funds were obligated for these structures. And third they were
very, very demanding bonding requirements to protect the taxpayers, not
only for the cost and liability of these projects right now, but into
the future. Remember that they're going to be on the ground in the ocean
for generations. The fact, we greatly resp-, appreciate the bill
authors' willingness to restore one of those legs, but the protections
for local taxpayers continue to be stripped out of this legislation. And
there's no, um, these projects are very controversial. A number of them,
including [beach re-nourishment?] projects have been rejected by
plebiscite in recent years. We believe the voters ought to have the
opportunity to vote on long-term debt that they're going to have to pay.
And then finally, the bonding requirements are, in this bill, in the new
bill, are considerably weaker than the original legislation and, uh, you
know, if we're gonna do this let's be really clear about it. This bill
radically weakens the taxpayer protections for the liability and cost of
terminal groynes, which can cost millions of dollars to build, hundreds
of thousands dollars, hundreds of thousands of dollars to maintain,
millions of dollars to repair after storms, millions of dollars to
remove if they have to be removed, um, and there's no protection. We're,
essentially this bill is saying, um, folks, taxpayers in the future will
pay, uh, will pay that bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Thanks very much. Members of the committee, we
have a motion before us for a favorable report for Senate Bill 236 as
amended from Senator Wade. Seeing no further comments, all in favor
please say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] all opposed nay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Nay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ayes have it. Members of the committee, this Finance
Committee is over.</p>
