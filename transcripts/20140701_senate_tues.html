Senate will come to order. Sergeant-At-Arms, close the doors. Members go
to their seats. Members and guests in the gallery, please silence all
electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer is the Reverend Peter
Milner, our Senate Champlain. All members and guests in the gallery will
please stand. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Heavenly Father, Lord of every nation,
we look towards celebrating the marker of our independence this week,
and we pause to honor men and women who have served, and by doing that,
we honor you. These men and women gave their lives. Their testimony was
their lives, not just their lips, and we pray that all over this land
there may be a return to faith where we trust you with everything. Even
as those in the past faced the dangers and peril of the frontier –
crossing the continent, building cabins, rearing families, making ends
meet – and also in raising a standard of faith to which men have been
willing to repair down through the ages. And Lord, you did say in your
word that we were ready to share with you not just the gospel, but also
our own selves, and so may we in this Senate share our very selves on
this day in July. And Lord of Hosts, forgive us, Oh God. By thy guidance
and thy power may our beloved land once again become God’s country – a
nation contrite in heat, confessing her sins, keenly sensitive to all
the unresolved injustice and wrong still in our midst. Hear this our
prayer, oh Lord, that we may confidently expect to see it answered in
our time. For Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Berger’s recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
President. The journal of Monday June the 30th 2014 has been examined
and is found to be correct. I move that we dispense with the reading of
the journal and that it stand approved as written. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection, the journal for June 30th stands approved as written.
Senators, we have a leave of absence granted today for Senator Parmon.
We also have a nurse of the day with us today. Lucerine McZeek from
Raleigh North Carolina is with us. Nurse McZeek, please stand and be
recognized. Thanks for your service to the Senate today. Senator
Hartsell, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] A moment of
personal privilege out of order. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hartsell has
the floor for a moment of personal privilege out of order. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the Senate, you will not
on your calendar today that the prayer was to have been given by Mr.
Paul Harmon, with the Pledge of Allegiance by Major General Leslie
Purser of the 108th Training Command. Unfortunately Mr. Harmon became
ill last evening and is unable to attend, such that we will not be able
to observe an extraordinarily important event. Mr. Harmon’s a
92-year-old gentleman from Cabarrus County who was shot down in the
Second World War, member of the greatest generation who was to have
received a number of medals 60 plus years ago but had not. Major General
Purser saw to it that this was to have taken place. As a result, that
was to have taken and the declaration of those medals was to have been
today, including his family and others. Unfortunately he is not going to
be here and we will not observe Mr. Harmon, a member of the greatest
generation, receiving the distinguished Flying Cross with two bronze oak
leaf clusters, the Purple Heart and the Air Medal. He also, after his
being shot down, was a prisoner of war for a number of months toward the
end of the Second World War. Regrettably this will not occur, but in his
honor I would ask, Mr. President, that we would adjourn in his honor
today. Thank you very much. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator.
Ratification of bills. Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Enrolled
bills. The enrolling Clerk reports the following bills duly ratified for

?? license of military service members and veterans to direct the board
of governors of the university of North Carolina and state board of
community colleges to submit a plan to ensure that college credit are
uniformly granted to students with military training. House Bill 1052,
an act to adjust the utility regulatory fee to reflect a change in
regulatory climate for the telecommunications industry as recommended by
the LRC committee on the assessment of regulated and non-regulated
industry utility fees. House Bill 1117, an act to confirm the law
governing the pledge of joining credit unions, savings and loan
associates and saving bank to the law governing the pledge of joining
accounts and banks as recommended by the general statutes commission.
House Bill 1182, an act to authorize acquisition or construction in the
financing without appropriations from the general fund or certain
capital improvement projects of the ?? institution or university of
North Carolina. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senators, that takes us to our
calendar for today. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Motions
relative to today’s calendar. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca has the
floor for his motions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, House Bill 369,
criminal law changes currently on today’s calendar. Ask that it be
removed and placed on, let’s do it a week from today, July 9th. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Without objection, so ordered. [SPEAKER CHANGES] House Bill
663, defined practice of laws, currently on today’s calendar. I move
that it be removed and be placed on Wednesday, July 9th’s calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection, so ordered. Senators, we’ll move
right into the calendar, starting with local bills, second reading,
Senate Bill 877. Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 877,
exempt time share rules against perpetuities. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Cook is recognized to speak to the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to
introduce an amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Cook, you can send
forth your amendment. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe
he has it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Cook moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Cook is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This amendment converts this bill from a local to
public. This change will allow certain time share owners in other parts
of our state to share in the benefits of this proposed legislation. This
amendment and the bill has been vetted by the North Carolina bar
association. I know of no opposition. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do we have any
discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question before the Senate is
the adoption of amendment 1. All in favor vote aye. Opposed vote no.
Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. The clerk will record the
vote. [PAUSE] McKissick, aye. Robinson, aye. Bingham, Tillman, aye, aye.
Tart, Van Duyn, aye, aye. 49 having voted in the affirmative and zero in
the negative, amendment 1 is adopted. The bill, as amended, is back
before the body. Senator Cook is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
sir. Put simply, this bill will allow certain time share owners to
overcome the rule against perpetuities, and thus maintain the ownership
rights that they currently enjoy. Bill 877 will allow board of directors
of time shares organized prior to the enactment of the North Carolina
time share act to amend their declarations such that individual time
share ownership rights do not automatically convert into tenancy and
common ownership. In other words, absent this law, time share owners
with declarations dated prior to July 1, 1984, which have tenancy and
common conversion provisions, would lose their individual time share
ownership rights. This bill will protect those rights. I ask your
support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Goolsby, for what purpose do you
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, I’d like to know if Senator
McKissick would yield for a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
McKissick, do you yield for a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, would you explain the rule against
perpetuities for this body? [LAUGHTER] [SPEAKER CHANGES] It deals with
the vesting of an interest in real estate beyond the point of time when
it’s 21 years or older. It goes back to an arcane principle. It’s part
of the common law of England. Notwithstanding that fact, I support this
bill and believe it’s absolutely necessary ?? to clarify present law.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator. IS there
any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question before the
Senate is the passage of the Committee Substitute to Senate Bill 877 as
amended, on its second reading. All in favor vote aye. Opposed vote</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Soucek, Sen. Rabin is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, thank you.
This bill is the result of the work of a joint legislative research
committee during the summer. It sets up basically four criteria for
future selections of Adjutant General as well as State. One is federal
recognition, one is command time,  which we believe is essential,
another is time in the National Guard so they understand the fabric and
culture of the institution, and then finally the education of going to
the war college. I ask your passage of the bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do we have any discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Soucek, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak briefly on the bill and then offer an ammendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President.
Members of the Senate, I just wanted to briefly thank Senators Meredith
and Rabin for the work they did in the study committee on something
that's really important, to make sure that we have a commanding General
of the national guard who is qualified and able to serve in that
important capacity. And at this time I'd like to send forth-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Send forward your ammendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh, it's on the dashboard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Soucek moves to ammend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Soucek is recognized to explain the ammendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This simply takes out a small portion that was giving some flexibility
for construction, it's something that's in the House, the Senate budget,
we were trying to make sure it got through because it's important, but
it did change financial portions of it so we thought just keeping it in
the budget was the best way and I urge your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

ammendment 1, all in favor vote &quot;aye&quot;, opposed to vote
