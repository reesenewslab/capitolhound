[Speaker Changes]
I ask you to join me in offering up this prayer written by and spoken
for the first time by Martin Luther to the legislature of his time and
being still appropriate today. Gracious and sovereign lord we pray for
your servants in this legislature of the state that you might keep them
faithful to the solemn office with which you have charged them.
Strengthen and uphold them, guide and direct them to fulfill your
purposes according to your word. Give them counsel and aid that they may
preserve the integrity and the honor of our state. Protect our
neighbor's best interests and uphold and preserve all life you have
given to them.Grant them firmness to maintain and promote law and
justice and determination to strive for the good of our state and the
betterment of its citizens. Give them wisdom in the hours of decision
that they may speak and decide on matters in the spirit of unity and the
bond of peace.  Give them serenity in the face of crisis, protect them
from accidents, ill health and untimely death. Preserve them from
unmerited criticism and disdain, guard and defend them that they may
serve the security and well-being of the people you have given them to
serve. Make them leaders of the people, who will do your righteous and
holy will in our state and our nation. We ask it in the name of your
most holy son, our lord Jesus Christ. Amen!
[Speaker Changes]
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to
the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.

Thank you Mr. Speaker, members of the House.
I just want to take a brief moment, as you all know, on Friday, the
memorial service was held for former Governor Holshouser, and there were
a number of members here, including the speaker and several members and
a host of other officials on both sides of the aisle past and present,
it was a tremendous service. The governor's daughter did probably the
best eulogy I think I'd ever heard, but I stand today just to publicly
acknowledge and thank Rep. Boles, as you know Rep. Jamie Boles does
funeral work, and I just want to acknowledge that he did a outstanding
job in terms of the arrangements for what was obviously a very difficult
state memorial service, did an outstanding job and reflected extremely
well on this entire body and I wanted to congratulate him.

Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Members, as the speaker mentioned, the paintings on the back wall I
think one thing that he didn't mention that I'd like to is to publicly
thank Denise Wheats, the principal clerk's office, and the maintenance
staff, they worked on this, she's been working on this for several
months to get these paintings here, and you can ask her the story of how
they got the very, very large painting back there up to the second
floor, so I think they had some work to do on Friday and a little bit of
acrobatics, aerobics, all that, all the above, so they were fairly busy.
So thank you Denise, and to the House principal clerk's staff and
maintenance staff. Mr. Speaker.
