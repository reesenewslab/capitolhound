Senate will come to order. Sergeant at arms will close the doors.
Members will go to their seats. Members and guests of the gallery will
silence all electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer today and
for himself is Senator Tillman. All members and guests in the gallery
will stand. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Before the prayer I want to thank those
who invited me to have the prayer today, and as a custom that I follow
when I pray in the caucus and other places from time to time is I quote
a Bible verse and I normally have a person in mind when I have the verse
and I'll call out a senator's name but today this one applies to all of
us, I think. It certainly applies to me, so I will begin with a verse
from Philippians Chapter 4 Verses 4-7. Now if memory don't fade, I'll
get it right. Surely you all are Bible scholars and if I don't get it
right, you'll correct me. It goes something like this. Rejoice in the
Lord always. I'll say it again, rejoice. Let thy gentleness be known to
all, the Lord is near. Don't be anxious about anything, but in
everything with prayer and petition and thanksgiving, present your
request to God and the peace of God, which transcends all understanding,
will guard our hearts and our minds in Christ Jesus. And I would end by
saying, Lord, I just pray, and this August prayer in this August body
that you will be preeminent in our lives and we'll put your first in all
things. Then everything else will find it's proper place. In Christ's
name. Amen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Pate is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. The journal for Tuesday July
8th 2014 has been examined and is found to be correct. I move that the
Senate dispense with the reading of the journal and that it stand
approved as written. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Nurse of the day is
Tina Shelling from Whitesaw. Thank you for being with us today.

Hanover County, the chair is happy to extend courtesies to David Collins

The chair recognizes Senator Pate for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
