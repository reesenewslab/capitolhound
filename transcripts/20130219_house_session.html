[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  If you'll bow with me.  Our Heavenly Father, as
we gather in this chamber to do the people's business this session, we
face enormous obstacles and sobering realities that challenge us beyond
our limited capacities.  We often fall short of what we ought to be as
the legislators the people of this state elected us to be, so we humble
ourselves before you today and pray you will endow us with the wisdom
and the strength we need to overcome our weaknesses and frailties so
that we can carry out our duties to serve the people of this state.  We
also ask that you grant wisdom to those in government in other states,
and in our nation's capital, and that you give strength to the people in
this great land, who are struggling in these difficult times.  We pray
your special blessing and protection upon those who voluntarily place
themselves in harm's way to ensure our freedom and safety; both here and
overseas.  We thank you profusely for all the marvelous blessings you
have provided us in this land of the free; may we never forget to honor
You from whom all blessings flow.  In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

<p id="10:00">
…amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I’ll try to be brief in
part because I already described the importance of this amendment last
week. But to give the summary, the House Bill 82, as written ends the
earned income tax credit for low and moderate income families.
These are families of employees who are working for businesses,
primarily small businesses, who, the businesses are able to pay
relatively low wages in dollars, $8, $10, maybe $12, which is really not
enough for any employee with a family to live on.
As a result of this, at the Federal level, years ago Representative
Blust reminded me that it actually began as an idea of Richard Nixon’s,
it was supported in the 1986 Tax Reform Bill by Ronald Reagan, President
Reagan, so it has been a bipartisan concept all along.
In 2007 this General Assembly added a state version which meant five
percent so that if you were entitled to 100 percent earned income tax
credit Federal, you received five dollars additional from the state, the
state five percent, so $105.
The consequence of not extending the earned income tax credit is the
cost the low and middle income families who are eligible for this tax
credit $105 million a year. That is $105 million that is very important
to these families. These are low income, these are working families.
It is so important that we try to do this and when we do not move
forward to extend the credit, I think this General Assembly or this
House is sending a message as we, in my opinion unfortunately did around
Medicaid rejecting the money, around unemployment benefits cutting them
drastically, we’re sending a third message that we do not care about the
well-being of the lower income families in North Carolina.
For that reason I would urge you to support the amendment. The amendment
simply extends the earned income tax credit for five years, sunsets the
provision in 2019 meaning it will expire unless the General Assembly
then chooses to extend it. But for today, I ask you to support the
extension of the earned income tax credit state version for working
families. Thank you. I urge adoption of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection, Rule 12D is suspended. Is there objection? So
ordered. Representative Howard, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentleman of the House, we had the earned income tax credit
for several years and last year during the negotiations and debate in
anticipation of tax reform we did extend this one more year, through the
year 2012-2013.
I believe it is in our best interest to not extend it any further and to
do the decoupling. We are actually complying but we are adjusting the
amount of the credit, so until we get through our tax reform I would ask
you to vote, “No,” on this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Holley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ve been looking into this. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities
did some research into the earned income amendment. It said that in 2010
it listed 9.2 million people, 4.9 million of them were children above
the poverty level and the majority that received the tax credit only
received it for one or two years because by that time they were making
enough money that they could live off of it.
The most significant gain in unemployment has been attributed to this
earned income tax credit, in particular with mothers with young
children. In 1990 it reduced more than a half-million families from cash
welfare recipients to work. These are not the kinds of programs we need
to cut out, anything that encourages work.
These are your low-wage people. They’re not trying to get unemployment
benefits. They’re not trying to get welfare. They’re trying to go out
there and actually work. Also these are taxpayers. They pay a
substantial amount of local taxes and they get, according to this new
bill, $4.50 per $100 that they will be getting as…</p>

<p id="15:00">
The average is just over 200 dollars. So you say 4050 cents is nothing
it won't buy you lunch down stairs in our cafeteria. But it well provide
so much needed relief for some of our poor families in Wake County and I
ask that you support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hall please state your propose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and very quickly I think
Representative Howard said it correctly. We have tax reform coming as
our understanding is coming and this was extended an effort to wake
until tax reform was done and was done in last session as representative
Howard said and there's no reason than to take this off the table so
when people do tax reform we look at all the options and all the
partners in this all the citizen who have something at stake in our tax
system. Some people say you do policy either with a carrot or stick and
we have pretty much pulled the stick out pretty well during the session
we cut off unemployment benefits and we do Medicaid and taken away that
option but this is something that helps people who are working now I
know all of those who are in favor of helping working North Carolinians
and this earned income tax credits just happens to help at least of
these North Carolinians you heard the information this is it helps
people climb out of situations where they need assistance this would be
one message we can say as not really a warn the poor we want at least
working poor to have some measure of assistance or respect our
government so I would say leave this as it is leave it and let's go
ahead and amend it and then when we have tax reform whatever it is let
them look at it and let us strand on this merit like every other
provision of our tax code. Let's not eliminate the working poor from
consideration and leave everyone in tax code whose getting tax relief
including those of us who would get 50 thousand credit against our tax
liability as was pass last session when we did not address the rest of
the tax code so we are doing situations where we give additional
benefits in the tax code even though we know we say we gonna rewrite it
but when it's time to look at our working poor we say we gonna take any
relief you have away even though we are waiting to rewrite the code. So
again I ask you to support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Ross please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much Mr. Speaker and ladies and
gentleman you know the amount of money somebody would get through the
earned income tax credits somewhere in the neighborhood 200 to 250
dollars a year doesn't sound like a lot to lot of people here but to the
people this effects the people who know that they may be getting 200 or
250 dollar a year it makes a huge difference. Last week when I went to
lunch with a friends somebody who I have known for a long time and we
were talking about this issue and she said her kids go to elementary
school with a family that has used what they get back from the earned
income tax credit to put down payment on a mobile home so they can own a
home for the first time in their entire lives they have used this small
amount of money and sculled it away because there's no way they can come
up with that kind of saving otherwise between bills medicine and other
things. It's a small amount of money that makes an enormous difference
in people's lives people who are living at the edge people who are
working. You know what this body has done they may have to be spending
this money on health insurance they may not be able to use it to put it
down payment on a mobile home. It's just simply inconceivable to me that
at the same time in this bill we would be giving extra tax breaks to
people at the highest level that tomorrow morning we are going to look
at doing away with inheritance taxes and yet again for the people who
are struggling at the end there's no compassion there's no worry there's
no consideration. Please vote for this amendment.

...came into the chamber today, we started off doing exactly what we do

one thing that was in that prayer, and we prayed it together folks. We
prayed that our heavenly Father would remember those that are
&quot;struggling in these difficult times.&quot; I will vote for this
amendment. I think it's right within my own conscience to remember those
folks who are struggling. And if the amendment passes, I will be ready

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, today in
Mooresville, North Carolina is Margaret Kennerly day. Margaret was born
100 years ago today and has been a real leader around Mooresville. Her
profession was a beautician. She's probably made more women beautiful
around Mooresville than we can imagine. But we appreciate the work she's
done. We use words like &quot;leadership,&quot; &quot;dedication,&quot;
&quot;kindness,&quot; &quot;compassionate,&quot; &quot;Christian,&quot;
&quot;ambitious,&quot; and an example for the rest of us to follow. And
Margaret is listening on the audio today, so I would like to say,
&quot;Happy birthday, Margaret, on your 100th birthday.&quot; And then,
Mr. Speaker, I would also--someone who wasn't born quite a hundred years
ago today, who's among us, has also served Iredell County very well. She
has served as clerk of court, dedicating many years of service to the
people of Iredell County, and last year decided to offer that same
service, knowledge and ability to the people of the state of North
Carolina, Representative Rena Turner. Happy birthday.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House,
here we go again. The first thing we've done is we've hit the
unemployment, folks who weren't employed through no reason of they're
own. Then, we hit half a million folks without insurance. Now you're
going after the working poor. What this bill does is, you're going to
pass the first part and the second part, you're going to take away
Earned Income Tax Credit for those low wage employees. But what you're
also going to do, you're going to increase the high threshold for joint
filers in this ?? to $300,000 when at one time it was $178,150. Which
means that this will be of benefit to those of us who are able to afford
it--or who really don't need it. What you're doing is you're going to
lose about $18 million in revenue from folks who can afford to pay that.
Now, sometimes enough is enough, folks. When you start disowning those
who are unemployed. When you start taking away health care for those who
can't afford it. And when you start running up the cost of these
hospitals to a point where many of them are on the verge of ??...</p>

Representative Blust, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and members of the House. This
is a very simple bill …..
Gentleman’s recognized to debate the bill.
….Thank you Mr. Speaker. It’s a very simple bill. It just eliminates an
obsolete provision in the law, which still authorizes 50 dollars to be
paid to members of the Board of Law Examiners. These are the people that
grade the bar exam papers and answers each year. And coincidentally, it
stopped being paid in the early 1970s. That was about the same time this
board allowed Leo Daughtry to pass that exam. So, I don’t know if that’s
just coincidence or not. It’s a very simple bill. I’ll be able, I’ll be
happy to answer any questions, and Mr. Speaker I hope that you’ll have
the question called after half an hour of debate on this. Please, thank
you.

Does the gentleman yield?

Yield.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don’t know why you want it that way. Let me ask you
this though, seriously. There are people who grade the Bar Exam who are
not members of the Board of Law Examiners. Does this cover them also?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don’t know if it covers volunteers, who just come
forward or not. I think this covers only people who are on that board
formally.
?? the question.
I yield.
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] These are people that the board asked to come and sit
with them to help them grade the Bar Exam. I know several people who do
that, on an annual basis. And if they are being asked by the board to do
that, why shouldn’t they be included in this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Michaux I don’t know that they aren’t.
I’ll have to check on that. I would ask that we take a vote on 3rd
reading, on 2nd reading we can just object, hold it over and I’ll get
you that answer by tomorrow….
