Conference Report House Bill 1218, to the President of the Senate,
Speaker of the House of Representatives. The conferee is appointed to
resolve the differences between the Senate and the House of
Representatives on House Bill 1218, a bill to be entitled an act
amending the charter of the city of Monroe, to remove the provision
authorizing the city manager to have direct supervisory authority over
the city attorney.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Placed on today's calendar and additionally, place the previous
conference report sit-in on today's calendar, please. Okay, Senator
Davis, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to take a moment of personal
privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd like to send forth a senatorial statement, please, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Send forth your statement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I'd like to recognize the quasiquicentenntial anniversary
of the Western Carolina University campus. Senator Tillman that means
125 years, and I'd like to tell you that Robert Lee Madison in 1889
founded this school for the benefit of the Western North, Western North
Carolina area to teach teachers, and to teach individuals, and to help
that area out. I'd also like to inform you that 4 years later, the North
Carolina legislature designated that school the first publically-funded
normal school in North Carolina which probably, probably explains the
fact that it has never had, and never will have a school of Law. Thank
you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brock is recognized to speak on the statement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. You know, not only was it a gift to Western
North Carolina, it was a gift to the entire state, presiding officer is
a graduate of Western Carolina. And I will say this, from the shot that
was heard around the world, when Carter hit the first 3-pointer in NCAA
history to when the University when I was there became most the wired
university in the country, was the first state-supported university to
have internet access into each and every room. And I remember when we
were trying to sell that program to the Board of Governors and through
the rest of the education establishment here in North Carolina, I put it
real simple, it would take two days for the newspaper, the News and
Observer, to get up to Cullowhee for us to read it. And with that
initiative by the Board of Governors at the time to make that University
to be connected to the internet, in every room, and it really has
transformed our new channel for its dynamic, hopefully we can keep him a
good while, but he is really transforming this school, and making it a
lot better. Which is a good thing for Senator Apodaca and I, because the
better they make Western Carolina, the better it makes us look, I heard
you, thank you for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Brock, just let me say, a moment of personal
privilege if I might, I feel that any success I've had in life, a lot of
it's contributed to my experiences in Cullowhee, and I hope I wish him
another 125 years, and maybe Senator Tillman can be around for that
also, because he was there opening day 125 years ago. With that being
said, I recognize Senator Pate for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I move that the Senate now recess subject to messages
from the House and the Governor, referral and re-referral of Bills and
Resolutions, Receipt and referral of committee reports, receipt of
conference reports, the ratification of bills, and appointment of
conferees to reconvene on Thursday, July 31st, 2014, at 1 p.m.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You've heard the motion, the Senate do now stand in recess 'til 1
o'clock.

The senatorial statement honoring Western Carolina University's 125th
anniversary, whereas Western Carolina University was founded in August
1889 by Professor Robert Lee Madison, who wanted to provide an education
for the young people in the region and train teachers to spread
education throughout the Western part of the state. And whereas in 1893,
the legislature designated the school as the first publically-funded
normal school, which evolved into a junior college over a 40 year
period, and then in 1929 was chartered by the legislature as a four-year
institution under the name Western Carolina Teachers' College</p>

and where in 1967, the North Carolina General Assembly designated
institution original university and changed its name to Western Carolina
University. And on July 1st 1972, Western Carolina Univesity became a
member of the University of North Carolina system. And, whereas adjacent
to the great smoky mountains, and a neighbor to the eastern band of
Cherokee Indians, Western Carolina University has a commitment to the
rich traditions of Appalachian and Cherokee culture. And, where as the
Millenium Initiative doubling the size of the campus in 2005, it's
supposed to be a hub for economic growth and a knowledge enterprise zone
where university faculty and students, private industry and government
partners, collaborate in the study and development of innovative
practice that result in applied solutions that meet the needs of the
citizens of North Carolina. Now therefore, Western Carolina University
should be commended on its quintessential anniversary for its commitment
as a public university that serves the public good, providing a focused
rigor with high-quality curriculum, it meets the educational economic
development needs of the people of Western North Carolina, the state,
and the nation. In the witness whereof, the undersigned signifies,

Follow up, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Will you explain to me how are your local county commissioners chosen
now in vacancies? How is that process work in Cabarrus?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Currently, along with 42 other counties, the party from which the
resigned commissioner or leaving commissioner or deceased commissioner
was elected, the executive committee of that party selects a successor
whereby the county commission appoints a successor. In 58 counties, in
North Carolina, the county commission simply appoints a successor. What
the amendment does is move from the first to the second. From the former
provision to the later provision.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What is the purpose in making this change for Cabarrus County, can you
explain that to me?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
First, let me say, it was suggested by one of the House members who was
not Linda Johnson, but Carl Ford. It is done in, like I say, 58 other
counties the way it needs to be changed. Without airing too much dirty
laundry, the current executive committee of the Cabarrus County
Republican Party is, well, more than 50% of its membership has resigned
and their are new members appointed to that are in that situation right
now. Of 20 people, about 12 are new and were never elected to a county
convention. The chair of the current county party is not elected by
convention, but was appointed. The vice chairs, there have been through
two successive vice chair, which is to say there’s a degree of chaos
that exists there. We’re simply trying to avoid the chaos.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d like to speak to the bill, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have no problem with Senator Tucker’s portion of the bill. I think
it’s good, it’s a local bill. It’s solid. The problem I have, I spoke
with Senator Hartsell earlier today and I asked him had he spoken to any
of his local board of county commissioners and the answer was no. Asked
had he spoken to any of the local government officials, the answer was
no. Any of the party officials, the answer was no. I think this is just
setting a precedent that I just don’t feel comfortable with. I think
without consultation of those local folks, we’re changing the way that
they are making their decisions on a local board. I’m not comfortable
with it. I don’t really care what happens in Cabarrus County, but I am
concerned about the precedent that it might set without input from the
local officials who are the ones who are ultimately going to be making
that decision. I’m going to vote no. Thank you, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President
.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me simply say that two of the three folks who represent Cabarrus
County were on the conference committee for this report. The third, who
represents Cabarrus County in the House, voted for this report about an
hour ago and has said he supports it. It seems to me that that is a
provision that is long established in this chamber, that we deal with
local, we have consensus among the local delegation. I’m the only one
who represents Cabarrus County and we’re simply trying to fix the
problem as best we can and we all agree and that’s, like I say, it’s a
local bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question before the body
is the adoption of the conference report for House Bill 1218. All in
favor vote aye, those against will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed
for the voting. The clerk will record the vote.
36 having voted in the affirmative and 9 in the negative, the conference
report for House Bill 1218 is adopted and the House will be notified.
Next up, let’s do...</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members, this bill allows for the creation of
a rail compact between North Carolina and South Carolina, to study,
develop and promote a small freight line that crosses North
Carolina/South Carolina border in southeastern North Carolina. A recent
decision by the federal surface transportation board creates an
opportunity to preserve this freight line and this bill will simply

associated appropriation formality. Thank you very much for your

Thank you, Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen, before I get started, I
just want to thank my co-chairs, Senator Hunt and Harrington and Jackson
for their many hours and hard work that we put into this and also the
subcommittee chairs who I think did a great job of working through their
subcommittees and sending us a pretty clean, I think, piece out of their
subcommittees that we could work with. I also want to thank the staff
who continue to amaze me in their professionalism and their hard work
and just their knowledge of helping us through this process. We’re very
fortunate in this General Assembly to have such a professional group…</p>

give and take, no exchange of ideas, no true competition among ideas, no
collaboration, no conversation, no listening to each other, no learning
from each other. This isn’t a budget, this is an ultimatum being
delivered to millions of people across the state. You may feel like you
had a real debate over this budget, but you didn’t. Republicans in the
Senate and Republicans in the House do not comprise a two party system.
You thought you were having a debate when you were really just talking
to yourselves all along. I understand that including the other side
would change this process. I understand it would make it harder, but
history shows it would also make it better. You need a balanced approach
to setting priorities when one side to simply exclude the other side, it
lends itself to mistakes. You’re not just asking me to support the
provisions in this budget, you’re asking me to endorse the process. I
can’t do that. No normal person could do that. I could bring ten people
in off the street, explain to each of them how this budget was made and
every one of them would tell you they expect more from us. Nobody in the
real world thinks this is how it should work.
As a very recent member of the real world, I’m here to tell you, we all
think that these kinds of political games, do our state a disservice. I
know what you’re going to say. I can see you reaching for the
microphone. You’re going to say, Democrats did it worse, and you’re
right. You’re absolutely right, about that historical fact, you’re
right. But in carrying on this legacy, you’re wrong. You’ve mislearned
all of those lessons. Being in power means having the power to change
things for the better. This isn’t just the way it works. This isn’t just
the way it’s always worked. It’s wrong. And maybe it takes the new kid
to tell you that, but so be it. Nothing I’ve said so far is
controversial. It’s all common sense, and yet here we are. Everyone
recognizes this isn’t the way it should be done, but you’re doing it
anyway, so let’s call it what it is. This is payback. Payback doesn’t
make good policy. Revenge is something that we’re supposed to rise
above. Our mothers taught us that. If you truly believe in the strength
of your ideas, let’s have a real debate. If you truly believe that your
vision is the way forward for this state, then allow a perspective other
than your own. I’ve gotten to know almost all of you. I respect all of
you. This budget process is beneath you. It’s beneath our state. Instead
of propping this sad tradition, we should end it. The pendulum will
swing back. It’s only a matter of time. Let part of your legacy be that
you broke this sad tradition.

I’ve been here for quite a while and of course I’ve seen the way the
sauce gets made around here and understand that there are limits to what
a minority party can do when they’re not in power. At the same time, we
need to be rational, not irrational. We need to be considerate, not
inconsiderate. And we need to be, most of all, thoughtful, when we’re
talking about appropriating over $21 billion. $21.3 billion. The process
by which we’ve come to this budget that’s here before us today is not
one that I can embrace. This process needs to be reworked, it needs to
be fixed, it needs to be tweaked. It’s a lot of things that can be done
differently. Most importantly, there needs to be input and consideration
provided by all of the members. We’re all elected to these seats. By
approximately, the districts have about the same amount of population.

Part of a minority party. And you're silencing the opportunity of those
constituents to participate to stakeholders in the process. We need to
be fair. We need to be reasonable. We need to engage in spirited debate,
but most of all, we need to be inclusive and transparent. And this
process has lacked inclusiveness and transparency. Now, if you really
want to get down to why it probably took us an extra month to get to
some type of an agreement, other than perhaps what it should have, we
don't have to go back much further than last year, when we came up with
all these tax cuts for the wealthy, top two percent, and short changed
us in the process. Short changed us to the point that we could not go
out and appropriate funds the way we needed to in this particular year.
So through smoke and mirrors we had to come up with ways of getting it
all done. Now I get concerned about some of the things I see here even
though I've had this budget in my hand less than eight hours. Less than
eight hours to review twenty one eight billion that we're about to
adopt. What concerns me, I hear that there's full funding for teaching
assistants, but yet when you look at the numbers, it's a hundred five
million dollars short. A hundred and five million short. That means
you're gonna have to go out there and ask your superintendents to
reprioritize what they wanna do if they want to keep the same number of
teaching assistants that they've got. A hundred and five million short,
that could translate to about thirty three hundred teaching assistants
that could potentially be terminated on top of about thirty five hundred
we lost last year. That gives me deep concern because that's potentially
sixty eight hundred that could be gone in our classrooms. I get
concerned about the fact we have not done anything to reauthorize this
teaching fellowship program, which is one of those programs that has got
strong bipartisan support over the years. I get deeply concerned because
when it comes to our teachers, there's no incentive for them to go out
there and further their education and get masters degrees and perhaps
refine their skills so that's the point they can be more effective
teachers in our classrooms because we've eliminated that funding unless
they got started a year ago. And when I look at other aspects of this
budget in terms of health and human resources, it gives me deep, deep
concern. We got a hundred eighty six million dollars has now been set
aside as reserve for Medicaid. It makes sense we need to have that kind
of reserve, but if we have to access it, the formalities that we have to
go through result automatically in perhaps fifty two hundred or more
people losing their benefits. And what do we know about our history? We
know about our history that we've had these, had these overruns when it
came to Medicaids for quite some time. When it comes to our hospitals in
our large urban areas, those hospitals are out there providing services
for Medicaid recipients. They are short changed once again, those
hospitals, those providers. In many cases they're gonna be providing not
only Medicaid individuals with services but indigent care to those that
have no insurance because we have refused to expand Medicaid to over
five hundred thousand potential recipients here in the state of North
Carolina. All of those give me deep, deep concern. When I look at Health
and Human Services, and I look at after school care, we have a lot of
people in this state that work and either single family households and
single moms. We have others that are not single individuals but still
need that after school care but what have we done, we've short changed
them by nine point two million dollars. Misplaced priorities. That's not
what we need to be doing. It gives me deep concern. And when we look at
those that get childcare subsidies in this state. Childcare subsidies
that need that childcare so they can go to work. Based what we've done
with this budget and the way we've funded Health and Human Services, we
know that there'll be seventy two hundred families that will no longer
qualify for those childcare subsidies. And our community colleges, you
know, we're increasing tuition once again and it was not that much this
year, but look at what you've done over the last couple of years to
those students that need to go to those universities, those colleges,
because they provide opportunities to further their education before
they go into foreign institutions or to help them get some type of
degree that will get them into the workforce. Their tuition's gone up
close to thirty percent. And we also pass</p>

“Taking away longevity pay or including it and tagging it as a 7 percent
raise is unfair and dishonest”-  A very concerned citizen and voter.
I’m not sure that 7 percent is a trick or a treat.  Because [??] still
goes on to districts and teachers who want to earn a master’s degree,
that’s been eliminated.
Moving forward.  It takes away longevity.  The people who were impacted
the most, teachers, were not consulted or talked with or given choices.
The majority part of the education appropriation members simply were
included in this discussion.
And while it may be a quality for this Republican, GOP.  It leaves
people scratching their heads.  It leaves us wondering whether or not we
are serious about moving teachers forward.  Pitting young teachers
against the older teachers.  Not looking forward to the future in terms

Thank you very much.  I will appreciate Senator Brown did a wonderful
job in going through the budgets and hitting some points. But I wanted
to speak on the education portion especially because of the
misrepresentation that were just brought up.  I think its important that
we set the record straight on these.  When you describe a 7 percent
budget increase, 282 million dollars, the largest dollar increase in
North Carolina history as punishment I think that’s a misrepresentation.
Every teacher in North Carolina will receive a pay raise.  That means
when they look at their paycheck it will look bigger than it was, every
single teacher.  But I want to get to the point that I assume that
neither the media, the organizations, now here on floor a
misrepresentation of our budget and what we did on longevity pay.
Longevity pay was not taken away, it was given them in a different, and
I will explain, a more effective format.  Every teacher with longevity
pay, will look at their salary, their base pay, and then they will look
at their raise on top of that.  And from here on out that form of
longevity formula will be in the base salary.  Here’s why this is great,
the way longevity pay was paid was a lump sum at the end of the year.
The way it’s going to be paid now is it’s going to be every single
month.  There’s a core principle of finance called the time value of
money.  What that basically says is that money that is available in the
present time is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its
potential earning capacity.  With all the longevity pay plan now
teachers will now have future time value of money to their advantage.
That’s also in the entire pay system, teachers are [??]</p>

facilities and why is this important and why my standing today to talk
about how excited I am about this. Bill archer him into the psychiatric
treatment facility and they have had their constitutional right to a
public education denied them, and this will stop the index tracks in
these facilities. they receive no educational services at all and the
ones that are not being treated are not being provided by our public
school system and about this for a little while. if a child has cancer

institution, a teacher goes and works at that child that constitutional
right is not denied, but that's not so in a psychiatric hospital, where
a child has a mental illness.they do not get back ask yourself what is
the difference now is that David Chase and private institutions about
children under both children with illnesses. well, it would be children.
the psychiatric hospitals, most of them are the least among us in the
foster children and children from families where parents have mental
disabilities because mental illness is often inherited the children
whose parents are unable to advocate for them. what that means is it
imperative for us to do it, and to require the department of public
education to stop violating these children's constitutional right to a
free public and public education, and that's what this bill does sadly
this is not a new problem in two thousand eight representative glazier
sponsored a bill and my dear friend, the late Senator Byron Malan
carried that Bill on the Senate floor. it was adopted
incredulously. six years later, after the bill passed the children are
still being denied their constitutional right to a free what I decided
to begin to figure out why the Department of Public instruction, and
this is this travesty. I think the psychiatric hospital in Atlanta, and
that was provided to me by the Department of Public instruction on June
nineteenth two thousand fourteen I read that these institutions are
private educational settings. I cannot believe probably how
unconscionable that he is unashamed of APIs equating psychiatric

These hospitals and I want us all to be thankful that we can now feel
good about that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant, for
what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the conference
report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator has the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, I want to join others
in appreciating the hard work of everyone involved in putting the budget
together and to also echo the appreciation for our great staff and all
the work they do. I just want to highlight our four concerns in the
conference report that stand out to me as I think about what we face in
the rural communities that I represent. One is about hospitals, the
second point is about home and community care block grants, the third
point is about the special assistance funding, eligibility, and fourth
about the federal monies, they use of federal monies. First, and briefly
about our hospitals. This budget taxes our rural and community hospitals
with our increased payments. Our hospitals are already paying more for
the the Medicaid care of our citizens than the state does and pays
billions of dollars for uncompensated care as you've heard me talk about
before. And you know I have a concern about that because we're not
expanding health care coverage for all who could be eligible. They are
having to pay those millions of dollars. But this is both a health care
and a humanitarian issue and an economic development issue as I've said
before. These hospitals are our major employers and especially in our
most economic strapped areas. This budget is tantamount to I think about
a fifteen percent or fifteen percent reduction in force and a two
hundred million dollar cut across the board and across the state over
the bi-enium to our hospitals. I'm worried that our rural hospitals will
not be able to survive this policy approach of taxing our hospitals to
balance the budget. And at the same time reducing and not expanding what
the health care coverages are. In addition to a reduction in jobs, we
are concerned about a reduction in service. Similar to that, there's
about a one million dollar cut in the home and community care block
grant. Many of you are probably familiar with that program. It's been
around a long time. It's an essential safety net program for elders and
disabled adults. This cut will affect about fifteen hundred elders in
our community losing services. Why is this important in our rural
communities? It is because in our communities, we have some of the
fewest services and some of the more fragile provider organizations for
this population and it will be a definite hit for us. Senator Brown
mentioned that they, that no eligibility for Medicaid was reduced, but I
don't think that is exactly correct and he may want to correct me if I'm
wrong. We're not reducing Medicaid eligibility for the aged and disabled
under the special assistance program, instead, we are reducing the
eligibility for the state program. That is our state special assistance
program was providing domiciliary care for those who were in need of it
who were aged and disable for income levels a little above the Medicaid
level and they would automatically be eligible for medicaid and that was
creating one of the problems in the budget. So, instead of reducing
Medicaid eligibility, we are reducing the special assistance
eligibility. The bottom line is at least under the current utilization
of that program, that would mean about four thousand and some of our
elders and disable, people who doctors have said have to have
domiciliary care, would then no longer be eligible for that care and
would be homeless or having to be cared for perhaps in more at risk
settings by their families. And finally, we are using federal monies in
the budget at least in the are of child care services and pre-K to
supplant general fund revenues to the tune of about thirty million
dollars at least or more. But, yet we are unwilling to accept federal
monies for health care that would, again, help our rural communities.
These four examples of policy approaches are strangling our communities
and we strongly oppose them and our survival and prosperity is being...</p>

not only people’s livelihoods that they then use to pay their rent and
pay their mortgage, buy groceries, get gas, support the local economy.
It’s not only that, but when they lose their job, entire units of
hospitals are closing which means the people don’t have access which
means if they get it, they have to go to a further hospital and wait
longer for that service. You all are inflicting damage and it’s time to
stop it. Here is the deal with your election year budget, it does not
get North Carolina where we need to be. Doesn’t help us with where we
need to be in public education. It doesn’t help us in providing the
critical healthcare services that the people of North Carolina have
every right to deserve. Instead, you all are spending this year, $464
million in tax giveaways to people whose average income is $940,000.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, wrap this up, you’re ten minutes is over.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe I have 30 minutes, Mr. President. You need to refer to the
rules, rule 14, section A down at the bottom. Ten minutes, wrap it up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will refer to the rule and I will trust that this doesn’t count
against my time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, you using your watch or mine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Pardon.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, can you point me to where in the rules it limits me to
ten minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, let’s go to rule 14, no Senator shall speak on the same reading
more than once on any motion or appeal and no longer than ten minutes.
This is a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Fair enough, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We just learned that the cost of the tax plan this year is $715 million.
We learned that over the next 5 years that it will exceed $5.3 billion,
which is $880 million more than what we thought it was when you all
enacted it last year. All these cuts to health care, all the cuts to
education, is in order to give $715 million in tax giveaways to people
who don’t need the money. People who are high earners already doing
well. Let’s do a budget that helps the working folks and middle class of
North Carolina and not the well to do and the well connected. They don’t
need our help. They don’t. It’s the people of North Carolina that need
our help. For that reason, I’m voting against this budget. I urge you to
as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President. Reluctantly to speak briefly and it certainly won’t be 14

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You know I guess that it would only could be the largest dollar pay
raise in history could be explained away by a Harvard Lawyer in that
we’re not doing anything for teachers. I collect emails too, Senators.
Senator Stein is always reading us an email. I go hundreds of them. I
believe I get many more than probably anybody in here from teachers.
They told me, don’t tie our pay raise to tenure. We didn’t do it. They
said don’t take all of our TA’s...</p>

...away, I will sacrifice a little bit from the 11%. We kept every
living body that’s a TA now, they’ll have them again if they’ll choose a
flexibility ride and not put $90 some million into teachers, you got
your TAs. They won’t need to be a single TA loss, Senator Stein, and if
putting $280 some million into salaries, the largest dollar ever
increase is not doing anything for teachers, that’s amazing to everyone
I know that has the brain of logic about them, common sense. They said,
give us a healthy pay raise, 7% average. That’s pretty healthy. The last
time we in here gave everybody everything they want, which was cutting
teachers, by the way, by the hundreds, by the thousands. It was about a
$3 billion deficit, so that’s where we started and now we’ve gotten rid
of that and by cutting taxes, I believe the triad today, you forgot that
article, had about the lowest unemployment rates we’ve had. It’s around
5%, somebody’s going to work, they’re not all of them losing their jobs.
It’s an amazing thing to me how that’s improving and how our rates
dropped the third fastest in the nation. I think somebody’s doing
something right. But if you want to spread that we’ve taken longevity
away, which is an out and out falsehood, we simply put that money into
their salaries, and their big bumps at the five year intervals, if you
look at the salary schedules, we’ve compressed it down to get the
beginning teachers pay at $33,000 and we’ve gone from, as you like to
say, 46th in the nation to about 32nd, and from around 9th in the region
to 4th. I think that’s doing a lot for education. Now this year, let’s
talk about longevity just one moment. Senator Soucek, you did a great
job on that. You get a longevity check every year on your anniversary
date. A nice little bump up there, certain percentages increasing every
five years. They’re going get that check too, Senator Stein, this year
and the happiest people I know will be the people that have earned
longevity, and the average of 7% pay raise on top of. They’re going to
double dip this year simply for putting time in in the classroom in the
seat. It has nothing to do with performance. I’d say that’s a pretty
healthy Christmas present. Some of them will get it around Christmas
time. If you say, with a straight face, that we’re not doing huge things
for education, you’re either misinformed or you’re uninformed.

Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I got a tie. Senator Blue, if we can, let’s go to Senator Goolsby and
I’ll come to you. Senator Goolsby, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the conference report motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Like Senator Graham, this will be my last time, at least for a while, to
speak on a budget. I’m very proud that as I end my two terms, four years
here in the Senate, that we started off, just take you back a few years
what it was like when I showed up with the 13 of us. When we took the
majority in the Senate for the first time in over a 140 years. We had a
$3 Billion shortfall left to us by the Democrats. If you will remember
the 2009-10 budget, because you can look it up still at the Department
of Public Instruction, the Democrats had cut public education $840
million. Remember reading about that in the paper? Because I don’t.
Every year we’ve been here, we’ve increased spending on public
education. Did you read that in the paper? Because I didn’t. But it’s
the truth. We sure did. At the same time, as Senator Hise, so eloquently
put it, we’re dealing with incredible Medicaid shortfalls. Correct me if
I’m wrong, Senator, by the time I leave here, we’ve had unexpected
shortfalls in $2.220 billion, almost as much as the Democrats left us
when we took over this chamber. And we’re going to hear from Senator
Stein, this budget doesn’t get North Carolina where it needs to be.
Well, guess what? This budget doesn’t leave us in the kind of hole that
your party left us in when I showed up. We’ve had tough economic times,
but what have we done.
I don’t believe that you can tax people into prosperity, you can
regulate them into riches or that more government will solve our
problems, but that is the  Democrat biword in any election season. Any
time they get up to speak that’s all we hear.</p>

We're gonna tax you into prosperity. All we need to do is spend a little
more money. When they did that, and they left us in an incredible hole
when I first showed up here four years ago. Thanks to leadership of our
President Pro Tem, of our majority chair, and of our rules chair, our
majority leader and our rules chair, we've been able to turn this state
around. We've been able to drive down the unemployment rate by doing
what? Subsidizing poverty? No. Getting government out of array and
letting the North Carolina people and our businesses go back to work. So
when I hear the drivel and the crying and the whining by Democrats about
how bad this is, I don't know what planet you're on. Because I know how
bad it was when you were in charge and what you left us, and what I
leave this Senate on, which is a budget I'm proud of, which are laws I'm
proud of, which is a state that I'm proud of. When I first came here,
our state healthcare plan was broke. There was no plan to repair it.
There retirement plan in our state was broke. We owed the feds about two
point four billion dollars in unemployment insurance, you know what the
plan was? Well Governor Perdue was running around robbing from all of
our trust funds across the state. You do that in business and you go to
jail. But that's the way North Carolina worked. Well that's all changed,
and I'm proud to vote for this budget,  I'm proud to be a Republican,
and I'm proud to be in the majority. Thank you mister President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill, mister President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister President and my colleagues, I want to raise a few other issues
about this budget. Some of them have been alluded to, but on the ones
that I raise initially, I'm sure that most of you who put this budget
together will agree with me. Want to just give you a little bit of
perspective, because this budget does five things that, that causes me
some heartburn in addition to the issues that you've heard. I really
think that this budget potentially puts the state's highly ?? AAA bond
rating at risk. I genuinely believe that. And maybe you've checked with
the three rating agencies and gotten their take on it. And if you
haven't, I'd suggest that you do. The first thing I want to tell you is
having been one of the architects of the Rainy Day Fund, which is the
reserve that you've heard alluded to, we've spent time talking with
those agencies when we set it up in '93, and I'll confess to you that
the state budget officer helped us think this through when we created
the Rainy Day Fund. The current state budget officer, not the one in
'93. The statute that set up that Rainy Day Fund said initially that we
would set aside a bit of discipline, because we had moved away from
disciplined budgeting, pretty much as other stuff as I've observed over
the last couple of years with current leadership. And so we were gonna
build the discipline, so that each year, there was a projected certain
amount going to that Rainy Day Fund. And initially we set it at five
percent. In 2006, this body set it at eight percent. Whether discipline,
and it's pretty simple. It simply said that twenty five percent of what
you've got left over at the end of the year. It's not unlike the way
that you would advise somebody to do their own savings account. Twenty
five percent of what you thought you were gonna spend that you didn’t
spend will automatically go to this Rainy Day Fund. So that you got a
discipline to save so that when hard times come, like Joseph, all times
aren't good, there'll be up times and down times. But when hard times
come, you've got something in place to fix it. Or at least to keep you
from falling too deeply. Now we with discipline started building that
fund. And again we had done so well by 2006 that you raised it from the
five percent of what the state budget was to eight percent. This is a
twenty one billion dollar budget. We ought to have one point seven
billion dollars in the Rainy Day Fund.</p>

<p id="135:00">
It’s not about deadbeats, It’s about people who are sick.  And if we are
not going to meet our obligation now.  I don’t know where we will meet
it.
So I say to you that you have heard a lot of issues raised about what
the budget is doing to education, and I agree with that.  The teachers
themselves don’t particularly like the way you’ve structured this raise.
 And one of the reason a fourteen year teacher, a fifteen year teacher,
on the current schedule will get a 273 dollar pay raise out of this
stuff that you have done.  If we seriously want to deal with the
competition that we’re having here in Wake County and across this state
with these job fairs of people coming to steal teachers over nine
hundred to a thousand new teachers in Wake County that we will hire this
year.  Then you need to work with the teachers in coming up with a plan
in raising them to the national average.
This seven percent pay raise doesn’t do it.  It may be the biggest pay
raise in terms of absolute dollars.  But it is far from the biggest pay
raise that we have given teachers.  Even in the last twenty years, we
averaged 117% increase in pay raises for teachers in trying to hold on
to them and bringing them to the national average.
Many years, multiple years, consecutively, teachers received pay raises
in excesss or of an average of 7 ½ percent, consecutively.  That is how
we brought them to the national average in the last decade or two
decades.  So, don’t pat yourself on the back too quickly just because
the cost of living and inflation have jacked up salaries over the last
twenty years and more than doubled them.  This might be the biggest
monetary pay raise but it is far from the biggest percentage increase in
teacher’s salaries and unless you commit yourself to doing it on a
continuous sustained basis.
It won’t solve the problem that we’re facing, and this is the biggest
problem that I got with this budge.  ‘Cause I don’t think that given
where we that it is sustainable, I don’t think that it is fiscally
responsible, and I think it creates problems for us that we are not
prepared to meet.  I believe that ultimately we’re going to have to come
up with a way to sustain these pay raises, to sustain a base of income,
in this state and through this budget.  So that we can meet our
obligations and have a sufficient reserve account, and not start using
it on current expenses, and pretending that this problem is not going to
exist next year when we come back to town.  Because if you think that
this is a headache, the governor is going to have a billion dollar
headache trying to present a budget that will simply preserve the stuff
that you’ve done when he presents it to us next January or February.  So
for those reason, I certainly cannot support this budget, but I do hope
you think the way you’re going about it if you’re hear to draw it come
January.

Senator Burger recognized, you have ten minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hey Mister President, I hopefully will not take the full allotted time.
I’ve been trying to figure out just exactly where to start.  I know a
couple of folks have tried to talk about some things that have been said
that just don’t’ seem to be so.  So I figure I’ll start there.
One of great things about the electronic age, particularly the internet
and some of the things you have access to.  I heard just a few minutes
ago that the recurring/non-recurring issue in this budget is something
that is going to create huge problems for us with the bonding agencies.
You know, I don’t like the fact that we have about fifty million dollars
in non-recurring money covering recurring obligations.  I think that is
problematic.  However, if in 2010, 2011 the last year Democrats wrote a
budget.  I want to put my glasses on because this is a big number.  The
last year the Democrats did the budget, 2010, 2011.  That budget
actually had 3.2 billion dollars in non-recurring revenue covering
recurring expenses.</p>

<p id="140:00">
The year before, they did a little bit better. It was $1.8 billion in
non-recurring funding sources covering recurring obligations. I think
$50, $55 millions is a huge improvement. That really ought to be the
theme of what we’re talking about. We’ve been digging out of a hole for
four years now. We’re just about out, but you talk about the spending on
education and every year, we’ve adopted a budget we’ve spent more on
education than we have the year before. Every year. But you’re right,
we’re still digging out of the hole ya’ll have put us in and we’re not
quite there yet. Let’s talk about what we have done. The best social
program for folks is a job. What we’ve done is we’ve reduced the
unemployment rate in North Carolina over the past 3 years by about 4%.
More people today are working in North Carolina than ever before. That’s
a pretty good social program. That’s something that turns those people
into taxpayers, which is what we want. Now, let’s talk about teacher
pay, because I’m telling you, it just amazes me on the floor of this
Senate how a plus is a minus and a minus is a plus. You’ve got the
chart. In fact, it’s on the dashboard if you’ll take time to take a look
at it, I believe somebody said something about a teacher with 21 years
experience and that their longevity was gone. I’m looking at someone
with 21 years experience, the present time under the salary schedule,
their salary is $42,820. Now that’s without their longevity. With their
longevity, it’s $44,212. Now that teacher next year will be at 22 years.
At 22 years that $44,212 turns into $46,500. Now that might be less to
you, but that looks like more to me and I would say to the third graders
in our schools in North Carolina, if they had that on a test, for them
to get the right answer, they would say that’s a higher number. I would
say that some may get it wrong and as they grow, turn into Senators, I
don’t know.
I would say that the additional money that has been dedicated in this
budget to compensation increases is historic. It’s historic, especially
if you look at how far we’ve come over the past three years. It’s
historic when you look at what it does in one year to where we are in
regional and national averages. It is something that continues the
promise that this General Assembly has made to the people of this state,
to the teachers in this state, to the educators of this state, to the
parents in this state, that we are committed to making our public
schools the best in the nation. Part of that is paying our teachers
more, and we’re doing that. We’re doing it with a substantial investment
of the money that comes from the people back into education, because you
see, the idea that the best social program is a job, is actually
supported by the idea that we improve our public schools and we give our
kids and we give the next generation the opportunity and the tools that
they need in order to be qualified for those jobs that will exist in the
future. I urge you to vote for this budget. I would echo many of the
things that have been said by my colleagues on the Republican side in
the debate. This represents a signal achievement. Is it enough as far as
teacher pay is concerned? No, we wanted more than that, but this is a
substantial achievement. and I urge your support for the budget for that
reason and for many others that you’ve heard and as you read through the
document, you can see.
