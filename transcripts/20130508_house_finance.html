This was an effort to get control of debt.  I will tell you that
Representative Brown and Representative Moffitt and I ran into a stiff
headwind, particularly with one department, and what we've decided to do
is to direct the Program Evaluation Committee to study this issue.
Again, we're no less invested in trying to address the debt issue, but
we're willing to have a longer period of time to discuss it, and so
that's the beginning and end of the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Starnes
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I couldn't have said it better myself.  I think
everything ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I do have a question.  In your preparation for the
original Bill that you filed, how much debt did you discover was being
issued for projects over 5 million dollars?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I don't know that we found a number that we would put
out there, but you can imagine, particularly, let's say, with the
Department of Transportation, where every little exchange on interstate
is a really big number.  We know that there are rather substantial
debt-like obligations and debt, and that's really what we want to get
our arms around, Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. Chairman, I'm satisfied with the explanation and
the direction he's taken this, so I move for a favorable report to the
Proposed Committee Substitute for House Bill 364, unfavorable to the
original Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Representative Starnes.  Any further
questions or comments from the Committee?  If not, all in favor say aye.
 All opposed?  Motion carried.  Thank you, Representative McGrady.  It
wasn't as bad as we all thought it was going to be.  Now we'll hear
House Bill 442, Municipal Incorporation Changes.  Representative
Brown--and we wish you the same luck as the previous Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  ??  Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the Committee.
This Bill makes one fairly major change to the way that we acquire
municipal incorporations.  At the beginning, historically, we have
always had a petition of the registered voters.  This Bill also adds a
petition for folks that own property but who aren't necessarily
registered voters.  That's at the front end of the process, which is
perfectly constitutional in and of itself, but it certainly gives people
who own property, who have no voice, over whether the area in which they
own property becomes an incorporation or not, gives them some voice.  Of
course, we left it at 15%, the same as it always has been.  At the back
end, because we know the petitions are not always relevant, the longer
the lifespan of them.  We have petitions that are still active, still in
the works, that date back to 2000 or before, and we know that those are
not the most valid of petitions.  People die, people move, people
divorce, etc., so we have put a there-year time frame on the process
itself, from the time that a certain community decides they want to be
incorporated, to the time that the petitions are signed, they are
approved, validated, and then they go to the Subcommittee on Municipal
Incorporations.  We've given it a three-year time frame, which is
perfectly legitimate and certainly long enough in order to get that
accomplished.  That's really the only changes.  Nothing else has changed
in state law.  I appreciate your support, and I'll take questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Brawley
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Brawley
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Comment on the Motion, if it's appropriate.  The
comment would be you can improve this Bill greatly if you would tell the
Require that when they sign that petition they sign acknowledging they
understand to be incorporated there has to be a tax base.  I received a
petition with 600 and some names on it.  Not a one of them I called
wanted to leave their name on a petition once they understood that
incorporation meant no tax base.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  That's probably a valid point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  At the appropriate time, I'd like to make a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes, sir.  Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Brown, have you discussed this with
the legal municipalities?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  There's no objection.  This Bill has been out here
for two months.  There are no objections from anyone.  What I did not
want to do was to impair or inhibit any community's ability to
incorporate, because traditionally--my county is a sterling example of
that.  We have so many incorporated areas up north, because what we were
trying to do was to keep the city of Winston-Salem from encroaching, and
so--this Bill in no way inhibit's a community's ability to
incorporate...</p>

<p id="05:00">
Did not want to do that and in fact did not do that. What I wanted to do
is, in those cases, and there's not that many of them, where the
property owner is not necessarily the registered voter that this at
least allows that property owner regardless of why they own that
property - it may be a future retirement home, it may be rental
property, it may be their vacation home that they occupy one week or a
month out of the year but they have a right to have a voice in that
incorporation at the front end. We know at the back end it's gonna have
to always be a referendum. We learned that during our annexation battles
in 2011 and 12 and it has to be a referendum at the end but at least in
the beginning they do have a voice and like I say most of the time one
is going to be the other but there are occasions where they're not and
this will take care of that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. Thank you
Representative Brown. I guess a question for ?? please Mr. chairman and
that is and I don't know who'd like to handle this. Didn't we have this,
a couple years ago, didn't we get into this problem of trying to give
essentially some kind of rights to non-residents? And so I guess I'm
trying to figure out how this doesn't get into that same problem where
you decide you can't - I mean we know you can't vote in Atlantic Beach
and Rhode Island just because you own a house down there if you live in
Durham or Lexington so can someone speak to that issue of non-residents
having a say on this issue? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Cohen. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes this bill basically puts that at the beginning of the
process as a trigger where in order which gives property owners as well
as registered voters a say at the beginning of the process just like,
for instance, to trigger the beginning of the process to create a fire
district involves only property owners and eventually it's a referendum.
What the court struck down was at the end of the process where it
actually has illegal effect involving property owners sort of as
substitute for a referendum because the Constitution says property
qualifications can't affect the right to vote so this is similar to
other processes where property owners trigger the beginning of the
process. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Carney. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I just have a question of staff on the back page
we've got this handout of places, municipal incorporations, that are not
yet incorporated rather. There are several starting with Guilford County
down through Dare County. My question is are these people going to have
to get back in the hopper are start all over again with new petitions or
are they - could you address that? Katrina maybe. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Roney. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This list was done by the ?? staff and what it
shows is people that the way I understand it the ones that are in gray
they did not actually incorporate. The reason - there's no call on here
telling you why they didn't incorporate but most of these they didn't
incorporate because we did check and most of them did not incorporate
because the referendum failed. So that's where the art in the process
they have a referendum and it failed. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. So it
failed but have they come back to go back through the process again.
Have they applied for that, do you know? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Cohen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Excuse me may I just clarify. The ones that are
highlighted they did not have a referendum? Is that what you're -
they're X'd out - they aren't a yes or a no so does that X indicate that
they did not hold a referendum? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't know. I can
answer the question about one of them Representative Carney. If you'll
look at Catawba County under something called Slanting Bridge. It went
as far as the public hearing, the general public was not in favor. There
was a very small group of people that wanted to prevent Catawba County
from putting a sewer plant in the Lake Norman area. That never went past
the public hearing, there was never a bill filed but it did it was a
petition filed I think Mr. Cohen has the but that's one of them I can
answer where it didn't proceed. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Basically this
provision says that after 3 years of submitting it to the commission the
petition is stale, in other words that the House and Senate rules
require that in order to bring a bill to the floor, not just to file a
bill, but to bring a bill to the floor it has to have had a
recommendation from this commission. Basically this will say that 3
years from the time the petition it's submitted to the commission it's
stale it can't be relied on in the legislature that let us satisfy this
rule and if it's still pending</p>

<p id="10:00">
the commission itself, it has to start over again. So, basically it
gives you a three-year life after the petition is submitted. If the
legislature hasn't approved of the bill or if it's pending before the
commission, the people have to start over on the basis that the
circumstances have probably changed. We've had people come back to the
legislature trying to get in a corporation bill five or six years after
the petition was submitted to the commissioner after the commission made
a recommendation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I just want to make sure that we
aren't catching some that are already in the process, you know, two
years, and we're going to slam them. Then, they've got to turn around
and go back and start over. If they're already in the loop, are they
taken into consideration in this legislation to the bill's ?? ? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Section 11 says the bill only applies to petitions submitted to
the ?? corporations subcommittee after this September 8th. That rule
doesn't apply to anything, all these things on the list for five or six
years ago aren't made stale by this. It only starts with new petitions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Warren. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just, at the appropriate time, I'd like to be
recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We have a motion. I think
it's the appropriate time, Representative Warren. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I'd like to make a motion for a favorable report to the
committee substitute unfavorable to the original. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This
is not a PCS. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah it is. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It is?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry, sir. Mine says committee substitute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, but it's the old one. It was a PCS in a previous
committee. It's not a PCS in this committee. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would
stand here and let you correct me, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir, I have
good people to direct me, and they keep me from looking like a complete
imbecile. So, bless your heart. Please repeat your motion for the
committee. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would like to make a favorable report on
the bill, and there is no referral. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the
committee, you've heard the motion on the floor. Is there any further
discussion? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman [SPEAKER CHANGES] If not. Yes
sir. Representative Starnes, you caught me right before. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well. Let me ask the bill's sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] By all means. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I wholeheartedly
support the limits. My question is, tell me the thoughts you went
through to come up with three years. Is that adequate time? I'm just
wondering if it doesn't need to be two full sessions as opposed to one
and a half sessions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can I respond? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma'am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The three years is from the time that a
community begins the process to the time that they get it to the
subcommittee of municipal incorporations. And that should be plenty of
time to do the petition. Then, they've got thirty days to have it
verified. Am I not correct? Mr. Cohen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That's correct.
This allows a full legislative cycle, either long and short or short and
long, depending on when it's turned in. The petition has to be submitted
to the commission basically by Thanksgiving of a particular year, and
then the commission has to report by the first sixty days in the next
legislative session. So, depending on which year the petition is
submitted, this gives a full session for the legislature to review it,
either short and long or long and short. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. My
only thought was, if it's done in a short session, and it doesn't have
unanimous approval, then it's ineligible. So, that carries it over
another year. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That's correct. If it was submitted in a
short session, it'll be eligible in the long. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any
further questions from the committee? If not, you hear the motion on the
floor. All in favor, say &quot;aye&quot;. All opposed? Motion carried.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Representative  Brown. We're glad to have you. For members of the
committee, I'd also like to alert you that house bill 553 Amend Cateret
County Occupancy Tax, has been referred to the Occupancy Tax
Subcommittee, and we'd be tickled to death if y'all will have it.
Representative Stone, do you have a report from the subcommittee on
de-annexation? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chair. The house
subcommittee on de-annexation annexation met. We sent out a favorable
report for house bill 567 and house bill 526. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Representative Stone. At this time, we will have house bill 567
Lumberton De-annexation Representative Waddell. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. This is a local bill. I
would say a simple bill, but it's not had a simple journey [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Nothing ever does. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Nothing ever does around here. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It was at the request
of the City Council of Lumberton to de-annex a little portion 95, I
think, that they were having problems with, and</p>

Representative: with having said all that I will stand for questions and
ask that you make it favorable.
Speaker: Representative Warren?
Representative: A question for the bill’s sponsor.
Speaker: Representative Videll?
Representative: I understand you say sir that there was no opposition at
all?
Representative: No opposition.
Representative: Mr. Chair, at the appropriate time I would like to be
recognized for a motion.
Speaker: Further questions or comments from the committee?
Representative Warren, as always, it is the appropriate time for a
motion.
Representative: I would like to make a motion for a favorable report on
house bill 567.
Speaker: Will you refer to the committee on government?
Representative: Absolutely.
Speaker: Thank you Representative Warren. Members of the committee, you
have heard the motion on the floor.
Representative: We had this in government Mr. Chair.
Speaker: To quote the grail from the computer, it was sent to Senator
[xx], but was withdrawn from the committee, according to the computer,
and referred to the committee on finance and is favorable. So it has
made one more trip to government and it should not be long, otherwise,
we are going to meet in government tomorrow.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chair, I look forward to hearing it yet
again.
Speaker: Yes, I do too. Members of the committee you have heard the
motion on the floor, is there any further discussion? I hope not. All in
favor say aye [aye]. All opposed? [silence] Motion carries. Thank you
Representative Warren – Videll, excuse me. Representative Videll why
don’t we have you, I know you want to get this over with, why don’t we
just down to house bill 526, chad burn voluntary annexation .
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chair. This is a voluntary annexation that
was requested by my hometown chapman to annex a small personal land for
victory in jesus. There was no opposition. They had a public hearing. I
have got all the documents.
Speaker: Members of the committee, this one does not have to go anywhere
according to the computer, and we rely on those greatly. Representative
Collins and then Kerney.
Representative: I would like to make a motion when it is appropriate.
Speaker: Bless your heart, Representative Kerney. Yes ma’am.
Representative Collins, your motion?
Representative: I would like to just state once again my ecstasy at
being able to make a motion that we accept and give a favorable report
to house bill 526 for a voluntary annexation in chadwin.
Speaker: Absolutely. Members of the committee you have heard the motion
on the floor, is there any further discussion? I hope not. All in favor
say aye [aye]. All opposed? [silence] Motion carries. Thank you
Representative.
Representative: It has been a pleasure.
Speaker: At this time we will have house bill 545, modify Henderson
occupancy tax, and I am sorry Representative Grady, I would have caught
you when you were up here before, if I had realized.
Representative: No problem I just want the same result. House bill 545
is dedicated to Representative Howard. Last year we adopted an occupancy
tax for Henderson County and dedicated a portion of that tax directly to
a certain nonprofit. House finance committee, former Representative
McGhee and other leaders, did not much like it but the senate did not
much like it. Well, low and behold, we are back to reverse it. We are
repealing the provision that house finance did not like last year and we
are taking care of a name change. That is all the bill does. The house
finance did not like what we did. The senate finance insisted upon it.
so this puts it back to where house finance wanted it last year.
Speaker: Redemption has been reached. Members of the committee,
questions, comments, motions? Representative Moffet?
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chair. I would like to make a motion for a
favorable report for house bill 545.
Speaker: Members of the floor you have heard the discussion on the
floor, is there any further discussion? I hope not. All in favor say aye
[aye]. All opposed? [silence] Motion carries. Thank you Representative
McGrady. You are holding out today. At this time we will hear house bill
552, remove area from county service district. Representative McElray?
We will thank the Potomac County schools for that.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Up to  get a $1000 tax credit just because I put them
under a friend’s probe.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I move the adoption to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members you’ve heard the motion from Representative
Brawley. Any other discussion? Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don’t understand, your sunset, isn’t that in the
PCS, lines five and six? Or five?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley? I’d have to defer to staff,
they just handed me the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Miss Scrition?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes, as you recall the subcommittee
yesterday amended the bill to add the sunset, which is what you see in
the PCS before you. There is an amendment drafted this morning to add
the language about the new hires and the amendment that you see simply
moves the sunset from the uncodified part of this statute, I mean the
uncodified part of the law, to put it in the actual statute. That’s more
of a technical thing. It just made more sense to put the sunset in the
statute. The sunset isn’t new to the, isn’t new to the amendment but
this committee hasn’t seen the sunset before but that was adopted by the
subcommittee yesterday.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further questions or comments from the committee?
How about a motion from the committee? I know you’re all out there.
Representative Howard?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir, I’d like to move that we give a favorable
report to House Bill...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We’re on the amendment. Pardon me, I’m ahead of
myself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m so sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s my fault. Members you have the amendment before
you for House Bill, the PCS for House Bill 341 and the motion for
Representative Brawley. Any further comments or questions regarding the
motion? Representative Talbert? Yes, on the amendment. Pardon me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. There’s absolutely no way can
we not support this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Talbert. You heard the
comment from the bill’s sponsor and the motion. All in favor of the
amendment from Representative Brawley say “Aye”.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed? Motion carried. Amendment passes. Kittens
and honey. Representative Howard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] At the appropriate time, Mr. Chairman, I’d like to
move that we give a favorable report to House Bill 341 as amended,
rolled into a new PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you ma’am. Representative Luebke?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to send for an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do members have the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, I think staff has it and it’s being passed out
right now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Committee will be at ease until the amendment is with
the members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman? Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d raise the point of order that this is not germane
to the bill, number one, and number two, it’s already been defeated in
this committee several times. Although that’s not… Anyway, I raise that
point of order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, may I respond? This is a bill on tax
credits, Representative Stam waited for a bill on tax credits so that we
could consider another tax credit. Representative Brawley’s amendment
makes clear that the history of our committee is that we put sunsets on
tax credits and this amendment simply really runs parallel to the
Representative Torbett’s bills so far as amended by Representative
Brawley’s.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This amendment’s been defeated several times.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, if I may continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please finish.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] They’re also...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Has he been recognized to debate it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He’s just responding.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m responding to your concern and also, I would also
add, Representative Stam, that Representative Richardson is here today.
She actually had filed this as a bill and was told that the bill would
not be considered in this committee so it was the only way we could
consider it was as an amendment. She’s here to speak to that if you
would like to hear that, Representative Stam. Mr. Chairman, I just think
it’s appropriate to add another tax credit extension, sunset extension
to the bill which is why I’m moving adoption to the amendment and I can
speak to specifics if you would like, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Luebke. Representative
Moore?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I move that the gentleman’s amendment do eye upon the
table.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members you’ve heard the motions on the floor and the
second.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Can we not in a committee discuss such a motion, it’s
not the floor?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m aware we’re not in the chamber, I realize we’re in

And it really makes me wonder and should make the public wonder, in what
are you afraid of in having a debate. So, thank you Mr. Chairman, I
appreciate it. [Speaker changes] Thank you Representative Luebke.
Further discussion and comments about the current bill from the
committee? Representative Tine [Speaker changes] I just had a question
of the Bill sponsor, how it works. Is it for all industries and types of
employment? Or is it certain segments? [Speaker changes] The easiest
answer would be to go to the Department of Labor website and look under
the ?? program and it will show you page after page of each identifying
process. [Speaker changes] Representative Howard, you’re recognized for
your motion. [Speaker changes] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I would move that
we give House Bill 341 a favorable report as amended rolled into a new
PCS and favorable to the original bill. [Speaker changes] Members of the
committee for the motion on the floor any further discussion, if not,
all in favor say I. All opposed. Motion carried. Thank you
Representative ?? [Speaker changes] Mr. Chairman members of the
committee thank you and just proves again that we are working under
worst government process there is, besides all the rest of them. So,
thank you all very much. [Speaker changes] It’s been a real pleasure.
Representative McNeil. [Speaker changes] At this time we will hear House
Bill 656 Forfeiture for Speeding to Elude Revisions. [Speaker changes]
Thank you Mr. Chair, committee members. House Bill 656 is a bill that is
changing the forfeiture for speeding to elude arrest provisions. I
believe it was in the last biennium that a bill was passed, making a
speeding to elude arrest a felony and also creating a way to forfeit the
vehicles for those that commit that crime. When the bill was passed,
this body used the provisions for selling the vehicles that came under
the pre-arranged racing statues. It turned out that those did not work
very well and this bill is basically changing the current law to sale
the vehicles and forfeit the vehicles under the same statue as impaired
driving. I will be glad to go through the bill line by line, until you
all want to stop me. [Speaker changes] Representative Warren. [Speaker
changes] Thank you Mr. Chairman, just appropriate time. [Speaker
changes] Thank you Representative Warren. Any other comments from the
committee? Or questions? Representative Stone. [Speaker changes] Quickly
just tell us what it does, real quick. With out going line by line
please. [Speaker changes] Basically what it does, under the old statue
for prearranged racing, it made it the Sheriff’s responsibility to sale
the vehicles, basically turn them over to them. This pretty much turns
them over to the school board, I guess. In a short, short version.
Basically ??, instead of the Sheriff. And if the staff has a quicker
explanation than that. . . that’s pretty much it in a nut shell.
[Speaker changes] Mrs. Sights, please. [Speaker changes] Thank you Mr.
Chair. The main thing is the DWI statues have a lot more procedure and
process for dealing with innocent owners, lien holders, there is a state
wide contract that DPI already has set up to take and hold these
vehicles until the court case is decided to auction and sale off these
vehicles and distribute the proceeds to the School Board. The process
that is currently in statue is only used in one other statue that is
very rarely used and Sheriff just aren’t really not set up to deal with
all these vehicles. So, this is a process where its already in place for
the DWI vehicles. [Speaker changes] Representative Alexander. [Speaker
changes] A question to the Bill Sponsor. What happens if somebody who is
arrested is not operating their own vehicle? Is operating a vehicle
owned by somebody else in the household? Or is operating their
employer’s vehicle? [Speaker changes] There are provisions in the statue
for that. Staff if you want to jump in? Its section two, on page two,
line nineteen I think it is.</p>

I have a lot of concerns about this. And I have a very serious question
now we are talking about giving grants and grants to people to send
there kids to other schools These kids with disabilities that are
recieving in order to get it they must be receiving daily programs from
the public school on this disability. Dos that also apply to where this
money goes. That if this child goes to a private school Does that school
have to address the disability and does this funds go to the addressing
the disability that the child has [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Holly
The child must receive special education or related service on a daily
basis that is a defined term 4 pages in the federal registry of what
that means That part of the bill does not change current law if that is
a question you have or a concern you have that is a question you have
about the bill that was passed 2 years ago not this bill [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  Follow up. Follow up. For being a grant we can stipulate that
the grant go forth a special education provisions that this child needs.
That's what I am saying if the original law does say and then the
private school and then the private school does not address the
disability of the child at all. But we're now giving a grant making it a
grant does this grant money go for the disability of the need of that
child [SPEAKER CHANGES]  It may well again that's no difference than the
current law in this bill but to answer your question it may very well be
under this law that they receive the grant to go to a private school but
then receive the services that they and daily services outside the
school for example the school does not have a speech pathologist so
every day they go to a speech pathologist and receive that. But they
must receive that. defined services on a daily basis in order to qualify
for the money [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up follow up Is it the school
then that providing the speech therapy not necessarily not necessarily
so parents may then have to come up with additional funds out of their
pocket to provide for the disability of the child because it was not
included in his grant [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
 Representative Jordan. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howlie I would
point you to page two line 12 to help alleviate your concerns
scholarships grants should be awarded only for the reimbursement of
education and special education services follow up follow up if it all
goes towards tuition and what representative starnes was saying the
child is still getting help from the dis ability. they only qualify if
they get the services daily you know you cant say yes if the qualify if
the public schools they get currently I still don't understand i have to
many questions representative hall was next in the que [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I want to focus on a question of the somewhat severity of the children
who would be recipients of this and I am concerned and I don't now if
since this bill has been in effect for two years that if we have any
thing from staff or from the bill sponsors as to what the severity
disability level of the children are receiving or participating in the
program currently</p>

<p id="55:00">
Of course, that's not a change from the existing law to this law. But to
put it into terms probably easily understandable. You'd have severe
disabilities, moderate, and minimal. This would include moderate and
severe, but not minimal. Because minimal disabilities, if you have to
have a pill once a week that doesn't, doesn't count. So it would not
include uh, the least severe.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Followup.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Then, the staff have any background research information on how the
program has been used to this point. Whether or not they're in moderate
or severe?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Dripdty, or Cara?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? Well, well the bill eligibility requirements is that you have to get
them the services on a daily basis. So we don't really have a way of
defining that other than it's on a daily basis. I believe we've got some
numbers from Fiscal research that said how many students qualified for
the tax credit in the past two years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As far as the number of students, information provided from DOR
indicates that six hundred and nineteen returns received the assistance
in 2011 taxable year. We don't have complete data for the 2012 taxable
year, but so far they have four hundred eighty five returns. So four
hundred and eighty five.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And we would expect 2012 to be more because 2011 was only in effect for
one semester, whereas, 2012, a whole year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Followup?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Followup.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is it correct then that, since we're moving this to a grant program,
that we can make this for the most severe children with the most severe
disabilities to be able to take advantage of it. As opposed to folks
who, who may not need it as much?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That amendment was offered on the floor two years ago, and was defeated
about three to one, your free law for that amendment. And I would
challenge you as to what it would actually say. That's a very difficult
definitional problem.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, make a comment and a motion at this appropriate time. But
the question about the grant and listening to this debate, I was under
the impression that we were just talking about a three thousand dollar
grant once you establish eligibility. But I read on down on page two,
line seventeen, eighteen, and nineteen. It says that the authority to,
that well. It says, the authority can require receipts or other
disbursements must be approved to demonstrate costs incurred. The
authority shall award a scholarship in the amount of the cost
demonstrated by the parent, up to the maximum amount. So they don't just
get a grant. They've got to demonstrate there've been expenses for that,
that, to try to help that person with a disability.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And it's three thousand per semester.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But it is demonstrated cost, so.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Up to the actual cost.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr.Chairman, at the appropriate time, I'd like to make a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Brawley. Representative Starnes, has
Representative Stam made one. I will get back to you. Representative
Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I need some clarification. On page one, starting on I guess
it's twenty four, twenty five. The ineligible, the eligibility
requirement is that you're enrolled in a public school during the
previous semester. Then you get over there on page two, and lines eleven
and twelve, and it says eligible students may not be enrolled. I'm
trying to reconcile all that. Help me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, if I could.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
By all means.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To become first eligible, you either have to have been in a public
school, which you just sited. Or if you go down to line thirty and
thirty-one, you can start at kindergarten or first grade. Or
twenty-nine, got it in the previous semester. So to qualify to begin,
you have to have fit one of those. But obviously to then receive the
grant, you can't be in a public school. You can't double dip. You can't
get the public education at twelve, fifteen, twenty thousand a year,
plus the grant. It's one or the other.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, well follow up then.</p>

<p id="60:00">
...and I guess that's one thing I've got a little bit of problem with.
Now I support the bill, but it troubles me that to be eligible, a child
has to be enrolled in a public school the previous semester. I'm just
afraid you're going to have unnecessary, unmanageable enrollment shifts.
Let's say I've got a child that I'm home schooling, because they have
special needs. And they're in the first grade, and so I decide I would
like to have this child in the private school, but for them to be
eligible to be in the private school, I've got to put them in the public
school for one semester.
So I enroll them in the public school for a semester, and then I pull
them back out and put them in the private school, and it just looks like
it's an unmanageable enrollment shift, between the public school and the
private schools. You understand?
[SPEAKER SHIFT] That was addressed in the fiscal note two years ago as a
possibility, and of course, what we found out is the numbers just have
not been that overwhelming. This year there may be a thousand students
involved, but that was addressed in the fiscal note. But if you don't
have something like that, two things.
First of all, the gatekeeper for this is the public school, because you
can only get this if you have an IEP that you receive at the public
school. In other words, you can't go out privately and get an IEP that
qualifies you this. The public school says, you're qualified, because
you have an IEP. So you have to start there.
And secondly, if you didn't require starting there, it would blow the
fiscal note up into tens of millions of dollars.
[PREVIOUS SPEAKER] Followup. I understand that it would blow up the
fiscal note, but are private schools not qualified to give an IEP?
[ORIGINAL SPEAKER] They may be technically qualified, but there's no
mechanism for it, and that's not a change from existing law. In other
words, we made a conscious policy decision two years ago that the public
schools would be the gatekeeper to determine whether in fact you are
disabled, and if so, how so. And you could argue with that, but it's
just a policy decision. Otherwise, the argument was, there would be too
much possibilities of fraud or collusion, or Representative Moore, you'd
be doing an IEP for Representative Ross. But that's the reason.
The Chairman: Representative McManus.
Representative McManus: Since I wasn't here two years ago, I am curious
that, with limited funds, what was the rationale about not prioritizing
this for students with the greatest needs?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Actually, it was prioritized for those with the least
greatest need [chuckles]. By an amendment offered on the floor that was
a combination of people trying to kill the bill and people who honestly
didn't believe in refundable tax credits, and the people who just were
trying to kill the bill were repented and said they would try to fix it
later, which they have done.
I will tell you that in the Education Committee, speaking in favor of
this, were Representative Charles Graham, who has is a special ed
teacher, Representative Glazier, and Represenative Brandon.
The Chairman: Representative Hamilton.
Representative Hamilton: I was not talking about greatest financial
need; I was talking about greatest need for services.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Okay, it's very difficult to define, for one thing.
Secondly, when the amendment was offered to try to define it, the
numbers came out that it was only covering ten percent of the people
that this bill covers, and this bill only covers about a thousand kids a
year, so it would reduce it down to insignificance.
The Chairman: Representative Hamilton.
Representative Hamilton: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I have a question for
the bill's sponsors, if I may.
The bill provides for a child with a child with a disability to qualify
for the grant, but it does nothing specific to address the child's
disability. In other words, we're taking, we're giving, we're rewarding
the parents for pulling a child out of the public school system, where
they were receiving services and giving them money for...</p>

Putting them in a private institution.  Is that correct?  A private
school, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hamilton, the funds are only as a reimbursement.  So
they’re going to be providing documents to show what they’ll be
reimbursed for. And the point is to get these services anywhere they’d
like to. We’d like to give parents a choice as opposed to putting a bill

to argue with providing tuition reimbursement for children with special
needs and disabilities.  But I can tell you from personal experience
that most private schools are not providing the same level of service
for their students that are provided for their children that are
provided for in the public school scenario.  So effectively, pulling
children out of the public school system and putting them into a private
school situation rewards the private school by increasing their
enrollment but it does nothing to help the parents because again,
speaking from personal experience, if the private school doesn’t offer
these services then the parent is going to have to come out of pocket
and pay for additional services that otherwise they would have been
receiving in the private school scenario. The amendment that I intended
to bring forward and will bring forward on the floor is to.
