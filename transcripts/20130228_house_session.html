[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Transportation.
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, once again I think some teachers were
actually finding their way to the chamber when I recognized them
earlier, so now that I see some familiar faces in the chamber, once
again I would like to extend the courtesies of the gallery to teachers
of the year from across the state who came here today to spend time with
us. Please stand and let us welcome you.
Calendar. House bill 33, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Committee substitute for House bill 33, a bill to entitle an act to
repeal the law prohibiting the setting of steel traps on certain rented
or leased land in Cleveland, Polk, and Rutherford counties, General
Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Whitmeyer, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the House, House bill 33 is a very straightforward local bill
that affects Polk, Rutherford, and Cleveland counties, and its main
objective is to allow these counties to be like all the other counties
in the state when it comes to people being able to effectively use steel
traps to manage an overabundant coyote population that is killing pets
and livestock and threatening public safety, and also to allow people to
be able to more effectively exercise their property rights when it comes
to managing other species such as beaver that are overabundant. This
bill is supported by the wildlife commission, the letter is on your desk
showing support for this, and in simple terms, it seeks to repeal a 33
year old law that was written prior to coyotes even entering the state.
It's a great example of regulatory reform, so with that I ask that you
support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

House bill 56, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Committee substitute for House bill 56, a bill to entitle an act to
establish a contract management section of the division of purchase and
contracts, Department of Administration, to amend the laws requiring
negotiation and review of certain state contracts to provide oversight
and reporting of certain contracts, awards, and to provide for contract
management in administration as recommended by the Joint legislation
program oversight committee. General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Howard, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and members of the House.
As the reading clerk indicated, this is a bill that came out of the
program evaluation oversight committee, and it was based on the state
auditor's report and also the joint committee hearings that were
concerning contracting. The findings were that they quickly identified
the lack of adequate legal review on proposed contracts for the state
health plan and the office of state purchasing for office supplies. The
hearings</p>

<p id="015:00">
Identified severe shortage of qualified contracting negotiators and
administrators within state government. The bill tries several things
and I will try to be as brief as I can. It requires attorney general or
his or her designee or university general council or designee to review
but not approve or disapprove of the merit or lot there of any proposed
contract of supplies, materials, printing equipment and contractual
services exceeding $1 million to determine if the proposed contract is
in proper legal form contains all clauses required by law is legally
enforceable and accomplished its intended purposes. Secondly it requires
the attorney general or representative to sign any contract for services
exceeding $5 million that requires the attorney general to advise or
assist with negotiation pursuant to GS 143-49 3A. If the attorney
general does not sign, the contract is not valid. Further it requires
the attorney general in consultation with department of administration
to establish guidelines for the review of sale proposed contracts.
It requires the general council of University of North Carolina to
establish procedures for review of proposed contracts and to comply with
the procedures established by the attorney general. It requires all
agencies and universities when considering contract exceeding $1 million
to notify the secretary of the department of administration of the
intent to enter in to a contract and to provide name and title of the
attorney designated to conduct the required reviews. It requires the
department of administration to adopt procedures for record keeping for
all contracts under review pursuant to the bill and to keep a log naming
the contracting attorney or university and the name and title of the
attorney conducting the required legal review. Requires the secretary of
department of administration to notify the attorney general of all
pending contracts for contractual services exceeding $5 million and
requires the attorney general to assign a representative to assist in
those negotiations. It does not require the secretary to notify the
attorney general in such contracts entered in to the by the universities
unless requested the general counsel of the University of North
Carolina. It authorizes the treasurer to request the secretary general
to authorize the treasure to employee outside counsel for investment
contract over $5 million.
It requires department of administration to notify agencies of legal
review required by agencies and otherwise exempt from state purchasing
regulations. To address contract negotiations and administration
deficiencies identified by the joint permanent  evaluation committee and
the state auditor requires the department of administration   by January
to implement International organization of standards two to create a
contracting specialist career path for all state employees third to
create a contract negotiation and management training and certification
program for all state government employees. Four to work with the school
of government on the study to determine the feasibility to adopt
provisions by the American bar I association model procurement code. And
lastly to establish procedures permitting state government in joining
co-operative purchasing plans. With that Mr. Speaker I would stand to
answer any question and I would ask for your support.
[Speaker Changes] Rep Holley, Please state your purpose
[Speaker Changes] to speak on the bill
[Speaker Changes] The lady is recognized to debate on the bill
[Speaker Changes] want to say that I have spent the last 25 years of my
life working in the division of purchase and contract. Through this bill
it tightens up something and it allows it be lot more efficient and
relevant to the state of North Carolina and I support the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Further discussion further debate. Rep Stam please
state your purpose.</p>

yeah a question for representative Howard.
representative Howard does the lady yield.
I do.
the lady yields.
representative Howard a question perhaps we could clarify later but at
the bottom of page 2 top of page 3 in order to be valid any contract for
services etc etc what would happen how would you interpret that if a
contractor provided all the services million dollars worth of services
and then submitted a bill does the state not pay them their million or
do they get to go on quantum [??] for what's the effect if the attorney
has not signed the contract.
that contract is not valid according to this bill.
well a second question.
yes sir.
the lady yields.
if the contract's not valid and the contractor obtained some
compensation in quantum [??] or are they just out of luck.
well the experts around me all the attorneys say that's for the courts
to decide.
it's a job's bill representative Stam, further discussion further
debate, if not the question before the house is the passage of the house
committee substitute for house bill 56 on its second reading all those
in favor vote aye all those opposed vote no the clerk will open the

the gentleman's recognized to debate the bill.
yeah it's a great bill I think that does need to be clarified but I
don't have the language to do it so I'll just get with staff and see if
they can come up with the right answer and deal with it in the senate.
representative [??] please state your purpose, further discussion

Mr speaker.
representative Howard please state your purpose.
motion subject to the calender please the lady's recognized for a
motion.
I request that house bill 61 be re-referred to appropriations.
without objection so ordered, house bill 97 the clerk will read.

schools as recommended by the legislate research commission study
committee on digital learning environment in public schools general
assembly of North Carolina enact.
representative Horn please state your purpose.
discuss the bill.
the gentleman's recognized to debate the bill.
thank you Mr speaker ladies and gentlemen this is [??] in a series of
bills to move our education system in North Carolina into the digital
age as you know currently 40 percent of library funds are [??] marked
for school construction not all schools systems not all counties are
continuing the construction business but I want they maybe in fact
paying off construction loans but what this bill does is give the county
commissioners flexibility to use their construction money from lottery
to purchase digital support materials I was trying to find a good word
for that I think that works pretty well probably if I just read off  the
bill it would do just as well but this is not an appropriations bill
it's not a prescription bill it's a bill for flexibility to the county
commissioners so that they can work with the school systems and apply
the money appropriately for digital education.
Mr speaker.
representative Wilkins please state your purpose.
thank you sir would representative Horn yield for a question .

Representative Horn, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker and thank you representative Horn. I maybe
reading this thing a bit wrong so I'm going to ask you to correct me if
I get it wrong. I read it as the LEA is given the flexibility to use
these funds but the funds go to commissioners. Am I getting it right,
sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, yes and no. Don't you love those political answers. I get on both
sides of the issues. The lottery monies for construction are really
under the control of the county commissioners. And actually I believe I
have an amendment to the bill that specifically explains that and it
should be on your dashboard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman wished to be recognized to send forth an amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do, sir. Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Horn is recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk
will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Horn. House bill 97H 97AlE2 B4. Representative Horn moves
to amend the bill on page 2, line 16.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker. On page 2, line 16, I clarify who has control
over those funds. And it now reads that through June 30th of 2016, the
county commissioners may use monies from this fund to pay for digital
learning needs.
Those monies are under the control of the county commissioner. I did get
confused a little bit in my presentation- boy I hate using that word, I
really hate using that word- nevertheless, I think that clarifies the
process. It also, by the way, this bill sets some performance
requirements. It doesn't just say here is the money, have a good time,
go out and buy a bunch of IPads. You've got to make some progress to
utilize this money for it to be- there's accountability in there.
I do point out that there is a recommendation from the digital learning
environment committee that was part of the LRC and was- got excellent
support in committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? The gentleman had the light on for the bill. Do you intend to speak
on the bill or the amendment?
Further discussion, further debate on the amendment?
If not-
Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment or ask representative Horn a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Horn, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much mister speaker. Thank you, representative. I'm just
looking at the amendment. I just want to make sure, and I'm totally on
board as you know on the bill, and I understand and agree with the
amendment. You're amending lines 16 where the word county appears to say
county commissioners. Do you also, for any reason, have to amend line 22
where the same term appears? Or is there reason to have different
language?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There is probably no reason to have different language.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I wonder if we could fix that on third and deal with it that way or
over in the senate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The chair would suggest that perhaps we displace the bill for this time
and possibly send forth a perfecting amendment so that we can dispose of
it today if that's the will of the body.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Perfect.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The bill will be displace.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And the amendment.
House bill 105. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House bill 105. A bill to be entitled. An act to expand the newborn
screening program established by the department of health and human
services to include newborn screen for congenital heart disease
utilizing pulse oximetry as recommended by North Carolina fatality task
force.
General assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fulghum, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is a bill brought forward by the child fatality task force. It is a
fact that about 125,000 children born each year in North Carolina, about
one percent of these children have congenital heart defect that may
result in death in the first year of life. About 250 of those each year
have a defect so severe it might result in death in the first weeks or
months of life.
Pulse oximetry is a technology that has been around for the last several
years that is simple, inexpensive, easy to do, while the child is still
in the birthing center or hospital shortly after birth that let people
know if this child has a low oxygen level that indicates something
really bad is going on. We find that the- nationwide these children who
have these findings can get attention right away</p>

in many cases involving heart surgery.  The procedure is recommended in
most large hospitals and done in most of the large hospitals now.  We
feel this bill is required to get all the hospitals to do it. All the
birthing centers. Again, it's inexpensive, does not have a physical
impact on the State and it's now regarded as a standard of care.  I
recommend it to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Representative Cunningham, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} To speak in support of the bill Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} As a health care provider I support the bill.  As most
of you probably do not know in the first days of an infant's life if
they are in trouble medically it is detected through respiratory and
pulse oximetry measures the oxygen level in the blood of the infant.  It
is very easy to do.  You can put a piece of tape across the head and it
measures it. So yes it is a good bill and I support the bill and it
should be everywhere across the State.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Further discussion, further debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Representative Fulghum, did the gentleman have
additional comments? I thought you'd concluded your comments. I
apologize for interrupting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} No, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Representative Murry, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} To send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} The gentleman is recognized to send forth an
amendment. The Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Representative Murray moves to amend the bill on page
1, lines 5 and 6, by deleting the lines and substituting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Thank you Mr. Speaker. This amendment just seeks to
add the potential that new technology might develop for pulse oximetry
screening or additional screenings for congenital heart defects that are
FDA-approved and are conducted in a manner that are generally accepted
to the scientific community. And so this is a just in case amendment,
new technology gets developed to screen infants for congenital heart
beat failure.  I ask you to support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} ??, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} I think this is a good amendment and I support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Further discussion, further debate on the amendment.
Representative Avila, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} I'd like to ask Representative Murry a question
please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Representative Murry, I have
an issue that I'm not sure about because I know in discussion with
people currently the pulse oximetry is fairly inexpensive. Do we face
the issue with some of these newer technologies when they come out being
cost prohibitive and maybe moving in a direction that we're maybe not
wanting to go?
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Yes and I believe if there is a more cost effective,
if pulse oximetry remains cost effective, then I think that would be the
standard but at the same time I think we do need to realize that the
potential of new development at even a lower cost could occur as well.
So this is what I call a get out of jail free card just in case new
technology develops we will have the ability to use it instead of being
restricted to just pulse oximetry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Further discussion, further debate on the amendment.
If not the question before the House is the amendment sent forth by
Representative Murry for the House Bill 105.  All those in favor will
vote aye, all opposed will vote no.  The Clerk will open the vote.  All
members wishing to record please do so at this time.  Representative
Graham. The Clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. 111 having
voted in the affirmative and 1 in the negative, the amendment passes.
We're now back on the bill.  Further discussion, further debate.
Representative Millis, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Question for the bill sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Representative Fulghum, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Yes I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Representative Fulghum, it is understood that there is
not a physical net associated with this because there's no cost to the
State  but the question is is there any cost with regard to the
hospitals associated with this or is this something that is a common
practice that is commonly, in these hospitals, is this one of those
things where we're basically making the recommendation that this be a
test that's required?
[SPEAKER CHANGES} Yes.  To answer the question, the existing technology
is existing frankly in every hospital in the State and in every birthing
center in the State.  Pulse oximetry, every time you go in and have any
procedure done</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, this may be the kiss of death, but I
will tell you this is an absolutely simple bill. Current law requires
that any time you file for an absolute divorce, you're supposed to list
both the husband and wife's social security number on the face of the
document. Problem is, those are public record and it's leading to some
identity theft and identity fraud. We have an alternative to start
tracking parents for purposes of obtaining and finding out where a
deadbeat spouse is. And those records are kept confidential. This simply
removes the obligation from attorneys to put that on the face of your
divorce judgement which is public record. I ask for your support. It's
effective immediately upon becoming law.

thrilled that Rep. Stevens beat me to the punch, and so it's a great
bill.

Further discussion, further debate.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to send forth an
amendment. The clerk will read.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To task a question of the Chair, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. My question is, before we get into the
amendments, could someone explain the bill so we could be the amendment
in context?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Chair will yield to Representative Murry.
Representative Murry came to the dais and said he would entertain the
amendments first, but with that request, if the gentleman will be at
ease. Representative Murry is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just wanted to get some of the amendments out of the
way because they are technical in nature, but I will gladly go through
the bill so Representative Catlin, we can just displace the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The amendment will be displaced.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll just get in it. This is a Senate bill. I am a
House member. The bill has four sections. The first section addresses
boards to be eliminated at the recommendation of the Administrative
Procedures Oversight Committee that met in the interim between short
session and today and the beginning of the long session. These boards
and commissions either had not met for many years or had their funding
eliminated. When we tried to contact them through the Administrative
Procedures Oversight, no one responded. So if a commission falls in a
forest, does it make a sound?
Part 2 of the legislation is the meat of the bill. So I will skip it and
go to part 3 and come back to part 2. Part 3 of the legislation
addresses additional recommendations that were made by the
Administrative Procedures Oversight Committee, including a requirement
that occupational license or boards consider certain factors before
denying licenses to individuals with criminal records and it also
authorizes the program evaluation division to consider the feasibility
of consolidation of some of the occupational licensing boards. Part 4
includes the effective date.
So, going into the second section of the bill, there are various
reorganizations of certain boards and commissions, including the Coastal
Resource Commission, the Coastal Resources Advisory Council, the
Environmental Management Commission, the Industrial Commission, the
Utilities Commission, the Wildlife Resources Commission, Turnpike
Authority and the State Board of Elections, State Board of Education,
State Lottery Commission, and the Charter School Advisory Committee, the
Board of Transportation, the Post Release Supervision and Parole
Commission, the Mining and Energy Commission, the Office of
Administrative Hearings, State Personnel Commission, and the Criminal
Justice Education and Training Commission.
The amount of conversation that I had about this legislation with
various stakeholders centers around the Coastal Resources Commission, so
I'll focus on the differences between the House version and the Senate
version with regard to the CRC. It sets the membership at 13 with 9
appointed by the Governor and 4 appointed by the General Assembly. The
House version also restores conflicts of interest provisions and adds
clarifying language to require all members of the CRC to have the same
ethics requirements as the members of the General Assembly. We also
require that all members be residents of North Carolina and reside or
own real property in the coastal area and that four of the current
members or the current members on the CRC will continue to serve until
June 30th of 2014 to help preserve institutional knowledge. The CRAC,
the Coastal Resources Advisory Council, is changed from the Senate
version, it requires all members to be residents of North Carolina and
reside or own real property in the coastal area.
The Environmental Management Commission sets the membership at 15, 9
appointed by the Governor and 6 appointed by the General Assembly.
Additionally, it has the same ethics requirements and conflicts of
interest provision similar to the CRC. It also retains...</p>

it means four members currently serving under certain specified
positions will continue to serve until June 30, 2015.   The Industrial
Commission I'm going to ask, at the conclusion of my remarks, I'm going
to ask Representative Daughtry to describe an amendment that he offered
in Rules today to address the provisions in the Industrial Commission so
you'll understand the provisions of the Industrial Commission.
Similarly I'm going to ask Representative Starnes at the conclusion of
my remarks to describe his amendment with regards to the Utilities
Commission and the changes that occurred in Rules.  The Wildlife
Resources Commission, the House version restores the number of General
Assembly appointments to 8 and the Governor's appointments to 5. The
Turnpike Authority, the State Board of Elections, the State Board of
Education, the State Lottery Commission, there were no changes between
the House bill and the Senate bill. I could go into the Senate Bill if
you would like but there are no changes from what passed the Senate in
those. The House version abolishes the Charter School Advisory Council
which was established by the State Board of Education policy.  It was
not a statutory commission.  It was established by the State DPI or the
State Board of Education by policy. The Board of Transportation
combines, basically combines, actually expands the Board from 19 to 21
by adding two at-large appointments by the General Assembly for a period
of two terms.  That pretty much is the differences in those sections. We
did add, the House version does add a post-release supervision Parole
Commission, Mining and Energy Commission, the only change in the House
version is it allows members to hold office concurrently with other
elected or appointed office. That's the sum total of the changes in the
Mining and Energy Commission. The OAH, we went back and forth and we
added this in the House.  It now continues to be that all ALJ's will
have a term of four years.  That's a change and will be exempt from
State Personnel Act. Current ALJ's are subject to the State Personnel
Act and the administrative ?? can continue to be appointed by the Chief
Administrative Law judge and the Chief ALJ is appointed by the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court. We restructured the State Personnel
Commission to allow the General Assembly to appoint four members and the
Governor to appoint five. Previously the Governor appointed seven and
the General Assembly appointed two and it also had staggered terms for
the State Personnel Commission and then the Criminal Justice Education
and Training Standards Commission modifies appointments to include
individuals selected by the Sheriffs Association and to remove an
appointment by the Law Enforcement Officers Association. That's the sum
total of the bill. I'm sure you're all excited and I'm going to ask now
Representative Daughtry and Representative Starnes to address the
Industrial Commission and Utilities Commission respectively and the
changes that were made in Rules today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Daughtry please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker.  To explain part of Senate Bill
10.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me also start by saying I'm a member of the House
as well. As it relates to the Industrial Commission it adds a
requirement that all licensed attorneys are eligible for membership on
the Industrial Commission and at least two members must be Board
certified worker's compensation lawyers.  It allows current members with
terms expiring this year and next year to complete their terms. The
terms of current members with terms expiring in 2015 through 2018 will
be accelerated by two years. All current member terms will expire by
2016.  As current terms expire all future terms will be four years.
Happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Ladies and gentlemen of the
House, we did make some good changes to the amendment Representative
Hager had adopted in the Commerce Committee yesterday regarding the
Utilities Commission.  It was felt by a number of us that it was not
wise to tinker with the Utilities Commission while some of these rate
cases were being deliberated</p>

<p id="055:00">
And debated. So the changes in the membership will not take effect until
2015. At that time there will be four members who will be up for
appointment. There are two members who have their term to expire in
2017, these two will be shortened by two years and then will disappear.
So basically, we will take the Utilities Commission from seven members
down to five members which is the way the Utilities Commission was
structured prior to 1975 when it was expanded at that time. We’ve also
increased the pool of people who’ll be eligible to serve on the
Utilities Commission by allowing more people with a broader base of
experience to serve. Now they can have utility law and regulation
experience, economic, finance, accounting, business administration,
engineering and renewable energy. So we’re, we’re increasing the pool of
people who are eligible to be appointed to the Utilities Commission. The
big thing is no change will take place in the membership until 2015 next
year.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentlemen Younts
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes, did I hear you list consumer advocate among the
criteria for people who could serve on Utilities Commission?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I really don’t think so.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Or follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentlemen Younts, gentlemen Younts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think consumer advocate, somebody representing the nine million
consumers of this state would be a good person to have on the Utilities
Commission as an eligible person.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don’t disagree with that except for the people, the seven categories
that are listed. They would also be considered consumers as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentlemen Younts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What? I don’t have a right here but the people you mentioned didn’t seem
to me to be people representing consumers. They seemed to be very
specialized business interests or professional interests. And utility
law, economics, finance, accounting, business administration and
engineering

Mr Speaker

The gentleman will yield. Representative Samuelson, please state your

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I ask the question of the Bill sponsor?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The, the, Representative Luebke has the floor. This time the lady would
be able to ask the question of the Bill sponsor, the conclusion of his
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I ask the question of Representative Luebke?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does Representative Luebke yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could I finish my exchange with??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman does not yield. The gentleman may ask the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Well, I just read off but everybody can see it too, we have
lines 25 to 31; utility law, economics, finance, accounting, business
administration, engineering and renewable energy. None of those persons
really, necessarily has anything to do with consumer interests. And my
concern with consumer interest is that they would represent the public
in trying to keep the rates down. And you and I are friends for a long
time and I know we agree on one end to keep the rates down on consumers.
So I’m just wondering whether we should think about a third reading,
adding category number eight, consumer advocate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke, every member has the ability to offer an
amendment.
So they need to be judged on some merits.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, the Chair would remind the members
that at the request of a member of this body, members were asked to
explain the Bill, the Chair insisted debate, it’s a lengthy debate on
this Bill and therefore the Chair would not want to lose sight of the
fact that the purpose for moving to this versus the amendment was to
provide the base one for subsequent debate. I would ask Representative
Luebke to keep that in mind and the context of the question.
Representative Luebke, this gentleman
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One more, one more, one follow up.

In urging me to run the amendment on third reading, would you be

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes, isn’t it a fact that there’s no designated
consumer advocate on there currently? And that, more importantly, isn’t
it a fact that we actually have a public staff, I think it’s close to a
hundred people, on the public staff whose job it is to look out for the
consumer</p>

members of North Carolina, and it is actually their recommendations.  In
fact, the current rate case before the commission, they've just been
provided with the recommendations of the public staff which reduced the
initial request.  Is that not correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]You are correct.  And ultimately, members are appointed
by the Governor, and the Governor is responsible not only to the people
he appoints to the Utility Commission, but he is accountable to the
voters of North Carolina.  And if the Governor appoints people that
allow the utility rates to escalate and become unaffordable, then
somebody's going to pay at the ballot box, so I think the consumer is
going to be represented.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Does the gentleman wish to cover any other comments in

amendment was temporarily displaced, sent forth by Representative Catlin
at this time, we will bring the amendment back up.  It's all ready been

amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker.  As an environmental engineer, I
tend to always take a look at my plans, all the way up to the last
second before I put my stamp on it, and then it's a done deal.  This
particular amendment is in regard to the 4 positions that are staying on
the Coastal Resource Commission, and the Environmental Management
Commission.  It's basically a simple technical change to add expertise
to one of the 4 members of the Coastal Management Commission, and one of
the 4 members on the remaining on the Environmental Management
Commission.  So, it's specifically on the Coastal Resource Commission,
the amendment adds a position with coastal forestry knowledge, and on
the Environmental Management Commission, this amendment adds a position
with knowledge of industrial air and water pollution control, and I ask
you to please support this amendment.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Ladies and Gentlemen of the
House, my amendment strikes part 2 in its entirety from the bill, and as
Representative Murry pointed out, the first section is eliminating a lot
of ops. leak commissions, and that makes sense, and the others relating
to the licensing boards, so that makes sense.  But part 2 is the most
controversial part of this bill, and I 'd like to explain why.  I'd also
like to give a lot of credit to Representative Murray, and Daughtry, and
Starnes, and Catlin for the amendments that improve this bill, because
this is a much better bill that came to us from the Senate, but I think
it's still problematic that we're eliminating 160 seats in the this
bill, and 97 of which are sitting on the environmentally oriented
commissions.  And I think it's, you'll hear a lot more about this, but I
just think it's an unfortunate step we're taking.  We're going to lose a
lot of expertise on these commissions, there's a lot of institutional
memory.  I sat on the Coastal Resource Commission for 7 years, it took
me a long time before I came up to speed on coastal management issues,
and understood the law, and the science, and I think we'll lose a lot of
that with this move.  So I think that also, specifically, we're
targeting a couple of the public health magnet seats on the Coastal
Resource Commission and the Environmental Management Commission, those
with specific knowledge of air pollution and ecology of both those
commissions, and those are really crucial positions.  So I think that
some of these commissions need review and reconsideration of the
membership.  We ought to do it individually.  We've never, in this
state, taken such a drastic move to wipe out the memberships of so many
commissions in one piece of legislation.  So I would urge you to support
this amendment which eliminates</p>

Thank you, Mr. Speaker and this amendment provide an opportunity at
least for us to go back and look at this again on an individual basis.
One of the things we’re failing to consider here are all the different
citizens who are affected statewide by these Boards and Commissions and
their ??. And for us to not get some response from those folks who are
most affected by these Boards and Commissions, may be some good ideas
about how we can improve those boards and commissions ,even their
missions and rush through this reorganization as we’re doing now. I
think it does a disservice to the people who are intended to be
benefited from these Boards of Commissions. So if that is what we want
to do, to improve the efficiency of them, or the effectiveness, I think
we also have an obligation to ask these North Carolinians who are
affected by them and work under their guidance.  Is this the best way to
go? We don’t have to feel like we have the answer to everything
ourselves and then push that vision down on the people of North
Carolina. We can take some time and let them respond and give us some
recommendations and some help.  After all, they live and work and make
their livings based on these Boards and Commissions how effective and
responsive they are.  I’d ask you support the amendment and give an
opportunity for us to go back and this body will have that in subsequent
legislation to make some changes that reflect the will of the people of
North Carolina, not just our will but the will of the people who are
affected by it.

Representative Dollar, please state your purpose.

Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Members of the House. This is what you would
call particularly in Congress, a test vote. And I want you to vote no
the amendment. I certainly agree with Representative Murry. But now is
the time, now is the time for this legislation.  You only really get to
do this sort of thing at the beginning of a new administration.  And you
have to do it now because appointments are beginning to come up on a lot
of these Boards and Commissions.  So if we’re going to make changes and
reforms, now is the time to do it.  And we’re elected to lead,
Representative Hall, and I appreciate your comment, but the bill has
certainly been out there over 3 weeks.  The bill’s been out there for at
least 3 weeks and been discussed more than that. There’s been a lot of
conversation about it, people have commented. And I would say that here
in the House those comments and observations have been taken into
account and changes and adjustments have been made in  the bill that is
before us today. And I would make one other point, I mean I really think
it’s amazing.  This is a reformed piece of legislation. When have you
seen the General Assembly take a significant group of Boards and
actually reduce the size of government? And reduce the number of
basically patronage positions.  And as many of you know,a lot of the
folks if you look them up, good folks, but if you look them up, their
main qualification may well have been contributions or participation in
a prior Governor’s election.  Well, this bill adds qualifications to the
process,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It cuts down the need for a number of positions
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman will yield, Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In these boards.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman will yield. Representative Carney, please state your

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I ask a question of Speaker, Representative?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
 
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think this is the first time in my ten years I’ve ever risen to ask a
question.  But I want to clarify something.  You said this an
opportunity, did you say this is an opportunity to reduce the size of
government with these Commissions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up question, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess what I'm trying to get is an understanding when you say this is
reducing the size of government. My opinion of appointed positions of

Thank you Mr. Speaker. This is a good bill, it's a very needed bill,

Thank you Mr. Speaker. I have a little trouble voting for a bill that
was rushed through too fast, that's too broad, where people haven't had
the time to consider the complexities of the boards that are involved or
the contribution and the issues that are solved and resolved through
these boards. Just because it's the right time to do it. I think that we
have an obligation as elected officials to be thoughtful and thorough
when we make these kinds of big changes that are going to affect the
lives of people. We have a responsibility to do it in a more candid…if
you want to do it this fast you need to spend more time…

Thank you very much Mr. Speaker. Just to be clear this so-called
reduction or reform that Representative Dollar is talking about is to
eliminate people who care about the environment. People who care about
the consumer, people who care about the citizen, and that , to me, isn't
a reform, that, to me, is handing government over to special interests.
And that is wrong. For no other reason you should vote for Pricey
Harrison's amendment.

Just like to point out, or respond to the comment that we've rushed
through this and make it through broad. This amendment is through broad.
If we were to pass this amendment we would remove the reassertion of the
conflict of interest requirement that we put in this bill which allows
us as a state to continue to administer federal regulations such as the
clean air act or the clean water act so I urge you not to vote for this
amendment.

before the house is the passage of the amendment sent forth by
Representative Harrison to the House Committee Substitute number two for
Senate Bill 10. All in favor vote aye, all opposed no, the clerk will

<p id="075:00">
are fundamentally defective at inception, and foundationally bad policy
and bad precedent.  And a slippery slope does not begin to describe the
terrain this bill puts us on in terms of governing this State in the
future.  For several very basic reasons, I'm going to vote no one this
bill in recognizing where it came from and despite the improvements made
here. First, what I think this bill does as it came over from the
Senate, and even in its current amended form, diminishes and makes much
less certain the ability to get quality appointments to many boards and
commissions.  Well, why would anyone want to serve when we have now
created a precedent, that opens forever based on their decisions, in
good faith in many cases, in most cases applying the law as we've set it
out, but we have made their decisions so open that we can simply, in an
arbitrary and capricious way as a 120 body, or 170 body Caesar, end
their jobs and their appointments with no ability for them to rely on
the fact of what their time table was, and what their authority is.  I
find that to be difficult, as we've already made the environment to
obtain quality people to serve on these boards and commissions, this
makes it 10 times more difficult.  Second, I think it is extremely
important for business and industry that we talk about, on both sides of
the isle in this State, an to which I know every member of this house is
committed, the one thing they need out of administrative process,
regardless of good decisions or bad, is predictability and stability.
What this precedent does, no matter what else it may do, is it imposes a
whole atmosphere of inconsistency, and instability, and
unpredictability.  And I think that is the worse possible message we can
sent in governance.  There are reforms that are needed, but let's not
couch this bill as a reform bill, because that's not how it originated,
and that's not its real purpose.  It is the purpose of many here to do
that, and there are parts of the bill, including the 1st section and 3rd
section that I think achieves some of that.  But there is very little in
the 2nd section that is reform as such.  In addition, we can look at
each provision in the 2nd session on their merits, independently.  To
defeat this bill is not to defeat a reorganization of the Coastal
Resources Management Commission, Environmental Management Commission, or
any of the others listed.  It is to understand how important each of
those are, to take those through the subject matter committees that deal
with them, and then to make the changes, even in a month if we choose
to, to give the Governor that capacity.  The administrative agencies in
process of this State were not designed to simply follow through in
whiplash fashion, every 2 Novembers, when we elect a new House, a new
Senate, a new Governor every 4 years.  They are, in fact, designed to be
a buffer against that.  The buffer against the whiplash of one way or
another, to recognize that the administrative process of the State must
be incremental, moving as the elections take us slowly, but not creating
the instability and unpredictability that this bill, in its origin,
makes clear.  The Senate bill as it came over here was nothing more than
a gratuitous political exercise, in part, patently unconstitutional, and
it really hurts the credibility of the agencies involved, their future
appointees, and this State.  And despite what I think are really good
amendments that are made over here, this is precisely what Senator
Murray opened by saying a Senate bill that does great harm to the State
in its inception, it is bad policy, it is bad precedent, and as House
members, we ought not support that, so I will be voting against this
bill.  Thank you.

It does 2 things.  First it reduces the salaries for the members of the

the Chair, and $80,600 a year for each member, and all new members
appointed after July 1, 2013 would no longer have the benefit of having

Representative: … on people on these boards of commission. Some of these
were changed within minutes, some within a day. I would certainly say
that this is not the will of the people, so whose will is it? Who do we
represent? Do they work for us? Do we work for them? now, even if you
look at some of the salaries of these boys in commissions, that we just
looked at, and we talk about keeping teachers salaries stagnant 0- and
not allow them to have any pay raise to keep with the cost of living,
but, at the same time, these bodys in commission, you decide to keep
their salaries high as part time jobs. Some do not say jobs, but as
compensation for them, so as to make a distinction between them and
state employees or not, but they receive benefits. So we are sending the
wrong message to the people of NC. I ask that you go back and consider:
do you really want to tell them that you don’t want to hear about their
own professions and how the should be regulated regularly? Do you really
want to tell them that you want to have these boys in commissions with
these perks and high salaries, but not pay regular state employees?  Is
that what we really want? I hope that is not the message you are really
trying to send? I do believe that folks feel left out, our communities
feel left out, these folks in these professions feel left out. I would
say that we don’t know what is best for these industries, communities,
and workers, not better than they know after many years of service in
their fields. So again I would ask you to vote against this bill. Go
back and let the systems of NC be involved in their future. If this is
going to be a reorganization, then let’s go ahead and have those public
hearings you have when you do a reorganization, those town meetings.
Let’s get the public’s involvement in this process – they are going to
be the one’s to live under it. so I ask that you vote no to this, take
it back and get the people involved.
Speaker: Representative Steinberg, please state your purpose.
Representative: To speak to the motion please, thank you.
Speaker: Representative you are recognized to debate the bill.
Representative: Thank you sir. I am hearing some folks on the other side
suggesting that we need to have a response from the public before we act
so hastily. The response was delivered in the ballot box in September.
Folks are expecting the majority to come in here and do something to
start creating jobs, and that is what they are doing. For the governor,
who has a plan to do that, which he will be showing in specifics with us
shortly, the governor wants his agenda to be embraced and he wants to
move forward. He has a vision for NC. He would like us to [xx] that
vision. We will debate that and have plenty of opportunity to do that,
but to continue as we are, to keep dragging our feet, and not take bill
action, and there are a few things in this bill, some specific things
debated in caucus and so forth, which a lot of us were not thrilled
about, but overall, we recognized a very significant need for prompt
action to try to take away the misery index here NC, i.e. the
unemployment index – which has been in excess of 9%, and, in some
counties, in excess of 10,11,12%. That is the real tragedy. That is
where we are. This kind of treading water and shuffling along, as we
have been, and doing business in the same old way, and, eventually,
somehow, this is just going to magically change: everything is going to
be fixed, everyone will go back to work, we will not have to do anything
different. Folks, that is not the way it is – any of you in business
knows that. We have to make things happen, and that is what we are
trying to do. We are trying to make things happen.
Speaker: Representative Lucas, please state your purpose.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker. I wonder if Representative
Steinberg will yield for a question.
Representative: Yes sir.
Representative: Thank you.
Representative: You are welcome sir.
Representative: In your commentary, you mentioned  that the decision was
made at the ballot box. The question is, do you feel that the average
citizen, who made decisions at the ballot box recently, are aware of
some of these salaries of some of these commissioners?
Representative: I will answer that with a question.</p>

Well, yes. I’m aware of some of the salaries and as I have mentioned in
my remarks if you were listening very closely and I’m sure you were,
that I said there were some things that were debated in caucus that many
of us were not happy about.  And one of those things as far as my own

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Representative Steinburg, are you aware that
this plan cuts potentially 2 positions from the Utilities Commission
saving approximately $300,000 of benefits?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, I am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield? The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Steinburg, are you aware that the average salary for an
engineer of someone that would go on this position would be worth 90,000
to 140,000 and we would have to pull this person out of private practice
because they cannot do anything else while on this Commission?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I am aware of that, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Steinburg.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. So I just conclude my remarks by saying that once again,
reiterating the fact that bold action is required on the part of the
House and the Senate. This isn’t going to be something that everyone is
going to like but we need to begin moving in a direction and moving
quickly.  Because there are people suffering. There’s no question about
that. And the way things are right now, right exactly at this moment,
things aren’t changing a whole lot. People are waiting on us and they’re
waiting on us to do something. And they’re waiting on us to do something
bold and innovative and that’s what this bill is doing. Whether you
agree with it or not, that’s what this bill is doing. We’re not going to
sit pants, sit on center, do nothing.  There are some in this chamber
who want to move forward. I am one of those. That’s why I came here to
serve.  I want to put people back to work. So I would hope that those of
you will give a great deal of thought before you cast your vote and I
support it Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Representative Blust, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and Members of the House. I am going to support
the bill. We’re in here where the history of it, some members have
alluded that it is big improvement on what the Senate sent over. And
since it came out of Committee, Wednesday, there have been significant
changes that met what I had told the sponsor on our side were my minimum
requirements to be able to support it. Nevertheless I’m still troubled
by some aspects of it. I think some of what Representative Glazier said
was well spoken.  But there is one aspect I really want to touch on
because it’s early in this session and I’m troubled more and more by
what I see down here and especially by the Senate side, but some of it
goes for this House too. There’s a story from the Bible, someone over
there mentioned the Bible the other day about a man named Oza. The Ark
was, David, King David wanted to bring the Ark of the Covenant back to
Jerusalem, and it had been stored in somebody’s shed or somebody’s barn
for several years and so David said bring it back, and they slung it on
an ox cart. The Ark which represented the very presence.</p>

of God, in the nation of Israel, and as the cart is going it starts to
stumble, and Uzzah reached out his hand for the very good motive of
keeping that ark from falling off, and the bible says God struck him
dead.  And I once heard Reve3rand Vance Habner in a sermon ask, Why
would God strike someone dead for doing something with great motives?
And he went into that, but what he said was the ark sitting there in a
shed, those there became too familiar with it in their daily lives.  Oh,
it's just something sitting there in a shed, and I wonder if we don't
forget sometimes, in the body, who we are and what we're doing here.  I
was talking with Representative Pierce, at Airborne School they used to
yell, Who are you?, and you'd yell back, Airborne!  How far are you
going to go?  All the way!  Just to constantly remind you when you are
an elite unit, and and elite group the standards are high.  And I always
though that this place should be an institution of very high standards.
This should be an elite group, and part of being an elite group is a
rather reverence of the process and of the institution.  And some of
that is observing the solemnities and the processes by which the public
can influence the product of this institution.  And we all like to carry
around these little constitutions, and we need to get back to the
Constitution but Article 1, Section 2 says sovereignty lies in the
people, and Section 12 talks about the right to petition the government
for redress or grievances.  And I'm troubled here, and I know that the
Senate was worse, this thing flew through and whether you like it or
not, due process means notice to be heard and have your point of view,
at least, considered.  And this bill, this version did not appear on a
House calendar on a Wednesday, I couldn't get a version of it, I could
not look at this thing as of Tuesday night, then we did make fixes in
committee today, but then it appears on the calendar today.  I don't
know, why do we all think that it's a small, slight thing.  Well, we've
done it, I've seen it happen a lot.  That calendar is notice to the
public of what we're going to consider as the people's legislature, and
yes we do win elections, but those are 2 year terms.  And the people
have the right in 2 years to yank us, and put someone else in depending
on what we do.  And that's our government.  Just because we have power,
we need to be judicious with it.  This county became a Republic, not
when the Constitution was ratified, it really became a Republic when
George Washington, on December 23, 1783, went to Annapolis and handed
back to the Continental Congress his commission and his sword.  He could
have been the absolute ruler.  George Washington, for which our Capitol
is known, set such and example for posterity on how we're supposed to
handle great power given us, and I wish would be more careful with it,
and I wished we cared more.  I don't like this idea, well we've got the
power, let's go ahead and do it.  I think we have to observe this in a

Allow you to suspend the rules but in this instance I have seen no
reason why hearing the bill could not have waited until next week. And
if it were just this bill I'd probably not have even said anything about
this matter. But I just want to be able to nip it in the bud so we start
observing the proper processes in this body because I think that's the
duty you owe to ??

axed and interestingly enough two days later the county commissioners
replaced them with several bureaucrats and elected officials. And yes,
there are still ripples from it in my community so there will be a
public response. Thank you Mister Speaker.

[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you Mister Speaker. I just want to stand up and respond to a
comment that the minority leader made about what message this bill sends
to teachers and state employees. I did just want to remind him that the
last four years that his party was in charge that they did nothing for
teachers and state employees as far as salaries go and that their
governor even furloughed them. And I also
want to remind him that last session when we took the majority for the
first time in a hundred and something years, that the teachers got and
state employees got the first pay raise that they'd had in four years
and they got five bonus leave days. So there's probably a number of
reasons that one could be against this bill from the opposing side. But
I just don't think that's a very valid argument and I did just want to
point that out. Thank you Mister Speaker.

[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you Mister Speaker and I just want to thank Representative Blust.
I think he's absolutely right. He's been right every single time he's
talked about the importance of process, the importance of the
Constitution. And some good improvements were made to this bill,
particularly to take out things that were patently unconstitutional to
deal with the judges. And I'm very, very thankful for people who care
about the Constitution, since last session seven laws were struck down
as unconstitutional. So I think folks have figured out the process
matters. It matters at every single step of the way.
But one thing that you need to understand: Even though you all have, in
your caucus as Representative Steinburg has said, have come to an
agreement. We've heard from the Senate that the way you have put it
together is DOA. And you're helping them move forward what they wanted
to begin with. This isn't going to be what's going to come back from the
Senate. I guarantee you this is not going to be what's going to be in

[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, members, I wasn't gonna speak
until the process arguments came up and I want to point out to members
that this bill has been pending, it's had full hearing both in the
commerce committee and in the rules committee today. We've allowed every
member who wanted to run an amendment to run an amendment Every person
who wanted to debate the bill to debate the bill. That's been the
process. We had a slot set aside for ruled today to take as much time as
we needed to, we go through it pretty quickly.The amendments were
explained and they were approved and the bill passed out by a pretty
overwhelming majority, it was just [??] vote.
I'm always mindful and representative Blust and I, we've spoken before,
we've talked about these issues. And I'm always mindful of this process
and the way we do things and I will submit to you that we have followed
the process the way it should be followed. That representative Murray
did a [??] job the last few days trying to put this together. And one do
the first things he said was, this is a senate bill and he's a house
member, and that's true. And who knows what's going to happen in
conference committee.
I don't know if this is what's gonna come out of it or something
different, I don't know. But that process too comes back to the floor,
and guess what? It's debated upon. It's voted upon. It's not something
you just slip under a door or something. This process is ongoing and
there's absolutely nothing out of the ordinary in the way the process
has been done and this. If the speaker or anyone wanted to stifle debate
that could have been done long ago but we've had a long and vigorous
debate and the speaker has been very generous having members run
amendments debate the bill. And I just want to set the record straight
on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentleman of the house we're going to hold
debate for a moment. We've come at 3:00 O'clock and that is the time
that we would release the pages. Pages please come to the front of the

<p id="120:00">
[Speaker changes.]...they sound good but if you look at the bill
carefully, there's really not an appropriation in there.  There's not
money in the bill to do all the things that the bill claims it wants to
do. In this particular case, I'm pleased that Representative Horn has
added digital to the possible uses but there's no addressing of the
question, what if a county needs to use all of its allotment for
construction? Then we have a situation...
[Speaker changes.] Mister Speaker?
[Speaker changes.] Representative Horn, please state your purpose?
[Speaker changes.] Mister Speaker, I'd like to ask the...Represent
[Speaker changes.] Does the gentleman yield for a question?
[Speaker changes.] Can it wait til I'm finished?
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman does not yield until the end of his
comments.
[Speaker changes.] As I read the bill, if a county used its entire
allotment for construction, they would not have the resources for the
digital that other counties might well have so we would have a situation
where some counties have resources for digital learning and other
counties don't. It's not a good thing to do and what we need in the
bill...what we need in this bill is an appropriation, just as we needed
one in Senate Bill 14 to do all the things with career and technical
learning, getting high school kids...somehow...to the community college.
 All that stuff costs money. And there's plenty of things in here that
cost money as well. These bills are &quot;feel good bills&quot; if they
don't have a referral to Appropriations. I may be the only one in here
who'll vote no but I am voting no because I don't like to see bills
through that need appropriations and don't get sent to Appropriations.
Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] Further discussion?  Representative Horn, please
state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] Debate the bill a second time.
[Speaker changes.] Gentleman is recognized to debate the bill a second
time.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Speaker.  Ladies and gentlemen,
this is not an appropriations bill.  It's not a lottery bill. It's not a
directive. It's a bill that allows LEA's???? working in cooperation with
counties. Allows counties working in cooperation with their LEA's?????
to utilize money in a flexible fashion, to meet a need that we all know
is coming...and that is...not coming, it's here...the digital age is
here.  We've heard the last three days from superintendents, principals,
and teachers about their need, their desire for flexibility in spending.
This is one of those steps that allows...that satisfies that need,
allows our LEA's????? and the counties to work together to meet the
needs that they have in their counties without spending additional
money. It gives them flexibility to use the money they have as they see
fit. Thank you, Mister Chair.
[Speaker changes.] Further discussion, further debate?  If not, the
question before the House is the passage of House Committee Substitute
to House Bill 97 as amended on its second reading.  All those in favor
will vote aye. All opposed vote no. The Clerk will open the vote. Clerk
will lock machine and record the vote.  109 having voted in the
affirmative and three in the negative. The House Committee Substitute to
House Bill 97 as amended has passed its second reading and without
objection. It will be read a third time.

question before the House is the passage of House Committee Substitute

aye. (Ayes.) All opposed say no. The ayes have it. The House Committee
Substitute to House Bill 97 as amended has passed its third reading. The
bill will be engrossed and sent to the Senate.

[Speaker changes.] For a motion.

on House Bill 105, require a ?????????? /?????? ?????.
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman has requested that the rules be
suspended so that we could take up third reading on the bill previously
taken up today. The gentleman is recognized to explain motivation...or
explain the motion.
[Speaker changes.] The title of the bill was changed due to the
amendment offered by Representative Murry.  That is actually a technical
change; therefore, was not allowed to go to third reading for that
reason. We have agreed that that is not substantial for material change
and we advocate going to third reading today. Thank you.

Point of order, Mr. Speaker.

The Chair asks that Representative Starnes please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Representative Fulghum a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fulghum. Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fulghum, I think you’re misstating what you’re wanting to
do. You have a bill that is eligible for second and third reading, and
you’re asking for a suspension of the rules. We don’t need a suspension
of the rules to have a third reading today. Are you just simply wanting
to have the third reading today?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My response? I understood that the title of the bill had been changed as
a result of the amendment…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If the discussion will cease for a moment, the Chair may be able to
clear up this issue. Representative Starnes, the reason why it had to be
carried over is that the amendment changed in substance and required a
carry over. The only way we could take it up today is that the House
would agree to suspend the rules for that purpose. Representative Moore,
the reason I was recognizing you is I have the muscle memory of
Representative Owens, which is normally when he would get up and say
suspending the rules is not a good thing to do unless there’s wide
consensus for doing it. Particularly now that we know that we’re going
to be in session on Monday night.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I speak to the motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may. Tom’s recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In honor of my good friend, Bill Owens, former Rules Chair, I would
remind the members that we should not just suspend the rules unless
there’s good reason. I would like to ask the member if he would consider
withdrawing his motion at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fulghum, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, sir, I would not. The reason that we’re proposing this amendment -
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman will be recognized to debate the motion a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s not an amendment but a motion. The reason that I’m proposing this
is to start this procedure of pulse oximetry is that we think it will
make a difference. Didn’t think it would make a difference, we wouldn’t
propose the bill to begin with. So therefore, any time that we save is
important, and I strongly advocate that we get third reading and get
this bill across to the Senate so they can go ahead and get it done.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’ve heard three lectures today on defending the
process. I defend the process, and I am opposed to suspending the rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion? Further debate on the motion? If not, the question
before the house is the motion by Representative Fulghum to suspend the
rules so that House Bill 105 could be considered for third reading
today. All those in favor vote “aye”. All those opposed vote “no”. The
clerk will open the vote.

legislative black caucuses excited about the month of black history as
we celebrate our ancestors who passed on the torch of freedom, justice
and equality to us.  Today we recognize the members who have served in
the North Carolina General Assembly.  We know that we are standing on
the shoulders of those who have served in these chambers before us.  We
know that they had many struggles, more than we have today.  In the
words of Frederick Douglass, where justice is denied, where poverty is
enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to
feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade
them, neither persons nor property will be safe.  Douglass along with
those who we recognized set a standard of excellence in pride that is
woven to the fabric of North Carolina politics.  The legislative black
caucus and its members we stand today on the shoulders of many with a
legacy of standard that we will pass on to young people in our community
and the next generation of politicians.  To the Members, once again, we
want to thank you for sharing with us today a very special time in the
life of the legislative black caucus and this body.  We are excited
about what we read about this rich history that all of us are really
encouraged today and excited about those who have come before us and
those who will come after we are no longer here.  I think we've set a
standard and we can say Mr. Speaker I commend this resolution.  Thank
you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Alexander, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  To speak briefly on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  The gentleman is recognized to debate the
resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I don't have any prepared remarks Mr. Speaker,
ladies and gentlemen of the House, I just wanted to say that we rarely
have an opportunity to serve with a living legend, with someone who is a
participant in history, and I just wanted to point out that our
colleague, Mickey Michaux, whose name showed up in that resolution was
indeed a pioneer, and he's still serving with us, and if you've never
had an opportunity to talk with Mickey over lunch or just stand around
here and listen to him swap some stories about his experiences here in
the House, I commend to you to do that because not only was he a pioneer
he is a living history lesson about how things have changed, and he
points us in the direction, I think, that we want to go.  I was thumbing
through my book on my favorite president and I did find a very brief
statement that kinda puts us into a sense of how it must've been back
when Representative Michaux first entered into these chambers.
President Lincoln once said &quot;Towering genius disdains a beaten
path.  It seeks regions hither to unexplored&quot;, and way back when
Mickey came here this was definitely unexplored and he was definitely a
pioneer.  I commend the resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Michaux please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Just to speak on the resolution a moment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  The gentleman is recognized to debate the
resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I just appreciate what Representative Alexander has
said but I wanted to assure all of you that I was not here when Lincoln
was President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Floyd, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  The gentleman is recognized to debate the
resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Mr. Speaker, I am standing before you because one of
the gospel singer F.C. Barnes that many of you haven't heard of him.  He
made a song that was on a 45.  Many of you all were too young to
remember those when they came out and he on one side he was in a pair of
whatever you call them, overalls and when you flip the label on the
other side you would see him in a three piece suit and you'd say my God
look what he has brought us from.   That's what we're saying here today.
 Look at where we came and where we are today.  I'm equally more</p>
