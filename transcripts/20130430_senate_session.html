...second reading House Bill 149. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 149. Caylee’s Law/Report Missing Children.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Allran is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. House Bill 149 would create a series of new
offenses involving the failure to report a missing child and would also
expand the scope of several already existing offenses. It makes six
major changes. First of all, failure of the caregiver to report the
disappearance of a child to law enforcement is a new offense, a class I
felony. Failure of any person who suspects the disappearance and who
suspects the child may in danger to report those suspicions to law
enforcement is a new offense, a class 1 misdemeanor. The third one is
failure to report to law enforcement the death of persons, secret burial
or disposal of a dead human body if it is a child is currently a class I
felony and becomes a class H felony. Making false reports to law
enforcement that involves a disappearance or child or child victim of a
class A, B1, B2, or C felony offense is currently a class 2 misdemeanor
and becomes a class H felony. The fifth change is failure to report to
authorities he suspicion that a juvenile is abused, neglected or
dependent or has died as a result of maltreatment must be reported to
the authorities. This is created as a new offense, a class 1
misdemeanor. Finally, failure by a director of social services to notify
the State Bureau of Investigation of a report of sexual abuse of a child
in a childcare facility is a new offense, a class 1 misdemeanor. This
bill was discussed thoroughly in J2 and rewritten in J2 and did receive
a unanimous vote in J2 and I urge your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there and further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question
before the Senate is the passage of the Senate committee substitute for
House Bill 149 on its second reading. All in favor vote aye, all opposed
vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. The clerk will
record the vote.
Jenkins, aye. Pate, aye.
47 having voted in the affirmative and 0 in the negative, Senate
committee substitute to House Bill 149 passes its second reading.
Without objection will be read a third time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
North Carolina General Assembly enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there and further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question
before the Senate is the passage of the Senate committee substitute to

All opposed say no. The ayes have it. Senate committee substitute to
House Bill 149 passes its third reading. It will be sent to the House
for concurrence in the Senate committee substitute.
That concludes the calendar for the day. Do we have any notices or
announcements.
Senator Tillman, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, if there are no notices or announcements, I’d like a
moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I rise today to speak about a gentleman...our Sergeant-At-Arms staff,
he’s standing by the door back there, Charles Marseilles. I imagine many
of you don’t know the story..many stories, but I know one I was sharing
with him down in the grill the other evening and him and Eddie Kessler,
I didn’t know...I knew Eddie’s history up through Carolina, but I didn’t
know about his pro career. But I want to speak about Charles for a
minute today to let you know. I’m going to start with a good party to
Ian Charles. It’s not even in this written stuff. When Charles was
playing with the Cleveland Browns, folks, that’s as in NFL Cleveland
Browns, he played with the great Jim Brown. He played with a quarterback
who’s now Dr. Ryan. Any pro practices there was a rule that if you hit
either one of these two protective players, big Jim Brown or Dr. Frank
Ryan, you would be fined. Well, Brown was known as, Jim Brown was known
as a very tough runner. He would run across the field to run over you
rather than around you, and he did that on many occasions, and he ran
over Chales one time and knocked him out. But Charles was not allowed to
lay a hand on the great Jim Brown. One day in practice, irregardless of
the rule, he saw a chance to lay one on…</p>

<p id="15:00">
Jim Brown. Caught him from the side, blind sided him, and knocked him
out cold. Charles, I don't know what the fine was back in those days but
a hundred dollars was a lot of money. I know you were fined for that.
And I know you're still grinning for knocking out the great Jim Brown
which he did. And I don't think any of you all know that story. And I
was just thrilled to hear that. But I said tell me a little bit about
your background Charles.
I played sports too Charles but I didn't do any of these things. In high
school, when he went to high school in Birmingham Alabama, forty-nine
through fifty-two. Let's see, I wasn't but about nine, ten years old
then. But anyway at Parker high school, this was a 4 A conference
school. He was in 1950 a linebacker on the conference champions team. In
fifty-one, he was all state, all conference and in 1952 was all state
most valuable player in the state of Alabama.
He played baseball while at Parker high school. In fifty-one, he was the
Jefferson county batting champion. In fifty two, he was all state first
team. Baseball. In college, he went to the great Tuskegee institute
which is now Tuskegee university in Tuskegee, Alabama and he was part of
the southern inter-collegiate athletic conference at that time.
In football, he was the starting outside linebacker. He started and
lettered at safety and was all conference. Started and lettered in ?? at
safety in fifty-five and was second team all American.
Now this is interesting, Charles. Your speed trials. In football, with
your gear on, you did a four point four two in the hundred. And then in
the sprints you did a four point three. In baseball, you have a heavy
baseball uniform?
Spikes, I don't know what it was but you were faster with a baseball
uniform on. In baseball, 1953, started all games as a freshman. Right
fielder. Fifty-four, he was all SA high ?? southern ?? inter-collegiate
athletic conference runner up in the batting title. Fifty five, first
team all conference runner up for the batting title. In fifty five, MVP
athletic award. Charles, that's quite an athletic career.
And I was bragging about being able to spell ?? and being able to throw
a baseball ninety miles per hour and I thought that was something. That
is quite a record, Charles. We're proud of you and I want the whole
senate to know that. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any notices or announcements?

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A moment of ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What do you have for us, senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You all probably didn't know it but we have another outstanding athlete
than this. I'm not talking about myself. Mr. Ed Kesler is running around
here somewhere. He's up there, behind me. Ed Kesler, his claim to fame
is, he has many claims to fame but probably his most famous claim to
fame is beating me at golf about twenty five years ago. ?? shot seventy
five right out of the shoot but he did a few other little things on me
that I will mention to you. He was a four year letter man in high
school. Captain of the ?? all star team. Marcellus said he had run a
four two. Ed had run a forty four point two. But he was still all
American selection. All American football in high school. Salisbury high
school. He also played baseball. He was all conference in baseball.
Excuse me, this is basketball. He was all conference in basketball. He
became the leading scoring basketball with twelve hundred points in high
school and that record lasted for thirty two years and finally broken by
a person who went to the NBA. He played baseball. He was a real slouch
in baseball though. He hit four thirty his last year, led the team in
home runs. He hit four twenty five in American ?? baseball, was all
conference. Started, in all these sports he started his whole freshman,
sophomore, junior, senior year. He went to Carolina. He couldn't get
into state. And he ran</p>
