Assembly this year, we came with the intention to increase teacher

<p id="015:00">
...which, except for one year, had been frozen for some five years. We
had intended to address salaries with respect to our state employees and
we made additional commitments. We made a commitment to begin a two-year
process of raising starting teacher salary to no less than $35,000
anywhere in the state.
To that end, this bill is a bill that addresses those top priorities. It
says that here in the General Assembly we can make sure that we, with or
budget that is already in place, we have a two-year budget that is in
place, for the biennium, we can and will fund or top priorities.
And let me just hit the highlights of this bill for you. The bill
contains a 5% increase for educators as was contained in the previous
version of the budget offered by the House. A 1.44% COLA increase, a
$1,000 flat salary increase plus benefits for state employees. It
includes the Yellow Ribbon program for community colleges and the UNC
system for eligible military veterans and their dependents. It includes
money that is much needed to address the coal ash issue, which that bill
we expect to have in the House's hands and to be addressed.
This bill also provides $134 million for Medicaid Risk Reserve should
that be needed for the upcoming biennium. It addresses technical, more
than technical issue, but it addresses the issue that's been raised with
the respect to Opportunities Scholarships funding $11.8 million as was
in the budget the other week. We adjust the Masters degree salary
supplements, restoring that. It was another issue that was well
discussed prior to this convening in the General Assembly.
We've also made adjustments to the school grading system, which everyone
agrees is critically important to our schools. Clarifies the changes to
teacher tenure. It gets us moving forward on our career pathways which,
as you all know, is a collaboration between the Governor, the House, the
Senate and educators and education administrators all across this state
who met just yesterday confirming their enthusiasm for moving forward to
modernize North Carolina's compensation system for teachers, which I
believe everyone shares that goal.
Mr. Speaker and members of the House, this budget makes other technical
changes which are prescribed and necessary for the second year of the
budget. It does not do other things. There's certainly plenty that many
would wish, but this is what is necessary. This is what fulfills our
promise. As we mentioned yesterday, there are no additional lottery
provisions in this budget. This is based on the revised consensus
forecast for those monies and of course those monies are allocated for
education.
Mr. Speaker and members of the House, I would commend this bill to you
as a fulfillment of the top priorities of this General Assembly and as a
fulfillment of our commitment to education in this state at all levels.
I would be pleased to answer any questions. I would appreciate your
support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Goodman, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative
Dollar. Teachers and state employees have been waiting for some
certainty on pay and compensation issues for a long time now and I think
it's time for us to give them that certainty. We can nitpick, we can
argue about funding streams and all those things, but it's time for some
action. They've been waiting for it so I recommend that we vote yes on
this budget. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Larry Hall, please state your purpose.

<p id="020:00">
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. They have a saying that we all get there
sometime, and I’m glad to see that finally leadership has decided that
teachers and state employees all are important enough now to try to have
some way to give them some reasonable, supportable pay raises. I’m glad
that some folks finally got the message and stopped gambling on the
lottery and decided we need to find another way to pay for the future of
this state, which rests in the hands of our teachers and our state
employees. So I’m glad that folks have finally come around, but we
haven’t gone far enough. This proposed spending plan – and it’s not a
budget, it’s a spending plan, and we know it lays on top of the cuts
that are going to be coming in the second year of the budget anyway, but
the one thing it does is gives some emphasis and some incremental
progress toward finding a real solution and a real way to pay for these
teacher and state employee raises, and so that is the one good thing
about this spending plan, and again, I wouldn’t refer to it as a budget.
It’s a short-term, limited spending plan. The numbers still indicate
that it’s going to be an unbalanced budget that we’re promoting in this
spending plan, and the numbers will still have to be verified. I’m
particularly disappointed that once again we’ve run a spending plan out
that we didn’t give proper time for members to vet, for our citizens to
vet, for interested organizations to vet, and help us come up with a
better idea, a more sustainable idea, and maybe recover some of our
credibility on these issues. There are major discrepancies on how we’re
going to pay for this. They’re still out there. They may not be as great
as they were when we were trying to speculate and bet on the lottery to
pay for it, but those concerns are still out it. We had our proposed
budget out on this floor before and you all were here. Some people drank
the Kool-Aid and voted for it knowing that the information in it wasn’t
correct, and hopefully we’re trying to trust this time a broke clock is
right twice a day, so we’ll hope it’s that time, that to some extent
some of the information in here is correct that would support these pay
raises, but we know there is a continuing dispute and we know that it
hasn’t been resolved, and we’re putting this plan forward creating
hopes, and so we hope that this is a step toward actually finding real
revenue to support real compensation increase and benefits increase for
our state employees and for our teachers. We’ve created a false
emergency. July 1st is not an emergency. The world’s not going to come
to an end, we do continuing resolutions all the time, so the idea that
July 1st is an emergency, it’s not an emergency. It’s not an emergency,
and we shouldn’t treat the business of the people of North Carolina as
“it’s an emergency because we say it’s an emergency”. The emergency is
the future of our teachers, the future of our children who they’re going
to usher in to be our leaders of tomorrow and run this state. That’s the
emergency. The emergency is not us being out of here on July 1st or 2nd.
We pass continuing resolutions, as I said, all the time. Now we have the
opportunity to do some things in addition to propose this spending plan.
Yes, if we have an emphasis on teacher raises and state employee raises,
but there’s some questions that we need to ask as we go forward. First
of all, we need to go ahead and have a continuing resolution so we can
get the conference committees together, get the public involved and have
a real budget. This plan that we’re putting forward, this spending plan,
assumes, as I said, Medicaid projections that are in complete dispute.
I’d ask some of you, and those that have corporate knowledge, when was
the last time that Medicaid came in on the low end? When was the last
time we didn’t have to contribute for shortfalls? Why is there such a
big difference between State Budget Office and what our fiscal staff
says the numbers should be? And then finally, why were we kept in the
dark until the last minute about these differences? As I said, with all
that in mind, the one thing that this…</p>

<p id="025:00">
Spending plan, and again, I won’t call it a budget, but it certainly
lays on top of the budget. The one thing it does do is show some
emphasis and understanding of the importance of teacher pay raises and
state-employee benefits and pay raises being done. That is the one thing
here that is of primary importance. And with that in mind I’m going to
support Senate Bill 3. This spending plan. This band-aid, but it is a
band-aid. And my fear is when it has to be ripped off, and people don’t
want to take responsibility for it. So, we’re going to support this
spending plan, but you’re going to be held accountable to fulfill the
promise of it and bring the public into the debate. We talked about
having an open process. Let’s open it up now. You've got this spending
plan. You've got a proposed budget. You've got a conference committee.
So, let’s open it up. Let’s let the public in. Let’s go ahead and pass a
continuing resolution so we can’t say we didn't have time to do it
right. We’ll you've got time. You've got the power. Pass the spending
plan. Then, pass a continuing resolution. Then, open that process up,
and let us have a valid budget for the people of North Carolina. Let’s
don’t create these false deadlines. Let’s don’t create these fake
numbers. Let’s do it right. You have the power. You have the ultimate
power. Let’s do the right thing for the people of North Carolina. I’m
going to support this bill. I hope you’ll support the people of North
Carolina, especially our teachers and the future of this state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speaker Tillis has recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I’d
like to do something a little bit different today. Why don’t we just
dispense with the rhetoric, particularly if you’re planning on voting
for the bill, and recognize that we are just here to fulfill a promise.
A promise we made back in January, or February, but it is really a
promise that began four years ago when we came in and solved the
deficit, started getting on the right fiscal footing, said that we could
do what we all want to do. Let’s not play games and pretend that we,
some of us suddenly start to care about teachers. I've cared about
teachers every year that I volunteered in public school when my children
went to school, up to including being a PTA president just eight years
ago. We care about teachers. What worries me about the comments from the
gentleman from Durham is there are teachers listening to this right now,
and they’ll watch it on TV tonight. And it’s sending a message that
maybe this is temporary. It’s not temporary. It’s fiscally sound, and
it’s sustainable. It’s taken the politics out of this piece of the
budget, and the gentleman needs to stand corrected on one matter. We've
got a two year budget. There’s no need for a continuing resolution. We
could go home today, and we've got a budget that the governor will be
responsible for managing. This is about providing certainty and doing
the right thing for these teachers, and I dispute the argument that we
can wait because while we wait, we have seventy-five hundred teacher
assistants wondering if they have a job. Really? We want to let them
wait? We have principals and superintendents trying to plan the school
opening plan, that’s only eight weeks from now. Really? We want to wait?
I hope you’ll support this budget measure that sets us on the right
path, does the right things for teacher, and I hope all the members of
this chamber will join us in support of this bill.

found out  at the 11th hour that you couldnt do it as a local bill, so
it just changes the word from &quot;Richmond&quot; county to

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, you may recall we discussed this bill
on Tuesday. As the title indicates, it modifies laws pertaining to
public schools. It received a unanimous vote in the Senate, discussion
in the House has been more interesting as a result of ammendments that
were brought forward, and as you could see on your dashboard, there's
more ammendments being brought forward today which means the fun will
continue. And Mr. Speaker, I've also asked that staff be with us on the
floor in case there's technical questions that need to be help with. I
think it's a good bill, I hope you'll support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate?
Rep. Brandon, please state your purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have an ammendment, if it's an appropriate time for that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman would like to be recognized to send forth his ammendment,
the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is ammendment ARQ74 v3: Rep. Brandon moves to ammend the bill on
page 1, line 6 by inserting after the phrase &quot;applications&quot;
the following:
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate his ammendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I appreciate that. This is a very simple ammendment, In light of the
ammendment with Rep. Stam I tried to bring able to  bring the definition
a little bit more closer to reality and so I tried to accomodate that
and so now we do have a clear definition that we have used in other
examples including our [??] bill that we are able to deal with the same
exact situation in charter schools.
Why do we need the ammendment? Some people have asked me, staff said
that public schools are not allowed to do this, and charter schools
should not be allowed to do it also. But the reason why we need this
ammendment is for the same reasons as why I stood on this floor and I
supported clarifications for students that are christians that have
their right to pray in their schools because some times even though it
is clear in the law, that you have rights but you also have people that
are in the school system and you have people in this country, in ths

And so it is incumbent upon this body that we make clarifications so
people will not say because &quot;you are a homosexual, or because you
are anything other than that then you cannot attend this school&quot;
because that is unlawful, it is unconstitutional, and it's un-American.
And it is also something that we should clarify in this body, that we
stand behind. That it does not matter who you are, that if you are a
child of this state, that we will educate you and you have the
responsiblity to educate them, regardless of their color, creed, and of
course, we have to include sexual identification. I know it's a hard
topic. I know people would rather for us to not talk about it. But I
will let you know that you guys already do this. When I got here, I was
amazed at the amount of respect that I received. No one treated me
differently because I was different. Everybody in this building treated
me with the utmost respect. We worked together on bills, we talked to
each other like colleagues, we pass bills together,  we ate and drank
together, we did all of these things together and nobody wondered,
&quot;What's Rep. Brandon's sexuality?&quot; because it didn't matter.
And I promise you, that the same respect that you gave me is the same
respect that our children and our teachers will give to any student in
any public place that we have. Discuss what we do. But in this body, it
is incumbent upon us to make sure that we make those protections. I
stand up on this floor for the last four years and fall for kids, poor
and minority kids, to have equal opportunity and equal access. Not
because I'm black, but because I'm an American and it's the right thing
to do. I stood up on this floor and fight for Christian students to have
the right to pray in school. Not because I'm a Christian, but because
I'm an American, and it's the right thing to do. I will fight for Skip
Stam, who is a friend of mine. And I have much respect for. And even
though some of the stuff he says is a little uncomfortable, and at
sometimes they might hurt someone's feelings, it's never an excuse for
me not to fight to my death to make sure that he has every right to say
it. Not because I'm a legislator, but because I'm an American. And
that's the right thing to do.  And you have the responsiblity, as an
American, regardless of homosexuality's a little uncomfortable, and it
might not be something we like. I still have all the priviledges
thereof. I am entitled to everything that you're entitled to. Not
because I'm black, Not because I'm a democrat, and not because I'm gay,
but because I'm an American. And it's just as simple as that. It does
not matter. So this ammendment is an American ammendment. And that's
what I want you to look it as, not- we're accepting things, we're given
exceptionalism, but we're simply saying that every child in this state
is entitiled to all the privileges thereof, as any child in any other
state and any other child here. Not because of anything other than
they're just an American. And that's what we do. Those stars and stripes
are for everybody. It's not just for your cause, the Constitution is not
just for what you want to fight it for,  the beautiful thing about it,
it's for every single person. Whether we like it or not. Whether I like
Skip Stam's comments or not, doesn't matter. He has the right to say it.
Whether you like the fact that I'm homosexual or not, does not matter. I
have the right to be here.  Because I'm an American. I urge all of my
colleagues to please, please vote for this ammendment. Lets send a clear
statement to the state of North Carolina that if you're a child in this
state, you are also an American and you are entitled to all the
privileges thereof. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Lewis, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker I'd like to speak on the ammendment and and then offer a

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I want to thank the gentleman from Guildford for
the very eloquent and heartfelt speech that he just shared with us. And
he's right. Public schools, public charter schools, which is what these
are, are for all people. They are free and open schools.</p>

...with that, this amendment is not, normally I would point out where
there's subject matter not so important that Representative Brandon just
pointed out, I would point out to the body that this changes the title
which means the vote on this bill can't be heard today. But the issues
that he discussed are actually more important than that. And in a
moment, I intend to offer an amendment consistent with state law to
address the concerns that the gentleman sends forward. Mr.Speaker, for a
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to state his motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I move that amendment six to lie upon the
table.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis has moved that amendment six be
laid on the table and it has been properly seconded by Representative
Cleveland. Therefore, the question before the House is the motion to lay
amendment six on the table. Those in favor will vote aye, those opposed
will vote no. The Clerk will open the vote.
Clerk will let the machine record the vote. Sixty-four having voted in
the affirmative and 52 in the negative. The motion passes. We are back
on the bill. Representative Lewis, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Send forward an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to send forth an
amendment. The Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis moves to amend the bill. This is
amendment 8TC-153V1. Representative Lewis moves to amend the bill on
page 2, lines 31 to 32 by rewriting those lines to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis is recognized to debate the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank you, ladies and
gentlemen of the House. The amendment that you have before you is
consistent with language that this Chamber has debated and discussed and
passed in this session. It makes clear that our public charter schools
are public schools. That they are free and open and accessible for all
people and I would urge your support of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative Lewis would yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, very much, Mr. President. Thank you,
Representative Lewis. I guess first question, the categories listed in
42 USC 2000D, can you recite to us what those are?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative, thank you for that inquiry. I had
anticipated it and was in the process of trying to pull it up on the
screen. I can't do it off the top of my head. My memory is just not that
good.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman yield? He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Lewis. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. I think before we vote on your amendment, and in that sense as
I'm asking asking it be temporarily displaced until we know what we're
voting on and what categories are in that statute and what categories
are not. And specifically, whether the categories that Representative
Brandon's amendment listed are in Section 2000D. I haven't had a chance
to pull it up, either.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I will take that as a request from a
colleague and I would ask the Chair if we could temporarily displace
this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection, we will temporarily displace
amendment seven. Representative Jeter, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman's recognized to send forth an amendment. The
Clerk will read.

moves to amend the bill on page 3, line 28 by rewriting that line to
read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jeter, you're recognized to debate the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Currently, there are 12 items
that are public information for charter school requests of teachers.
What my amendment does is leaves 11 of them in place and removes one.
The one that it removes is the name of the teacher. I will tell you why
I think this motion, this amendment is valuable and necessary. Charter
school teachers are not state employees. Charter school teachers do not
get to participate in the state pension plan. Charter school teachers do
not have tenure and charter school teachers do get paid on merit pay...</p>

in competition within their school system. Very different than how we
pay teachers in the traditional public school system. Therefore, you
create a very hostile environment when you have to release names and
salaries for every teacher. When somebody can be teaching third grade
and the other person can be teaching third grade, been there the same
long times, have the exact same degrees, making very different amounts
of money based on what the principal believes is the quality of their
work. The question is, I'm trying...The argument I've heard is that I'm
trying to make it so it's harder to find out what we're doing with
public money. Let me tell you why I think that argument is folly. There
are twelve items. The only thing I'm taking away is names. If you go to
any charter school with a Freedom of Information Act Request, you still
get the age of the individual, the date of their employment, their
contract terms, their current position, their title, their current
salary, when they got an increase and decrease in pay, where their
demotions and transfers were, what the general description of their each
promotion for, what they teach, where they're currently assigned and if
they've had any disciplinary actions by the local board. It gives you
all the information that we as a public need to know to make sure our
tax dollars are being used effectively. All it does is eliminate the
potential of creating hostile work environments for people that aren't
state employees, that don't get to participate in the state pension
plan, who don't have tenure, and who do get paid based on a merit based
system. I would strongly encourage your support for the amendment.
Speaker Changes: Members without objection, Rule 12 B is suspended so
that Representative Cotham can finish her bojangles. [laughter] So
ordered. Representative Hardister, please state your purpose.
Speaker Changes: Debate the amendment.
Speaker Changes: The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
Speaker Changes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, I think this is an
excellent amendment for the reasons described by Representative Jeter. I
appreciate him bringing this forward and I hope you'll support it.
Speaker Changes: Representative Jones, please state your purpose.
Speaker Changes: To see if Representative Jeter would yield to a
question.
Speaker Changes: Representative Jeter, do you yield?
Speaker Changes: Absolutely.
Speaker Changes: He yields.
Speaker Changes: Thank you, Representative Jeter. I want to join my
colleague for congratulating you for this amendment. I think it's an
excellent amendment and I intend to support it. My question to you is,
do you think, based on all the other categories that you mentioned, does
your amendment go far enough? I mean, the other categories...If all
those categories are made public, is it still obvious...I can't remember
every one that you mentioned. One was age and so forth. Would it still
be obvious to the other employees there who that is?  Is all that
information absolutely necessary?
Speaker Changes: I think that's a compelling argument, Representative
Jones. I don't disagree with you. That being said, my goal was to try to
get the amendment passed without releasing the name. Certainly, I agree
with you. The reality is if somebody really wanted to do some digging
this does not prohibit them from finding out that information. All it
does is make it so if you get a sweeping request from media outlets,
you're not going to see everyone who's at that school's name and salary
listed. Obviously, if a co-worker wants to go through those, you
probably don't eliminate that, although it's going to make them do a lot
more effort than most are willing to do.
Speaker Changes: Gentleman yield to one more question?
Speaker Changes: Gentleman yield?
Speaker Changes: He yields.
Speaker Changes: Again, I think it's an excellent amendment. I intend to
support it. I suppose time is of the essence here. I think under normal
circumstances I might ask if you'd want to object to third reading and
see if there was further work that might make it even better. However, I
do support your amendment, and I assume you probably would prefer not to
do that.
Speaker Changes: I believe this is third reading. The other thing I
would say, Representative Jones, is that I am happy, should I have the
privilege of being reelected in November, to work with you. I think you
can make a compelling argument that teachers in traditional public
schools should have the same right. The public has a right to know the
individuals like to code by job, by description, what they make. I'm not
sure that the public should know...be able to print even tradition
public school's names. As we get in a long session, my hope is that
we'll look at that as well.
Speaker Changes: Representative Hastings, please state your purpose.
Speaker Changes: To see if Representative Jeter would yield to a
question.

...I would yield all day.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jeter, this is a ?? question I would
really rather not have to deal with it here on the floor, but back in
February of 2019, I had come under personal attack for supporting
charter schools and as I researched the charter school law that was
passed when the Democrats controlled the state Senate, I asked our staff
a question regarding the status of charter employees. What they wrote
back was the employees of charter schools shall be deemed employees of
the local school administrative unit for purposes of providing certain
state funded employee benefits including membership in the teachers and
state employees retirement system. Then they went on to tell me that the
decision whether to participate in the state retirement system is in the
discretion of the charter school board of directors.
I was just wondering if you were aware of that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Couple things, Representative Hastings, I think you
referenced the date 2019, so I appreciate your foresight.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] February 19.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All I know is that my understanding in talking with
the charter schools I've spoken with is that they are clearly by
definition not state employees. My understand is that they do not get to
participate therefore in the state pension plan. That's my
understanding. Of course, as many people in this room know always
reserve the right to be wrong.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentlemen yield for a follow up?
Representative Jeter, do you yield for a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I got a swim meet tonight, so keep talking.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And I'm not trying to be difficult here...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Now, at this point I'm confused so I need to ask,
would it not be prudent for us to just go ahead and displace this and
get this clarified because the staff is generally pretty good on these
issues?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have no intention of displacing the amendment, its
third reading. I have been advised by staff that certain members can
elect in under certain conditions into the state pension plan. I go back
to my point. They are not state employees and even traditional public
school teachers, if you really want to know my druthers, I don't believe
they should have their name forcibly announced, either, because I don't
think it serves a public good as long as you allow that job description
and the pay amount to be released, which is what we're really looking
for to protect the public dollars.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Whitmire, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I pose a question to the
amendment's sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jeter, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] As I said, I have a swim meet at 6:30, my least
favorite thing in the world to do, so I'll answer your questions all
afternoon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think that was a yes. Representative Whitmire?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right, thank you. If my memory serves me fairly
well, last year we passed a few local bills about educators from charter
schools being included in the retirement system. How would that effect
that? It may be a little bit redundant with Representative Hastings
question but I think it's a worthy question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The end of the day, not to say we're getting a little
bit off track and I appreciate the question. The purpose I have is these
are not state employees, they don't have tenure and they have merit pay
at almost all of these charter schools. I'm sure there's some that
don't, but most of them do. When you allow their name and salary to be
blanketly published by newspaper outlets or whatever, with no
consideration of what that means, to me does not serve a public purpose
and all it does is it possibly create a hostile work environment.
I would argue that the pension aspect is less critical to what this
amendment is trying to do. The reality is we are going to publish all
the information that is necessary for the public to ensure that these
dollars are being used in an appropriate and legal fashion. No one is
suggestion we're not. All we're saying is that teachers names shouldn't
have to be published for ridicule.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insko, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the bill's sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jeter, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jeter, you're changing a statute in
115C which applies to our public schools.</p>

Differences between charter schools and public schools and you just
mentioned one. And that is the pay, the charter schools don’t follow the
pay schedule like they do in the public schools. So if there were some
women teachers for example who thought that they were not getting equal
pay for equal work, and they would not be able, they might be able to
find all the salary schedules but would they be able to find, would they
be able to find who that was? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would argue that name
is not always gender identifiable. So if your name was Robin. It could
be a guy or a girl. All I’m suggesting is name is being excluded. There
are eleven other identifiers under 115C-320. And you know, I would
imagine that if you’re getting into those types of things, if you saw
discrepancies there’s things you could look at. To answer your question,
at no point in these 12 items as I see them is gender referenced at all.
And I don’t think name in and of itself addresses your issue because
there are plenty of names that could be male or female. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Certainly. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well,
I’m not suggesting that the public would sort of randomly look at
charter school salaries and try to identify that. What I’m suggesting is
that usually unequal pay for equal work comes from people who work
inside the system. And they know everyone already. But if you didn’t, if
you weren’t able to identify, if you thought there was a colleague that
you knew who they were, or if all the women were being paid less. Or if
all the men were being paid less. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think that’s an
excellent question Representative Insko. I think under that scenario,
you could identify because you’re going to have to give the age of the
employee, you’re going to have to give the date they were hired, where
they teach, and what they teach. So you’re a coworker, you would
basically have that knowledge. My guess is if somebody wanted to know,
if we all were paid on merit and somebody said we need to know a 40 year
old man that got elected in 2012 that sits on the back row, that’s kind
of a smart aleck all the time, I’m willing to bet everybody in here
knows that’s me. So I think there’s plenty of qualifiers for that. What
I’m trying to prohibit is the blanket publication of the names. I don’t,
I believe this data would allow a coworker to figure out if they were
being unfairly compensated, based on anything that would be prohibited
by law. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I was here when we sent up the
legislation for charter schools and supported it. But the more money,
the more tax dollars charter schools get or receive, the more I think
they should come under the same regulations as public schools. And I

for public schools. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman's recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I won't speak long to belabor it, but I think
Representative Jeter's right. It's a good amendment. I think with
respect to all these claims that parties could make, just like in
private businesses, people bring discrimination claims all the time and
that information, I think, can be discovered. I think that's really a
non-issue. I think more significantly to Representative Jeter's point
and maybe to Representative Jones point, we ought to consider broadening
this as we move towards a system where we allow more variance in pay to
protect more of this information generally across the board. I think
it's a good amendment and I hope you'll support it.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday the
24th, I asked this House and the House was kind enough to pass an
amendment to this bill that allowed charter schools to expand. There
were a couple of concerns that were raised, in part by the gentleman
from Cumberland and the lady from Guilford.
What this amendment does is tighten the language on the amendment that
we have already passed and what it does, I don't want to read if word
for word, but often times that the best way to explain it. It says that
a charter school may expand one year provided that it meets certain
qualification. The first is that the charter school, as you all know,
charter schools are public schools and they're subject to the same
regiment of in the course and whatnot, testing that our traditional
public schools are.
This would say that the academic outcomes or the test scores would have
to be at least comparable, which means at least as high as the
traditional K through 12 schools within the county. If they were not,
then there ability to expand...</p>

Would not exist. B, it would require that the charter school has
provided a financially sound audit showing that they are able to
withstand the ??? that the charter school has shown that it is in
compliance with state law, federal law, the school’s own bylaws or the
provisions that were set forth in the charter as it was originally
granted by the state board of education. Further, we go on to say that,
and I apologize I don’t seem to have the actual version in front of me,
at the request from the gentleman from Cumberland we also added language
which begins at the bottom of page 1 and continues into page 2 that says
the state board under exceptional circumstances, which is a very borad
term, but that they could also deny or veto the right to add the one
grade level. I would ask your support, I think does do what my intent
was which is to allow a school that is performing well to grow but it
also establishes some very measurable performance standards which show
that it is educating kids at least as well as the traditional K-12
schools are within the county. It’s financially strong enough to do so,
which I think is something that the lady from Guilford had inquired
about, and it still provides one extra safety valve in case the state
board is aware of a concern that maybe we didn’t address in this bill so
I would respectfully ask for your support of this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Reives please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker, and I’m just asking on the last
vote on Representative Stam’s amendment if I could be recorded as voting
yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Without objection the gentleman will have his vote
changed and recorded as yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Alright.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Adams please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you. I’d like to ask Representative Lewis a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Lewis does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Representative Lewis. I had a concern the
other day about moving from one grade to the other that would allow the
school to move from, for example, elementary to middle school, middle
school to high school, but I don’t see that this amendment corrects
that. If it does can you tell me, you mentioned that you thought it did
but I don’t see it.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Well thank you for that inquiry, Representative. The
amendment does not address that specific concern, it just says that the
school will be measured based on being able to perform or that the
students in that school are able to perform at least as well as the
students in traditional K-12 schools. If that condition is met, along
with the condition of financial stability of the school, along with the
safety valve, if you will, that if the state board is aware of some
concern that they can prevent the expansion, but your point is well
taken in that there are K-5 and then 6-8 and then 9-12, I’m very aware
of that. This amendment would allow an expansion from the K-5 into the
6th grade. I am convinced that if a school is performing as it is
supposed to, if the parents and the students who have chosen to go to
that school are pleased with the results and want to continue to advance
that they should have the chance to do so.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] So even if the charter that’s been developed for that
school allows that school to operate through the fifth grade, if the
parents are pleased when that child gets to fifth grade and wants that
child to remain, that can automatically happen? Is that what you’re
saying here?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] No ma'am, what it’s saying is..</p>

that a charter school may prepare to add a grade for the next academic
school year. That it can do anything it needs to do to prepare to do
that. Let's use, let's say so that we can be on the subject that you're
asking about, let's say that a charter exists for fifth grade, and the
school wishes to add sixth grade. If the school can do whatever it needs
to do to logistically to prepare to do that and then still would be
subject to a veto if you will if their standardized testing that's
required of all public schools if they do not meet those goals, if
they're not financially sound enough to do so, and or if the state board
determines that there's some cause to not allow them to expand. [SPEAKER
CHANGE] May I just speak briefly on that?[SPEAKER CHANGE]The lady is
recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr.
Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen, I had a concern the last time this issue
was before us. I appreciate the gentlemans the changes he's made to
accommodate some of the concerns but the concern that I had is still
there. I think this is just perhaps another way to continue expanding
these schools. I think if we're going to do that we need to do it in the
right way. But I also have some concerns even as a grandparent now
because my children are out of public school. But I just believe that if
the school has been authorized to operate K-5, 6-8 then that's what
needs to happen. Until it goes through a process where it's reviewed and
there's another application for a different kind of school. But based on
what this amendment says that doesn't have to happen. If you're pleased
as a parent and the child is in the fifth grade and that school can then
expand to the sixth grade and who knows it will go to the seventh and
eighth. Before we know it there'll be another school. I don't that
that's the intent of the bill this amendment but it seems that's what
will happen. I think that we're headed the wrong way on this. Someone
mentioned that were putting people our administrators and teachers to
the same standards in public schools but we're really not if you just
look at the last amendment that just passed out of here. But I don't
support the amendment. I think it's setting a bad presidence, and I'm
going to vote against it. [SPEAKER CHANGE] House will come to order.
Representative Glazier please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGE] To
debate the amendment Mr. Speaker.[SPEAKER CHANGE] Gentleman is
recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr.
Speaker and I shared and still share a lot of the concerns that
representative Adams had but I want to first tell you why I'm going to
vote for this amendment today. We did a lot of work last night and a lot
of work this morning up until a few minutes ago on this amendment and I
think it actually answers most of the questions. So let me go through my
reasoning and if people disagree I'd sure like to hear it. So this does
expand or allow the expansion by one grade of a charter school that
currently offers let's say K-5 to 6 but unlike representative Lewis's
amendment yesterday which did not have criteria on it he has three
criteria on this bill which I think were crucial but it's the fourth
provision I want to talk about that's even more. So it does require now
that the charter school could only do that if it's academic outcomes
were comparable to the local school unit. Second no financial audit
problems. Which is obviously an issue when you're expanding. Third they
have to be in compliance fully with state law, federal law, it's own
bylaws and the provisions set forth in the charter granted by the state
board. So there can't be any problems with any of that that exist. Even
with that if you look at line 31 at the bottom and then the beginning of
the next page, if the state board finds all of that but still and this
gets to representative Adams point, but still finds there a
circumstances which would justify denial of the charter, for example:
they're unprepared with curriculum, they're unprepared</p>

appeared with staff. They're not ready to go to a sixth grade. They may
still deny the application. And on top of which Representative Lewis has
put in a very narrow sunset for this so that we'll see how it goes for
the next year. And it ought of also give incentive to the state board to
fill in the blank in this area with their appropriate rules and
regulations so we will not see this come back and that will be in the
rules. I think we have effectively given the state board the ability to
deny any application for a charter that's not ready, isn't compliant,
has any financial problems, or otherwise isn't making the grade. That
may be all we can ask for. I think, although it's a little round about,
I think we do give it exactly the concern that Representative Adams had.
I am going to, for that reason, vote for the amendment.
Speaker Changes: Mr. Speaker?
Speaker Changes: Representative Adams, please state your purpose.
Speaker Changes: I'd like to ask Representative Glazier a question.
Speaker Changes: Representative Glazier, do you yield?
Speaker Changes: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker Changes: Representative Glazier, yes it does give the board
certain authority. Does the board have authority, based on what's in
this amendment,  to deny a school that's currently operating at a
particular level to move into another type of school?
Speaker Changes: Representative Adams, I believe it does, and that's the
only reason I'm voting for the amendment because I share your concern.
We added in, specifically to get at that issue, if the state board
believes that that school is not ready; that is: they haven't put all
the effort in preparing to move from fifth to sixth; they haven't shown
them that they have the faculty, the curriculum; all the things that you
and I talked about yesterday or two days ago on this bill, then that to
me would be, that seems exactly what exceptional circumstances are and
they can deny the expansion. Now, it would depend, obviously, on the
state board exercising good discretion and control. We have to assume in
good faith that they'll do that. They've been pretty good about limiting
charters so far when they're not ready to proceed. And again, I hope
they'll fill the gap with some rules but the answer, short answer to
your question is I believe this amendment does allow them to deny a
charter moving to another level if they are not ready to do that.
Speaker Changes: Representative Insko, please state your purpose.
Speaker Changes: I'd like to ask the bill sponsor a question.
Speaker Changes: The amendment sponsor a question?
Speaker Changes: Yes.
Speaker Changes: Representative Lewis, do you yield?
Speaker Changes: Excuse me?
Speaker Changes: Yes, Sir.
Speaker Changes: He yields.
Speaker Changes: Thank you. Representative Lewis, I agree with the last
discussion that's come up. My question is, when a school has been
approved as K through five that's going through this process does the
current language here shall be in compliance with state law, federal
law, school's on bylaws provisions. Would it require that school also to
complete the requirements as if they were going to become a middle
school?
Speaker Changes: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker Changes: Thank you.
Speaker Changes: Representative Wilkins, please state your purpose.
Speaker Changes: Must speak of the exchange between Representatives
Adams and Glazier answered my question. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This amendment will make it
clear that our charter schools are just like our public schools, that we
are not going to discriminate based on any category protected by our
United States Constitution,including the Equal Protection Clause, where
under Federal law it applies to our states. I think there is some
consensus on this, and I would ask that the body support this amendment,
and if you have any questions, I would be glad to try to answer those.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker, thank you, Representative
Ramsey. I
agree with this amendment. Now, I will say that it doesn't do it in
exactly the language that I would wish, or that Representative Brandon
had articulated and enumerated, and that Representative Fisher had
enumerated yesterday. But I think it does what we want morally and
legally constitutionally the law to be, which is the recognition that no
child should be discriminated against in a charter school, which is a
public school, for any reason, based on their status, or who they are,
and I think that, when you look at the categories protected by the
Constitution and Federal law, that I think this achieves that in a way
that perhaps sends a good message from everybody in this House about
what we believe are the rights of children in public schools, in charter
schools. I commend Representative Ramsey on this and urge adoption of
the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brandon, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Speaking on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One of the things I love about this place is the way
people come together to be able to make sure that we're doing the right
thing. I'd like to thank Representative Ramsey and Representative Lewis
for wanting to do the right thing and  giving us the opportunity to do
that. I do accept this amendment. The bigger problem that we have is
that this is the best way to address it. The bigger problem that we have
in the state of North Carolina that I hope as I leave this body, that
you deal with when I leave, is that you still have a whole group of your
citizens that are treated as second class citizens. There are no
protections, really, except for federal law and statutes, for the LGBT
community. I am not going to rehash all of that, but I want you to know
that, regardless of how you feel about the situation, we still are
Americans, and like I've said before, are still entitled to all the
privileges thereof. Thank you.

House Bill, excuse me, Senate Bill 78, the Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] House Committee Substitute to Senate Bill 78, a bill
entitled an Act to Require Cities and Counties to Remove Personal
Information From Records Available on the Internet Websites Maintained
by Counties and Cities When Requested by Certain Law Enforcement
Personal, Prosecutors and Additional Officers. General Assembly of North
Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Malone, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Debate the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman's recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, and good afternoon to everybody. Senate
Bill 78 is a very simple bill. All our bills are simple. What this
basically does it says that any, and I'm going to read them off for you
if you don't the bill in front of you, that any of these individuals can
go to their cities or counties and ask for their information, their
personal information, to be taken down from their websites, such as tax
information. For instance, right now you could very well go to mine or
somebody else's tax information on the Wake County website and you will
see my information. You will be actually able to go ahead and take a
look at a map and get yourself directions as to how to get to my home.
This is a threat assessment and it's an issue for a lot of different
people, or raises the threat assessment is what I should say. If you're
a federal, state or local law enforcement official, an officer, beg your
pardon, this covers you. Criminal magistrates, assistant district
attorneys, prosecutors employed by the State Attorney General, there are
about 10 of them in that office. U.S. attorneys or assistant U.S.
attorneys, and federal judges. The reason why federal judges are on
there is because they're appointed. There are no elected officials on
here. We are not creating a two-tier system for anybody.
Now the reason why I brought this bill forward was because, and many of
you will remember this, and we talked about this in committee, there was
an incident in Wake Forest, a gentleman was kidnapped. He was a father
of an ADA here in Wake County. And that's what highlighted the
situation. I'm going to acknowledge right away that that particular
situation would not be remedied by this bill, but that ADA, the woman
who's father was kidnapped and brought down to Atlanta, did come to the
committee and spoke very highly of the bill. She understands, as did
several others who also came and spoke on behalf of it, that it is not a
perfect bill, but it is a good step going forward in protecting our
policemen, protecting anyone involved in the judicial system that falls
under this criteria that we're stating here.
That's what we're trying to do. We're trying to make them a little bit
more safe. Once upon a time there was no internet and a threat
assessment, always high, is now a little bit higher. We want to scale it
back.
Now I understand that there are problems with the bill, not necessarily
in the bill but in the situation that they face. You can't necessarily
if you're, well you can if you are a committed individual, if you're
involved in crime, you can find these people if you want to. You can go
to a Google and buy a subscription and find an address or something like
that, but there are a lot of people out there who make threats. They go
online, they find it and then they go look for the guy. A lot of them
won't do that anymore so it will lower the threat assessment, they'll
make them feel more safe and they're happier with the situation.
There's a lot of associations that agree with this. There a few that
don't. I will go ahead and point out that the press association kind of
said, &quot;Well, we'd like to be able to take a look at the
internet.&quot; But, you know, they didn't say much more than that. The
realtors, I offered them an opportunity to amend the bill if they so
chose, they could not come to a consensus and so they do not have an
amendment.
As Representative Jeter said earlier, I will opine that if I am lucky
enough to get re-elected in November and they want to come back and
discuss the issue, I'm happy to revisit it.
What we're trying to do here is make them a little more safe and I think
it's a good bill. I commend it to you. Answer any questions. Thank you.

On down, financial problems, down to the cities and counties. This
particular bill suffers from several defects, but the first is it will
cost our counties millions of dollars. We don’t have a fiscal note
because it’s not a state cost, but it will have, it will require the
Register of Deeds of every county to completely change the way they
present information. It will cost law enforcement people lots of money
because when they want, if they take advantage of this because if they
want their title search, the person searching the title will have
physically go to the courthouse to do it instead of doing it online as
they do today and which is much more efficient. It is a solution in
search of a problem, and I can give different solutions to law
enforcement officers who want an anonymity. There’s a much simpler way.
Representative Wells could form an LLC forum and be the manager, and
they could get their name and address completely off the public land
records and tax records. But this idea that you can have two different
sets of records electronically, one at the courthouse and two online is
just completely unworkable. I would ask you to defeat the bill and think
of another solution to the problem.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Speaker. Members of the House, I,
too, oppose this for somewhat different reasons than Representative
Stam. I do know it’s a problem for real estate attorneys. It’s, also,
going to be a problem for banks who go in to try to determine certain
credibilities and things that they only do online. These people, in
essence, will become non-existent to them, but the second thing is
actually the instant that facilitated this is something we’ve got to
think about. When they can’t find Chris Malone, law enforcement officer
on there, they may as well show up at Chris Malone Joe average citizen’s
house and come after his family because we do know that people
frequently have the common names. In the situation he’s talking about,
they couldn't find the prosecutor. They went with someone with the same
last name. It was her father that became the victim here. So, if we’re
really trying to help that situation, we’d be removing a whole lot of
people, and the question is where do you stop? And when do they become
public again? If you’re a law enforcement officer now but in five years
you’re not there, do we continue off the system forever? What about your
wife? What about the children? What about when the children get old
enough to get married, get out on their own? Where do we stop taking
people off? When the bill came up as committee chair, I received several
calls from other people who wanted to have their name removed from the
public records that were not necessarily elected officials either. Do we
take off the social workers who are working with abused and neglected
children? Do we take off the divorce attorneys who people don’t always
like? Do we take off school teachers who are getting threatened? Do we
take off legislative staff? And I did have a request from a former
legislative staff member that he’d like to have his names taken off,
too. Thought it was a good idea. It is not the best solution to the
problem that we have, and it’s certainly not going to be workable. So,
I’m asking you to vote against this bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Grier Martin, please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if the gentleman from Wake, Representative
Malone, would yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Malone, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]. He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Malone.  Just a question for
you. On page one line twenty of the bill, this would include federal
judges in your bill, and my question is would that term include a
federal magistrate judge who were appointed a separate measure from, a
separate way from federal district and appellate court judges? They’re
not confirmed by the Senate. I just wanted to make sure that federal
magistrate judges would be included in that line.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My answer would be yes. We did not specify, but yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A follow-up Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman ?? to an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, he ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And just to confirm that is your intent in this bill
to include federal magistrate judges?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s my intent.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir.

remedy if the county for some reason administratively fails to do that,
or does the county have any liability for that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I was asked that question. I beg your pardon. Yes, I
was asked that question, and the answer is no. We do a lot of things. A
lot of unfunded mandates so you can't very well you know, hit a county
with a misdemeanor or something like that. So the answer is no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Mr. Speaker, members, this, this bill.. we
heard this bill in the judiciary committee and, I want you to know
Representative Malone worked, worked very hard on this bill. And I don't
?? ... and I've been in and out of the chamber, so I'm not sure if he
told you the story of what actually inspired this, or what actually
happened; where you had the agent who was kidnapped, the father of the
assistant DA was kidnapped, she came to the committee and spoke. This
bill has been endorsed by district attorney's, the, the US Attorney's,
all three US Attorney's have joined in support of this bill. And, while
it does not completely fix the problem, it is a step in that direction.
It is, it is something that if it passes here today, it will go to the
senate, and probably will need to be tweaked a over there. But, I think
Representative Malone did the right thing in not just waiting to do this
in the long session, and acting on it now. Because of, what happened.
What's happening right now is that we have folks in our, in our prisons,
who have... who are kingpins I guess you'd say, particularly with some
of the gangs, some of the drug groups, and they're getting access...
there's a whole nother issue about access to cell phones, or having
access to cell phones. They're, they're able to conduct their
business... they're able to do a lot of things. And this isn't just
theory. You actually had the father of an assistant DA who was
kidnapped, and, but for really good work by law enforcement probably
would be dead today. And this is not, I mean this is a real thing. I
know there are those who say &quot;well should you add more people to
this list, should you do this, should you do that?&quot; The difference
with prosecutors, and the reason to include this the way it is right now
is; It's not theory what might happen, what possibly would happen, but
what has already happened. And this, I would submit to you, is a
responsible way to try to deal with it. I think even Representative
Malone would acknowledge it's not going to totally fix it. If somebody
wants to find out where somebody lives, they still can. But it makes it
more difficult. They would at least have to go to the courthouse, or
they have to use some private source. There's gonna... remember the
people who gonna want to track somebody down to commit this kind of
crime, they're not going to leave a fingerprint, if you will, while
they're trying to locate them. So, I would encourage you to.. the body
let's vote for this, let's vote for this bill today, let's get it to the
senate. If it needs some more, if it needs more work, we can keep
working on it. If it comes to the point where it gets to the senate
where it can't be worked on and fixed there, then, then so be it. But, I
would hate to see this bill die in the house, and not have a chance for
us to do something in this session, because folks, it's not just theory,
these are facts, these are problems that are happening, and I would urge
the body's support of the bill.

I tried my best to see the new one, it was handed out about 10:40 in

unanimously in both houses last year. Happy to report that since we
passed that bill, we’ve had I believe it’s… and I didn’t realize this
was going to be put on the calendar today, so I’m just taking it from
memory. I think it’s eight cap… maybe it’s five. It was either five or
eight captive agencies that have already opened up in North Carolina.
We’ve already got about 500 thousand dollars in revenue from those.
These amendments are pretty simple and designed to make us a little bit
more competitive with the laws of the captive insurance companies that
surround us. We assume I think with good… pretty conservatively that our
captives will be up to about 25 by the end of this year and the revenue
will be over a million and a half dollars. If you remember, captive
insurance companies are basically insurance companies that are formed by
companies to insure their own risk primarily, and sometimes some of
their subsidiaries. It’s something that I don’t know of anybody who’s
against. The Department of Insurance actually helped craft this bill,
and so I know of no opposition and would ask you to support it. [SPEAKER

…And we are seeing our prisons are protected and then obviously one of
the new provisions, just two provisions that were included in the bill,
one in the PCS this morning and that’s the transfer the SPI to ahead and
that was in both the house and the Senate budget and this is an effort
to make sure that is one item we know is eventually going to be included
in a final budget but it’s important to make sure that our own
enforcement agency here are SPIs able to focus on the jobs and we don’t
wanna get this transition started so they can consolidate their offices
and also as another provision that touches on really a critical matter
in the state and something that came up this week was really the issue
and Harnett County this week that came up with the sex crimes issues
that have been addressed in this bill includes the provisions and that
were also in the budget to authorize the State Bureau of Investigation
to expand their unit that’s out targeting individuals predators online
and that are going after at young people in the state children in the
state that’s included and also at the request of the Department of
Justice provisions to make sure that the State Crime Lab, several
positions they wanna to make sure were transferred out of the SPI and
left into the Department of Justice and in the crime lab that was
included at their request and the provision that adds in the electronic
testimony for the crime lab folks so that they can try to help and find
ways to be more efficient and timely and make sure they are able to do
their job with the resources they have available and that came out of
our house select committee on judicial efficiency. I’m certainly happy
to answer any additional questions that members may have but I know
there is one amendment from Representative Bolls that he has and we will
certainly stand for any questions, thank you Mr. Chairman.

Thank you and I would Representative Berg running this bill I went back

Representative Berg I started this bill with just a cell phone and it
grew from there and there we accepted more and more amendments to it,

things in this bill I hope you will support it and I hope you will vote

...they still were able to keep their ABC license. What this does is
that it will suspend the license for 30 days and it gives them time for
the ABC commission to come back and have a probable cause hearing
whether to suspend or revoke the establishment's license and also, but
it still continues the business can operate just suspends their ABC
permit licenses. It would be no different from someone stopped, as
another privilege that we have in this state is driving license. If
you're caught with DUI, your license is suspended for a certain period
of time but then they were given back until you appear before a court.
Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on the amendment?
If not, the question before the House is the passage of amendment one
offered by Representative Boles. Subcommittee has favor passage of the
amendment will vote aye, those opposed will vote no. The Clerk will open

The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. One hundred and
eight having voted in the affirmative and three in the negative, the

For what purpose the gentleman from Wake, Representative Jackson rise?

amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is amendment AMD-83V5. Representative Jackson
moves to amend the bill on page 1, lines 17 and 18, by deleting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, this is
an amendment that is similar in nature to the one that was laid upon the
table when we were debating the budget. It would delete the provision of
this bill directing the SBI transfer from the AG's office to the
Department of Public Safety. As you know, we've already passed that in
the budget, there's no need to do that again. This was a last minute
change. I assume that the language is the same as it was before but I
couldn't take the ?? and had a chance to read the entire 2-some pages.
What I will tell you is that I did read the fiscal note and the fiscal
note that's listed on this bill doesn't include any costs for this
transfer. In the budget we showed $1 million savings directed the
Department of Public Safety to save $1 million by completing this
transfer. That language I know is, I don't believe is in this bill. I
think this is inappropriate to be in this bill. This bill's got a lot of
good things. Senator Davis mentioned those. I mean Representative Davis
mentioned those and I'd love to be able to vote for this bill but I'd
also like for you to consider at least having an up or down vote on my
amendment. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the lady from Wilson,
Representative Farmer-Butterfield rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I wanted to vote yes on the Boles amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Did the lady, was the lady recorded as a no vote? The
lady will be recorded as having voted aye. For what purpose does the
gentleman from Haywood, Representative Queen rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To put the transfer of the SBI in this bill I just
rise to oppose that, so I think this is a good amendment. I have never
thought that it was a wise thing for this body to disenfranchise the
voters of North Carolina who elected the attorney general as the chief
law enforcement officer with the full authority that he has to
investigate, including the office of the SBI, to stand for the citizens
against public corruption of elected officials as one of his prime
responsibilities.
Less than two weeks ago, there was article on the SBI investigating
public corruption issues and of members leadership and members of this
body, the General Assembly and others. And now we're going to transfer
the SBI from the attorney general to an appointed position that
legislative leaders appoint, the Governor, underlying appointees. It's
just sort of, we're putting the fox in the hen house. We need an
independent, publicly elected, publicly accountable to the people
attorney general.
The idea that this is not political is just beyond the pale. It is
nothing but partisan politics for the gubernatorial race, so I am
really...</p>

CHAIRMAN: What purpose does the gentleman from Stanly? representative
Burr rises.
R.BURR: Speak on the amendment
CHAIRMAN: Gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment
R.BURR: Thank you Mr. Chairman. We’ve seen this amendment now in
different forms. I believe at least four times on the floor and is been
defeated four time on the floor. This language here concerning the state
borough investigations, I believe mates the SBI truly and independent
agency where you wont have a someone nominated by the governor and
confirmed by the general assembly for an eight years term. And the
insolvency set off that person is that they can perform their duties
without fear of being fire by an elected official during the time they
are serving. To say that the SBI being under the terning(?) general is
not political, I think is just a very interesting statement because he
too is elected a state wide and runs at parkinson (?)tickets as many
others. This gives the ability to make sure that there is not only one
person getting the control of what happens with the director of the SBI
and having that person be at will and puts him in a place where these
agencies can actually perform their duties and look out for the state of
North Carolina and fight corruption and other crime that are under their
jurisdiction. So I will respectfully ask to the members to vote again
this amendment.
CHAIRMAN: For what purpose is the gentleman from Cumberland?
Representative Glazier rises
R. GlAZIER: To speak to the amendment
CHAIRMAN: Gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment
R. GlAZIER: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I rise and I wouldn’t
normally do that on this amendment because I think we have sort of
discussed this policy and decisions have been made as representative
Burr said, several times. But I want to rise to make this point. About
three hour ago, I think, we, on this side of the aisle, voted
unanimously with you in the majority. Even if we disagree with many
provisions in that bill that was passed on the budget. But we did so in
good faith to try to extend the discussion on the issues that it raised
on t-shirts and all the things that we did jointly believe in. We did
that in good faith, and what representative Jackson is simply asking is
a return collegiality. We want to vote for all the other provisions in
this bill, but you know that the SBI has been a part of an issue between
the two sides. It is now been in three different other bills. All we are
asking on this side is to allow this bill to have a clean vote, and to
allow us to vote with you on all the other provisions, after we did what
you ask us to do earlier. Now is time to the majority of us to show some
good faith and to adopt representive Jackson amendment. Thank you

CHAIRMAN: Does the gentleman form Stanly yield for a question?

CHAIRMAN: He yields
R. BLUST: Representative Burr, I notice in the long title it says near
the end that it got all the provisions in the bill it says “recommended
by the commission for judicial efficiency” I think it is. Was this
particular provision recommended by that commission? The SBI be moved?
Was that One of the recommendations?
R. BURR: The provision that was recommended was the remote testimony
from the crime lab analyst.

To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate he bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, we have this bill this morning and the
appropriations and this bill in large measure was a rehash of something
that we have already voted on. And I heard Representative Davis said
that this bill started out as ___[00:54] Prison Bill and I like that he
pointed to the bill, I wanna bill the vote before bill and I wish it
will be possible to vote up and down on the measures that we all concur
that ought to be rectified but moving the SPI, something agenda the body
has voted on but its not a divisive vote and it’s something that already
has gone over to the Senate and I’m still wondering and why we had it
back again but I still have in my what my county sheriff and as I
understand the Sheriff’s Association of North Carolina has said about
this and they are very be on that they don’t want this to occur. So, at
places ___[01:46] how do you vote for the good pass of this bill and
then separate those pass of the bill that you don’t feel comfortable for
and we know that it’s impossible. So, one has to decide then, “Do I vote
for the bill or do I not vote for the bill because you really in your
heart want to vote for all of the good aspects of this bill.” We are
placed almost in an untenable position and so I just reluctantly will
have to say, “No.” Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Stanley yells to the gentleman from Scotland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Bill. I just wanna ask you a question in my
district I have at least three to four prisons in the area, has
technology caught up with those who actually bring cell from anything
are you noticed people gonna be risk, it still gonna take the chance, is
there anything that you discussed at technology still can find a way to
at least keep them out even though if we get the stick to beat him if
they bring them in anything your conversation about if you don’t mind.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Sir Representative ___[03:30], there are in fact possible solutions
out there a wide variety of solutions that could be looked at to go
along with this to keep cell phone out of prisons or if they get in to
simply block them from being able to make phone calls or pickup those
phone calls within that radius, it’s very expensive technology at this
point and something that cost millions to do just at one location but I
do believe that there are a number of possible ideas like that the
Department of Public Safety is looking at moving towards in the future
but it’s just a matter of what may fit best for the particular prisons
that they are looking at.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.

The gentleman yells to a second question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there a pilot for ___[04:20] in the state going forward this time, do
you know if there is a pilot program just to see how this technology
would work at any provided facility to present time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I know that the department is certainly looking at a number of different
ideas and I won’t get into quite frankly not 100% sure on where, if and
certainly would want to disclose anything that they maybe working on to
try to address these issues but I know that it’s a serious issue that
they realize it’s not just about having a cell phone in there, it’s
about giving that person a connection out…

Into the public, to potentially do some dangerous, participate in some
dangerous activity, as was done here in Wake County and trying to
prevent that. So they know first-hand what a serious issue it is and I
know they’re working to address it just as I mentioned earlier about the
issues at Waynesboro. I know they’ve been down there with the SBI and
the FBI as they worked to weed out a number of issues they seem to have
at that one particular prison and I’m sure it’s not the only one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just one follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the
gentleman yield to an additional question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He does. [SPEAKER CHANGES]?? You and Representatives
from Wilmington? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES] A lot of
investigation. Just for me personally, is there no way that the system,
if the gatehouse, I just say the gatehouse to really stop those phones
from coming in at the gatehouse, is there no other policies or ways that
they’re actually stopping them at the gatehouse? Like I said I’ve worked
at, in my area I’ve got three or four facilities that I know about it.
My wife in fact retired from there. Is there nothing at the gatehouse
that’s really stopping that from coming in, if you don’t mind. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] There are tools that they have. I’ve seen them, the last time I
was at Central Prison. They’ve got a cell phone detector as you come
into the facility that they can use. How well that works, I’m not sure
but I know, I believe they have been able to capture folks off that. But
individuals get creative, unfortunately, with these things and they’re
sneaking them into prisons and it’s an issue that they’re working to
address. But yes, they have some technology. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman
from Durham, Representative MIcheaux rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, here we go again. You know, you all need
to sit down and just think about what you’re doing. This bill, what
you’ve done is put in this bill like you did the other bill, Senate Bill
3, you’ve put in there the things that both bodies basically have agreed
on. The Senate has agreed on moving the SBI to Department of Public
Safety. The Senate agreed on actually teacher wages and this type of
thing. Everything that you’ve got a conference committee sitting out
there, trying to work these differences out. But what you’re doing is
trying to double insurance on this situation by introducing bills on
items that have already been agreed upon, and knowing that you’re
antagonizing the folks on the other side to the point where you’re not
going to get anything done. It just doesn’t seem right to me, when
you’ve got the process, a process which takes care of itself. You don’t
have to take these extraordinary measures to do this. It’s just not
necessary. Why would you, people say well we’ve got to do it you know,
because. No, no that’s because of time, this type of thing. We’ve go the
time. Let me tell you something. You have left some items in there that
you’re never going to agree on. You may agree on most of these items
here but there’s always room for compromise. We agreed to go, we agreed
that teachers ought to have a raise. No question about that. If you
wanted to something about the SBI why didn’t you make it an independent
agency, with an appointment by an elected official, or non-elected, and
make it as independent as you can without putting it under anybody? To
me if you’re trying to take the politics out of it, you put more
politics in it now by doing this than you had before. So my friends,
let’s just think about what we’re doing. Why don’t we let whatever it
takes, let the conference committee go to work, do what both houses have
done, try to bring everything back together, and keep, just quit running
stuff by us twice, three or four times when you don’t need to do it. I
hope you kill this thing. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Wake has the floor to debate the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister Speaker and members of the House, I think one
of the great, really good provisions of the bill is the one on remote
forensic testimony, and the reason for it just, very briefly, is so that
we don’t have our forensic analysts running all over the state, sitting
in the back of court rooms at trials instead they can be in the lab
doing their work. And in many cases, they’ll be able to do their
testimony by video. We asked the head of the lab by Judge Joe John if
they’re ready to go, and he says, pretty much they’re ready to go, at
least in some places. So this would allow them to begin this three
months earlier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on the amendment.

forty-nine the following.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Chatham has the floor to debate the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Speaker. Members of the House, I
would just ask that you support this amendment. I agree with
Representative Stam. One of the best thing about this bill is remote
forensic testimony. One of the issues that came up when this was brought
up in judiciary B was a clearer meaning of the word report and what we
want to do is to encourage both sides to use remote forensic testimony.
It’s going to save us a lot of money and save us a lot of time, and so
all we've done is further define what is meant by that report so you’ll
have less objections and more uses as remote forensics. We didn't get a
chance to add it on in judiciary B because of the speed of the bill
moving through. Representative Davis has been very helpful and assist
me, trying to get this together and to bet it. He’s thought to, if I
remember correctly, the conference of district attorneys, talked to the
bar. All of them are in agreement with it, and it will make this a
better working part of this bill, and so we’d appreciate your support.

Representative Davis, rise?

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Speaker. Representative Reives is

Attorneys conference is okay with this language, and I ask you to

… independent, politically-independent decision on your part; just that
you’d like to have an appointed chief law enforcement officer rather
than an elected one. An elected official is accountable to the people.
That is politics. That’s the good part of politics. That’s the part of
politics that I stand for. It’s like we just say in this body “Let’s
just decide the county commissioners can appoint the chief law
enforcement officers of the county. They don’t get to elect their
sheriffs anymore.” So we know that in the counties, it’s a good thing to
have your chief law enforcement officer independent, able to do his job,
and in particularly when it comes to investigating political officials,
people in this body. I just read a couple of things, just out of the
popular press, why this is not important. Why would we want to let SPI
answer to the very people they may be investigating or who may play a
part in the legislative confirmation of their director? That’s not a
good thing in my opinion. The article goes on to say – there was just an
anecdote about this just a couple of weeks ago – pick something like
sweepstake poker gambling that we’ve all handled in this General
Assembly and it been hard to get our hands around. Lots of money comes
in from this gambling enterprise. What does it say that the state’s most
powerful political politicians top the list of recipients? Thom Tillis
is first, followed by Governor McCrory and then Berger, and they’re
under investigation for illegal campaign contributions. You want an
independent agency to deal with these kinds of questions, independent of
their appointed positions and answerable to the people. So again, this
is for our Republic here, our state’s integrity. This is why it’s such
an important issue and it shouldn’t just be dealt with as a political
power play. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker? [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what
purpose does the gentleman from Mecklenburg, Representative Jeter rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative Queen would yield for a
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman from Haywood yields if the
gentleman from Mecklenburg…? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He referenced three individuals
being under investigation. Does he have some knowledge that the rest of
the world does not currently possess? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m just reading
form the ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I rest my case. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman from Haywood has the floor to continue his debate. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Does anybody else have any information they want to reveal at
the moment? Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the
gentleman from Guilford, Representative Blust rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, just to speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
has the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And I’ll try to be
brief. I really don’t want to be here Thursday afternoon debating this,
but some of the gentleman’s comments were just so over the top, it cries
out for a response. And I voted with you on the amendment. I’d rather
just not do it right now myself, but it’s being way overblown, I’ll tell
you that, and the idea that Roy Cooper, the Attorney General, is not
political, is laughable to his face, and I know him well, I graduated
law school with him, but he is a very political individual himself, and
the idea that politics does not intrude on anything is just… come on,
let’s not be naïve here. This move to some will make it less political.
I don’t know that. I guess any agency like the SPI, which will be still
serving under an elected statewide leader, the Governor, it will still
be subject to political control even with this move, so to make it some
kind dire thing where you guys are just trying to keep politics out of
it and we’re trying to inject politics in it is just not accurate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If Representative Blust will suspend, for what purpose
does the gentleman from Guilford, Representative Brandon rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To see if my good friend Representative – [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman, he yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
just wanted to know, do you think the Governor – you might no Pat
McCrory, you might know Beverly Perdue – do you think they’re political
figures?</p>

<p id="165:00">
I do. I’m not trying to pretend there’s a way that you can totally take
politics out of everything. Look at the national scene right now,
Representative Brandon. If I don’t think Eric Holder is political when
he’s appointed by the president, and is not making political decisions
on all kinds of things just like the current IRS scandal, I’m just not
that naïve. So I hate to see it overblown like this, a simple move, the
Governor is elected. The attorney general is elected. There’s no place
you could put it. I sure wouldn’t want any law enforcement type agency
out there on its own, unaccountable to nobody. There is no way to
totally isolate politics. We have to do the best we can. This is not
some dire thing that’s going to terribly change. I think a few years ago
the SBI had a whole lot of trouble and had some scandals in it, when it
was under the attorney general’s office. If you remember, go back and
check the headlines and check the stories. So I just hate to see it
overblown like this and I guess I can’t stop you from playing politics
either but investigations can go on. I’ll close by just noting there
were a lot of scandals up here five, six, seven, eight years ago. And I
didn’t see the attorney general then involved in any of this. It was all
federal officials that uncovered it and prosecuted it. So the idea that
the current attorney general’s going to throw the book at political
corruption and if this is taken from him, there’s no answer, it’s just
not accurate on its face. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does then gentleman from
Stanley, Representative Burr rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Move the previous question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Stanley
has moved the previous question. So many favoring adoption of the
previous question will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no. The clerk
will open the vote. The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote.
72 having voted in the affirmative and 42 in the negative, the previous
question is adopted. Does the minority leader wish to offer three
minutes worth of debate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Mr. Speaker. I wish to
offer three minutes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The minority leader has three
minutes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And I hope someone will put me on the clock,
make sure I use all of these three minutes. We’ve all agreed this is a
bad way to do business, yet still virtually every piece of policy we’re
bringing though here now is an omnibus bill. You have a super majority,
first of all, so the only people you have to answer to is yourselves.
And it’s almost as if you’re scared to answer to yourself. You’re saying
let me give myself an out. Let me put some good things in here so I can
do something I know should not be done this way or should not be done at
all. But I don’t want to be accountable to myself so what I’m going to
do is put it in and give myself some excuses. That’s where we are now.
I’ve said it before. Democrats can’t save you from yourself. Your own
ethics are going to come to pass. You know they say alcohol makes people
drunk but power, well power makes you drunk as well. So now you’re in a
situation where you’re continuing to violate what you know is the proper
procedure for carrying legislation through this body. I’m disappointed.
We understand you have the power. I’ve said this before. But for you to
continually violate it. Even Representative Blust, he said this is not
the way to business. But time and time again we continue to bring these
bills. This bill shouldn’t even be in this situation, where all of these
good things are being captive in a bill with a major policy that should
be debated. It should be voted on its own merits and it should not be
hidden in a bill so people will have an out for not standing up and
making a decision based on a good analysis. Again, you have the power.
You’ve chosen to use it in this way. You’ll ask why people don’t have
confidence in our institution and in our government. You have the power.
What way will you use it? Will you continue to use it this way? I think
the people deserve more and better. I know you can do better. I hope at
some point in time you’ll choose to do better. I hope you’ll oppose this
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Majority leader has up to three minutes to speak
to the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and ladies and
gentlemen of the House. What you have in this bill are some provisions
that will move the people of North Carolina forward in the right
direction. I think</p>

<p id="170:00">
look at the provisions of the bill, either individually or collectively,
I think you would come to the conclusion that this bill is a good bill.
It does a lot of good things for a lot of good people. We can debate and
argue about specific proposals, but over all I think that it is
something that moves our agenda forward. Our agenda is to provide good
government, good policies to the people of North Carolina. That's what
it does, you can vote for this bill and be proud of it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland, Rep. Glazier rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Pursuant to rule 8 for a moment of privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Moment of personal privilege.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I normally don't use this at all, but I
think there was one comment made that does affect the integrity of the
House and I do wanna speak to that. Rep. Blust, and I know this was not
ment this way, but Rep. Blust stated in the last debate that during the
scandals of the last decade the attorney general wasn't involved at all.
That's simply incorrect and fundamentally wrong. And I know that because
I, along with Rep. Stam shared in co-chair in the legislative ethics
committee during those scandals, and I had to chair the impeachment
proceedings of a representative on this side of the aisle. And the
people who did the prosecution of that were representatives in the
Attorney General's office. They worked with this body throughtout that
proceeding, and in all the years that we shared together, the
legislative ethics committee on the House side, ever time we asked the
Attorney General for assitance to prosecute members of this body, be
they Democrat of Republican, we were always accepted and they always did
the work. The Attorney General never refused to assist, and in fact
assisted in the only impeachment of a sitting member, a Democrat, in
this body. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Pages, on behalf of the House we'd like to thank you for your service
this week, you've done a wonderful job, we hope this has been a great
and rewarding experience for you. You have earned the weekend off. Thank
you for your service, glad to have you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate bill 871, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House committee substitute for Senate bill 871, a bill to entitle an act
to remove certain described property from the corporate limits of the
city of Raleigh and to add the property of the corporate limits of the
city of Durham, and to make changes to SL2013-386. General assembly of
North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Durham, Rep. Luebke has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. It's a straightforward bill, the first part is a
voluntary deannexation from the city of Raleigh, and accepting the
annexation is the city of Durham. The second part of the bill involves a
subdivision which previously had been requested to receive both water
and sewer from the city of Durham and at this point has asked that it
receive only water, the city did not initiate this, but we in the
delegation have talked with our mayor, and we are in support of this. I
urge support of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate? If not, the question before</p>
