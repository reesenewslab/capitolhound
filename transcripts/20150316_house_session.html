[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today marks the 213th anniversary of the
founding of the United States mkiliary academy at West Point. After the
Revolutionary war, several soldiers and legislators, including
Washington, Knox, Hamilton, and John Adams, desiring to eliminate
America&#39;s wartime reliance on foreign engineers and artillerists,
urged a creation of an institution devoted to the arts and sciences of
warfare. President Thomas Jefferson signed legislation establishing the
United States miliatry in 1802 after ensuring that those attending the
academy would be representative of a democratic society. Thep rayer I
offer today is a West Point prayer, as expressed by Dan Doyle. The cadet
prayer&#39;s message and its petitions are profoundly universal, moral
behavior is the force that binds us together in our relationships, both
personal and communal, and as we pray this prayer, please reflect on its
message and how we can endeavor to be humble servants and legislators.
Please pray with me. O God, our Father, Thou Searcher of human hearts,
help us to draw near to Thee in sincerity and truth. May our religion be
filled with gladness and may our worship of Thee be natural. Strengthen
and increase our admiration for honest dealing and clean thinking, and
suffer not our hatred of hypocrisy and pretense ever to diminish.
Encourage us in our endeavor to live above the common level of life.
Make us to choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong, and
never to be content with a half truth when the whole can be won. Endow
us with courage that is born of loyalty to all that is noble and worthy,
that scorns to compromise with vice and injustice and knows no fear when
truth and right are in jeopardy. Guard us against flippancy and
irreverence in the sacred things of life. Grant us new ties of
friendship and new opportunities of service. Kindle our hearts in
fellowship with those of a cheerful countenance, and soften our hearts
with sympathy for those who sorrow and suffer. Help us to maintain the
honor of the Corps untarnished and unsullied and to show forth in our
lives the ideals of West Point in doing our duty to Thee and to our
Country. All of which we ask in the name of the Great Friend and Master
of all. AMEN
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

Representatives Riddell and Ross, House Bill 58, a bill to be entitled
an act to provide that the Alamance County Sheriff&#39;s Office may
contract for the purchase of food and supplies for the county&#39;s
detention facilities without being subject to the requirements of
certain state purchasing and contract laws. The General Assembly of
North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Alamance, Representative
Riddell, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill. The House will come to
order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Friends, you may remember this bill from last week, it is a bill simply
to allow local flexibility for our local detention facilities in 12
counties, something which every school district in North Carolina
currently is unable to do, and of course the bill took the long way
around the barn last week but it did end second reading with 94 votes
and I would encourage you to give it that same level of support as we go
on with it here tonight. I see that there is an amendment, that I will
be asking you to defeat, that will be brought forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham, Representative Hall,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Send forward that amendment that the member wanted to be defeated.

The gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment, the clerk will

through nine, by deleting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Durham is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I appreciate Representative Riddell&#39;s
work with me last week. We had an opportunity to discuss the bill and
some of the inadequacies that I thought were in the bill as far as
providing guidance to our local sheriffs who would have this authority.
As you see, the amendment does two things, it puts the idea or the
concept of competition back into the bill that says there will be
competition and it defines the area and restricts

  bids to vendors within the county in which the sheriff is elected. Now,
we know that everyone had a good intention of saying we&#39;re going to
have a bill that would require the sheriff to get local produce and
other products locally, presumably locally grown or produced, and used
in the jail system. But that is not what the bill does in its current
form unfortunately. As you look at the bill, it really doesn&#39;t have
any definition of what local means and that&#39;s something that the
member and I discussed. We don&#39;t have a definition in state
contracting law that has the word local as a definitive measure. The
closest thing we have, and I got a email from the Division of Purchasing
and Contracting, says their is no definition for local in terms of
purchasing, there is a definition for resident bidder, but no definition
for local. As a result, what this bill really does is say there will be
no competition and the sheriff, at his discretion, does not have to have
any bid but can contract for this food from anywhere he wants to. Now,
you might say, &quot;Well we know our local sheriff, the current one we
have, we all trust him and he&#39;s been vetted, he&#39;s experienced,
and he&#39;ll do a great job to ensure we get local produce, etc, for
our community,&quot; but this bill is for all of the state,
everybody&#39;s sheriff, whether you know them personally or not and,
going forward, what we&#39;re trying to do is ensure that competition is
still there and local produce manufacturers benefit from the bill. So I
know folks voted in favor of the bill previously, I would hope you would
support this amendment so your intent can be carried out in this bill as
it goes forward, if your intent was for the local sheriff to use local
providers in the jail system, this bill will do that. If your intent is
to ensure the best price is also acquired, this bill will do that with
this amendment. So again, I&#39;d ask the same folks who voted for the
bill with that intent, vote for this amendment, which will in effect
make that happen. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Randolph, Representative
McNeill, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentleman, the last thing I wanted to do is be standing up
tonight to talk more about this amendment and about this bill but I feel
like I must. Although he seemed to be well-intentioned with the
amendment, I think it actually does more harm to the bill than it does
good. Now, the food that is purchased in a jail is perishable, it&#39;s
mean to be consumable. You don&#39;t want to buy your milk from Texas
because you can get it 50 cents a carton cheaper, or your eggs,
there&#39;s a lot of things you want to buy local. Your canned green
beans, you might want to get them from somewhere else because they are
all going to be of the same quality. It seems to me that this is
restricting, the language in this amendment is restricting the bill so
that the sheriff can only buy local, when other, maybe some counties, I
know there were two smaller counties that were listed on this bill,
Pamlico and Anson, there may be some of the smaller counties that are
listed on this bill that can&#39;t find things locally. And if
they&#39;re restricted to buying things locally, then you&#39;ve
actually made this bill a lot worse than what was intended. If you look
at the original bill, nowhere does it say &quot;buy local.&quot; It just
is a simple bill that said allow the sheriff to not be required to be
bound by G.S. 143-129 and G.S. 143-131, and because there was some
consideration that maybe that might jeopardize minority vendors, you
actually amended the bill to take care of that. This amendment makes it
more restrictive and I think it hurts the bill. I think we just need to
vote this amendment down, pass the bill, and move on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the lady from Wake, Representative Holley, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

  buy North Carolina products, or anywhere in the state. And it&#39;s more
than adequate. And when you send a bid to put something out on bid, the
state vendors get a 5% discount or $10,000, whichever one is less. Now,
if you&#39;re local and you can&#39;t sell your produce or what you have
for less than what you can if it was bidded, then there&#39;s no reason
for this bill at all. Nor for this amendment. The other problem that I
have with it is that it is also limiting in the ways of--this bill does
not say it&#39;s for local produce, and it says &quot;food
supplies.&quot; What is that? Is that refrigeration? Is that equipment?
Is that forks? Is that spoons? What do you call food supplies? The state
government already has existing contracts that they can buy off of to
get the supplies and the things that are needed. This is more than about
food. This is just bypassing a bill, and adding a local piece on it
doesn&#39;t help it at all.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you. For what purpose does the gentleman from Nash, Representative
Collins, rise?
SPEAKER CHANGES
To debate the amendment.
SPEAKER CHANGES
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
SPEAKER CHANGES
I think probably the worst thing we could do would be to define who
these folks can buy from by county line. We have a lot of farms in the
part of the state I&#39;m from, and farms don&#39;t know county lines.
Farms cross county lines. Farmers lease fields that are in multiple
counties. Most of them are pretty big farmers by now. I don&#39;t know
how you&#39;d possibly enforce this. Let&#39;s vote this amendment down.
Dividing it up by county line makes no sense and I think would be
unenforceable.
SPEAKER CHANGES
For what purpose does the gentleman from Alamance, Representative Ross,
rise?
SPEAKER CHANGES
To debate the amendment.
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, in Alamance County over the past few
years, locally grown food has become big. Many of you that are from the
central part of the state are familiar with Weaver Street Market in
Hillsboro, which is in Orange County. We have a co-op in Burlington, the
Burlington Co-Op, that works closely with Weaver Street and Orange
County. A lot of our local food may be grown--if you&#39;re familiar
with where Alamance County is, and the geography of Alamance County--a
lot of our local food may come from Caswell County, which by the way is
a Tier One county. Local food could come from Rockingham County.
It&#39;s more of a regional reach for our local food, the food that goes
into this market. Some of it comes from Orange County, some of it comes
from Chatham County. To restrict this to within the county line of
Alamance would defeat the purpose of what we&#39;re trying to do here.
So I ask you to defeat the amendment.
SPEAKER CHANGES
For what purpose does the gentleman from Alamance, Representative
Riddell, rise?
SPEAKER CHANGES
To urge the defeat of the amendment.
SPEAKER CHANGES
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment a second time.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, you&#39;ve probably all
heard about the terrible crime spree sweeping North Carolina, where
school districts who do not have a convenient definition of
&quot;local&quot; in their local purchase of their local food, have
operated somehow beyond the law. Or in a manner that is on the
razor&#39;s edge of the law. Don&#39;t forget: Every single school
district in North Carolina has operated under their existing exemption
of buying local without the suggested definition of &quot;local&quot; in
the amendment sponsored by my friend, Representative Hall. As he said,
we did have a long conversation about this, a very cordial conversation.
I believe I do understand the gentleman&#39;s intentions. But it is
completely unnecessary. There is no crime spree by our local school
districts in the purchase of food locally. We don&#39;t need to define
&quot;local.&quot; We might as well define what the definition of
&quot;is&quot; is while we&#39;re at it. Let&#39;s keep local money in
our local economies. When it comes to this amendment, I would ask you to
defeat the amendment. Folks, buy local, think local, and vote local.
Thank you.

For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham, Representative Hall,
rise?

SPEAKER CHANGES
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment a second time.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And again, for those folks who voted in favor of
this bill with the intent of having local producers and providers get
the business, this is the amendment you want to support. If you look at
your calendar tonight, and we took great pains to create the illusion
that we thought this was going to be a local bill in those 12 counties.
But if you look at your calendar tonight, House Bill 236 has been
introduced. It&#39;s going to provide at least six more counties. And
you can imagine, once it goes to the Senate, someone&#39;s going to say
for the sake of legislative economy, let&#39;s just

  <p id="25:00">
  combine the two bills, now it&#39;s a statewide bill, so what you&#39;re
voting on is really statewide and we appreciate, once again, those of
you who have sheriff&#39;s that know that they would do the right thing
that was intended in this bill. But what you&#39;re getting ready to do
is provide the predicate for a statewide bill that will say the sheriff
can buy from wherever he wants, from whoever he wants, without any
competition and therefore no real benefit, necessarily, to the local
economy or local producers. Now again, this is optional, the sheriff
does not have to do that. What&#39;s the difference between a sheriff
and a school board? What&#39;s the difference between a school board
with all the members of the school board reviewing contracts and a
superintendent and all those folks involved in the decision making
process and the sheriff, who this bill says can go ahead and contract? A
great difference, obviously. So again, this is, in effect, the predicate
for a statewide bill, let&#39;s face it and be realistic about it. We
have, right on the calendar tonight, the additional six bills that takes
it over the limit, they&#39;re going to the Senate, you know what&#39;s
going to happen. So let&#39;s be responsible about what we do. If our
real intent is to provide opportunity for local folks, let&#39;s make
that clear and direct the sheriff to do it. If you don&#39;t like the
definition given &quot;local&quot; here, and say you want it to be tier
one counties, then you&#39;ve got an obligation to amend it. But to say
we&#39;re going to send this bill out of here and we know it&#39;s
defective and does not achieve what we talked about we wanted it to do
is really a farce by us and we should not do that. We should either vote
this amendment in or, if you have an amendment that does what the intent
is supposed to do to ensure local competition and opportunity, then put
it on the floor and let us vote it. But to send this bill out of here
without any direction and just say &quot;sheriffs can avoid the
contracting laws and and competition,&quot; is not the right thing to
do. So I&#39;d ask for you to vote for the amendment and let&#39;s get
this bill right before it goes to the Senate and it has an additional
bill coming behind it with six more counties.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the amendment. If not, the
question before the House is the passage of amendment four offered by
Representative Hall to the House Committee Substitute for House Bill 58.
So many favoring adoption of the amendment will vote aye, those opposed
will vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock the
machine and record the vote, 37 having voted in the affirmative and 73
in the negative, the amendment fails. We&#39;re now back on discussion
on the bill, further discussion, further debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham, Representative Michaux,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak ont he bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Very simply, what we are doing now is we are going to sole-source
contracting. It&#39;s just that simple. The sheriff has the authority
not to buy food and food service supplies, whatever they may be, from a
sole-source contract. That&#39;s what you want to do? Fine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate? For what purpose does the other
gentleman from Durham, Representative Hall, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and to make one last reminder to the body.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It appears we&#39;re going to go ahead and
create this statewide bill, in effect, that&#39;s going to take away the
opportunity for market forces to work and that now we decide we&#39;re
going to pick winners and losers by designating the sheriff in each
county to be the one who solely picks the winners and losers. And so, if
the average term of a sheriff is twelve years, for twelve years I&#39;m
good with my contract. I don&#39;t have to improve my services as long
as I&#39;m good with the sheriff I&#39;ve got that contract for twelve
years and everyone else who would provide a better service or a better
contract for the county and the tax payers will not get that
opportunity. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s consistent with what our
values are here in this chamber. I don&#39;t think that was the intent
when this bill was explained and how it was explained to us. I think
that&#39;s what the effect of it will be if you vote for it. I ask that
you vote against it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate. If not, the question before the
House is the passage of the House Committee Substitute to House Bill 58

To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, this bill came across our desks last session, we
passed it 109 to 2. It&#39;s a fix from a 1995 bill that, instead of
saying &quot;this bill is effective for all felonies committed on or
after December 1st, 1995,&quot; what they put in there was &quot;for all
felonies before, on, or after,&quot; which really is ex post factor and
it took away the rights from a lot of people. This fixes that error.
Again, it breezed through here and went into the Senate, made it through
all the Senate committees, the only reason it didn&#39;t pass the Senate
is because, at that time, they added on some stuff which ended up
killing the bill. That stuff&#39;s not in here. This is the original
bill, same one we passed, let&#39;s fix this and make it fair. I ask you
to support this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
