<p id="00:00">
Let's go ahead and get started this morning. Sorry for scaring my clerk
on that one. All right, let me first introduce. We have our Senate
pages, we have Keegan Hines, we have Sarah Wilson, Andrew Smith, Malisia
Mills and Keyanna Brower. Thank you very much for being here and our
sergeants at arms are Robert Young, Steve Wilson and Billy Fritcher.
Thank you. We have two bills on the calendar today. We're going to
switch the order for expediency and we're going to allow Senate Bill 168
to come up first with Senator Tucker so Senator Tucker please explain
this. I think we're going to need a motion for a PCS is that correct. We
have a motion from Senator Pate. All in favor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed. The PCS is now before us. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] ?? I attended the Hunt Education Seminar a couple of years ago
and at that seminar Dr., the head of DPI was there and she talked about
the fact that they had a lot of reports that the legislature required of
them that were unnecessary and I asked her, I asked Dr. Atkins, I'm a
young legislator here, I mean a new legislator, not young, and I'll be
glad to run a bill for you and so this is a result of that discussion
with her and her staff and so what this bill does is it adds some
technical language in and takes away a lot of bills that are unnecessary
that have been replaced by the federal guidelines which we are under now
in certain cases such as nutrition, those kind of things, so it
eliminates those kinds of reports to DPI. I also asked her that if we
eliminate these reports would that also eliminate a job and she said no
it would not, so I don't know what this individual that's been keeping
up with these reports will do after this bill goes through and becomes
law but we'll see about that. So that's basically what has been done.
There are some initiatives here that have been technically changed by
staff to update them and put some more teeth into them and then
eliminate some of those there so without further ado, Mr. Chairman, I
presented this bill, I'll be glad to answer any questions. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Do we have any questions from the members. Senator Robinson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, thank you Mr. Chair and thank you Senator Tucker
because I did hear the same thing from them in terms of the kind of
paperwork we require. The only question I have and I think it's good is
where it just under personal education plans it says the state board
shall periodically review data on the progress of identified students
and report to us, now does that mean that I don't want the report but
they're still going to review that data themselves in house, aren't
they. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That's right and as you well know that's done on
the local level as well, the plan report. My daughter in law's a 4th
grade teacher and she has 18 students in her class and she has to do
those plans that are performed and then that information is transitioned
to DPI, and so I just want to make sure I'm correct. Yes, that's
correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Senator Pate. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. On part 5 which begins on page 3 I didn't hear you
mention anything about that licensure. Are there any changes to the
licensure process as a result of this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll ask
staff to answer that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Go ahead. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Pate the majority of the reworking of this statute is just to
make it more readable. It's currently written sort of like War and
Peace, it's just a long narrative so it breaks it up into more
subsections but the only new part of it is on page 5 under b1 1 and it
adds j, which is line 31 on page 5, this was a request from state
department of public instruction that in the report that they are
required to produce the schools of ed, that they include information on
the effectiveness of their teacher education program graduates and then
on page 6 lines 12-16, which is a new subsection 5 it just, let me make
sure</p>

I said that right. I’m sorry, it’s again on page 5 beginning at line 50.
Near Sub Section 3. This educator preparation program report card. That
was a request from the state department of public instruction. They had
to create this for race to the top. They wanted it added they would also
report this to the general assembly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. At the appropriate time I would like to be
recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Any questions from members? Any comments from the public?
Yes, please state your name and remember to please keep your comments to
two minutes and under please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My name is Chris Hill. I’m the Director of the Educational Law Project
in the North Carolina Justice Center. I’d just like to say that it would
be important for us to keep the records and have them sent to DPI for
the personal education plan. The legislation had been strengthened in
the last two years. In the excellent public schools act, it’s a major
part. It would be wise to collect the information statewide to see what
is successful, and what is working with the program. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr Chair? Mr Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chris came to see me about this. Of course, he had some excellent points
on it. I reviewed it with staff. Staff can answer that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The PEPs would still be in place and LAA’s would still have it certified
if they complied with the section annually to the state board. The
requirement in statute that the state board would record the data and
report to at oversight is what is deleted. The state board could of
course continue to review the data as they saw fit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The data is still available Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Great. Thank you. Senator Robinson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a follow up to that, and thank you Mr. Chair. That’s was  kind of
what I was getting at, that the data would be collected. That it would
be somewhere. Mr. Chair, I’m assuming that periodically we can request a
copy of that report as well to an oversight if we wanted to review that
and keep up with what is going on?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma’am. You are a senator. You can request that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. No further questions. Senator Pate is recognized for a
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Mr. Chairman. I move that we give a favorable report to the
proposed committee substitute to Senate Bill 168 unfavorable to the
original bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without further discussion, we have a motion on the floor. All in favor?
Opposed? The ayes have it. We have favorable report to the PCS and an
unfavorable report to the original bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair, and committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. I’m going to hand the chair over to Senator Tillman
as I’m presenting the next bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Souchek if you would come forward to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. This is Senate Bill 119. It’s one of the bills that
came out of our digital learning environment study committee that we had
during the interim. What this is doing is…There were several requests
during the process for schools who had capital funding through the
lottery. They’ve requested some flexibility to be able to spend that
towards a digital learning environment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Souchek? You have a PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m sorry. Yes, we have a PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have a motion to adopt? I have a motion Senator Robinson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, thank you. Sorry. This was going back to the idea of… The basic
concept of that when you build a school. You put power, you put
electrical, you put all these things and that’s part of the capital
funding. We see the digital learning environment, the infrastructure, as
as critical to the learning environment now as those basic utilities.
Also, beyond that it doesn’t go just to that, but goes to some of the
purchase of the devices and even training as well. The material that you
put on the devices. This is the material we had and we’re moving forward
with. Now, there is a slight change as we realized how this was working
staff brought our attention to something that changes something beyond
what the original scope was. I think you’ll agree, it is an important
change. There are two different funding, ways of funding for capital
funds. You have the corporate income tax, or mostly people consider the
ADM funding, which comes down as for capital funding and currently can
be used for digital learning. Now, we have the lottery money which comes
down which is restricted to…</p>

<p id="10:00">
capital funding. So as we're looking at opening up the capital funding
from the lottery to give the use for digital learning we realized
instead of having two sources with two slightly different rules we
thought that would be inefficient and confusing. So we want to combine
those two so that both sources of capital funding would have that
flexibility under one set of rules so it would come into one pot with
one rule rather than one pot with two different rules depending on the
source. So it's a slight change to that but we thought that that was an
important part of the PCS and that is how the bill stands. Do you have
any questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Senator Soucek I like what
you're trying to do. I do have one a concern though. I don't know that
there's a county in the state right now that isn't struggling with
capital needs as far as schools go. And as far as lottery dollars go
we've cut those back in the past few years which I think has put more
and more pressure on the locals to find those dollars. I know a lot of
counties have passed bond referendums and are using lottery proceeds to
pay back some of those bonds. I just have a little bit of a concern of
where this is going. Personally I think all the lottery money ought to
go to capital needs. That's just my personal opinion because the needs
are so great out there and it's putting a huge burden on the counties.
We're seeing school boards suing counties because counties aren't
willing to raise taxes to satisfy the school boards for capital needs.
It's just a mess in my opinion on what's happening with capital needs.
That's the concern I have with the bill. I think it just puts a little
more pressure on county commissioners trying to figure out what they're
gonna do with capital needs in the counties. My county's going through
this problem right now. We've got a we passed a bond referendum a few
years ago of $75 million. Now the school board's back asking for
another, you know, referendum. So it's just a real concern I have. I
don't think those needs are gonna get any less. I think they're gonna
get worse. I think counties are truly struggling in this economy
especially with values going down on ?? Buyouts that are happening
because of  our housing issues. It's just a serious concern and it's
something I think we might want to consider.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You may respond.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. And I do that is I'm glad you brought that
concern up because of what we are doing is by giving more flexibility it
creates another burden on the county commissioner's burden. Before
someone says we want to buy iPads, no we're restricted from doing that.
Now they have to say no and then give a reasons so it does create a
little bit more burden on them. But I will say on the one hand it is an
optional thing. So when a school system is burdened with a capital need
they can put all of it toward the capital. There's no requirement
whatsoever to do any digital technology. I will say that there were
school systems that came to us and they said we have we don't have a
population growth with our school system and our capital needs are
sufficient we would like to have this flexibility. Our hope is to create
the flexibility for the school systems that need it, but the majority
that don't it won't have any change for them. That was our thinking
behind this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The idea has come up and probably you'll see
legislation file Senator Brown that will have that all the lottery money
devoted to school construction and if you don't need it there put it
into the digital. That bill's not been filed yet but it's been mulling
around in the back of several heads including my own. But this one is
permissive Soucek, Senator Soucek. Am I right, you're not requiring or
mandating this are you in your bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No absolutely it just creates the option.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A number of hands over here. I think I saw Senator
Newton first.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair and Senator Soucek. I have a
similar concern as Senator Brown has raised and know that for example in
Johnston County is now part of my district they're quite extended on
bonds because of their high growth. They've had to build many many
schools a lot faster than most districts would have to. And so I have
similar concerns and I want to make sure I understand it because I'm not
sure I'm clear in reading it on the fly here. I haven't had a chance to
read it before today. I admit that I haven't done my homework. Who would
make this determination the school board or the county about whether or
not these funds would be devoted to digital learning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe it's the county but let me ask staff to make
sure I have my facts correct.</p>

It would be at the request of the LEA, to the County Board. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir, follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
And if I may direct this to staff, just to be sure I understand their
answer. The LEA would request that the determination be made by the
County Commission? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I think that’s all. Senator Allran next and then we’ve got
Bryant and then I’ve got Robinson. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I see
that this bill is, just allows flexibility and I feel like that’s got to
be a pretty good thing. But I would just like to make the general
comment, is that it seems like the state legislature and maybe people in
general, have this assumption that everything that is digital makes
students learn more. And I just doubt that whole basic premise. I had
some students come visit me last week, the smartest and best and
brightest in my district, and they sat in front of me as I stood there
upstairs and they were, talked about how why did I vote for that bill to
make everything, what was that bill? Whatever we did, make everything
digital. It was unanimous. The vote was. So why did you do that? So I
asked them whether or not they liked having everything digital and they
said no. Then they gave all the reasons for why they would rather have
books than computers. One after another after another. I asked them, and
I thought we don’t ever ask these kids what they think. Yeah. [LAUGHTER]
Well the point should be obvious, quite frankly Mr. Chairman, the point
is you’re assuming that going digital makes children learn more and my
point is I don’t think that should be assumed. Books have a lot of
advantages over iPads. A lot. And a lot of kids think so. Now they did
come up with one point and that was computers are lighter. And I agree
with that. You don’t have to lug the books around. But other than that,
they couldn’t figure out much that was better about a computer. And one
other thing. I just think that we need to start having some
accountability to show that we’re at least saving money or something, by
going digital. I mean, or is it saving money or is it costing the state
more money to do all of this and if it is, it’s not money well spent
necessarily. We also need to find out whether or not the students
actually learn more nowadays. I doubt it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re
speaking for the bill or against it? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The bill’s
probably okay but I do have this issue and it’s the Education Committee
and we’ve only got two bills on here today so I thought I would raise
it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re just taking up time. I tell you what.
They’ve never helped me either, computers. I didn’t have television
until I was your age. [LAUGHTER] and they didn’t help you either because
you and I ?? are behind on this. But you make a great point. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Are you sure? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. I don’t know what it is
but it was a great point, seriously. I’m having fun. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could I comment on that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe that’d be dangerous
but go ahead. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Allran, ?? I saw two schools.
One where I thought this dynamic was occurring. Really outstanding. And
I saw one where I talked to the students and said how is that laptop
working for you and he goes, “I rarely take it out of my locker.” And so
I think what that says is something that you mentioned which is
absolutely correct is that putting technology in someone’s hand costs a
lot of money and doesn’t do anything. Putting it in the hand with a
school system and teachers and principal and parents that have bought
into and are engaged in the system and the advantages to it can have
tremendous input. And so I think that it’s really critical that we
remember the training piece and the environment piece, that it’s not
just having a textbook on a computer, but changing the entire dynamic
from a teacher in front of the classroom, being taught at, to an
individual learning platform for each student. And one of the things we
do have in the bill is a requirement as you’re spending this money for
digital learning, that you have a requirement to teach and instruct the
instructors on how to use that equipment. Not just give it to them and
hope they figure it out in a beneficial way. So we’re real cognizant
about using this in a real beneficial way rather than just throwing it
out and having some negative effects that could possibly happen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant, I have you next and I have Senator
Robinson next. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. I was wanting to
ask the sponsor and/or the staff about ??</p>

sections E, section E I was trying to understand from July 13th through
the 16th you can use the money for digital learning needs but you must
use a portion for professional development and then after that only if
the state board determines that you have demonstrated improvement or
something, could somebody help me understand how that’s going to work
and your thinking behind that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ll give a quick explanation and then I’ll allow staff to elaborate.
This goes to the point I made just earlier, is that we don’t want to
just hand this out. We want to make sure that the LEAs understand how
important it is to have a professional development along with it. So, we
utilize all these devices for maximum benefit and it’s also saying we
want to put a little condition on it. Let’s move forward with this, this
it isn’t some definite thing but a little bit of a trial, some
constraints on it so that we’re ensuring this is being used in a wise
way. Staff, do you have?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that’s right just based on what the committee wanted to do, the
study committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK. I just wanted to make a comment, if that’s ok?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. I have the same concern as Senator Brown and I think
Senator Newton have expressed in that our local counties were very
insistent on encouraging us to do everything we could to protect and, if
we could, increase the amount of the lottery proceeds that were
available to them for capital expenditures and not to continue to chip
away at it for other purposes. And, I do think we need to find some
dedicated funding for the technology needs in our schools and I worry
too about this professional development, even though it’s needed, where
many of our schools are already involved in these ?? projects and other
kind of technology projects and may have already launched themselves
into professional development expenditures. So, I worry if it wouldn’t
be, if the lottery bill isn’t too much of a big umbrella for this and
that it maybe should be in some other funding component where there can
be a plan with somebody who can administer a plan and then tailor it to
what the individual districts would need given where they are. Because I
understand your point that there may be some districts who don’t have
the capital needs but they do have these needs and they could spend
their money and I just worry that this mechanism may not be the best
mechanism, so that would just be my comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Soucek?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do. These are very valid concerns and these are the things that we
discussed during the committee because if you take one source of money,
although we’re not splitting it up and being used differently we’re just
giving more flexibility, there is the idea of are we funding digital
through the lottery money at exclusion of maybe having it from somewhere
else, so you kind of are spending it differently. I’ll tell you the
intention here was a short term fix, that’s one reason why we have the
dates here, allowing counties to have the flexibility to start moving
that direction. Our intention is to be funding digital learning outside
of the lottery, that this is just a small step towards that but this
isn’t the conclusion where we’re going to start to using lottery funds
for this and then not having additional funding sources.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Soucek, well Senator Robinson let’s hear from you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ll make it real quick Mr. Chair, I know you want to move on, but I
wanted to echo some of what I heard, but also to say that the digital
learning certainly is important but I think having people to make
choices out of the same pot of money when we have the same kind of
capital issues in Guilford county as well too, and we’re a large county,
but if we have those I can imagine what’s going on in terms of baying
the bonds, et cetera, in the other counties as well too so if we’re
going to mandate digital learning and teacher preparation then we ought
to be looking at some other sources of funding for that as opposed to
making counties pull out of what they have and they already need it,
unless those who aren’t using it you know can make that choice.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Very good. Senator Wade, I believe this is going to be the last one we
need to take then we’ll see what we want to do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Soucek, thank you Mr. Chairman, I had the same concern that
Senator Bryant had also but my question is more, first off I wanted to
commend you on your hard work here and I think it’s definitely the way
of the future and I think we definitely need training for teachers in
this field knowing how to train students because usually the students
know more than the teachers by the time we get there with computers.
But, my question is, is there a percentage of…</p>

<p id="25:00">
Amount of money that can be used on teacher training versus what
actually is used, what I consider capital computers, wiring, being able
to put smart boards in. I mean, do we have a cap on it because what
might happen is we might get this money sent over and we use it all for
teacher training instead of any for capital needs cause I could see that
happening in my area but I didn't know how you were going to address
that although I think teachers need the training. I just didn't know
that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff, is there a maximum on that? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I'm not sure I'm following your question but the bill just
states that if the county uses the money for digital learning needs then
they have to require some of those funds to also be for professional
development so the professional development is not required unless they
use those bills and Brian Nissen from fiscal is here, he may have
something to add to that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] But if they get the funds
can they then instead of using them to buy computers or whatever just
use them for professional development if they've been granted the funds
and they say they choose to use those funds. I didn't see anything in
there that said you couldn't use all the funds for teacher development
instead. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Soucek, I believe the intent was that
that would be computer training for the teachers that would be in the
new digital devices that they would be getting and it would not be set
aside for other staff development. It may have nothing to do with it.
But now that intent is one thing and what's written in the bill is
another. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That's definitely our intent but I want to
make sure that we haven't left room to be able to misuse beyond our
intent. Staff is looking at that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] On page 3 line 16-17
digital learning needs is defined including school connectivity, digital
textbooks, and instructional resources and digital devices in local
school administrative units and because that's a defined term, if
counties are using money for those purposes, they would also be required
to use a portion of the funds for professional development. For
teachers, for digital learning. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. That
halfway clears it up. Senator Wade follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] But may
they use all the money for professional development - if digital
learning needs - I see the definition but instructional resources could
mean anything but besides that it also says you could also use a portion
of the funds to ensure high-quality, on-going, digital learning
professional development for teachers. Well, what's a portion of the
funds? All the funds? 10%? 50%? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No, the portion is not
defined. It's discretionary. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It's discretionary
related to the money that's been used for the digital learning
environment. You couldn't use it for something outside of the digital
learning which is defined in bill and it would be discretion as to how
much you use towards that portion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] But the question
was, could you use totally what you get? Suppose your computer - you got
all the hardware and all the computer - you still need the training. If
they wanted to according to what I'm thinking they could take all of
what they requested and get it to do the training for the teachers. I
think that was the question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll tell you what I see
stops us. If this will address this and a bunch of things. Senator
Robinson mentioned a mandate and I think that that was a word that we
need to be careful about using with this bill because it really isn't an
option. We have to remember that these are adults, these are elected
officials and these are leaders. What leaders do is leaders make
difficult decisions. They've given options - they're not forced into
something. That's not leadership, that's administration. We're giving
them the option so they can say &quot;Here is what's best used in our
community.&quot; We're elected leaders in this community to do the best
we can. We're giving them the tools to be able to do that. We're coming
up with scenarios on how someone could misuse it. There's accountability
in elective system and these are elected leaders and I expect them to
act appropriately in the best interest of their children so when we come
up with a system of how it could be misused I think that we're not
giving enough credit to our elected leaders in the counties. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Alright I'm gonna take 2 more. I'm going to take Senator Newton
and Senator Barringer. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd like to address - [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I've got Senator Newton first and if you hold it, we'll go back
to that. Senator Newton. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman and
I'll try to be quick and this kind of goes back to the heart of the
first question that I asked because I appreciate Senator Wade's
questions and I'm not trying to nitpick this bill. I think the heart of
what we're trying to do is the right direction. We just need to make
sure we have the right safe guards in place this is going to be
administered correctly. And this question about a portion and line 11 on
page 3</p>

shall also use a portion of the funds to ensure high quality ongoing
digital learning professional development for teachers. So it mandates
that some part of it shall be used for that and how much is that because
it's up in the air and this goes back to my original question, who makes
that decision? I'm concerned, and that is my question, I'm concerned
about the interplay between the county commission and the schoolboard.
I'm certainly familiar with schoolboards who like to devote money to
spend things in certain directions where the county commission is not
ready to spend money in those directions and if it's considerably left
to a schoolboard who may not have the right motivation, they may direct
lots of moneys towards teacher development that they ought to be
spending other funds on and then going back again to the county
commission and saying &quot;Well we need more of these lottery moneys to
do digital learning&quot; when the county commission wants to be
spending it on capital or bond servicing servicing their debt. So I
think we're going - the intent here is right, I just think we need to
make sure we've got the right controls on this. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good
point. Senator Barringer you wanted a question for the staff here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The hat I'm wearing now is I've spent 25 to maybe 30
years being a lawyer looking at tax statutes mostly but lots of statutes
trying to figure out how to do the best for my clients so if I were
representing the folks who wanted to spend as much money as I could on
teacher development and as little money on hardware, the way I'm reading
this statute is that I have to spend something on the hardware, on the
digital learning needs. Something. Maybe 1%, 2%, 3%, I can't do 0. But I
could then do the lion's share. So it wouldn't be 100%, Senator Wade,
but I could as if I were that kind - if that's who I was representing,
that's where it would be. So you'd be technically correct within the
statute to buy just a few things and then spend a lot on the learning
part. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Point's well taken. I want to make a comment
here. I'm seeing two things. One, we may not be ready to vote today on
this bill cause I see a split vote at best and I do see that need for a
little work on this bill. Now Senator, it's your bill but, if you don't
mind, I would suggest we pull this bill back and do a little small
committee work and see if we can't get some understanding. What bothers
me is that you could take all of the money that you wanted to request
and none for building and say &quot;I want to do the whole school with
computers and training for my teachers.&quot; You could do that. LEA
wants to do that. You wouldn't have to take any for capital and you're
not mandated to do anything but it's opened the door for this is not
just construction anymore. It is other things. And then other things can
lead down the road. Senator, I know your intent is good and I'm going to
ask that we pull this back and have a small committee to take a look at
it. Senator Newton and Senator Barringer and Senator Robinson, would you
three work on this bill a little bit with Senator Soucek? And see if we
can't get some of these questions resolved before we have a vote and if
you feel good, we'll bring it back up. We've got time. Senator? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I'd like to make it clear. I actually support this because I
like maximum flexibility. I was just translating the result of what's
written here so if we were voting today I would vote positive because I
like flexibility but I'll be glad to service you if we could help
tighten this up some. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, I definitely
support that. I think that the good concern that has been brought up is
that you have an authorizing authority and an executing authority which
may not be in sync and you can allow something to be authorized and then
not accountability on how it's executed and I think that putting some
restraints on that so it fills our intent would be a good amendment we
could work on. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That's good and we've not heard from
the county commissioners on this and they won't totally be in love with
it, I can tell you that. But they'll do whatever we do but let's make
sure we've got a little clearer path and some more clarifying
information here. The best classroom you'll ever have, and I'll say this
again Austin, is a good teacher whether you're using books or whatever.
A creative teacher who loves teaching and loves children. And if we ever
try to do it without the teacher? My grandkids would rather get in my
lap with a book than a computer. They love a computer but not when it's
storytime. They always bring me a book. Well, they know better than to
bring me a computer to start with. But my wife is very good with both.
When they crawl in her lap? Austin and I were raised up hard, we didn't
have anything. Oatmeal, cornmeal and ?? meal. Anyway, let's do that and
you call get together Senator Soucek</p>
