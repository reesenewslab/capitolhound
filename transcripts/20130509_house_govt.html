Good Morning. Welcome to the house committee on government. Ladies and
gentlemen we have a pretty good agenda and the time is ticking so we've
got a lot to cover in the next two hours. Introduction of seargant of
arms: Young Bay, Bob Ralsey, Joe Cook, Crock and Mr. Powell. There we
go. Introduction of pages. Sac Dalson, Dobson, from Avey county
sponsored by representative Dobson. Corey Lewis from Wake county
sponsored by representative Tillis; Albrey Sugars from Wake county
sponsored by representative Floyd; and India Furchers, I hope I got that
right, Purchase from Davidson county sponsored by representative Brown.
Thank you for your help and participation today.
Ladies and gentlemen, some of these bills will have some speakers from
the audience, the rules will be two minutes from each one, we'll ask
that you please stay within those guidelines as we move forward. Today's
first bill up will be house bill 274, taxpayer bill of rights.
Representative Blust.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman and members of the house, of the government
committee, I hope you'll bear with me, I'm mighty sick today, and my
voice isn't what it should be. But this is an idea that the Taber, it's
also been known as the taxpayer protection act, it's  been around
probably for twenty-some years. A version of this passed the house in
1995 with over 90 votes, it had bipartisan support. So it is something a
lot of members are familiar with. Basically, the bill will cap the
growth of state spending at the rate of inflation plus population
growth. That's the genesis of the bill. Revenue above the amount that
might come in above the expenditure limit, set up by this bill, goes
into an emergency reserve trust fund, and that can only be tapped with a
two thirds vote of the house. And that can be tapped in case of
hurricanes, or some sort of emergency along those lines. There's also a
provision in the bill that the director of the budget can take funds
from the account, if the revenues coming in in a year don't meet the
budgeted expenditures; he can do that without a vote of the legislature,
but that would be only after the legislature had appropriated, let's say
the legislature appropriates 20 billion in a year, the revenue, we have
a horrible economy and the revenue comes in at 19 billion, the budget
director could take a billion to meet the budgeted revenue, and that
would not take an additional vote to use the funds for that purpose. It
is a constitutional amendment, that is because if we did it simply by
statute, a legislature that was inclined to increase spending more than
the limit, could simply repeal the law and get away with it that way, so
we need strong constitutional protections, and one reason is if you'll
review just recent history, within the last twenty years, we've had
three budget emergencies, the latest being probably the worst, and each
time the genesis has been the same. We had good years, we had the fat
years where we spent the whole thing, I can remember ads, I can't
believe they spent the whole thing. Back in the nineties, then in we had
an emergency in '92 and '93, then in 2001 the same thing played out in
the middle and late nineties we had billion dollar increases in spending
which raised our baseline. Then in the mid-2000's we did the same thing
and in 2008 with the economic downturn we had an emergency, and there's
been analysis that showed, had we had the caps in place, we would have
had sufficient revenue to meet the expenditure needs, we would have just
had to budget more carefully.
With that I'll close and answer any</p>

<p id="005:00">
co sponsor burt jones here, i will go ahead and say one thing about, I
see someone handing out something about standard and pours. I think its
absurd for a bond rating agency, if that's their position to think that
restraining the growth of your financial commitments, will make it
harder to meet your past financial commitments. I just don't think that
that is a logical analysis, and I will point out also that standard and
poors is being sued by the federal government right now for their
negligence and bad actions in rating the disaster level housing debt at
triple a within a month of the housing collapse back in 2008, so I don't
give them a lot of credence right now, with that I'll let my colleague
burt jones take over
[speaker changes]
thank you, members first of all I'd like to thank our primary sponsor
representative bluss for his leadership on this issue and for allowing
me to join him as a primary sponsor of this good bill, and ladies and
gentleman this is a good bill. There are those that will probably come
forward and say that its not perfect, I don't know if I've ever seen a
perfect bill, but I will say that the perfect is not the enemy of the
good. This move North Carolina in the right direction. This moves
spending in the right direction. If there is one overriding issue that I
hear over and over and over again from the people that sent me here, it
is their belief that we need to spend within our means. The government
needs to do that just as the family, just as the business, and folks for
that reason as we look back over the last couple of decades when state
spending virtually tripled, I can only imagine what our state budget
situation might look like today in a more positive sense had we had
legislation like this in place 20 years ago. I'm going to stop at that
point, I'm just going to say that this is a good bill. Anytime you talk
about limiting the growth of government. Any time you talk about
limiting government spending you can expect for a lot of folks to come
out of the wood work in opposition, and I would just suggest to you that
that is why we find ourselves where we do today, not just as a state,
but as a nation, and if we are serious about the blessing of liberty to
our prosperity, we had better get serious about the idea of spending
within our means. Now this bill, this good bill has provisions to say
that if necessary, if in the case of emergency the legislator needs to
override it can, with the super majority vote, but it also provides some
restraints that sometimes persons and personalities simply can not do,
there are some people, unfortunately, that have th idea that serving as
a legislator is like serving as a pig at a trough, where we're all here
to compete with one another for limited resources and see how much we
can bring back, but folks we have got to exercise physical restraint and
again if we are going to secure those blessings of liberty to our
prosperity we had better get serious about what it means to spend within
our means, and for that reason I do commend this good bill to you
[speaker changes]
thank you, ladies and gentleman of the committee, we've got quite a few
people that want to speak, so before I come to the committee I'm going
to let three different posing for and against in the audience step up
and speak, just please remember in the audience, its two minutes each
and we'll take the first speaker at this time
[speaker changes]
mr speaker, mr chairman, I just wanted to let people know, because this
was all being done horridly, and I appreciate that the staff could do
that, but BTC budget and tax center fact sheet being handed out, thats
one I asked to be handed out. members I think its a brilliant piece so I
hope you'll read it
[speaker changes]
our first guest speaker stand up, come to the podium please, please
announce your name.
[speaker changes]
good morning my names tyzer mitchell, I'm a public policy fellow at the
north carolina budget and tax center, thank you for giving me the
opportunity to express why the center is opposed to this bill. This bill
would take critical decisions about revenue and public investments out
of the hands of legislators and instead use a rigid fundamentally flawed
formula to determine the state budget, [xx] would force permanent cuts
to education, roads and highways, healthcare and the other key services</p>

<p id="010:00">
And quality of life.  The flawed formula fails to take into account the
costs such as education and health care that grow faster than inflation
and it fails to account for demographic shifts such as increasing share
of North Carolina's population that is made up of elderly residents.
Because TABOR restrictive formula makes it impossible for the state to
keep up with the cost of services, it would force annual, recurring cuts
to all government services, that families and businesses rely on.  This
means large, annual cuts that grow deeper and deeper over time.  North
Carolina's spending is already 11% less than it was when the Great
Recession began.  Capping state spending through TABOR would make it
impossible for us to regain the ground we since lost.  Contrary to how
it's sold TABOR is a harmful gimmick that causes more problems than it
solves.  It does nothing to reduce the cost of educating our kids, or
keeping our communities safe, it does nothing to ensure that our tax
dollars are well spent.  If lawmakers want to keep spending a lot they
can do that without tinkering with the state's constitution.  TABOR is a
proven failure.  Look at the experience in Colorado, where it caused
such deep cuts to services like education and infrastructure that
business leaders came out and voters decided to suspend it.  TABOR
inherent flaws and the experience of Colorado make it clear that TABOR
is the wrong formula for North Carolina's future.  Thank you.
[speaker changes]
Thank you.  Quick fifteen-second response from the bill's sponsor.
[speaker changes]
Thank you mister chairman, I'd just like to respond to one thing that
was just said.  If this is taking the decisions out of the hands of the
legislature, that is equal to saying that having a family budget is
taking the spending decisions out of the hands of the family, or having
a budget for your business is taking the spending decisions out of the
hands of a business owner.  Thank you, mister chairman.
[speaker changes]
Quick response.
[speaker changes]
One thing, Rick.  Two things real quick.  One, mindful of the economy,
this really doesn't take full effect until 2016.  So hopefully our
economy will be back on its feet by then.  Also, I don't quite agree
with the Colorado experience as said, but one thing that we did in this
bill that will get around that problem, we don't go back below zero so
we don't get into the &quot;ratchet down&quot; situation with the cap.
[speaker changes]
Thank you so much.  Next guest speaker please.
[speaker changes]
Good morning, my name is Becky Grey.  I work for the John Locke
Foundation.  We are a free-market, limited-government, public policy
think tank here in Raleigh.  We have been in North Carolina for 23
years.  We have been in favor of restraining government spending and a
TABOR amendment for all of our 23 years.  We have written extensively
about this.  Since I only have two minutes I will just direct you, and
you should all have all of this information, but chapter two in our
recent book First in Freedom is dedicated to explaining our position on
the TABOR amendment.  In John Hood's book that was published last spring
on page 88 he devotes a couple pages to explaining why TABOR is such a
good idea.  And in our Agenda 2012 book, which all of you should have as
well, there is a complete explanation of one of our key issues of the
John Locke Foundation, so for a detailed explanation I would suggest
that you go there.  Since I only have a few minutes I really tried to
figure out, OK, how can I deliver our message to you all most
effectively?  So I have brought a chart that I use as I speak to
taxpayers across North Carolina to illustrate why it is important to put
some government restraint on spending.  This is a chart that shows state
government spending beginning in 1980 and going through 2012 with the
red bars.  So you can see how quickly in the increase in state spending
that we have had over that time period.  Now when I make the argument to
people that our government is growing too fast and that it spends too
much money, they often will tell me &quot;Well of course we are spending
more money here in North Carolina, we're doing such a great job and we
have lots and lots of people who are moving here and with that increase
in population we have to provide more schools, we have to provide more
roads, we have to provide more government services, that's why we have
the increase in government spending.&quot;  So what I did is I went back
on this chart and I overlaid this with the growth in population over the
same period of time.  So that's the blue line that cuts across here.  So
I think this illustrates to you how out-of-whack this has gotten.  Just
imagine, if you would, as you all are facing these challenges, what
would have happened in 1980 if we would have had a TABOR amendment in
place.  Thank you very much.
[Speaker changes]
Mr. Chairman?
[Speaker changes]
Thank you.
[Speaker changes}
Mr. Chairman?
[Speaker changes]
Yes?
[Speaker changes]
May I rebut her comments, since she's for the bill?  The lady who spoke
against the bill, you gave them an opportunity to rebut... should't I
have the opportunity to rebut?
[Speaker changes]
Representative Luebke, when we finish with all the speakers the
committee will have full chance...
[Speaker changes]
Right, but you do understand that it's unfair the way you've structured
it?
[Speaker changes]
I understand that the chair is making a decision.
[Speaker changes]
Yes sir.
[Speaker changes]
Next speaker up, please.</p>

<p id="015:00">
My name is Vance Holloman I'm the deputy state treasurer I'm the
individual that asked for the Standard &amp; Poor's report to be passed
out I like to say that we feel the state government has tremendous
responsibility to its citizens for every tax dollars it raises but ill
point out that this will tie your hands to respond with increased
revenues at a time of fiscal stress this is going to create a super sub
majority 33% plus one vote will make the decision for the entire state
if you'll look at the handout Standard &amp; Poor's and they are having
a bit of legal trouble with some mortgages but ill  point out that a
different group of folks handle state and local government ratings and
those ratings have proven to be good in the market they have not had the
problems of the housing industry they have laid out fairly clearly how
they determine ratings I'd like a golf score a AAA is a 1 to 1.5 the
worst rating they could possibly assign is a four they look at number
factors and indicators and one of those indicators I put just below that
table revenue structure most states enjoy the flexibility to set and
modify tax rates dots exemptions and collecting data if in our view
these can be achieved without major constitutional legal political or
administrative difficulties these disbursement powers can quickly and
favorably influence the state physical conditions so that the lack of
these types of super majorities' is viewed positive if you look at the
revenue structure item below that currently we are at a score over 1 on
that based on the criteria if you'll look down to item to level three
that is what we would become the they are in our view significant
constraints to adjusting taxes and revenues these constraints can
include constitutional prohibitions on tax increases are above majority
legislative threshold for approval so this is going to move us to a
level three if you'll up there a level three they view that the
equivalent of a unit of government that is single-A rated there is
further items here we 1.4 ratings on a 1-1.5 we  could move closer to
move beyond that AAA rating with this you will notice the governmental
framework ??? North Carolina forth line North Carolina has considerable
revenue raising ability to raise its income and sales taxes and can
improve new revenues without the voter approval or supermajority in the
legislative so this is going to hurt us with the rating  agencies the
last item is from moodies it indicates the government says 30% you'll
have a chance to read that too sir. [Speaker change] thank you so much
this next up for comments [Speaker Change] Mr. Chairman may i ask him a
question? [Speaker Change] When we finish this new speaker you can ask
questions this is the last one we got left. [Speaker change] Mr.
Chairman The handout he is talking about, all of us do not have a copy
of it could we get a copy of it. [Speaker Change] The chair would ask
sergeant of arms to make sure she gets a handout. Speaker please
proceed.[Speaker Change]. Thank you chairman ??? Americans for
prosperity allow me to go off script here a minute to respond to the
treasurer's office ??? I Find Quite Frankly Absurd If You Pay Your Bills
and You don't overspend  You Will Retain a AAA bond rating As Has the
State of Utah Which has had  a Very Effective Paper Amendment in Place
for a Number of Years.??? all ??? Does Is Keep This Body from
Overspending When Times Are Great so They Don't Have To Make Mean and
Cruel and Difficult cuts When We have Economic Downturns the Tabor
Amendment in Colorado Was Effective for Many Years It Returned $3
Billion back to Taxpayers It Was Very Effective all the way through the
90s until the big spending Education Bureaucrats Figured a way to Put
Another Amendment That Weakened Contrary to the Story in Colorado If You
Look across tabors Have Been Successful in Oregon and Utah and Have Had
Great Success in Restraining the Rapid Growth of Government [Speaker
Change] Mr. speaker, Mr. Chair Comment Please. [Speaker Change] Order
the chair has a right. Speaker please finish your comments.[Speaker
Change]  in Fact across the Country Unsuccessful tabors have  Failed
because politicians of the Special Interest and Have Undermined them
through Subsequent Spending beyond the Legal Limit States like Oregon
and Utah have had Great Success in Restraining Rapid Government Growth
by Enacting well defined tabors in Restraining from Undermining about
Subsequent law North Carolina Can Return Our State Spending to a
Fiscally Responsible Way by Enacting 274 of course this Body has done  a
Great Job over the Last Couple of Years and We Are Nowhere Close to
Spending at the tabor line so all we have to do is sort of Maintain That
and make sure we do that into the Future don't fall for the critics
misinformation on 270</p>

It doesn't slash spending at all, rather, it places a reasonable limit
on how fast spending can grow to insure the states finances are in good
shape for future generations of North Carolinians. No doubt ?? laws are
controversial. They are controversial because they are effective at
limiting state overspending and I commend the sponsors for the bill.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. The chair would like to ask if we have anyone else in the
audience that would like to speak for or against this bill. Please stand
up. The chair would also like to realize that this is a controversial
issue and we would like to ask that we keep some professional ?? upon
ourselves.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, coming back to the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, as I sit here and as I listen to people speak to this body,
this committee, I ask them to also respect us as we listen to them and
vise verse as we respect them. And I think that this is what we have to
do. ?? ?? ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you representative ??. Comments for the committee, representative
??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, as I read this document as it stands, I'll give you some
assistance in this. I thought that this body resolved matters in the
affirmative. When I look at this bill and I look at the text of this
bill, I look from pages one, three, four and I see about ten if's. No
committee should come before the board with a ?? if. It should be in the
affirmative of how we resolved that. So I like to see that if it goes
forward to changes these ten words if. ??. If you look at page one line
thirty-one, if on and after December 31st and it continues to go on. I
think that we must absolve action in the affirmative, not if or should
the appropriation be available, but not  if the appropriation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would the bills responsible like to respond.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I don't see any difference in the language. There are alternative
situations that can confront you. There are contingencies and you need
to address the contingencies. For example on page two line four, if the
fiscal research division an the office of state budget ?? do not agree
on the general fund expenditure limit, the lowest shall be used. I just
don't see that as a major problem. I guess we could say when they don't
agree, but we don't know that they won't always agree so I think if is
the better word and I think the same thing would be true if I went
though every time the if is used.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that representative ?? made the appropriate statement and the
appropriate change on how to move bills forward with the proper text.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks. Next is representative Goodman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, you had me on the list.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, ??.  Just a question, would there be a baseline set for this,
there's still the tax reform issue coming through, this could become law
before that. Will there be a specific baseline that we'll always work
from?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, the baseline is established as of, I believe it's July 1st, 2015.
That when you take whatever was appropriated for that fiscal year ans
say that is the starting expenditure limit for this whole regime.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So assuming in 2016, the legislature came in and cut taxes by one
billion dollars, would the baseline then become the new number or would
it stay where it was when the law was passed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, this is an expenditure limit so it really doesn't have anything to
do with the tax. The tax side of the equation, whatever the general
assembly decides to spend, they have to, by state constitution already,
make sure that enough revenue comes in that tax system to meet those
expenditures so the tax issue is not involved in this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.</p>

spoke. If we cut expenditures then in 2016, does that recalibrate the
baseline? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No. The baseline is set. It does not go
down, so it doesn’t recalibrate. We don’t want the ratchet down
situation to go, so the baseline does not go back below zero, or the
factor doesn’t go below zero and lower the baseline. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you so much.
Representative Luebke. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I
wanted to first ask a question of Mr. Holloman from the Treasurer’s
Office. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure. Mr. Holloman, please to the mic.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Mr. Holloman, is the essence of what you’re
saying with respect to our AAA bond rating that if this bill became law,
our AAA bond rating would be very threatened and would…? Or put in other
ways, we almost for sure would lose our AAA bond rating with if this
became a statute? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m not going to say I know we would
lose it; however, it is from these documents clearly something that’s
going to be viewed negatively by the rating agencies. From the SNP
document, we are, on a scale from 1 to 1.5, we’re 1.4. It will push us
closer to that 1.5. The exact mathematics of it is difficult to know,
but SNP probably has the most open process in this, and they have again
shown us that we are getting close to that 1.5 number. This will
definitely raise that number because again, we will go from no
constraints or legislative constraints to the point of having a
supermajority requirement. So again, from what they’ve shared with us –
and this is their way of kind of letting you know what they’re looking
for – again, at the bottom of that front page it shows you we’re
currently moving down to a level three. Level three, again, is what they
would associate ?? as being equivalent of a practice of  an A- state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And follow-up question for him and then a question for
Representative Blust. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, and Mr. Holloman, can you tell us for the committee and for the
public that I know is listening in on this the importance or the
benefits to all of us in North Carolina that we have a AAA bond rating,
that we’ve had one for quite some time? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well there’s
certainly advantages in the market, but to me the most important thing
is it indicates that we are a state which practices strong financial
management practices. It is a… Being one of the nine unit, nine states
with a AAA rating, it is certainly something that folks look at when
they’re considering a location to North Carolina, an indication of our
financial stability and our financial management practices are among the
highest in the nation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And a question for
Representative Blust then. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Blust, this bill seems to not trust the voters
and the people of North Carolina to vote their legislators in, to vote
their legislators out. What’s wrong with the process we have right now
where the people of North Carolina have an election every two years and
make a decision? As you and I both know, a major decision was made in
2010 which I think was a bad one, but it happened. 2012, an even worse
decision happened, but the fact of the matter is it is what it is, and
what you’re doing here is somehow artificially getting in the way of
that, plus, as Mr. Holloman indicated in his very important point,
you’re requiring… you’re no longer allowing the majority will to
prevail, but rather it’s two-thirds majority that has to prevail. So why
are you doing all that? Why not just trust the voters? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I don’t agree that we’re not trusting the voters. One, the voters
are going to have to approve this. [SPEAKER CHANGES] At the election
day. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So it will be up to… [SPEAKER CHANGES] After the
election day. [SPEAKER CHANGES] … to the voters, but two, and I’m trying
to remember all that you said to… but we already have some constraints.
For example, we don’t trust the voters not to elect a legislature that
won’t run a deficit, so the Constitution provides that you have to have
a balanced budget every year. So that is a constitutional constraint,
and I just don’t interpret that as whoever put that in the Constitution
didn’t trust the voters. Three, I find it ironic that someone your side,
and they’re in court saying that districts were so rigged that in an
election you don’t get the true will of the voters. So I think this is a
common sense way to just keep spending, expenditure, growth within a
certain tract so we don’t get the periodic budget emergencies that we’ve
experienced and I think we will again in the future, just given the fact
that the past indicates that kind of thing will happen. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, speak on the bill? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Proceed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Members of the House, members of the
committee, TABER, so-called Taxpayer Bill of Rights, TABER is a horrible
idea.</p>

It ignores the realities of the state the situations that we face. It
constrains the General Assembly from taking the actions that that
General Assembly may see is right or wrong at a particular time. It
neglects the realities of the long term needs of the state. For example,
Tabor is a kind of a straight jacket really. It doesn't point - it
doesn't in any way deal with the reality that our state in increasingly
a state of aging citizens and therefore we're going to have more needs
social services needs that are going to have to come from government.
It's just a reality of an aging state is that you're going to have
greater needs. It does not deal with the reality that the reason our
unemployment is as high as it is because we were so heavily dependent on
manufacturing and as a result of that we could have large parts of our
state with low levels of education among the adult population. We now
know what's happened in the recession with the departure due to
globalization of those jobs that did not require a well educated labor
force. When you pass a rigid straight jacket bill like this you are not
allowing the members of the General Assembly to make the decisions to
the respect of the reality of say the needs of the future of the state.
We need to have better educated citizens and a straight jacket telling
you you can only spend so much money on education or so much money on
health care or whatever makes no sense to me. I do not know why we would
want to do that. I come back to the question I asked a moment ago, this
is unnecessary, this puts rigid limitations on - it was a failure in
Colorado and Colorado as the speaker from the budget and task centers
pointed out that the chamber of commerce of that state came around to
realizing what a disaster it was for Colorado. Let's avoid this disaster
in the making here, members vote no on this bill and I will right away
Mr. Chairman while I have the floor request the eyes and nose on the
vote. Yes. President Brown. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair, I
would like to commend the bill sponsors this is an issue that I ran on
in 2008 and 2010 and my constituents expect me to vote for it. We are
human and we want to do what people ask us to do and we increase
spending this saves us from our worst selves and I am just so in favor
of this bill and I just appreciate what you have done. I come back again
every time we try to reduce debt we're told that that's going to affect
our bond rating. A state that tries to get it's fiscal house in order
for it to negatively affect the bond rating just is a mystery to me and
that is the same point that I took with the debt that you the bill
sponsors have certainly taken with this bill. I really urge the members
to vote for this. I think it puts the power back into the hands of the
people in North Carolina. The other side can educate and talk to them
about their points of views as we will ours and we will leave it to the
good sense of the people of this state. Thank you Mr. chair. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Blust. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I want to
make one quick point on the ?? to hand out from the treasurers. We are
under this analysis going to take a ding of a bit on does the state have
a constitutional cap on raising revenue but if you'll go down to the 4th
and the 5th factors are their criteria ensuring maintenance of a rainy
day fund and this bill is going to result in a fund of 5% of the total
expenditures so I think we're going to gain credits on that factor for
having a some source of cash that can meet emergencies so I think it's a
good fiscal move. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd like to ask Representative Blust a question and
then make a comment or two if I might. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blust as I so often do when I come to a
committee meeting or go on the house floor I feel like I enter the
twilight zone where these types of things only happen here in Raleigh, I
guess they happen in DC as well. Am I misreading these two documents or
does this standard implores global credit portal not deal exclusively
with revenue raising and putting inflexibility on the raising of revenue
and your document not House bill 178 not deal exclusively with putting
restraints on the spending of revenue putting the 2 totally irrelevant
to each other .[SPEAKER CHANGES] I didn't see this before this morning
but it does seem to be logical that if you restraint your future
spending</p>

Commitments to restrain your expenditures that would make it more likely
that you can pay for your past commitments of the same revenue stream of
this seem logical to make comments follow the law will have rented from
one until assassinated everyone cynical, radio one and one deals
exclusively with raising revenue totals exclusively with spending
revenue flows like Madonna one of the few smoke springs that's been put
up from the company would realize that from the speaker said (SPEAKER
CHANGES) that we've had a love that Roche is so I guess the word women
in the last session draconian 11% decrease in state spending during the
great recession on, like to say the private sector most businesses back
other spending by a whole lot more than 11% in the greater session until
I have a deal with businesses all, financial issues most emphatic other
spending tremendously more than 11% of slate of people who receive
benefits from the state spending money if the fat kid will get a greater
session on the hardworking taxpaying constituents back or olives are
constantly asking the same question to one in particular, go back and
that is (SPEAKER CHANGES) what you Gotta get serious about cutting state
spending half think most of the folks that allegedly feel like home they
don't have a choice in the election battle of Leyte elected they're
ordered on a continuous Lake Spanaway more money than they think we're
on the skin of this total remedy the situation that leases, gets the
full bill map and I get a file, would be that I was enlightened. That
was so if the state of bargain of four and left justify your kid

again said that although would like to and from within bustle H gray on

decent examples of IE Post a week to a lot of you know that that is a
good question is how physically you can put the money back in the hands
of taxpayers from Iraq should be some sort of rebates on the back,
knowing it's probably something we need to take a close look at we hope
that that happens on the network??......(SPEAKER CHANGES)  Then we have
this fund word seal on completely fills up to the point we have excess
revenue goes back to the taxpayer bet that is a point well taken the
following Q: so you see on the CNN from someone calling from the subnet
would not something you do every year they build a delicate thing that
is just impossible to predict ahead on how  much excess you may have on
the we have not had real good economic times lately of paper to the
point we all are spending pretty much everything becomes imperfectly
with the Medicaid someone, I don't think that this would affect value be
having much if anything go into this fund so if passed, to be a good
problem to have to reach that stage in the current issue to have to
resolve, you actually return those funds back. We hope that happens,
questions to follow well get out, I was asking those questions because I
just wondered if you thought maybe the possibility of restoring some
services that can track the answer was away and from that that can
happen if 2/3 legislature and there was something stronger than the back
of the fund can be used for with the meal they got the short motion of
no small comets as Oregon may not take this is a very good bill
Lachemann the bill's sponsors for doing this all takes longer than I do
some excellent idea and I really like it because it allows the people of

1st Speaker :  Indeed in the judiciary  committee and express similar
concerns to many of the concerns that have been mention already here  in
the government committee. Our biggest concern again is in the separation
of powers concern withe legislative branch having oversight over the
judicial branch which is third co equal branch of government we also had
concern with allowing taking away the ability  for the district bars to
give recommendations to the governor I have not seen the amendment that
was run today i think it is a step in a right direction but i would just
say that we at the bar association have long supported ?? selection and
the district bars the way the process works is the only system we have
in place right now that has true merit section within the sate and i
would say that the governor don't have to point the 3 nomination one of
those 3 nominations under this current amendment if i understand it
correctly that would be our concern is that it's politicizing the
process as was mentioned before so we have concerns with this
legislation but as i said i have not seen the amendments as of this
morning. thank you

<p id="100:00">
I'm Diane ??, President-Elect of the North Carolina Cemetery Association
and manager of two cemeteries here in Wake County.  The North Carolina
Cemetery Association and North Carolina Cemetery Commission are united
in their opposition to this bill.  I am here today to make sure that you
as a representative body understand why the passing of this bill would
be devastating to perpetual care cemeteries and the families who have
entrusted the care of their loved ones to them.  There are over 16,000
abandoned cemeteries in North Carolina and not one of them was a
perpetual care cemetery.  Please do not add to that number by making a
decision without all the facts.  In 1922 Dr. Hubert Eaton founded the
first perpetual care cemetery in our nation.  He wanted to provide
families with final resting places that would be forever cared for and
he decided to take a percentage of the
property selling price and deposit it in a perpetual care trust fund.
When the cemetery was no longer producing an income these funds would be
used to maintain it.  He wanted to make sure this concept would really
work, he commissioned an extensive actuarial study to determine what the
minimum acreage should be based on 1,000 burials per acre to generate
enough monies to fund its perpetual care trust.  The minimum number was
30, 30 acres.  This is the reason that every state in the United States
has 30 acres as the minimum requirement for a perpetual care cemetery.
There has only been one time that a cemetery has come before the
Commission to ask that it's acreage be reduced below the minimum.  That
was three months ago.  It is located in Southern Pines.  The Cemetery
Commission has communicated with the cemetery and has offered an
agreement that would allow the sale to move forward providing that the
cemetery will pay into the Perpetual Care Trust fund according to the
legal minimum requirement by North Carolina state law to protect the
thousands of families who have purchased their final resting places in
good faith from this cemetery owner.  The way the law reads now 10 acres
of cemetery property sold with a minimum amount required by state law
would ?? $1,000,000 for perpetual care
and under this law it would only yield $150,000.  Please do not give
this a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  Anybody else want to speak?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can I just comment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Bolds, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't know about you all but I have been in the funeral business for
30 years and I have seen the business model change and I'm not sure if
many of your families as far as burials or cremations in the future.
What they are offering is a business model study, 1922, and customs have
changed and I just ask for your favorable report.  It is kind of ironic,
yesterday the Cemetery Association, and I don't think the Cemetery
Commission is here because if they are, I'd like for them to speak in
opposition, which is a regulatory board but yesterday the association
was in a judiciary complaining that they wanted tax exempt for profit
cemeteries because they couldn't afford property taxes so I think this
would relieve a lot of that burden, is for them to, the undeveloped
land, be able to sell it off and put proceeds of that sale into
pre-need, perpetual care fund and it would reduce the maintenance and
the tax they were asking for yesterday in the judiciary meeting and I
ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions on the bill from the Committee?  Representative
Setzer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  I move for a favorable report for House Bill 810.

before us.  All in favor say aye.
