There and since in such Medicaid funding frenzy fast-changing fiscal
year 2012 2013 is not subject of consultation requirements of section
5.2 obsessional 21 145 that's consultation requirements make sure that
the Gen. assembly know what's happening with money get with the journals
in Windows what's happening with this money then disclaimer says that
consultation requirement does not apply I'm secure those are the the the
three technical changes I get all related to that in C fast funding with
Mr. Rebecca Angelo and branded a pretty good job of explaining the
differences for bill in the actually we did that income is from the
committee budget and so I think Mr. chairman I like to make a statement
and I have loved to men and sidelined since then forward this bill for
will hurt not help the hard-working low and middle income people of
North Carolina it will hurt and not help the small business owners of
North Carolina undermines the future North Carolina it unnecessary that
it is a very this guy did bill let me start by commenting on why this
bill is bad for business if legality expand Medicaid small business
owners who have 50 or more workers many of whom have incomes up to 133%
of the federal poverty level will be required to provide health
insurance for those workers or pay a fine by expanding Medicaid the
small business owner is relieved the cost of providing the coverage and
the small business owner has a healthier workforce by rejecting a
partnership exchange it will be harder for small business owners to find
the right policy for their employees on a federally run exchange and it
will be more expensive because the fees that are charged a small
business owners through a federal exchange will be higher than they
would be through a partnership exchange under the ability for as a bill
that business that purchased the group policy on a federal exchange is
forced to depend on the federal government to resolve differences of
insurers under a partnership exchange we would be able to employ our own
consumer assistance people who would help help the uninsured find it
right policy that would create 500 jobs in North Carolina and is jobs
that pay between 20,000 and $30,000 each that would be good for our
working class North Carolinians a be good for working-class business by
rejecting the exchange and Medicaid the really hurt the working class
were the middle-class guy working people in North Carolina and the hurt
small businesses receiving checks and Medicaid is also wrong that will
further undermine our low income middle families either working families
are not people who are not responsible they are responsible their paying
their fare share there doing their part to doing everything right here
paying into the system but they still fall behind to no fault of their
own of the 1.5 million people in North Carolina who do not currently
have health care insurance more than 500,000 of these would be covered
by the expansion of Medicaid 233% of the federal poverty level these are
working families who don't make enough now to buy insurance that you get
sick when these I'm sure people get fit they go to emergency rooms for
care and hospital emergency rooms are required to provide that care that
uncompensated care so how do hospitals manage to do that well you and I
hate fat we pay for it in two ways first of all we pay for it through an
increase on our own insurance premiums fell according to families USA
for a family that has a group policy every family that has a group
policy pays $1200 each year more in order to offset the indigent care
for individuals they take close to $1000 a year extra in premiums that
they shouldn't be paying back the clock that is to help understand or
shift the cost I cannot pay hospitals for the indigent care another way
is through our disproportionate share program at the federal program
taxpayers support that my</p>

<p id="15:00">
Tax dollars go to that, your tax dollars go to that. When the affordable
care act goes into effect the disproportionate share payments to
hospitals, especially our rural hospitals who depend on this money to
keep them viable, to keep them floating. That money is going to go away.
And so in order to make up for that there's a projection that our
insurance premiums will go up even further, that there will be an
escalation in the cost of our insurance premiums to help rural hospitals
offset that loss of the disproportionate share money. But that's going
to be a struggle for our rural hospitals and those of you who represent
rural districts right now I urge you to go meet with your hospital
administrators and talk to them about how they're going to handle the
disappearance of disproportionate share money without the expansion of
Medicaid.
No rationale reason exists to to expand Medicaid. Especially during the
first three years when the federal government would pay 100% of the
service cost and savings would more than offset any administrative cost.
The expansion would create 25,000 new jobs in the first three years,
that's in addition to the 500 that I was talking about before. It would
produce $125 million in savings to the state, to the state tax payers,
$124 million dollars of savings. Before I've sent forward these
amendments I want to just add that access to affordable appropriate
healthcare is really a national emergency. We are an unhealthy country.
We are the only industrialized nation in the world that does not provide
healthcare to all of its citizens because healthcare is an essential
service. our military, our law enforcement, our military are rejecting
more and more of people who want to go into the military because they
fail the healthcare exam. And that's true also for our emergency
workers, our policemen and our law enforcement officers, more of them
are having healthcare problems.
I don't want you to blame the auditors report. First of all I've talked
with people at DMA, they assure me that the administrative issues in the
auditors report should be fixed and they can be fixed, they have no
problems with that, those problems will be taken care of by July 1,
2013. The $1.4 billion dollar shortfall that you see in the auditors
report isn't $1.4 billion in state dollars, that's the federal state
combination. The shortfall is about, is a little less than $400 million
dollars in state. That's a lot of money still but that's the money that
secretary canceller [??] said, the department would not be able to meet.
That was an excessive cut in Medicaid that the department said they
would not be able to save. The $90 million dollars savings in community
care network of North Carolina we all said was not realistic given the
way they rolled that program out.
We knew that Medicaid was going to fall short. That's not something that
the auditor had to tell us. And I would just say that democrats balanced
the budget on the backs of Medicaid too. That wasn't new with
republicans. So I think we all support getting all of those things on
the books up front and dealing with them. But that's not a reason not to
expand Medicaid and it's not a reason not to have a state partnership
exchange. I also hope we won't blame the federal defect or the debt.
Republicans and democrats are both responsible for that let's just take
that off the table, and let's don't see repeal and replace. We have had
a huge effort since maybe before President Truman, trying to get
healthcare. President after president has tried to do that. We finally
have a plan, an imperfect plan, a plan that needs to be fixed, but it
doesn't need to be repealed and replaced, we need to go ahead and this
is the law of the land. We need to go ahead and move forward, take the
lead as North Carolina has on so many other things. Take the lead and
help get it fixed but help roll it out and implement it.
I just would like to send two - forward two amendments, but I do want to
say that our community care network, we have a rich package, a rich
Medicaid package in North Carolina. And we do pay more. Those are people
that are age, blind and disabled, dependent children under the age of 19
who are poor, those are not...</p>

People who we can expect to take responsibility for their own care.
Those are our vulnerable population, people that we have historically
said, if you're an American and it's not your fault if you're
vulnerable, you can't do it yourself, we're going to make sure that
there's a safety net that works for you. So I would like to send forward
two amendments.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Insko, would you hold
your amendments for just a minute please. Thank you. Representative
Brisson.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chair. Question for
Representative Burr. Representative Burr, would you just define the
present system? And I know, I've sat on this Committee for six years,
and I know that Medicaid, we've with the present system we've been able
to expand throughout the last six years with new folks, patients that
apply. We'll always have new patients coming into the Medicaid system.
If you glance at this title, No Medicaid Expansion, that might send the
wrong signal to some of the people, particularly the new Representatives
just getting introduced to the program. Can you define what this would
do when new patients still apply, that patients would still be able to
apply in the present system. You understand what I'm talking about? Just
a short ??[SPEAKER CHANGES]I get what you're saying pretty much. You
correct me if I'm going down the wrong direction. But it is the intent
of this bill, and I believe the intent of the Governor's comments today
and the Legislature, to make very clear that with those folks that are
currently enrolled in Medicaid, or eligible to enroll in Medicaid under
the current program as it is today, we want that program to be
successful. We want to see healthy outcomes for those individuals. And
yes, we were pretty much, I think the Governor, or the auditor's audit
wasn't a big shock to anyone in this room. I think it just reinforced
very much that this General Assembly and this state has really got to
take a serious look at the current Medicaid program and the current way
that we do things within Medicaid, and get those things fixed. As I said
earlier, when you've got a house in shambles you don't build onto it at
that point. You fix what you've got and then you move forward from
there. And I believe at this point, Representative Brisson, we've got to
take care of what we've got and we've got to make sure that we're fully
meeting the needs of those folks that currently qualify for Medicaid
before we ever consider looking at any type of expansion.[SPEAKER
CHANGES]Representative Dollar.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Just a quick question.
Representative Burr, is it fair to say that if we pass this legislation
it's not a decision for all time, whether we're talking about the
Exchange or whether we're talking about expansion, these are issues that
the General Assembly, in accordance with this legislation, would be able
to come back at some point in time, if the desire was there, and make a
different decision? Is that fair to say?[SPEAKER CHANGES]That's correct,
Representative Dollar.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.[SPEAKER
CHANGES]Representative Fulghum.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Representative Burr, is it fair to say that there is ?? cost to this
expansion over the next six years, and how much would that be in a
dollar figure as far as the state's share?[SPEAKER CHANGES]There is.
Perhaps staff could give us that number. I think Susan Morgan, if you'll
allow Susan to speak in this chair, she could give us a precise
number.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Ms. Morgan.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Burr,
members of the Committee, we have the document that talks about the
expansion through 2020 that's been prepared by Steve Owen with the
Division of Medical Assistance. I believe that he is here. In looking at
the impact to state funds associated with expansion</p>

And couple of things are going on and that is assuming that the offsets
that he is including that is serving people who are currently in the
correction system, you can now talk about the expand in medicate and
also the mental health funds that are currently state only would be
eligible to be covered by the new expansion. During the first four years
of his analysis it shows that there is an increase in revenue for the
state, once you get to 2018 the cost that state associated with the
expansion that’s because there is a step-down in the Federal match right
beginning of that year. The cost that first year 7.8 million dollars by
2019 the cost increases to 34 million dollars according to his analysis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And Mr. Chairman if I could end that as well I think it should be said
that there is no guarantee, there is no certainty at all Representative
___[00:50] that with all the uncertainty we have in Washington DC right
now with the budget and the deficit and all the issue they are facing
that they potentially couldn’t come up in future years and change that
match and that number could grow even larger and potentially after 2020
it will be ___[01:11].
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Insko, would you like to send forward an amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would like to ask a question if I ask the staff I believe in response
to a question that was asked before about I agree that we could come
back in approve state run exchange or the expansion of medicate, could
the staff just tell me when we would have to notify the Federal
Government in order for us to start expanding medicate in 2015 instead
of 2014? What's the deadline for that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, staff would like to comment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At this time there is actually no deadlines the state is able to
opt-into the expansion when they to choose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And how about for the excuse me, I have a follow up, how about for the
expansion for the state, partnership exchange is there a deadline for
them?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For the 2014, the deadline has passed to do a state based exchange, the
partnership exchange deadline is actually this Friday, with regards to
the future for an exchange in 2015 the deadline for a state based
exchange would be sometime in this November. So, it will always be the
November a year and a couple of months before the state based exchange.
With regards to future deadlines for the partnership they have not put
any of that information out yet.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you and so Mr. Chairman I would like to just point out to the
members that they have on their desks letters of support for medicate
expansion from the North Carolina Hospital Association, The North
Carolina Medical Society and for partnership exchange from the health
care underwriters and the first I would like to send first forward the
amendment S4AME-6V4.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Clerks have the copies, the members of the committee have the copies.
Okay, Representative Insko.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, you will see on your bill, if I can find my
bill, on line 10 Section 1BGS52-240 ___[03:48] is repealed, I believe
that is an overreach and an unnecessary overreach and one that actually
is probably can be easily, fairly easily fixed and that we should
probably have broad consensus on fixing this, this is the language that
gives authority to our own department of insurance to resolve issues
between insures and industries and providers and individuals and the way
this is worded it would prevent the department if insurance from dealing
with all of those things that have currently been rolled out already for
example whether or not about pre-existing conditions, about providing
insurance for children under the age of 21, about some preventive care
or there is whole long list of Federal, provisions that have already
rolled out and already in place and this would force individual people
or…

<p id="30:00">
businesses to actually go to the federal government to resolve
differences and I believe that the bill sponsors intended really to
limit that to the industry. And if I could have the staff, this is
fairly complex even though a lot of us in here spent a lot of time on
medicade and healthcare it's something that I think that it would be
better for the staff to explain so that I make sure we get the details
right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, there are several
provisions within the affordable care act that put requirements on
insurance plans, Representative Insko mentioned a few of them, our
authorization for our commisioner of insurance, however, in the powers
and duties says enforce the state law. This is number one within the
powers and duties. There's this additional authority that was added in
the budget bill, the ten which you'll see excerpted on the ammendment
form, what this would do would make just enough changes to the existing
statute to be in line with the rest of the bill. And that is saying no
state run exchange, no partnership exchange, explicitly says this
authority does not, the authority intent does not include the authority
to do those things, but it would include that information, that
authority that's in there to enforce the provisions of the affordable
care act. And I have a list of some of those that I can run down,
however it was something that was provided to me by the department of
insurance so it might be more appropriate for perhaps Rose to run
through those if she's in here or someone else from DOI.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman if we could ask Rose Von Williams from the insurance
department to explain that issue, I have some of those here too, but if
she's in the audience she would know more about that than I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? please identify yourself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, and Representative Burr, My name is Rose Von
Williams and I'm legislative council to the department of insurance, and
I think the question is to go over those things that this would prohibit
the state from enforcing. Is that correct? Without the clear authority
from the general assembly as the general assembly did with HIPAA and
other things we're certainly going to try and do our job and enforce all
we can, but I think that this would affect those things in the
affordable care act so that enforcement of all those new items that are
coming down in this large federal law would all be then answered to by
the federal government. Disputes between hospitals and doctors or when
individuals have questions or problems with their health insurance
company, that maybe some of the provisions of the new act are not being
followed. Maybe you are being charged more for a preexisting condition
or maybe your child is not being allowed to stay on your health
insurance policy even though he or she is within the dependent age
limit, but the other list would include the no lifetime or annual
limits, preventative services, uniform explanation of coverage
documents, appeals, recisions, premium rating, and the essential health
benefits package or plan. That answers that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ok, Representative Insko?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, thank you. I really do believe that our hospitals and our
physicians and our patients who have healthcare prefer to go a state
department of insurance to get these issues resolved. And they would be
more quickly resolved with people who knew the state who knew the people
who knew the companies without involving the federal government. So I
would move adoption of the ammendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other comments on the ammendment, Representative Burr.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. chairman. Representative Insko, you raised an issue that
we've all been looking at, I find to ?? best how to address this one
piece. I'm not sure this is it. I'm certainly willing to work with you
to find a vehicle and a place and a way to do that, but at this time I
would ask, right now, that members oppose this ammendment and we can
certainly carry on discussions in the future about how to address this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could I ask for show of hands please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ok. Any other discussion on the ammendment?

Mr. Chairman.

that the General Assembly wants to take to establish a state and
exchange has that ship not sailed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For 2014, the state no longer has the ability to have a state based
exchange. However, for 2015, 2016, 2017 that window is still open.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Farmer-Butterfield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I wanna to speak in favor of Representative
Insko’s amendment, I think it’s a good amendment, I think it would allow
people in North Carolina who are uninsured and under insured to receive
the necessary services and wanna to save the state dollars.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other comments from the committee, Representative Baskerville…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Question, how can it be better for the citizens of North Carolina that
have an issue with being denied a service or coverage or having an issue
with payments or anything like that, they have to go to a Federal
Authority to have those issues ___[01:50] down or concerns address? How
it could be better to have that approach then to come to a state
regulator or agency to address those concerns I mean that seems like
that’s the opposite of how we should approach this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, Representative Baskerville never said that it was a better idea
for folks have to go to Federal Government, what he said is this is an
issue that we are aware of and we are trying and figure out how to best
address that and certainly I’m willing to sit down with Representative
Insko and try to address that not at this time in this committee but
address that in future to make sure that we have the best possible
solution to make sure that folks were able to rely on our state assets
here versus having to rely on the Federal Government.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, Representative Insko moves for adoption of the amendment, she wish
to have the vote, those in favor of the amendment raise your hand,
please give them up. Okay, those oppose to the amendment raise your
hand. Okay, the ayes seven votes, No’s 14 votes the amendment fails. Do
you wish to send forward another amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I send forward an amendment S4-AME-9V1.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The members of the committee have the amendment. Representative Insko,
do you wanna explain the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, members this actually a delete section 3 and
replaces it with a language that would authorize the expansion of
medicate according to the Affordable Care Act for the first three years
only that’s during the time when the Federal Government would pay a 100%
of the cost of services and when there is ample return on and savings
for example that have already been mentioned during those first three
years we would actually, the revenue would actually increase state
revenue, there would be no loss of state revenue that the offsets in
mental health and other savings would more than pay for any
administrative cost. So, there are and this is very important that we go
ahead and do this for the first three years, we have learned from
community care network of North Carolina…

<p id="40:00">
To know that when we have people who are uninsured they are a lot sicker
than the general population. The way to save money in healthcare is to
keep people well. It costs less money to provide healthcare to well
people than it does to sick people. And so we've learned in community
care network that those - when we take in a new group of people that the
first 12 to 18 months we actually spend more money on them than we do in
the long run because in the long run what we're doing is maintaining
health. What we're doing in those first 12 to 18 months is treating
really serious chronic conditions and high cost conditions. We need the
federal government to pick that money, to pick that cost up.
If we delay the cost of - the time we expands Medicaid and we lose that
window, this is the law of the land and we will eventually be moving in
that direction because of the other things I mentioned about how the
lack of expanding the Medicaid is going to hurt our business community.
And so we're going to - I think that you all have seen the editorial
from the Wall Street Journal about businesses now looking more closely
at the costs associated with not expanding Medicaid. That the chamber of
commerce in Virginia, that predicament of chamber of commerce in
Virginia actually supports the expansion of Medicaid because of the
benefits that it's going to bring to businesses. So this issue of our
impact on business I think is going to be here too in this state so it
is very important for us to go ahead and take advantage of these first
three years.
This bill automatically sunsets at the end of this period when the
affordable care act, when the federal government quits paying the 100%
of costs. So I'll be glad to answer questions and I move adoption of the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, if I may I'd like to ask
Representative Ensco a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms. Jacobs referred earlier to a document that Mr.
Owen had done regarding the finances of the first, second and third
year. What after the third year are we going to do? Have you had a
physical note or a memo or anything done as to what will happen as that
match from federal government decreases and do we know what beyond 2019
or 2020 the decrease is going to be?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This bill does not, this bill sunsets at the end of
three years so we wouldn't have this program unless the general assembly
took affirmative action to continue the program. This bill sunsets at
the end of three years. It would treat our sickest people during those
first three years at no cost to the state. There is no reason for us not
to do this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We are currently having a significant issue where we
have to eliminate by necessity because of financing services. So you're
telling me that we're going to expand this to 500,000 people which as
I've heard the estimate that will be covered for three years and then
we're just going to throw them off the boat at that time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, if I could respond to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] At that time I believe that there will not be a
reduction in the federal, I think there's good reason to believe that
there will not be a reduction in the federal timeline. They would go
down to 93% which would leave us with 7%, and then at the end of 10
years I think it goes down to 90%. We currently pay a third of the cost
for every person whose enrolled in Medicaid. So paying only 10% to get
our people healthy and insured is a huge savings. the money that would -
there are numbers about the money that would come in during that time,
about the jobs that would be created, about the increase in revenue from
those jobs that are created. every person who has a job, who is going to
make more money because of the increase, all that federal dollars goes
to the private sector in the form of jobs. And so those people are all
going to be paying state taxes and that's going to increase our state
tax revenues. So there are numbers that show that, I don't have them
with me right here but I'd be glad to get those for - and I think that
this program is going to be so popular in the public that the federal
government will not reduce its share.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Burke
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Member, I'd ask you to oppose
this amendment for many obvious reasons. This is exactly what's wrong in
our country is the fact that the federal government constantly comes and
dangles some dollars down in front of our faces and we think we
instantly have to grab it and we have to take those dollars, and then we
forget that when we get those dollars there's all kinds of strings...</p>

Attached to it, and it puts you all, us all, the citizens of the state
on the hook for many many years to come for something that is advertised
as just a temporary free - this idea that it's free money. There's no
such thing as free money. It's either coming out of the taxpayers right
pocket or the left pocket or the one in the back, and it makes
absolutely no sense to take money that's coming form the taxpayers or to
take money that is really being borrowed at this point and to say that
as well taking it through that direction through the taxpayers you'll
also be taking it through premiums because I believe there's a great
chance that you'll see the premiums on north Carolinian's rise as you
see the hospitals start to do cost shifting more and more through having
additional Medicaid patients on the rolls.
And certainly they will be paying from both ends at that point and we
simply don't need to be moving in that direction, as I said earlier we
need to manage what program we currently have and maintain that and
better maintain that for those people that are truly at need, and beyond
that we need to be willing to say no and step back and assess what we
have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Earl.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I'm certainly speaking in support of the
amendment. I think we need to kind of look at the big picture. We've
only been here a few days and already we're rushing through two major
pieces of legislation and I think that they are very much connected. we
just passed out the unemployment piece and I don't know whether a lot of
the new people realize that if you don't fit into certain categories you
don't qualify for Medicaid regardless to how poor you are or whether you
have income or not. And we've just passed this major piece of
unemployment legislation whereas after 20 weeks if you're lucky you're
not going to have any money coming in and you probably didn't have but
$100 or $200 coming in anyway, after a couple of a few months you're not
going to have anything coming in. Our economy is just starting to kind
of make a forward move. What we've done with the unemployment is going
to certainly hurt the economy and then you've got people that are not
going to have any safety net anywhere to go when they've exhausted this
limited amount of unemployment. And I'm just wondering, and if anybody's
even thought about it, where this is going to bubble.
This is a safety net for people that would otherwise have nowhere to go,
they'd be on the street or knocking on some of our heads trying to feed
their families. And I think that North Carolina ought to be better than
this. We talk about the federal government dangling money, well they're
dangling money for a cause, for a reason, to help people that otherwise
would not have any services or have anywhere to go. And I'm sure the
hospitals would love to have these people covered because right now
anybody that presents at the door has to get served so I'm sure that
they would love to have it and this would just be a boost to our economy
that seems to be starting to make an upward move. But I think with the
two major things that we're doing right now I think we certainly are
going to see some impact on the economy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Farmer-Butterfield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. I want to speak in favor of the
amendment. I understand that the hospitals in North Carolina have
incurred a debt of $1.6 billion dollars because of the uninsured and
under-insured not being able to pay for the cost of care. So that is
indeed a concern to me and representative Ensco's bill or amendment
rather will address that to a certain extent. I also understand that
five governors who are republicans so it's nonpartisan have agreed to
the expansion of Medicaid and that's Ohio, Arizona, North Dakota...</p>

Nevada and New Mexico.  So I'm concerned that we're looking at the
Institute of Medicine's report, some of us have read it, and the first
three years it talks about the fact there there will be 25,000 jobs
created in the state of North Carolina and we indeed are concerned about
jobs in the state.  I'm also concerned that the net savings for the
state for the first three years would be over two billion dollars.  So
why are we taking two billions dollars off the table each year of the
first three years?  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Hurley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr. Chair.  My question is where is the
money coming from?  The government has no money, the federal government.
 We're 16 or 17 trillion dollars in debt, that's just my concern.  I
know it might do jobs but where is that money coming from?  Also, why
are our military being rejected for service?  I'd like to know the
reasons for that.  That they're unhealthy or is it because of the drug
situation or whatever.  I just feel that we need to look at this closer.
 I just feel that we don't have the money to expand this even though we
want to help those less fortunate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Baskerville.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr. Chair.  Just a question. If the
problem is how the federal government operates and the problem is the
federal government danging 500 million dollars in front of us, why are
we advocating our authority as a body to the federal government to
establish these exchanges because it's going to happen, we're just
giving them the authority,  But they are the ones that are operating in
a way that giving them the authority, advocating our authority as a body
to them to establish these exchanges.  Now, in support of Representative
Insko's amendment. When the full contribution from the feds is reduced
this amendments sunsets.  Now, where are those folks gonna go that were
receiving this expanded coverage?  They're going right to the hospitals,
they're gonna receive care in the most inefficient, expensive way
possible.  Do we have money to pay for it that way?  Where is this money
coming from?  The money is coming from our taxes that we pay to the
federal government, our federal taxes that we pay.  Why would we pay
federal taxes and then not have any say on what the feds do with that
money?  We're giving them the authority to spend our federal tax money
that we pay them but we're not having any say in it.  That's just about
three questions actually.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Were those directed at anyone particular?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  To anyone that might have an answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Burke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I'll try to address your questions and simply say
that in terms of the exchange, the federal government passed the
exchange, they created this monster. And they created something that
basically they're gonna come say, &quot;Well, Representative Baskerville
we're gonna let you handle this, we're gonna let you operate this but
here's the guide book and you have to do exactly what we say and
basically mirror what we want to the T and you have no real
control&quot;.  It's an illusion to think that the state is gonna have
any say in what would be involved in a state partner, in either a
partnership or a state run exchange, it's all already determined. It was
determined when they passed the bill back in 2009, that's already passed
so that's a done issue.  In terms of the Medicaid and, again, I won't
repeat myself, I've already tried to make the case with Representative
Insko.  To me it's not a very good argument to say, &quot;Well, we have
a chance to get money, let's get more federal money&quot;.  That's the
problem in this country right now, we've got too many people trying to
figure out how to draw down more federal dollars and it's federal
dollars we don't have.  At this point, you're not talking about even
necessarily all tax dollars that are coming from the state of North
Carolina, you're talking about money we're borrowing from other
countries, it's a big difference.  So to try to address your question
but those are my opinions of why we need to pass this bill and move
forward with trying to work with what we've got now.  And Mr. Chairman,
if I could also make the point that I don't think at all that it's the
intention of this legislature or...</p>

<p id="55:00">
for anyone, really, let me start over, it is the effort I believe fully
of the speaker, the governor, the pro-team, the legislature, to put
people back to work. That's the best way we can help people in this
state, let's put them back to work and make sure they have a job and
they have opportunities to succeed. And if we do that then we are
succeeding and that's why you're seeing this effort to move some very
important legislation early on to make sure that we're serious about
this and that we want to see that, that all North Carolinians have an
opportunity to succeed. But they can't do it if we continue to have this
wet blanket which is the federal government suffocating our state and
suffocating our citizens at every turn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.Chairman. Just a couple of points. One
point that the gentleman made, just to kind of go back for a second.
With respect to the exchanges supposedly there are three options,
there's a federal exchange, there's a state federal exchange, and then
there's a state exchange. Well the reality is is the state federal
exchange is a federal exchange for which the state picks up part of the
tab. And that's the reality and I think that's not just an opinion
that's a very objective assessment of what we have seen over the last
couple of years. Because remember this, a lot of the affordable care act
or Obama care however you want to say it, is still being written and
it's being written by the federal HHS. And it is constantly being
massaged and changed and altered and the like. So some of this stuff is
a real moving target.
So the real question with respect to the exchange really is whether or
not we want to have a state exchange or let the federal government do
it. I think we don't lose anything particularly where we are today time
wise to see for example if Utah's exchange is actually going to be
accepted by the federal government. It's been sort of provisionally, I
wouldn't say approved but it's been, they've got some provisional
authority to move forward on their exchange but I think the Utah
exchange which really doesn't match the federal legislation, it really
doesn't, but if that exchange which is very much a market based exchange
which would probably be much more in line with I would think we would
want to look at in North Carolina, if that is able to get up and to run
and Utah actually has the authority and flexibility to make that work
and the state does have control, then that's something for us to take a
look at down the road.
So there's no harm in us waiting to see what's going to happening that
regard before we make some sort of a commitment that's not advantageous
to us. As far as the amendment is concerned, obviously it's an
unworkable amendment. As representative Avila pointed out and
representative Burke pointed out, there's no way that you can put
500,000 people into your healthcare system and then take them out in
three years, that's just completely nonsensical, it doesn't work. And
one other quick thing I would point out and that is, we were talking a
moment ago about where some of the various groups are, I noted in the
letter form the medical society in the end of the third paragraph it
says, we believe the expansion of Medicaid should occur only if stable
financing can be identified and the state can be assured of it. Well
we're not there. We're not there by any stretch of the imagination. And
I think until we get there there's no point in launching out saying
we're going to expand until we know that we have stable financing,
before we sit here and say, okay, were going to take on the healthcare
for 500,000 more people in this state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. I guess this would probably be
best directed to staff and let me apologize I hate to use acronyms but
another member spoke earlier today about the DISH program which goes
largely to rule [??], well it goes to all but it makes up a larger chunk
in the rural hospitals to help provide for uncompensated care. Does - is

the Affordable Care Act for these reforms that we're discussing. Does
that go away in 2014?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative, Board Members of the Committee the
Affordable Care act does decrease DSS over several years. I do not
believe it is eliminated by 2014, but the concept being that if you
expand medicaid and the clients are actually covered with health
insurance or medicaid the need for the DSS funds actually decrease. But
we have someone here from Medicaid is she'd like specifics on how that
might impact North Carolina's current DSS Program.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Cherry I not to belabor this point but I think
that is relevant to this discussion because the inverse of what the lady
just said is if you don't expand Medicaid then we're going to take away
the only small percentage of compensation that we're paying now. I'm
just curious what that amount is and what those dates are.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Owen would you like to comment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good afternoon I'm not Mr. Owen.  I am Carol Steckel,
the new Medicaid Director. I will bring in the ringer if we need
specific numbers, but on this issue I am very familiar. The DSS statute
in the regulation, or in the statute has a direct link. The secretary's
required to cut $500 million dollars a year over the next three to four
years, however it has to be tied to the reduction in a specific state of
the uncompensated care of the uninsured amount. The secretary has not
released the regulations related to the DSS reductions yet, so it's yet
to be determined how she's going to calculate that. But there is
specific statutory language that says whatever formula she comes up with
has to vary a state's reduction in uninsured numbers of people that are
uninsured.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK thank you. Representative Burr.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I just wanted to followup on something that
Representative Burr said. I'm assuming he was addressing part of my
comments when he said about wanting everybody to have a job and I
certainly want you to know that we all have that same we have
constituents that we certainly want to be employed but we all know that
if everybody wanted to work there are not enough jobs in this state that
are available for folk. And if we did not anticipate there being more
layoffs we probably would not have been rushed to do the unemployment
bill. So I think we all know that there will be more people laid off
with no income coming in.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar. Do you have anything else? OK.
Representative Insko.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I thank you Mr. Chairman. I do think it's important
for us to recognize that this is a jobs bill, that this would all of
this money would go into the private sector. It would create jobs. It
would support jobs. It would help put our people back to work. The
healthcare jobs over the next 10 to 20 years are going to really expand.
Plus our tax dollars now are still gonna go to those other states that
are expanding Medicaid. We're taking our tax dollars and sending them to
the Federal government and they're gonna go to the other 25 or 30 states
that are going to expand their Medicaid. There's no reason for us to be
sending North Carolina tax dollars to other places when we could have it
here benefiting our own citizens. Once again this seems to me, this bill
seems to be really an attack on poor people, a disregard for their
situation, an unwillingness to take a reasonable, logical, step that
would support our poor people in our shrinking middle class. And in the
long run that is gonna hurt North Carolina and so I would urge members
to vote for my amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well just to comment on that, I mean, as a point was
made a moment ago there're a host of unknown but</p>

<p id="65:00">
Part of the way that the federal government is talking about funding all
this is taking money out of medicare. People are gonna be shocked in
2014 when they see how much money comes out of medicare programs. You
know, they're gonna wonder what it is they were buying into, and they're
also, to the extent that dish comes out of the other side have you
really had a net gain, or in terms of assessment. There's discussion
that assessment would be ramped down from 6% down to 3.5%, that's money
out on the other end. So, this is not just some grand flood of new money
out there and we really need to see how all of this is actually going to
be written in the federal regulations. We need to see where the money is
actually coming from. We need to do a much better assessment with more
information down the road before we just simply leap into saying that we
are going to take on the healthcare responsibilities for an additional
half a million people, and let me mention one other thing that we, need
to be concerned about, the MMIS program. Now, we've been on this for the
last couple of years. There's a concern now in the latter half of the
year that if the system goes live it can't, that they're gonna have to
manually enter some of the claims. That they're really not gonna be able
to pay the claims with the new system. We gotta know that we're gonna be
able to operate that claims payment system correctly before we come
around and say &quot;oh, well we're just gonna add another half a
million people to that system&quot; that is completely irresponsible in
my mind. [Speaker Changes] Representative Earl [Speaker Changes] I just,
I just wanna- Excuse me I'm sorry, I didn't intend to speak again. I
just wanted to address something that Representative Donald said about
taking money from Medicare. The money that's coming from Medicare is
coming through savings that has already been identified. It's not like a
clump of money is going to be coming out to go to, to cover Medicaid.
That is not, that is not the case. [Speaker Changes] Representative, so
[Speaker Changes] Mr. Sherrman I would like to ask Representative Dollar
a question [Speaker Changes] Representative Dollar, to you [Speaker
Changes] Representative Dollar, you said that the State shouldn't take
responsibility for these 500 thousand people that we would be covering
by Medicare. Who should take responsibility for them? Who should? Who
should? Who? Are these people that are working, but can't afford medical
care, who have preexisting conditions and can't get medical care,
medical insurance. Who should? Who is responsible? [Speaker Changes]
Well, it's some for all of the above. I mean, some studies show that a
substantial number of these folks are currently insured, and would be
moving off of their, because of the cost to employers, the way this
system works that employers might choose to dump folks and say
&quot;okay, you go pick yourself up on Medicaid&quot; But what can't,
but what I don't think any and I'm not gonna pick on you Representative
?? but I don't think there's any member of this committee that can
actually sit here today and lay out all of the cost numbers for us. Now,
if somebody can do that, great. Then maybe we should consider moving
forward at this point, but I don't think we're there yet. We may get
there, and the question I had asked earlier of Representative Burr, this
is not a decision for all time, this is a decision for where we are
today but, I would think that everyone and some of the question
Representative Lewis was raising and others have raised. I think we'll
need to continue to monitor this, see where the numbers are and make a
decision down the road when we have greater clarity from the Federal
level and from the State level on exactly what the cost and impacts are.
[Speaker Change] Representative Farmer Butterfield [Speaker Change]
Thank you. I just wanted to comment that rejecting the Medicaid
expansion will indeed, possibly risk people from having jobs in the
healthcare profession. Some people are gonna lose jobs because you're
talking about cuts in Medicare, if you don't want to increase Medicaid
funding by the federal government. In addition, every year that we delay
in North Carolina implementing the Medicaid expansion program means that
those dollars are going to go to other states</p>

and bolster their economy. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Burr
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Again, Mr. Chair I just ask members to oppose
representative Insko amendment at this time. The point being I've looked
at the occupation list of all of the members of the general assembly.
There's no fortune teller on the list. We don't know what's gonna to
happen in the future. We simply don't know, there's to many unknowns.
And we shouldn't put future general assemblies at risk to bear the
burden of having to take more money from taxpayers, to take more money
out of education, to take more money out of transportation, to take more
money out of the taxpayers wallets at this time. We simply are going to
move forward with what I think is the best option for our state with so
may unknowns. [SPEAKER CHANGES] May I call for the show of hands again
please? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ok. Representative Insko moves for adoption of
the amendment. The vote will be by show of hands. Those in favor of the
amendment will raise their hand. Thank you. Those opposed to the
amendment will raise your hand. Thank you. 7 aye's 14 no's, the
amendment fails. Back to the bill, anymore comments on the bill itself?
Representative Insko [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll defer my comments to you in
just a minute. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ok, representative Earle [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. I've been around here long enough to know
that this train is on the track and it's going to run me and some other
folk right on over but I just want to say that I certainly would think
that North Carolina would be more concerned about it's citizens than
what's been displayed and what will be displayed and the explanation
that has been given for why we are pushing through with this. I was kind
of optimistic thinking that maybe we would not after the governor asked
for a little delay, so I really was kind of optimistic that we would not
continue down this road. But the explanation that's been given to me,
it's not valid to me when you talk about the fact that we owe money to
the federal government. Every since I've been here DHHS has always had
to pay back money for one reason or another and this has been under
republican and democratic secretaries so that's nothing new. I would
think that we ought to be able to chew gum and walk at the same time and
be able to do and focus on more than one thing at a time. I would like
to say to that we've got a lot of new members and I just would like to
appeal to you to look at what this would do to your constituents. I'm
sure that democrats are not the only members that have poor people or
people that would need this expansion. So like I say I know this train
is going down the track and it's gonna be passed. I can just look around
at the faces and look around at the folk that are here and know exactly
in the numbers that it's already a done deal. I just want to again, I
don't want to rehash everything that's been said cause a lot has been
said and I really don't think that anything can justify the fact that we
do not take this federal money and cover people that are not insured. We
would have a healthier population for this state and I just think that
it's the right thing to do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Fulghum.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For those of you who know me know that I've had some
comments to make about being conflicted on this because I'm a physician.</p>

[Speaker changes.]...and I wanted to slow this down to where we could
think about it...how we could do it better. That doesn't mean I'm gonna
vote against this bill because I do think that we should do it better.
The audit demonstrated there was money being wasted. Profligate waste.
This Observer article used the term &quot;rats' nest&quot;. We owe our
constituents and owe our taxpayers a better fiduciary oversight on how
this money's being spent. Most of all, the patients deserve it. People
who we're tryin' to help aren't gettin' helped like they should be,
whether it's mental health or general health conditions.  This category
of people who, the new eligibles in this bill, between 19 and 65,
childless adults...500,000...they were left out of the original Medicaid
coverage, probably because they were the least people the feds worried
about makin' eligible. That doesn't mean they're least deserving. That
means that we've got to figure out a way to do this better. If we have
time, and I think we do over the next year, 2-3 years...how ever long it
takes to get this done right. With the auditor's help, Ms. ????????'s
help, who's kind to help us on the Medicaid program here...and the new
administration.  The Medical Society letter that Nelson Dollar
referenced mentioned that we support full exploration if...of financing
options and we believe expansion should occur only if stable financing
is available. It was also echoed to some degree by the hospital
association's ??????????? that they recognize expansion can occur only
if built on solid foundation. And look forward to working with the state
to improve the current Medicaid program...that's what we need to
do...improve the current Medicaid program. And make sure that we're
doin' the right job by our citizens and the working poor...so I'm gonna
vote to try to stay the course with improving our oversight.  I'm not
gonna approve this expansion.  I just don't think it's good...I think
it's a house of cards and trying to build more stuff on top of a house
of cards will soon collapse because the federal debt will not support
it. Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] Just a minute, Representative Insko.  I would like to
hear from anyone in...that are guests of the committee. I received notes
earlier that someone may wanna speak?  Raise your hand if you're a guest
of the committee that would like to speak.  OK..please come to the
microphone and identify yourself.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chairman. My name is James A. Wall,
Sr. I am the Volunteer State President for AARP North Carolina and,
first of all, I'd like to say that AARP is certainly strongly supports
the expansion of the Medicare for services to those who are currently
uninsured. I would just acknowledge that Representative Insko and a
number of the other committee members, including Representative
Baskerville and others, have made a number of the points that I was
prepared to make in terms of support of this bill but I just wanna
highlight just a coupla' points if I may and that is when you talk about
500,000 people that are uninsured, we don't talk about the fact that
about 100,000 of those people are people aged 50 to 64 and who are..have
been without employment or for some chronic illness that they have
encountered unfortunately.  The other point that I wanna make and I'll
just mention the fact that I'm a retired hospital administrator, I spent
some 37 years in the field and when we talk about uncompensated care, it
certainly does have a major impact on our rural hospitals. And what does
that do?  It increased the uncompensated care but it also increased the
highest cost by people having to go to the emergency rooms for care.  So
I think that has been made but I just wanted to underscore that point.
And the other point that I quickly wanna make is clearly there's been a
number of reports that say this is a job creator and I know that has
been a high priority for the members of this....

Committee, and also I believe the Governor has spoken to that as well.
So it is a job creator. In some estimates, as many as 23,000 jobs will
be created. Certainly by expanding Medicaid to the uninsured, it
certainly has the potential of having a healthier workforce to respond
to these jobs that everyone is working to create. I'm encouraged to hear
that members of the Committee are willing to go back and revisit this
issue. I'm encouraged by the fact that the Governor indicated that he's
certainly willing to go back and revisit this in the future. The stakes
are too high for us not to do that for our citizens within the state who
are currently without insurance. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing
me to make some brief comments. I look forward to working with you as
part of AARP in any way that I can.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, sir.
Anyone else? Yes, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you very much, Mr.
Chairman. My name is Adam Searing. I'm the Health Care Director for the
North Carolina Justice Center. I think there's been a lot of great
debate in this Committee today. I think a lot of great points have been
made with both these amendments. I just want to point out one thing for
you all. Folks who are saying don't expand Medicaid keep pointing to
this audit that says we overspent money in the Medicaid program. Really
this shouldn't be as a surprise to anybody who's been in this room for
the past several years. I'll just quote and let that be my remarks.
Former Republican lawmaker and former DHHS Secretary Lanier Cansler.
Back in August 2011 he said, when you all proposed a budget and passed
that budget for the Department of Health and Human Services for the
Medicaid program, he said to you all, quote, it's really just going to
be next to impossible to achieve this budget. And I'm not sure where the
Legislature will go with that. The fact that this budget plays into next
year means that next year is going to be a difficult year as well. So
then we had some more discussion about the budget in Medicaid. And
Secretary Cansler, former Republican lawmaker Lanier Cansler, wrote a
letter to this General Assembly, again in 2011, saying the aggressive
budget cuts mandated by the General Assembly's budget are unreasonable
and unattainable. So then we come to this year, and we have an audit
that says we went over budget in the Medicaid program. Well, I think we
all know why we went over budget. So I don't see that as much of an
argument for not expanding Medicaid coverage to our poorest citizens in
this state. I think that some of the Representatives made the point most
clearly today when they said, how are we going to look our constituents
in the eye? And I've been around the state a lot as well. Who are coming
to us January 1, 2014, saying, in a majority of the country I can get
health care coverage. But here in North Carolina I can't because of a
decision made by the General Assembly. So I'll just leave you with that.
Thank you very much for allowing me to speak. I appreciate it [SPEAKER
CHANGES]Thank you, sir. Anyone else? Yes, ma'am. [SPEAKER CHANGES]I'm
Brenda Cleary and I'm a proud North Carolinian. But I was glad to see
North Carolina AARP here, because I worked at the AARP Public Policy
Institute in Washington for three years looking at the health of our
country. In my past practice, my nursing career spanned 40 years. And in
my past practice I was a geriatric nurse. In that capacity, all of my
patients I served were insured by Medicare. But many of them had over
the course of their lifetimes either, unlike most of us in this room,
gone without health insurance or had spotty health coverage. And it's
almost impossible to do prevention for diabetes and heart disease. It's
a life span proposition. So that's why I'm really very concerned about
how we're moving forward in North Carolina. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]Thank you. Yes ma'am. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Hi, my name is Sarah. And
I just became a citizen in ?? America. I came from Korea, who has 100%
insurance. I never though about ?? who's going to have insurance and
who's not going to have insurance. And I don't think you don't care

Not paying a lot of money, getting paid a lot of money, and doesn’t have
insurance that’s going to be unstable. I had an experience when I was in
pregnancy, I couldn’t enroll insurance company because I have to pay
$1500 a month to cover my pregnancy tests and everything, and I have to
pay $10,000 for entire pregnancy when I was 30. I’m willing to go back
to work.  I’m willing to be working, but I was not able to work. So if
you support a short period of time, I will be so fortunate that I can
get support from my state or from my country. And people who are in
their 20s or 30s who are healthy, sometime they never check their
physicals because they don’t have any insurance. They don’t know they
are diabetics.  They don’t know they have high blood pressure because
they never had a physical exam for ten years. I hope everyone can do the
physical at least.  I’m an MP student.  I’m willing to work for
under-served population.  I’m willing to let them come into my office
and do the physical exam so at least they know what they are and what
their blood pressure number is, what blood sugar number is, so that they
can check their body at least once a year. They can keep themselves
healthy for the future. So for three years support will be good for some
people to take the physicals, take their blood sugar.  It’s not going to
cost a lot of money, but this bill supporting entire state. So thank you
for talking here and thank you for Chairman and I support three years.
It’s going to be a lot of money to support a lot of people.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, ma’am. Representative Dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I appreciate it.  I just have to respond to
what Mr. ?? said. The fact of the matter is, when we came in majority
two years ago, we inherited a hole in the Medicaid budget that proved to
be over $600 million. We didn’t create that.  That’s what we were facing
and we resolved that hole in the Medicaid budget with no cuts to beds.
No beds were eliminated in this state. No optional services were
eliminated in the state of North Carolina and we have one of the richer
programs. And there were no rate reductions for physicians. So we made
sure to keep access up. We did all of those thing and were able to find
sufficient savings and, frankly, put the money up to fix that hole.  Now
that we’re getting additional things that we had to address the
following year.  Thankfully, they weren’t as much. But a big portion of
that was mismanagement from past years, from community supports and
other programs, where we had to provide one-time money to fix things
that were frankly, off the budget and had never been on the budget. We
did those things and I also think that there are great things that have
been going on that we’ve tried to move forward. If you look in the last
07-10, actual growth in Medicaid, the actual program itself and get down
to the core program, the average for the four years is 3.5 percent.
That’s the lowest of any place in the nation. So we have things that we
have been working on for two years to fix.  We’ve got more to do. I
applaud the department for example they released.  I think this last
week, an RFI requesting additional innovations from folks all around the
state to put forth additional ideas.  I think this general assembly will
be looking forward to looking for additional things to do, innovative
things to do with the Medicaid program.  We’re on the right track. We
have solved out problems.  We have more problems we’ve got to solve and
then we can take a look at where we are after that in terms of
expansion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We recognize Representative Insko, and then Representative Burr, and
then I think we are ready to vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Aside, I’m really glad to join
Representative Dollar in supporting Community Care Network of North
Carolina.  It is one of the best models in the nation.  Our growth rate
is 3.5 percent. It has been that low, really a model that other states I
hope will endorse. Those of you who have worked with me over the last
ten or fifteen years, know that I’ve been heavily involved in Medicaid,
mental health care…</p>

<p id="90:00">
There are people with mental health and developmental disabilities,
addiction disease. One of the great tragedies I think of our efforts to
reform that system was the fact that we didn't make any, that we didn't
put any money into our system to care for people who didn't have health
insurance. It is very hard to get a provider to provide healthcare,
mental health, addiction disease, developmental disabilities if they
don't get paid for it. Providers just can't provide free care to very
many people. And what we've seen is this huge increase in people going
into our jails and prison system and sitting in our emergency rooms,
that's because we're not putting money into services for people who
don't have any insurance.
People who have Medicaid coverage and are fortunate enough to have
private sector insurance for mental health care are pretty stable and
for the most part not revolving in and out of our system. This expansion
of Medicaid would cover a lot of those people and I guess one of my main
goals in expanding Medicaid is making sure that those people between the
ages of 19 and 64 who have mental illness, currently don't have any
insurance, would actually have access to care for the first time in a
long time. So I'm going to vote against the bill not to move forward
with this, I think it's a bad mistake and I know we can do better and I
know our state, this is an option that we should be - this should be an
option that we accept and embrace and fix, but we should do it. So I'm
going to vote no on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Burke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I just will simply ask for the
members support. I will not repeat all the points that have been made,
very valid points from Representative Dollar, Representative Avila,
Representative Fulgum and others as to why this is the right direction
for the state of North Carolina. And I would ask with all the unknowns,
with all the uncertainty that quite frankly the federal government
created this mess and much of the unknown and still today there are as
we talked about, Representative Bakersfield, many unknowns, and we
shouldn't put our citizens of this state at risk for those unknowns and
future general assemblies and I would ask members to support the
legislation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair could we have a show of hands please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. The chair will entertain a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would appreciate it if whoever makes a motion would
re-refer this bill to the insurance committee, it would give us another
place, another group of people to discuss it, another time for more
information to come in. Everyday we're getting more information from the
press about things we didn't understand, and I think that would really
be a benefit to us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think - thank you Senator or representative. I think
that we can refer to the floor and it would be up to the speaker then to
put it to another committee if he wishes. Representative Dollar?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I move for a favorable report for the proposed house
committee substitute for senate bill 10 and I believe, excuse me senate
bill four, 10 comes later. Senate bill four, and I believing the serial
referral to appropriations had already been struck.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Right. Unfavorable to the original?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Unfavorable to the original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Show of hands has been asked. All those in favor
raise your right hand or any hand. Thank you. Those opposed? 16 aye's, 7
no's, the aye's have it and the motion passes and the bill will be
reported to the floor. Thank you all for attending, this meeting is
