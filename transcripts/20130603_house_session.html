Dear God, as those who bear the mantle of leadership for the people of

I wanna give you, for planning purposes, some things to think about. The

next two days. We’ll work on the session on Thursday. There is a
possibility right now slight but a possibility that we’ll also have
session on Friday morning. There will clearly be votes on Monday night.
The budget will be before us on Wednesday and Thursday of next week. The
chair will anticipate those to be very long sessions. If history is any
guide, probably somewhere around the order of 5-6 hours. So, I would
expect both Wednesday and Thursday potentially being lengthy sessions.
The budget will be published over the weekend. That will be substantial,
I believe the budget that will come out of the.</p>

of the committee on Tuesday and consistent with the rules we set forth
in 2011 there will be a 48 hour period after the conference with the

[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mister Speaker I move that we the House do adopt the
conference report for House Bill 10 and just by way of explanation I'll
try to keep it brief this evening that the Senate after a number of
weeks did come back to the House's position.  The language that you see
in the House bill now is the language as we passed it in different
sections of House bill 817.  So it is consistent with what this general
assembly has sent out of the chamber twice so we're glad to see it back
in the conference report and I would just for the sake of our friends
over in Garner I would just add a quick note that under no circumstances
whatsoever did we ever intend to bill the ??.  That will not happen.  It
won't happen mainly for financial reasons but if it takes additional
action action in the general assembly sometime in the distant future we
will be back here to that.  But that route will not be billed.  But this
will allow us to move forward with an important project.  We appreciate
your support for the conference report.

question before the House is the motion to adopt the conference report
for House bill 10.  All in favor vote aye.  All opposed vote no.  The

[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the bill as amended. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mr. Speaker, members of the House. I'll try to keep it short. This is
really the third in a series of bills that we have been working on in a
bi-partisan effort over the last several years to reform North
Carolina's mental health system. We started out with the House Bill 916,
back in 2011, which was a bi-partisan effort to expand the 1915B which
is mental health waiver for Medicaid, and C which is the developmentally
disabled part of a Medicaid waiver, statewide. We've done a project,
many of you are familiar with PBH down in south central part of the
state, was a nationally recognized model for mental health reform. The
General Assembly, ?? the department with the cooperation of the
administration at the time decided to expand that statewide, we did a
bill last year to try to clean up a number of issues that had been
identified in the implementation. This bill, this Senate Bill 208 is
actually an extension, or the third really in a series of bills to fully
operationalize that 1915BC waiver and have it be a success for us. Not
only in terms of trying to curb costs and save resources, but more
importantly to better allocate our resources in the areas of mental
health and intellectual and developmental disabilities so that more
individuals can actually receive services. Unless you want me to attempt
to go through the details of the bill, I can simply tell you that we've
worked with the department on it, I've got a whole bunch of letters here
from both the LMENCOs as well as the providers who are fully on board
with this legislation. They're looking forward to it. It helps everyone
concerned who is both from the provider's side as well as the LME side,
LMENCO side, in terms of having more effective governments and ensuring
the success of this waiver for long term. Be happy to answer any
questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insko, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
lady is recognized to debate the bill as amended. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members, this bill really makes explicit a lot of
issues that were implicit in the bill before. There's always been a
tension between the local LMEs and the state department. In reform, we
intended for the local LMEs to make local decisions, but for the state,
the department at the state level to ensure that there was a state-wide
system. And I'll just give you one example, when we transferred them to
the NCOs, we really needed all the backroom functions to be uniform, so
that providers that provided services in more than one LME wouldn't have
to have different forms to fill out. They would all the be the same. But
because of the historical independence of the old area programs in the
LMEs, the department felt like it didn't have the authority to force
everybody to take the PBH model, even though House Bill 916 said that
the NCOs would be, would conform to the PBH model. So this bill really
does just give the department, very clearly states to the department, we
want this to be a state-wide system. We want good local decisions to be
made at the local level, but some things need to be state-wide and
that's the main thing that this bill does and I support it. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. If not, the question before
