us to sign it or just I mean circle the name.
[speaker changes] Representative Floyd, the chair examined the
possibility whether we can take a voice vote.  There are rules that
prevent us from doing that and now that we have that we need to make
certain that the ballots that were cast were correct.  Hopefully, there
was only, they were filled out properly, but we have to in fact confirm
that they were filled out correct as per the rules.  It should be brief
however.

?? Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The House will come to order.  Representative Moore is recognized for a
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Speaker, the committee having counted the votes, James L. Holmes,
Jr., receiving 113 votes in favor of his election to the UNC Board of
Governors, I move that his election be approved by the full House of
Representatives.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Members, just as a point of information 94 of them were signed and the
candidate was circled, 19 were not.  As stated earlier the chair assumes
that the member just simply assumes since there was one choice there was
no need to circle it so we are assuming that is a valid vote for the
candidate for a total of 113.  The question before the House is the
confirmation of the Board of Governors Election.  All those in favor
will vote aye, opposed will vote no.  The Clerk will open the vote.  The
Clerk will let the machine record the vote.  113 having voted in the
affirmative and none in the negative, the motion passes.  This has to be
read a third time, this will be a voice vote.  The question before the
House is the confirmation of the Board of Governors Election.  All those
in favor will say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Aye
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
All opposed say no.  The ayes have it.  The Board of Governors election
has been confirmed and will be sent to the Senate.  Ladies and Gentleman
of the House, on behalf of all the members and on me personally, I would
like to extend the courtesies of the gallery to our most newly elected
member of the Board of Governors, Mr. Jim Holmes, please stand and let
us welcome you.  We are now back to the calendar, House Joint Resolution
113.  The Clerk will read
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
House Joint Resolution 113, A Joint Resolution honoring the North
Carolinians African Revolutionary War Patriots and supporting the
proposed national liberty memorial, the House resolves the Senate
concurring.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Gill is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Could I ask the Clerk to read its entirety
except for Section 1?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Whereas from 1775 to 1783 an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 slaves and free
persons served as soldiers, marines and patriots or provided civilian
assistance during the Revolutionary War and Whereas more than 250
African Americans from 41 of 100 counties in North Carolina and 11 of
the state's 13 congressional districts served in the Revolutionary War
and Whereas John Ellis and Curry Tan were two of the African Americans
from North Carolina that participated in our nation's struggle for
independence from Great Britian and whereas on April 27, 1776, John
Ellis enlisted as a private in the 10th regiment in the North Carolina
continental line and during his 2 1/2 year enlistment spent a year
guarding the North Carolina Legislature while it met in the town of
Hillsboro and whereas in August 1, 1782, Curry Tan who was born to a
free person of color enlisted as a private in Capt Hadley's company of
the 10th regiment of North Carolina Continental Line and served for
about 18 months and whereas in 1984 Congress enacted public law 98245
honoring the contributions of African Americans who served during the
American Revolution and whereas in 1986 Congress authorized the Black
Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial Foundation to establish the Black
Revolutionary War Memorial to honor the 5,000 courageous</p>

slaves and free black persons who served as soldiers or provided
civilian assistance during the American revolution. And whereas, in 1987
Congress enacted public law 100-265 authorizing the placement of the
memorial in the ?? area of Washington DC. And whereas, in 1988 the
national park service, the commission of fine arts, and the national
capital planning commission approved a site in constitution gardens for
the black revolutionary war patriots memorial and in 1996 approved the
final design. However, the memorial was not constructed and the
authority to do so lapsed.
And whereas, over the years, members of congress have continued to
introduce legislation supporting the memorial. Former senator Elizabeth
Dole co-sponsored a bill in 2007. And whereas, in 2012 the national
defense authorization act for fiscal year 2013 was signed into law with
an amendment authorizing the national mall liberty fund DC to build a
memorial honoring the African American revolutionary war participants.
And whereas, the efforts to build a memorial had generated interest in
genealogical research resulting in the publication of hundreds of books
over more than two decades reaffirming the significant contributions
made by African Americans in the post colonial period. And whereas, the
2008 publication entitled Forgotten Patriots, African American and
American Indian Patriots in the revolutionary war, contained the most
extensive list published so far of African Americans in the
revolutionary war.
Now therefore, may it be resolved by the house of representatives, the
senate concurring, section 1, the general assembly honors the memory of
the following 250 African American soldiers and patriots from North
Carolina who participated in the revolutionary war. Section 2. The
general assembly applauds the national mall fund DC, the members of
congress and many citizens and volunteers who have worked over the years
to establish the African American Revolutionary war memorial. Section 3.
The general assembly encourages volunteers to discover the names of
still unknown African American revolutionary war soldiers, sailors, and
patriots. In large, the body of knowledge about their lives and forward
the information to the national mall liberty fund DC for inclusion in a
database that will celebrate these unknown heroes. Section 4. The
secretary of state shall transmit certified copies of this resolution to
the governor of North Carolina, local superintendents of schools,
librarians, and historical societies. Section 5. This resolution is
effective upon ratification.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker and members of the general assembly.
Most of you are aware of the fact that this month is black history
month. And it's quite an honor for me to ask you to support this
resolution honoring African American slaves and free persons from North
Carolina who fought for independence, liberty, and justice for all
during the American revolution.
Thousands of slaves, African Americans, sought freedom generations
before the modern civil rights movement that we know of. As was read in
the resolution, from 1775 to 1783, an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 African
American slaves and free persons fought or provided other assistance to
the American war effort.
I am going to share with you a little bit about the composition of the
250 African Americans who have been identified. Five percent of the
5,000 African Americans who were a part of the revolution fought from
North Carolina. 210 are connected to 41 counties and 12 congressional
districts in this state. 109 were known with known residence are tied to
17 counties in the first congressional district. 101 are tied to the 27</p>

...counties in the second, tenth, twelfth and thirteenth congressional
district. Of those counties, the total number of recognized or
identified African-American are 30 from Halifax County, 23 from North
Hampton County, 18 from Granville County, and 13 from Franklin County.
But those of you that do not have a copy of the resolution, you would
see that there are 250 identified African-American soldiers from North
Carolina, and they are listed by name, or at least identified associated
with their slave master. Today I’m encouraging the North Carolina
General Assembly to approve this resolution honoring the history and
voice support for the National Liberty Memorial. Thank you, I commend
this resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollar, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I rise to speak on this because I’ve had occasion to study the Battle of
Yorktown quite a bit over the years as sort of an amateur historian.
That is an amazing battle, as you know, the culminating battle of the
Revolution. The role of African-Americans in that battle is rather
extraordinary. Most people are familiar with John Armistead, who later
because John Armistead Lafayette who was actually a double agent. He
worked for Lafayette in Washington’s spy ring. He was probably one of
the most successful double agents in American spy history, really. If
you go to the spy museum in DC sometime, you’ll see an accounting of his
rather remarkable work. In addition to that, there were African-American
troops who were working on deepening and extending the trenches in
October, well September and October of 1781 when the British made an
attempt to break out of Yorktown by land. Those African-Americans held
off British regiments for quite some time. Hand to hand combat and at
the time they were mainly equipped with shovels and hoes until American
reinforcements could come to the scene and seal the breach and that
basically sealed the fate of the British in Yorktown since they could
not escape to the sea. Another occasion was really the final death knell
of the battle when redoubts number nine and ten needed to be taken. The
French were assigned redoubt number nine, the Americans were assigned
number ten. In that, troops from the Rhode Island regiments, I believe
the Rhode Island First, were actually hand selected by Benjamin Lincoln
and under the command of Alexander Hamilton. They went in with just cold
steel at night and they outperformed the French so the Americans were
very happy about that along with Lafayette. They performed just
tremendously in the lead forces in taking that redoubt number ten which
closed the gap and sealed Cornwallis's fate. It was actually very
shortly after that, a matter of a couple of days before the surrender
actually took place. And the other things I would mention is, I think
there are some historians now that believe that because of the roles
were done, and maybe up to 20% of Washington’s force at Yorktown was
actually African-American. Some of the numbers over the years have been
underestimated, but clearly they did a tremendous job in terms of
helping win that battle and win freedom for all of us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Horn, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I couldn’t let another opportunity pass to quote
Winston Churchill. When once asked by a young American standing outside
number ten, Mr. Churchill, what is the secret to your success, he
responded with “Study history, for in it lie all the secrets of
statecraft.” It is history truly which we are celebrating here today and
the suggestion of the monument in Washington DC. Washington DC, our
nation’s capital, is a city of monuments. This particular monument which
is being paid for by private funds.</p>

those of us who would support these as monuments come together, we're
not asking the government to give us anything but permission. Give us
opportunity that great issue that really dominates the American
landscape is opportunity. So I urge my fellow members of the House to
support this bill and to honor its intent that we study history. Thank
you very much.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Mr. Speaker, I'd just like to take the opportunity to thank you sir, for
the formal recognition of the legislative prayer caucus. Many of you are
probably aware that just about the end of the 2011 session we had a
group of at least 36 Representatives and Senators that met with many
many hundreds of citizens across North Carolina out on the State Capitol
grounds and basically signed a resolution saying that we wanted to
follow in the pattern of the Congressional prayer caucus, which I'm sure
many of you are familiar with that was established back in 2005. And I'm
not gonna go into a lot of details, there'll be more forthcoming about
we'll be  meeting. I'll invite anyone that would be interested to join.
But I did just want to celebrate the moment, and again Mr. Speaker,
we're very pleased that North Carolina was indeed one of the first
states in the country to want to establish this legislative prayer
caucus, and now we are formally recognized as a caucus. Thank you sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Jeter please state your purpose.

Point of personal privilege Mr. Speaker?
