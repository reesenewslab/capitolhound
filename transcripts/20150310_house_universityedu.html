  Thank you for being here. This is our first meeting. It’s a little
different than the past. The Education Committee used to be all as a
whole and this year we have it separated into three different groups,
the University, the K-12 and the community college and we’ll be
focusing, of course, on bills dealing with the University system. We
will not go through and do the first day of school thing where everybody
tells us their name. If we don’t know each other’s names by now we might
better find a new profession, but we’ll start off, we’ll introduce the
pages and actually I’m gonna let them introduce themselves. If you will
please stand up and tell us your name and where you are from and who
your sponsor is, and we’ll start with the young lady on the right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, thank you all for being with us. We appreciate
your service and we hope that you take something away from this week and
hopefully meet some new folks and make some new friends and again thank
you for being with us. We’ll also take a moment to recognize our
Sergeant at Arms. We have Charles Godwin, Dean Mashburn and Joe Crook.
Thank you all for being with us this morning. That being said we will
move to the first bill and that is House Bill 19, waive tuition for
fallen officers. We have a PCS that needs to be adopted. I need a
motion. Representative Jonathan Jordan makes the motion to adopt the
PCS. All in favor, signify by saying aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed, no. The ayes have it and the PCS is
adopted. Representative Graham, come forth and present the bill and the
floor is yours. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair and it’s a
pleasure to be here this morning with a committee and I’m kinda nervous.
The first bill of the first meeting of a new committee, so I don’t know
how to take this but I’ll get through it. House Bill 19, I’m to present
this to you this morning and let me say again, it’s a pleasure to be
with you. House Bill 19 is, and the title basically tells you what this
bill is all about. It’s fairly straightforward. This bill adds legal
guardian and legal custodian to those individuals who would be
recipients of obviously free tuition at our state’s university when our
guardian has fallen, has died as a result of service as a firefighter, a
police officer, anyone in law enforcement. This bill has a lot of
support throughout the state. The North Carolina Sheriff’s Association,
the North Carolina Chief of Police supports this legislation, the North
Carolina Law Enforcement Officer’s Association, the Fraternal Order of
Police, the North Carolina Firefighter’s Association has endorsed and
supports this legislation and you can see the language in Section 1, it
basically has added legal guardian, legal custodian, and it applies to
those individuals who are between the ages of 17 to 24 years of age.
That is the bill, just straightforward, plain and simple. There is no
fiscal impact on our budget. Actually it’s negligible. I have that
information and it’s zeroed out through 2020 so there’s no fiscal impact
on our state budget and at this time if you have any questions I’ll be
glad to entertain those questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Are there any
questions from the members? Representative Jordan. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Representative Graham, the language says legal
custodian, so could that be foster parents cause they would have legal
custody. Custody’s lower than guardianship or adoption, so would that be
foster care? That kind of? [SPEAKER CHANGES] You know what,
Representative Jordan, that’s a great question and if I could defer to
staff on that, Mr. Chairman, I would. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely.
Staff, could you assist Representative Graham with that, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Representative Jordan, foster parents do not have
legal custody. Foster parents are granted physical custody. Usually the
local Department of Social Services has legal custody of the child so
that would not include foster parents. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Go ahead
Representative Graham. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I just wanted to thank staff
for that response. Thank you, Representative Jordan, that was a good
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Fraley

  Yes, I wondered how the university system felt about this? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Graham. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me just, this bill
came to my attention from a university, UNC Pembrooke. There was a young
man, we had an officer who died in the line of duty two summers ago and
obviously this young man went to enroll in the university and was
looking forward to having this benefit and, of course, it was not one
that he could take advantage of. My university strongly supports this
and I would feel that the constituent universities in this state would
not have any objection because I haven’t had anyone call me raising any
objections to the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Fraley, I see
we have a representative here from the university system. If you would,
we’ll allow him to come forward and speak and hopefully he can speak for
the university system. If you would just identify who you’re with,
obviously the university system, but your name for the record. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Sure. Drew Morrets with the University of North Carolina
General Administration. We have no opposition to this bill and certainly
hope we never have to use it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Are there further
questions? Seeing none, if there’s a motion and, Representative, do you
have a question Representative Martin or was you wanting to do the
motion. Okay, I’m gonna get Representative Jackson cause he was first
and Representative Jackson if you will make the motion, the motion that
I’m assuming you may want to make is a favorable report, unfavorable to
the original, favorable to the proposed committee substitute and a
serial referral to Appropriations. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I read your mind. I knew that was it, and members you
hear the motion. All those in favor signify by saying aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed, no. The ayes have it. The
bill passes and it will be sent to appropriations. Thank you,
Representative Graham. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank
you members. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All right, we have one more bill before
us today and this bill is for just discussion today and the chairs
believe that we will vote on this bill in a future meeting but there was
some questions. We thought it would be good for the membership to hear
the reasons for this bill. It came from program evaluations and we have
with us Representative Hurley and come on up and we will allow you to
present House Bill 72 which is SOG pilot project standards and
Representative Lucas, thank you for being with us and Representative
Carney is in here as well and she’s a bill sponsor and Representative
Turner so thank you all and we’ll turn the floor over to you all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. Good morning. This bill did come
out of Program Evaluations and I was not on there at the time this study
was done, but they did a pilot program and there were five pilots that
were done in North Carolina about the driver’s education. When they got
the results back they could not use the data at all because so many
questions were unanswered so from there we thought when there are so
many pilot programs in North Carolina that it certainly wouldn’t hurt to
have, that we need da da da da. So that’s how it came about and I’m
going to ask staff, if you will let staff explain. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure, and whoever’s going to assist them turn over to your, okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, members, I’m John Turcott, Director of
the Program Evaluation Division. As Representative Hurley explained this
bill came about because of two projects PED did. The first was driver
education. At the time the General Assembly was considering offering a
driver ed through online approaches and some of the districts were
already using online to some extent and the issue was would it be more
economical, more effective to use online. Well, this was part of a
reform. It was passed with driver ed in 2011 and the state board of
Education and DPI were to do this pilot project and test out the concept
in at least five districts. Well, without being disrespectful to my
colleagues at DPI, they did not do the pilot project very well. The
design for the project was more or less a repetition of the special
provision to do the pilot and they got volunteer districts to
participate and they told the districts that if you volunteer you have
to use your funds allocated for driver ed to conduct the pilot, and

  They also said that the vendors that would do the pilot had to follow
standards used by North Carolina virtual school. At the time North
Carolina virtual school had not adopted those standards. I could go on
at length, but there are a number of technical flaws as well in the
statistical methodology that should’ve been followed that was not
followed. As a result of that the School of Government did come in
toward the end of that project and helped, tried to get DPI some better
data and they were able to develop a comparison of the test results of
those taking online, those taking mixed online and traditional classroom
but the issue was cost-effectiveness and because DPI did not collect
cost data the School of Government couldn’t come to any solutions about
which approach or mixed approach was cost effective. The joint committee
took a dim view of them not having findings as a result of the pilot
project, this is my joint evaluation committee, and that was the first
instance of this. The second instance in a formal way, the General
Assembly required a pilot study of overnight respite services by adult
daycare facilities and DHHS used a methodology, user satisfaction and
there was a lot of self-selection by us in this, of course, and there
was really no formal concept that there were testing. It was just a
vague concept. They should’ve had some sort of logic model of the
concept they were testing. Overnight respite is where the caregivers are
allowed to put their loved one in the facility for a brief period of
time to give the caregiver some respite. The sum and substance was that
you couldn’t tell from the pilot whether or not if you scale this up
statewide would it be a worthwhile undertaking and what would be the
implications if you did scale it up statewide and in general members
oftentimes the General Assembly wants to do pilot projects to test
concepts of one kind or another and so what this bill does is it
requires the School of Government to convene a working group, a
technical working group of experts who understand statistical
methodology and how to do pilot projects and make a preliminary report
to our joint committee in December of what they found, then by December
of  develop formal standards to recommend to the Office of State Budget
and Management for adoption. School government can’t regulate, can’t do
any sort of executive function, but then they would be doing the
development of the standards and the Office of State Budget and
Management would adopt those standards. Okay, so then what would happen
after that? If the General Assembly wanted to do a pilot project, all
you’d have to do is say a pilot project and the law itself executing.
The law would say if you do one, if the General Assembly says pilot
project these standards are required to be used. Now, of course, if you
want to be more emphatic, you could say do them consistent with the
standards adopted by the Office of State Budget and Management. If you
did not want the standards used you could say very clearly say not
withstanding whatever the section is in the law. I don’t know of a
circumstance where you’d want to do that but there may be. That’s the
essence, Mr. Chair, I’d be glad to answer any questions. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Are there any questions from the members? Representative Brown?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just had a quick questions. Why
are we only having this for discussion today because to me this seems so
clearcut, so common sensical, so necessary that I just had that
question, thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brown, we do
intend to vote on this and perhaps at the next meeting and there were
some members who had some questions, maybe that were not familiar with
what was going on in PED and so we do intend to vote on this and
probably at the next meeting cause we do not have a large stack of bills
in this committee. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Johnson. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I’d just like to make a comment. I think this is such a novel
idea that we, North Carolina collects all kind of data but only parts of
it are useful. I think this is a very good idea whether it costs money,
whether it

  Cost money not to labor that. It’s just that if you go to the trouble to
do something you ought to be able to use the results. Thank you, Mr.
Chair. Mr. Chair, may I ask one more question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes,
ma’am. I was just conferring with staff, but yes, Representative
Johnson. [SPEAKER CHANGES] What is the reason that it would take to
December of 2016 for formal standards? I mean, does it actually take
that long? I mean, they know when they do. I mean, they have a history
of what’s already happened. Would it take that long to go through the
data and figure out? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Cherkot. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Johnson, the School of Government submitted a formal
proposal to our Joint Legislative Program Evaluation Oversight Committee
before the committee recommended this legislation and their idea was
that it would take quite a while to go about getting experts together,
convening a work group and the committee wanted to take a look at
whatever the methodology they were using to make sure it was gonna
produce something useful and so the idea of having a two stage was
appropriate and also it would allow state agencies that have ideas on
pilot projects, who knows what those ideas would be. Probably most of
them would be good, but it would give them an opportunity to see where
this is headed and provide input to the School of Government and
ultimately to the Office of State Budget and Management before they
adopt the rules as required by this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And
Representative Brown also wanted to tell you as well that according to
staff there needs to be just a bit of cleanup to the bill and they
mentioned a possible amendment that needed to be worked on and I think
this is the only stop for the bill and I think it goes straight to the
floor from here. Is there a serial referral? [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Needs to be. So we’ll make sure we’ll get it ready and
that’s why it’s just for discussion today as well. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Representative Brown. We’ll come back to you, Representative
Hurley. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. As I look at these 10
recommendations, I guess my question is are we doing a good job in
communicating the reason that we feel a test pilot is necessary and that
we go through these criteria as we should before, you know, we kinda.
Such an appalling result of this pilot study, and I don’t wanna just
blame it all on the agencies. Are we doing our due diligence? Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Those 10 questions, Representative Brown, those 10
questions came from a very good report that was done by the Fiscal
Research Division several years ago. They too had concerns about pilot
project efficacy and Chris Nordstrom from the Fiscal Research Division
wrote a technical document and had those suggestions for legislators,
questions to ask if a pilot project was being proposed. Now, to try to
head off a question that we got this in program evaluation was well, if
Chris Nordstrom and the Fiscal Research Division has already laid out
these 10 standards, why do we have to have the School of Government
develop standards. Well, they were not written as standards. They were
written as suggested guidelines for legislators to ask and they
certainly are not the formal, very technical standards that would come
about as the result of this process, so yes, indeed, if you do have an
agency or a stakeholder group coming to you, these are the questions
that should be answered and if the standards are adopted they should be
taken care of, but before you do or authorize a pilot project to get
clarity as to what it intends to do, those questions are in order at
that time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hurley, I think you had a
comment you wanted to add. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. I
just wanted to tell you that we do have a companion bill in Senate, it’s
Senate Bill 91 and it is already in the Appropriations Based Budget over
there. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Are there any other comments or
questions? Representative Jordan? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chair. I’m just curious, the funds that are requested for this, is there
a specific reason they’re asked to be non-reverting funds? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Well, I, appropriation questions always concern me. I wanna get
them right and correct. The School of Government

  Representatives are back there but let me suggest that when you make an
appropriation to the universities they may need additional time to do
this but just to put the on a strict reverting type of appropriation
should they have any need to correct those standards in the future
they’d have to come back and ask for additional appropriations, so that
was part of their proposal and the committee concurred in that. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr Chercot, would you like to recognize somebody in the
audience. I know you said someone was there and if you wish for any
extra explanation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, Dr. Maureen Brinner and Dr.
David Brown from the School of Government, they’re the ones that
developed this. Dr. Brinner I think took the lead in it and Dr. Brown is
the liason for the school of government. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If you will
just identify yourself for the record please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, my
name is Professor Maureen Brinner. I’m with the School of Government at
UNC Chapel Hill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And David Brown also with the School
of Government. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the question, unfortunately
I don’t want to, for the same reason as Mr. Chercot, I’m not familiar
enough with the technicalities in terms of the budgetary terms, so the
most I can say in terms of that specific item is we would try to get a
response to you as quickly as possible, but the length of the time that
we would use would really be in order to really convene together a group
of folks from state agencies, some of the national experts. There is a
lot of really exciting work going on with state legislatures right now
in terms of adopting these kinds of standards and we would want to make
sure that we put into place standards that would be useful for a long
time going forward and make sure we do it right, so that we wanted to
give ourselves enough time not to rush to put into place something that
would not be useful and I imagine that the budgetary statement is to
allow us to be able to do that fully, without any stops or additional
requests, although, again, I’m not professing technical expertise on
that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And I also found an answer from our staff.
That’s why I always tell them they’re in charge. Representative McCraw,
if you will give them the explanation that you just shared with me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This really is just reiterating the comment you just
heard, but the appropriations for the 2015-16 year because the timeline
contemplated in the bill would have report on this in the Fall of 16 it
requires the funds, or it keeps the funds from reverting so that they
can complete their work in the fall without a new appropriation being
made in next year’s budget. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does that answer the
question? Any further questions? Seeing none, as stated there is some
little cleanup we need to do to the bill. I expect it will be in the
next meeting and we’ve already had the discussion today so we can just
have it up on deck first thing next time, so with no other bills before
us, this meeting is adjourned.
