[Speaker changes.] ...representatives.  Representative Holloway,
Chair... Representative Brisson, Horn, ??????, and Elmore.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Horn, please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] To explain the bill.
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Speaker.  Ladies and gentleman, I
move for concurrence to a... post conference committee substitute on
Senate Bill 812, replace common core standards with North Carolina's
higher academic standards.
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Speaker.  As you know, we worked
long and hard on this particular bill...both the Senate and the
House...this is a coming together of a commitment to exercise North
Carolina's right and obligation to create and establish academic
standards for our public schools. This conference report melds the two
versions, I think, quite well.  There are...I'll just point out a couple
of things.  One is that this bill does insist that North Carolina work
towards achieving the highest academic standards in the country. That we
are creating a commission of eleven members, that's a change from the
House version, which was nine members.  That we are not taking anything
off the table from the standpoint of being able to access the best ideas
in the country...to insure that we have high academic standards and that
we took the privacy part out of...student privacy part out of the bill
because that was covered very well in the bill that was signed into law
very recently by the Governor...it came out of the Senate...Senator
Barefoot's bill. Pretty much, that's it.  We did add principals and
superintendents to the list of those who should...or we suggest should
participate in creating the new standards but it is very clear that
we're not going backwards.  It's very clear that the standards we
presently have remain in effect so there is stability and promise and an
exercise of North Carolina's right to cr...constitutional right to
establish its own standards. I ask for your support.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Cotham, please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] To see if the gentleman will yield for a question.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Horn, does the gentleman yield.
[Speaker changes.] I yield.
[Speaker changes.] Gentleman yields.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Speaker and Representative Horn,
just looking through the online version, I wanted to ask about the
smarter balance consortium assessments.  Will those assessments be
allowed with this conference report.
[Speaker changes.] We have taken nothing off the table.  We don't
prohibit the commission from looking at anything, wherever this state
can see the best possible standards that works for this state...that's
allowable.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] To speak on the bill, Mister Speaker?
[Speaker changes.] The lady is recognized to debate the motion.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Speaker.  Members, as many of you
know, I have been a part of this Common Core debate for over four and a
half years when this idea was nationally brought about to all state
legislatures. I was one of the ones, along with some of our Senators who
are no longer here, to really work on this issue so I feel I have spent
a lot of time, maybe too much time looking at this issue.  I do think
that it's really important that North Carolina has the best academic
standards.  I believe that the Common Core Standards are very good
standards and very much standards that are focused on student
achievement and really raising the bar for student performance and that
should be what we all want.  Sadly, this issue has been made extremely
political in the last few years. And that is extremely unfortunate
because we are talking about our children's education and their
curriculum. We are talking about very complex issues and many people I
have been concerned did not exactly understand. And so, although I'm
glad to see some of the changes that were made...I think there are some
good changes...I just get back to why are we really doing this?</p>

<p id="10:00">
and what is the real reason? Is this really to better education, or is
this more political in nature? And I worry that this is more political,
that this is against the federal government, that the Department of
Education, and if we throw in President Obama's name, then goodness.
So, I do think this is something that is not necessary. That it's a
solution looking for a problem that really doesn't exist. A problem that
we have created as the legislature, along with several other of our
southern states. And so, for those reasons I will vote no today.
I do think that the Common Core Standards, we've invested a lot of time,
we have invested a lot of money, and I think this sends a bad signal to
teachers, and to parents, and to students about what happens next. What
about all of the professional development, what about all the training,
what about all the supplemental instruction that goes, and is aligned
with Common Core? Are those items now irrelevant? What does this say to
our school system? And I think that it's not a fair burden to place on
our schools and on our teachers right now. Especially with so much else
that is going on.
I asked the question about the assessment piece, because assessments are
a big part of Common Core. There are different types of assessments.
North Carolina has focused a lot on what we call 'summative' assessments
that give just a final grade in the end. The Common Core, with the
smarter balance consortium looks at more formative, summative, and
benchmark assessments. Which I can tell you, as an educator myself and
as a parent, that's what we want for our children. Those are the type of
tests that will help children to actually grow and we can see where
problems are. And so, unfortunately I am not going to be able to support
this bill. I do encourage, and I appreciate the work that
Representatives Horn and Holloway especially have made on this, but I do
not believe this is a bill that we really need to focus on right now,
and we should not politicize our curriculum. So, I'll be voting no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
For what purpose does the gentleman from Craven, Representative
Speciale, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
While I respect our colleague, Representative Cotham, I have to disagree
with her. When we started this fight last year, and that's when it
started as far as I'm concerned, because I wasn't here prior to that.
When we started this fight, it did appear nationwide, or statewide, that
this was a partisan issue. It appeared that way.
Your folks in the schools system, your educators, they all said that
this is the greatest thing since sliced bread. As long as they were in
the public, as long as they were on the school grounds, as long as they
were around other educators, other teachers, they were going to spew the
DPI propaganda. But the minute we started getting them away from the
school, and talking to them one-on-one, those same educators told us
this was a terrible system. Those same educators, in many cases,
admitted that they are teaching something they know nothing about.
The entire Common Core program needs to be replaced. We need to replace
it with North Carolina program. Even, possibly, not necessarily in here,
I don't know the feeling of most of the Democrats in here, but I can
tell you that statewide, this is not a partisan issue, because even the
Democrat's children are coming home with Common Core homework.
Everybody's children are coming home with this stuff, and people are
getting angry on both sides of the aisle.
This should be a matter of concern for everybody in North Carolina.
We're losing a lot of our rights, day to day. We've got an issue on the
ballot in November about another right that we could end up giving away.
And to give away the sovereignty of our educational system, is something
we don't need to do.
Now, if this was a good program it would be a little harder to stand up
here and say we need to do away with it. But the evidence is in. We had
our study committee, so that we could educate ourselves on it, we talked
to people. We had people coming in from all areas of the educational
system, we had people coming in from all walks of life that were
familiar with the Common Core. And the bottom line is, it's a terrible
system</p>

<p id="15:00">
There may be some good things about it and though this bill will allow
them to use those things if they need to. Taking it out of the common
core system. There's just too many problems inherent in common core.
It's something we never should have accepted. The upside to this bill is
we are not going to beat up our educators and beat up our students,
changing to another system the way we did when this one was implemented.
It was implemented all at once and they were expected from day one to
change to a whole new program, a whole new way of teaching. This program
in many quarters of the country is a laughing stock. We need to get rid
of it. We need your support. Again, it's not a partisan issue. It
appeared to start out that way, but your kids are taking or your grand
kids are taking this and if you haven't done any time, spent any time to
look at this program and see what it really is, then please vote to get
rid of it because it is a terrible system and there are many states now
moving towards doing the same thing that we did, the same thing that
Indianapolis did and same thing that several other states are doing and
that is stepping away from this program. And if you remember correctly,
this program was accepted before it was even completed. This, DPI had no
idea what they were getting into when they accepted the program because
it wasn't complete yet. I ask for your support in getting rid of this
program. Please vote yes on this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what
purpose dose the gentleman from Stokes, Representative Holloway, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
has the floor to debate the motion to concur. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you Mr. Speaker. I just want to take just a moment to just address some
of the comments about his being politicized. I think President Obama was
referenced and, you know, if I look back at the history of common core
and how it came about, if I'm not mistaken, it came about from the
Governor's association. And I believe that Governor Jeb Bush, was
actually in charge of that association when it came about. So, I don't
know that this is clearly just politicized. I clearly heard from
parents, I heard from teachers, particularly in the subject of math.
That math was being taught just completely different in the schools.
Just adding and subtracting numbers was almost banished with common core
an it became more just word problems. And, I heard a lot of concern from
teachers. I heard a lot of concern from parents and students. This bill,
again, the state board is going to have a review next year. They were
gonna make changes next year whether we did anything or not. But, I bet
you recall getting a lot of emails blaming you or fussing at you to keep
common core, do away with common core. Well, we don't really have any
say in it. We never have. The state board, it's their purview and we
leave it under their purview, but we create a commission  and we put our
voice in it. We ask them to replace it and we have a board to keep us in
tune to what's going on. But, Mr. Speaker, we've debated this issue,
we've already went through this several times on the floor and I'd like
to make a motion please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman is recognized for
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I move the previous question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman from Stokes, having move the previous question.
The question before the House is the motion for the adoption of the
previous question. So many favoring the motion for previous question
will vote aye, those opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the vote.
The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. Sixty-two having
voted in the affirmative and forty-two in the negative. The motion for
previous question adopted per senate to the rules. The minority leader
and majority leader are each permitted three minutes of time to debate
the motion to adopt the conference report. Representative Hall, does the
gentleman wish to use the three minutes? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We'll not be
usin those three minutes.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Majority leader waves,
excuse me, Minority leader waves. Does the majority leader wish to use
the three minutes? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may speak up to three minutes to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
House, I think what we have in front of us today is a victory for the
people of North Carolina. I think this is a situation that shows that
democracy works. Yes, several years ago, common core became a part of
the curriculum in the state of North Carolina. It was told to us that it
would be something that would improve the curriculum  and help the
students to learn. But, after it became implemented, it became clear
that there were some flaws in the program. [end]</p>

<p id="20:00">
And so where did the effort to change common core begin? It didn't come
from the DPI. It didn't come from the teachers and the administrators.
It came from the parents. The parents began to express to us as
legislators that they had some concerns with common core and the way
that their children are learning or not being able to learn under this
new curriculum. And I think that what we did as legislators was listen
to the parents. The people who are out there trying to help their
students do their homework every night. And what we have done is respond
to the concerns of the parents of this state who want the best for their
children. I think that we need to reassess a lot of programs as time
goes by, to see, is it doing what we intended it to do. I think that
with this change to the common core, it will put in place a new higher
standard, a North Carolina standard, for our students in North Carolina,
is going to enable our students to learn in a way that will help them be
successful in life. I think it's a good deal. I think it's a reasonable
compromise and I urge every member to vote yes. Thank you. [SPEAKER

report for Senate bill eight twelve. Submitting favoring of the adoption
of the conference report will vote aye, those opposed will vote no. The
clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock the machine and record the

And the changes that are made by the Senate are, were very minor. And
just as refresh everybody's recollection, this bill helps to control
hazardous drug exposure for individuals working in hospitals with
anti-neoplastic therapy, such as chemo, chemotherapy. And, the
department of labor has the authority under the occupational safety
health act to enforce federal regulations on this. This would give the
commissioner of labor the authority to promulgate additional rules in
consultation with interested parties, such as hospitals and other folks
that deal with anti-neoplastic chemotherapeutic agents. I would that you
support the legislation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion? Further
debate? If not the question before the House is the motion to concur
with the Senate committee substitute for House bill six forty-four. So
many favoring adoption of the motion will vote aye, those opposed will
vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock the machine

present sense, Speaker of the House of Representative constitutes points
of law difference between the Senate and the House of Representatives on

of the House of Representatives. Representative Hasting chair,
Representative Soucek and Floyd. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Hastings, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Just to move
for adoption of the conference report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
has properly made his motion. The gentleman is recognized to debate the
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No reason to debate other than to say this has
been fully voted through an LRC committee and through the Senate and the
House and would appreciate your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Grier Martin, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you  very much
Mr. Speaker. Representative Hasting exacerbate, this is one of those
bills that's gotten a great bedding but it's been the subject of some
controversy as it's gone through the process. As the bill stands now,
there are many good things in it, but there's also some things that I
believe still tie the hands of our Governor too much when he goes to
select our next Adjutant general. And right now the Governor has, under
current law, the Governor has considerable flexibility. If we, if this
bill passes however, the Governor would have his hands tied in several
ways, some of which are good. You'll see, I think, Representative
Whitmire might talk some about it also, it would require the Governor to
consider federal recognition. Representative Whitmire knows more about
that than I do. That's a good thing. Overall North Carolina has been
blessed with good adjutants general. We've had a great National Guard
that has had next to no internal problems. Other states have not been so
lucky. So, should North Carolina ever have a misfortune of ever having
some internal problems, I want to make sure our Governor can reach
outside the state, if necessary, or to reach into folks with more active
component experience, to come in and help solve any problems that might
arise. I don't think that's going to be necessary, but I want the
Governor to be able to break that glass in case of some emergency that
pops up. This report in front of you, if it passes, would restrict the
Governor's ability to do that and limit it to too narrow a pull of
adjutant generals. I can say, this is one of those things that as we've
gone through the process, it's been a completely nonpartisan issue.
There's been proponents and opponents of both parties on this and so
it's been a nonpartisan delight to work both with and against you all on
this. In the end though, I'd urge you to vote no on this motion so the
conferees can go back to work. i think there's some issues that could be
resolved in a very, very prompt manner, come back to use with a
conference report that we can all vote on. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Whitmire, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Debate the bill, please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized
to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Folks as
you all know, I work considerable a whole lot in my role as a north com
liaison for emergency response with our National Guard. I, going back to
November, reached out to the National Guard bureau and many... [end]</p>

<p id="30:00">
Any stakeholders to get the facts and simply put representative Martin
has spoken very much what I was going to speak, but to bullet down and
to try and get away from the military language that sometimes you may
not necessarily understand. Limiting the eligibility pool to the extent
that the Senate's version does this I think is extremely poor policy for
many reason and here's a couple of them. Currently, and again, we have
an outstanding national guard and I want to keep it that way. We have an
eligibility pool for when - and I hope that's a long ways in the future,
that we're needing the governor needs to select another adjutant
general, between 30 and 35 people. But if we go back to 1986 what seems
like an eternity ago, Goldwater nickels items that put the military into
a joint context, elements of that are still being implemented. One of
which is general officer criteria, and the guard reserve always pretty
much follows the active component.
The active component has had the particular criteria for general officer
selection and federal recognition in place since 2008, it's not a matter
of if, it's a matter of when. and if we're not in session and that's
implemented, when that time comes, that eligibility pool of 30 to 35
will be shrunk to zero to two maybe three people to pick from. That
makes this poor policy. Well, okay, if you want to gamble with that vote
to concur. it needs to go back to conference and people to actually look
at this page of facts as to why it's not good. and with that I do ask
you to vote red to non-concur, and I'll add a couple more things.
This language as written will preclude some of our state's most likely
eligible qualified folks because if someone has been chopped to another
entity in the military outside the state as a guardsman at let's say
NORTHCOM, a joint force headquarters command, and took a follow on to
another joint force headquarters, that's the breadth and scope of
experience that the adjutant general needs. Well they would not have
been here through the last six years. There's many problems with this
bill. The intent of it was good, to put rigor and federal recognition
into the adjutant general criteria. But the way it is, the 99% of good
in this bill is absolutely trumped by what you have heard. You'll hear
some positives in the bill, there certainly are. We need to conference
those reasons and get those who literally trumped what we voted for
unanimously a few weeks ago, that went through our full committee
process. we need not let just a handful of votes veto the entire House's
unanimous vote from a few weeks ago. Thank you, I ask you to vote red.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bill Brawley please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Point of parliamentary inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker this is a conference committee report, if
we defeat it does that not mean this bill is just dead?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, representative Brawley if we fail to concur we are
still in the state of not concurring so we could reappoint the [??] to
negotiate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Szoka please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To the debate the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, like my
compatriot over here I also have - I'm a retired military officer,
active component, I think you all know that. Throughout my career I had
many opportunities to work with many different national guard units,
Hawaiian National Guard, Iowa, Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, and North
Carolina. In none of those cases where I was never in a supervisory
position, I was always in an advisory position or in training position.
Representative Whitmire has said that 99% of this bill is good, I think
100% of the bill is good.
The one issue with this bill that is at contentious with a minority of
the people who are on the conference committee is that the bill requires
the next adjutant general or the national guard of our state militia to
be selected from our national guard. There's a difference of opinion on
this. I think that that is the right and proper policy, I don't see it
as tying the governor's hands, I don't see it as limiting his ability to
pick someone who is fully qualified to lead our state's national guard.
There are others who would like to see this opened up to other
components of the armed services. Someone who, like myself maybe, who
had been retired from active service.</p>

Could meet that criteria. Others who are reserve officers, another major
component of armed forces could meet the criteria if this were not in
there. Thirty-four of the other states in this great union have a
similar legislation to this where it's mandated that the adjutant
general is picked from within the national guard. Our national guard
today is a highly professional, highly capable force. If you go back to
the seventies perhaps and the eighties, back before the volunteer army.
I will tell you that I served in the late seventies and there were
problems in the guard and there were a whole lot of problems in the
active component and there were problems in the reserve.
Immediately following Vietnam our military had huge immense problems,
all the components of armed services. To fix those problems, fix the
systemic issues within them, and I have full faith and confidence in our
national guard today and in the other components. And I have full faith
and confidence that in our current governor or any future governor will
find many qualified candidates to select to be the next adjutant general
whenever that occurs. I respectfully ask you to support this and vote
yes on the adoption.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Robert Brawley please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Speak on concurrence.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentleman. For 24
years I served in the North Carolina National Guard. Yes my name was
combat Bob, I was well known across the state because when I took over
as commander I did some things that had never been done in a guard
before. I was also as commander of the aviation section the only person
in the section with no combat experience. This bill potentially
restricts us, the North Carolina national Guard, to the point that if we
were going into combat we could be tying the governor's hands so that he
has to have a commander with no combat experience. I think we need to
vote this bill down, work on concurrence so that the governors done a
good job. Twenty-four years experience, I've seen a lot going on in the
North Carolina National Guard. We've had some good commanders, but if
we're going into combat we need the governor to be able to have somebody
that's been there, knows what they're doing and can lead with authority.
I urge you to vote no on concurrence.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Members, unless the response or the motion chooses
otherwise it's the intent of the chair to let representative Hastings
speak last on this. Any members wishing to speak on the motion please do
so, we have three on. Representative Floyd please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To speak on the conference [??].
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Speaker when we first looked at this, and being an
ex-military person, sometimes when you go outside the system to bring
someone in it creates chaos within the system. This is what we are
trying to do here, not trying to tie the governors hands, it's just look
at the motivation within the national guard so that person can believe
that there's an opportunity for him or her to rise to the highest level.
So I'm asking that we vote green on this.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Stam please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I have - my limited military experience was as a
private and a corporal. We've had three of our people who have served us
in high ranking officers and I think they probably know better than I
how we should vote on this. I would like to hear from representative
Larry Hall, Larry you were a major in the marine corp. Representative
Blust, weren't you an officer of some kind in the army? I know you had a
lot of shell shock, and maybe there's some others that I - sorry, sorry.
I'm not expressing an opinion, I would just like to hear the opinion of
those who have served as officers in the military on this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Cleveland please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] When this bill left the House, the governor the way it
was written had a large pool to draw from if he needed to. I could not
envision any...</p>

Governor of any state going out of his integral national guard to select
a commander, unless there was a problem. And conceivably there could be
a problem. We should not restrict a governor to having a 25 or 32, 30,
whatever it is, eligibility pool within the national guard and keep him
from selecting the best person to lead us. Another thing this conference
committee reported was instead of having one assistant adjutant general,
they want to have two. I'm not sure why, I wasn't on the conference
committee, but that makes absolutely no sense to me whatsoever. You have
a division commander, you have an assistant division commander. You
don't have a division commander with two assistants.
So there's other problems with the bill outside of the pool. And why the
portion was added for spouses and children, where did that come from?
Someone's special favor to somebody? I have no idea. It wasn't in the
bill when it went to the Senate, and it miraculously appeared. Why
should I think this? This always happens. But seriously, I do not think
we do the state of North Carolina a service if we restrict the governor
from being able to select the best person to lead our national guard. I
vote no please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Soka [SP] please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd like to ask representative Cleveland if he would
yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Cleveland, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Cleveland are you aware that the active
duty divisions do in fact have two assistant division commanders, one
for support, one for maneuver?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry Mr. Speaker I did not understand the
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Can the gentleman please restate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. Are you aware that active duty divisions do
have two assistant division commanders of equal rank, one for support
and one for maneuver.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I wasn't aware that the army needed two assistant
division commanders for the divisions, the marine corp doesn't.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentleman that was an exchange.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for your blessed and enlightened answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That was an exchange between an army officer and a
marine corp master gunnery sargent. Representative [??] Meyer please
state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Debate the bill a second time please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion a
second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Three quick points. I without any reservation
whatsoever 99.9% of the time the adjutant general should come from the
ranking file of the state national guard, period, dot. It's having that
opportunity if and when you had a situation where good order and
discipline had decayed for various reasons and there's many, I've seen
it in other states, history certainly proves this true. To where if a
governor whoever he or she may be at the time had to go outside of the
organization to put the train back on the tracks, the version we passed
in the House that could be conferenced into this addresses that and
fixes it very simply.
Number two, as a citizen soldier, citizen [??] air man, whether you're
guard, reserve or what have you, the Senate's language only requires the
adjutant general to have had only three years. Now granted they may have
a lot more than they really should be. When you're serving two masters,
your civilian employer, whether it's yourself or someone else and a
military commander, you really need to have someone who's walked in
those moccasins more than just a touch and go, to be that particular
leadership peace of knowing their people.
Number three, the two pieces that were added to this after it left the
House, again by unanimous vote, the addition of another assistant
adjutant general, in my opinion that's technical in nature, it's
federally funded by and large, don't miss the forest for the trees for
that. It's in the budget to the best of my knowledge and I've got the
paragraph unless it's fallen out. And the family support centers we can
put that elsewhere, but the reason for this bill was to put rigor into
the selection of the adjutant general that is valid, but again, it's
fouled up to the point right now that I ask you to vote red. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other members wishing to speak before the chair

Representative Hastings is recognized to debate the motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, Mr. Speaker. One thing I’d like to do is remind this body
that this is not my bill. This bill emanated from the men and women of
North Carolina who are in the North Carolina National Guard. They’re not
members of the Army Reserve, they’re not members of the Air Force
Reserve. They don’t have an ulterior motive of being the adjutant
general. They simply understood that for our state to move forward, we
needed to improve the process so we have federal recognition. And so
that we have the ?? of having a North Carolina member of the National
Guard serve as the adjutant general. No ulterior or partisan or
political motive. One other thing I would like for you to remember is
there is a requirement in this that makes this person who becomes the
adjutant general a North Carolina resident. A person who lives in North
Carolina, not someone from another state. And then finally just to
close, after reminding you again that this emanated from the men and
women of North Carolina in the National Guard, not the military but the
North Carolina National Guard, which is under a separate title of the
United State code. It is not a military unit. And finally, I just wanted
to remind the people of this body about the provision where the funds
appropriated would be for family assistance centers for expenses related
to support of surviving family members of deceased members of the North
Carolina National Guard. And I would appreciate your support on the
adoption. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further
debate. If not, the question before the House is the adoption of the
conference report, the motion made by Representative Hastings, for House
Bill 1048. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk will
open the vote. [PAUSE] The clerk will lock the machine and record the
vote. 40 having voted in the affirmative and 66 in the negative, the
motion fails. The Senate will be so notified. Senate Bill 614. The clerk
will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] President of the Senate, Speaker of the
House of Representatives, conferees appointed to resolve the differences
between the Senate and the House of Representatives on Senate Bill 614,

amendments to the military affairs commission, and to protect sensitive
military documents. Conferees recommend the Senate and the House of
Representatives adopt this report. Conferees for the Senate: Senator
Brown, chair. Senators Pate, Rabin and Clarke. Conferees for the House

Thank you Mr. Speaker. I move to accept the conference report. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The only major difference in this conference report from what
we sent to the Senate was the portion to protect the ?? information that
the state generates through the process of making sure that our bases
are protected. That information will not be made public until after the
federal government makes its decisions on what they’re going to do in
the next ?? process. I’d appreciate your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Whitmire, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Despite all the debate on the last bill,
this is a good one. And please vote in favor of the motion. [SPEAKER

Speaker: Ladies and Gentlemen of the House, at this time, the reason we
added the items to the calendar today was to leave out the possibility
that we will not have a vote session tomorrow. It appears as though that
will be the case. So we will, when we adjourn, we will be adjourning for
a 9 AM meeting tomorrow. I'm sorry, a session tomorrow but there will be
no votes. There is however a possibility that we could have a session on
Friday. Not likely but possible. So I hope that you will plan
accordingly.

purpose.
Pierce: Just a query of the chair.
Announcer: The gentleman may state his inquiry.
Pierce: Mr. Speaker, in case that comes to pass on Friday, many of us
are prepared to share with Senator Palman?? in the funeral of her
husband on Friday at 2 o'clock in Winston Salem, so I hope you, whatever
emphasis you would have to make, I would hope that you would give us
that privilege.
Speaker: Thank you for making that point Representative Pierce. We will
certainly make that accommodation. Ladies and gentlemen, since the
motion to concur failed on House Bill 1048, the prior conference,
conferees will be reappointed. Hastings, Chair Whitmire, Susan?? Floyd,
the Senate will be so notified.
