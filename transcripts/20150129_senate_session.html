[SPEAKER CHANGES] Lets prey. Father we come here today so grateful for
who you are, lord, and just incredible mercy on our lives. We don&#39;t
deserve it. We don&#39;t deserve the grace that you distribute to us so

journal of Wednesday, January 28th 2015 has been examined and is found

Senators we have leaves of absence granted today for senators Bingham,
Stein, and Blue. We do have a nurse of the day with us today, Nurse

Ratification of bills, clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Enrolled
bills, enrolling clerk reports the following resolution dully ratified,
properly enrolled and prepared for the presentation to the office of
secretary of state. Senate joint resolution four, a joint resolution

governor to address a joint session of the senate and house of
representatives. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well that was a long session. Do we

announcements? We have any further business to come before the senate?
Senator Robinson, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] For a
senatorial statement. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson you have the
floor for your statement. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President and
I appreciate the opportunity to present this. If it&#39;s not out of
order I&#39;d ask the members of, who are graduates of North Carolina
A&amp;T University to stand with me. This senatorial statement honors
the 55th anniversary of Greensboro who are sit-ins. You may remember the
A&amp;T Four and all of us who are products of that university hold dear
to our hearts the remembrance of that occurrence and then all of the
progress that has been made as a result. Where as on February 1, 1960,
Ezell Blair Jr., David Richmond, Joseph McNeil and Franklin McCain,
freshman at North Carolina A&amp;T State University, boldly and
courageously stood against obstinately resistant segregation in this
country by sitting at the all white lunch counter at F.W. Woolworth
Department Store in Greensboro, where as on the following days the
determination, boldness of these young men forced them to return to the
store along with other A&amp;T students to sit at the counter, which
drew widespread attention throughout the country and in the south, where
as when the fourth president of A&amp;T, Warmoth T. Gibbs was asked by
Greensboro city leaders to preclude the students activities and keep
them on

  ?? As he said &quot; We teach our students how to think. Not what to
think&quot; .  Allowing the demonstrations to continue. Whereas the anti
four, said and fuelled the movement to desegregate public facilities in
this country. That led sleep in in segregated motels, kneel ins in
segregated churches and swim ins in segregated pools. Resulting in, more
than seventy thousand people participating in similar demonstrations
across the country, by august 1961. Whereas, the actions of these brave,
young people were instrumental, in the adoption of anti discrimintory
laws and policies, that have led to a more diverse nation.  Whereas to
acknowledge and honour, the sacrifices  and actions of the anti students
and , many others, activities have been planned to commerate the fifty
fifth anniversary of the Greensboro sit in. Now therefore,  the
courageous and bold actions of those who participated in the Greensboro
sit ins,  deserve recognition on the fifty fifth anniversary of the
Greensboro sit ins. So, I commend to you Senators the memory of those
students, who were about nineteen years, not much more, but who had
courage to go and say &quot;Something&#39;s wrong with the system. So,
we&#39;re gonna step forward, we&#39;re going to do something about
it&quot;.  I knew personally three of them, still know one of them, and
others have family members connected. So we commend thus to you. We ask
you to celebrate with us. And thank you for the opportunity.  [ SPEAKER
