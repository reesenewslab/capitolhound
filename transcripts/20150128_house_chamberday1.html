  Members of the House, would you stand at ease a few moments. The Rules
Chair is going to be presenting an amendment and I think he&#39;s
conferring with the House Minority Leader, so while that conversation
continues we&#39;d ask that we stand at ease, probably for no more than
two minutes. [background inaudible conversation] Member, while that
conversation&#39;s occurring, the chair is going to go through a number
of courtesies of the gallery. First off, I&#39;d like to recognize and
extend the courtesies of the gallery to a former member of this House
and a former colleague of mine, representing Cleveland County,
Representative Pearl Burst-Floyd. Representative Burst-Floyd, where are

me. I couldn&#39;t see around the lights, but also notice that our good
friend Karen Justice, a former member of the House and a former member
of my freshman class is here. Representative Justice, thank you for
being here too. [Applause] On motion of Representative Setzer

  The house will come back to order. Members, the chair would like the
members attention to recognize a special guest who is with us in our
gallery we are honored to have with us our governor today. Governor Pat
McCrory. Governor McCrory, please stand so we can welcome you.
[Applause] I would be remiss also if I did not also welcome and
recognize Thomas Still who&#39;s Chief of Staff, Jimmy Braughton
who&#39;s Legislative Liason, Coris Fredstein who is my former seatmate
and a former member of this House who&#39;s there and also Ryan Mento,
we welcome you all and thank you all for being here today. [Applause] On
motion of Representative Turner of Ardale County the chair&#39;s happy
to extend the courtesies of the gallery to Steve Codver who is the Clerk
of Superior court in Buckham County and Legislative Chair of the
Clerk&#39;s Conference. Mr. Codver, if you could please stand so we
could welcome you. [Applause] [??] The gentleman from Harnett,
Representative Lewis is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion, Mr.
Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to state his
motion and to debate the same. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Mr. Speaker I move the rules be suspended to the end that I may file a
resolution which amends the temporary rules of the House. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not, the question before
the House is the motion to suspend the rules set forth by the gentleman
from Harnett. All in favor will vote aye, all opposed will vote no, the
clerk will open the vote. The clerk will [??] the machine and record the
vote, 116 having voted in the affirmative and none in the negative, the
motion is adopted. The gentleman from Harnett has the floor for a
further motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker I have placed a resolution
with the clerk for consideration. I respectfully ask that it be assigned
a number and that the House may consider that resolution. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The bill is assigned the number House Resolution 17 and is
before the body for consideration. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] House Resolution 17, a House resolution to amend the temporary
rules of the House of Representatives concerning voting on resolutions,
standing committees, [??] seats and conforming changes. The House
resolves. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Harnett has the floor to
debate the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, thank
you members of the House for the opportunity to present this. The
resolution that you have before you is merely modifications to the
temporary rules of the House. I&#39;d like to reiterate that these are
the temporary rules of the House. We will move on to the permanent rules
at a later time after the Rules Committee is named and they can be
thoroughly vetted. I will take just a moment to explain the substance of
parts of the resolution before you. On page one line nine, this is
simply a clarification that resolutions that are before the body do not
have to have a machine recorded vote. The may be by voice vote. Also, on
page one lines 24-26, this merely is a change, it&#39;s a change to our
rules but it&#39;s not really a change to our precedent. What it says is
that if a member vacates their seat through resignation or death that
the seat would be assigned by the Speaker or the Rules Committee Chair.
It does not necessarily go automatically to the individual chosen to
replace the member. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate
or does the gentleman wish to further comment. Sorry, the chair
didn&#39;t mean to move the gentleman along. The gentleman still has the
floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. For the record I am
talking as fast as I can. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You&#39;re doing a great
job, by the way. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you

  Speaker: members if you could continue on page 2 ?? there is some strip
through language that removes the sub committees of the appropriate
ancient committees ?? so there is no longer be sub committees of the
appropriate ancient i wanted to make few points on that if i can .it is
our ?? that the budget would be developed and passed out and much the
same way that it has pass the sub committees will be responsible for
governing to and developing their part of the budget but ll the budget
bills will go for the appropriations ?? in full discussions that was one
of the concerns of that minority part have raised and i wanted to be
clear  that will the appropriations bill the budget bill will go through
the four appropriations committee just is it has in the past ,also would
like to point out in bill  12 of reconstitution,reconstituting committee
paper on capital,it is anticipated that we will be asked to look into
some substantive investments and state assets ?? will certainly go
through finance there is  backside ?? and so this would low ??
Representative dollar that it would also be sued to large capital
practices requests Mr.speakers and vendors that entire rest of this bill
pages 3 from 9 simply strike through ?? there is no substance of changes
from pages 3 to 9 ??
Speaker changes:Well done gentlemen ?? Representative ??
Speaker changes:to speak on the resolution
Speaker changes:the gentlemen has the floor to speak on the resolution
Speaker changes:thank you Mr.speaker and thank you ?? for the effort
made making plans and terms of this i would recommend you to vote in
chance to favor of this ?? temporary rules so we can move through the
community process i think the changes are pretty clear on their face and
gin i would recommend you to vote in favor of these temporary rules
until we get to department of rules and t that point we have already
discussed with the department of rules and we would look forward to take
in on time,thank you for your time
Speaker changes:for what purpose that gentle men from denim Michelle
arise
Speaker changes:to ask the gentlemen ?? question
Speaker changes:??
Speaker changes:i yell
Speaker changes:he yells
Speaker changes:we have talked bout this Representative ? but i have
bit of  problem ?? but you are taking appropriations committees sub
comitees and making them stand in committees is that correct
Speaker changes:yes sir
Speaker changes:can i follow up ??
Speaker changes:he yells
Speaker changes:i have  problem with that because what you doing is you
creating more chairmanships you are making so independent decisions both
chairs will be making independent decisions stand up committee but if
you go to page 7 line 43 matter of favor will report is this one of the
standing committee which reports the bill with the recommendations so
that the bill can be paged on ?? what stops that chairman that committee
from reporting the bill of favorable

  Whether I like it or not? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for the question,
representative. The answer to it is that the Appropriations bills will
go through the full Appropriations Committee and we will not allow the
bill to be reported out directly to the floor and if it would reassure
you, I would ask the Speaker if there are bills that are referred
directly to these new policy area appropriations group that he also add
an automatic referral to the full Appropriations Committee to make sure
that there&#39;s no way that it makes it to the floor until it goes
through. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I [??] I
can handle that. That is the intent of the chair. None of those
committees which were formerly subcommittees were made direct reports of
the floor. They will have to go through the Appropriations Committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for a third question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I guess my third question or point is can&#39;t we put
that in the rules? Because, I mean, I&#39;m not doubting anybody&#39;s
word at all except somebody who comes behind you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??]
And to the membership that we will further clarify this when the
permanent rules roll out. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland,
Representative Glazier rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the gentleman from
Harnett a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Harnett
yield to the gentleman from Cumberland? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield, Mr.
Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Speaker, thank you Representative Lewis, and I think the answer is
already in the rules that you&#39;ve suggested, but it may be that the
language as Representative Michaux suggested be massaged in line 49
because as I read that, the rest of that section, it says those new
committee, Appropriations Committees, can refer the bill, that it goes
on the floor unless the bill&#39;s re-referred to the Committee on
Appropriations. So that line, which is already there, seems to me to do
exactly what you and the Speaker are intending to do with the change and
maybe the [??] has to change a little bit, but is that not correct, that
the process you&#39;re setting out really is answered in that section?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. If not, the question before
the House is the adoption of House Resolution 17 on its second reading.
So many in favor will vote aye, those opposed will vote no, the clerk
will open the vote. The clerk will out the machine and record the vote,
116 having voted in the affirmative and none in the negative, the
resolution is adopted and is ordered printed. And the chair will point
out, I&#39;ve noticed a few folks in the gallery have indicated
they&#39;ve had a hard time hearing, we have sent a note out so, Mr.
Till indicates there&#39;s still trouble hearing, but we&#39;ve notified
folks and hopefully that&#39;ll be remedied soon. Appointment of
committees. The clerk will read. Aging Committee, Representatives Hurley
and R. Turner, chairs. [SPEAKER CHANGES] As the clerk, this has been,
