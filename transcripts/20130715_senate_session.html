[SOUND] Senate will come to order. Sergeant at arms, close the doors.
Members will go to their seats. Leading the Senate in prayer is the
Reverend Peter Milner, Senate Chaplain. All members please stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Almighty God, we stand on holy ground, and the ground
is moist with rain for Father, you rain your love down upon the just and
the unjust. Your love is not discretionary. As Deitrich Bonhoeffer
prayed in 1945, stand by your enemy’s side and plead for him to God,
taking his distress and poverty and perdition into yourself. Each of his
insults will bind you more closely to the Father. Would you Lord, the
forgiving one, fire us up to forgive like you forgive. Fill us up with
you. By ourselves, this isn’t possible. Without calling on you, this
cannot happen. We’d never be able to do this. But with you, all things
are possible. Help us to work together as people and as Senators, for
the good of the people in this amazing state. Lord, help us here today,
for Your glory and Christ’s, Amen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Burr is
recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. The
journal of Thursday, July the 11th, 2013 has been examined and is found
to be correct. I move that we dispense with the reading of the journal
and that it stand approved as written. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Without
objection, the journal for July 11th stands approved as written.
Senators, we have leaves of absence granted today for Senators Hartsell
and Cooke. We do have a nurse of the day with us today. We have Linda
O’Boyle, from ?? City, North Carolina. Nurse O’Boyle, please stand and
be recognized. Thanks again for your service to the Senate. [APPLAUSE]
[PAUSE] Senators, we’re going to move right into our calendar for the
day. We’re going to be starting with the third reading, public bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, for
what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think we might have a
change in plans, please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, for what
purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. House
Bill 15, currently up for third reading, I ask that it be moved from
tonight’s calendar and placed on tomorrow’s. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Without

me, Senate Bill 653, clarify dealer plates, ask that it be removed from

objection, so ordered. [SPEAKER CHANGES] While I’m at it, Mr. President,
if I might, House Bill 870, record closed sessions of public bodies,
currently in J1, ask that it be removed from J1 and sent directly to
Rules. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection, so ordered. [SPEAKER

practice ?? currently Committee on Rules. I ask that it removed from
Rules and re-referred to the Committee on Finance. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senate Bill 571, Authorize Various Special Plates.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Brock is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. President. The House made some changes. One is extension
to some military plates that, while some are for soldiers, and sailors,
and airmen were deployed, it gives them time to sign up for certain
plates, to eliminate of fees for certain military plates, it repeals the
phase out of the blocks that was put on the plates last time around, and
it makes various and other technical changes, and adds about, I don't
know, two or three dozen license plates. I urge your concurrence.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Brock urges you to concur.
Senator Rucho, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
A question, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Brock, do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
You mentioned about eliminating the phase out of something. Would you
repeat that again so I can understand?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yes. In last session, in 2011, the plates that we have with the full ??
plates, with the background, there was an agreement back then, matched
where the blocks themselves would be a white on a black background, and
currently the DMV is going to take a look at those and make sure that
the color combination used is of a high contrast. That way you can make
out the numbers on the license plates.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Follow up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
So we originally had a plan that we were going to all go back to a one
similar colored plate, and then allow logos for the different
organizations, has that been altered?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yes. If we go back to the phase out of those color plates. It'll repeal
the phase out of those plates.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Let me try that one more time, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Brock, do you yield for a third question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
It is getting rid of the phase out? Or it is allowing the phase,
stopping the phase out of those plates?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
It's stopping the phase of those, it's stopping the phase out, which was
repealing those plates.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Rucho, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
May I speak on the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
This Senate took some strong position, and the House actually supported
it. Where the Highway Patrol, the City Police, the Chief of Police,
Sheriff's Department, all came down and they said it was very
challenging for them and also affected their safety. In regards to
preforming their duties as Law Enforcement Officers, both their safety
and the efficiency of doing it quickly, and that is why we worked to get
rid of those plates, allowed for that logo so that organization would
continue, but everyone was going to have the same base plate. And it
sounds like that is being changed, and I would say to you, sir, and to
the members of the senate, that is the wrong direction that we need to
be going on this. And that I would hope we not concur and discuss this
at length, because that is flying in the face of this Senate and what
this legislature did the last time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Hise, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
To as Senator Brock a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Brock, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Brock, just to clarify, would this allow for the continuation of
the Blue Ridge Parkway plate, and the Great Smokey Mountain plates?
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
As is. Apparently, yes.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] We thank you for sacrificing time out of your summer
and thank you for serving the senate this week. Do we have any notices
or announcements? Notices or announcements. Is there any further
business to come before the senate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
Send forth a senatorial statement. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You can send forth
your statement, Senator. Senator Randleman, would you like to be
recognized for a point of personal privilege as well? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Sir. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You can have the floor, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is a senatorial statement honoring the life of
chief district court Judge Mitchell Mitch McClain. Judge McClain of
Wilksborough was the chief district court judge for the 23rd judicial
district serving Wilks Ashe ?? Counties. He was elected in 1998 and
became the chief district court judge in 2006. He was well loved and
highly respected among his peers and the citizens of our community and
was known for his  caring and compassionate nature. And the thing about
Judge McClain, if you were succeeding in anything, he would look at you
and he would say good for you. He was very compassionate. While he was
on vacation in Sunset Beach, Judge McClain died during a rescue attempt
to save swimmers caught in a riptide. Judge McClain is survived by his
wive Beth, two sons Jackson and Finn McClain, and his mother Pauline
McClain. Judge McClain should be remembered for his kindness and for his
unselfish act that helped save the life of another. Mr. President, I
would respectfully request that this senatorial statement be spread
across the pages of the journal and that we adjourn today in honor of
Judge Mitchell McClain. Thank you, Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any
further business to come before the senate? If not, the chair recognizes
Senator Berger for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President.
If I could, just a short moment of personal privilege before I get to
the motion. Members of the Senate, it is my understanding that one
amongst us is celebrating a birthday today and I couldn't let the day go
by without making sure we wished our reading clerk a Happy Birthday. And
with that, Mr. President, I move that the Senate do now adjourn subject
to the receipt of committee ports, the re-referral of bills and
resolutions, the receipt of messages from the house and the governor,
the ratification of bills, the appointment of conferees, and the receipt
of conference reports to reconvene on Tuesday, July 16th, 2013 at 2:00
pm and I ask that the record show that we do adjourn in honor of and in
memory of Judge Mitchell McClain. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator.
The motion is that the Senate do now adjourn subject to the stipulations
stated by Senator Berger to reconvene Tuesday, July 16th, 2013 at 2:00
pm, seconded by Senator Randleman. All in favor will say aye, opposed
no. The aye's have it. The Senate stands adjourned.</p>
