  With us. Steve McCain, Carlton Adams, Martha Gadson and Joe Judson.
Thank you for being here as sergeant at arms. I’ll go ahead and go
through the process, I apologize. Everyone’s very important and I need
to recognize these people so thank you so much. Okay I’d like to go
ahead and get started. I’d like to, first person that’s going to be
coming to the podium today is David Watson, if you’d like to come
forward. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning. Thank you Mr. Chair,
members of the committee. My name is David Wasserman. I’m with the
Department Prioritization Office and I’m going to talk to you about our
third generation of the prioritization process, known as Prioritization
3.0, P3.0 it’s also known as, and it’s the first under the guise of the
STI legislation that was passed in 2013. So this slide shows the
cornerstone of the bill. It really shows how the bill is supposed to
function. 40% of the funds go to projects in the statewide mobility
category. Here, the eligible types of projects include interstates,
Class 1 railroads, major US and NC routes, along with your four major
airports. And projects are selected in this category based 100% on data.
The next 30% of your funds go to projects listed in the regional impact
category. Here, projects are selected 70% based on data, 30% based on
local input. And projects really only compete against one another within
the same region, and the regions are comprised of two divisions also
known as a paired division, also known as a funding region. The funding
for each of those paired regions is based on population. And lastly we
have your division needs category where projects are selected 50% based
on data, 50% based on local input. Here, projects only compete against
one another within the same division, and initially each division gets
an equal share before other funds are taken off the top. One of the more
innovating pieces of the STI is what is known as the cascading effect,
or the waterfall effect. And that is essentially, projects that don’t
make the cut for funding in the statewide mobility category are eligible
for funds in the regional impact category using the criteria and weights
of that category. Similarly, projects that don’t make the cut in the
regional impact category are eligible for funding in the division needs
category as well. And Prioritization 3.0 and also in the draft step that
was released in December, we had several projects, over a hundred
projects that cascaded down with this effect. So we definitely like the
way it’s turned out. This slide shows the criteria and weights that was
used to score highway projects. These were initially recommended by the
workgroup and ultimately approved by the Board of Transportation in
2013. And more detailed information about each of these criteria is in
the handouts on the website, in the Highway Criteria Summary Report, and
also in the Criteria Summary Report and the All Weights in the
descriptions for all modes of transportation on the website. So I’ll go
through these real briefly here. In the statewide mobility category,
again projects are selected 100% based on data, 30% of the score is
based on what is known as travel time benefit cost. And here the measure
is essentially travel time savings over thirty years, divided by the
cost of the project to the department. And the cost to the department
can be lowered if non-state or non-federal funds are committed by the
local areas, such as local funds, municipal funds, or tolls. Congestion
consists of your average annual daily traffic, divided by the capacity
of the roadway, and then weighted by the volume of the roadway. Economic
competiveness is based 50% on the long-term jobs the project is expected
to provide as well as percent change in the economy. The major input to
that criteria is the expected travel time savings over thirty years that
the project is expected to provide. Safety is composed of your critical
crash rates, crash density and crash severity. Multi-modal, military and
freight consists of whether the project is on the military network, also
known as ??. Truck volumes along the route, and whether the project
provides a connection to a transportation terminal. And that, those you
can see the weights and percentage for the statewide mobility category.
When you get down to your regional impact category, again 70% is based
on data. The remaining 30% is evenly split between the division
engineers rank and the NPO and RPO rank. And each is a formal
methodology for assigning points for your regional impact project, as
well as your division needs project. When you get down to that category,
the division engineers rank holds

  <p id="05:00">
  5% of the weight and the MPO and RPO rank holds 25% of the weight. And
the last criteria that I need to mention is accessibility connectivity.
That essentially looks at what the county tier that the product is
located in. We get that information from the Department of Commerce.
Whether the product upgrades, how the roadway functions, such as
eliminating traffic signals along the roadway, building new freeways,
and lastly it also looks at the census commute times in the area. As far
as the non-highway modes go, each has a minimum of four criteria. The
criteria was not separately spelled out in the legislation. However,
again, the details of this are in the handout. And all projects must be
scored on a 0 to 100 point scale with no bonus points. So the biggest
challenges in Prioritization 3.0 essentially how to allocate STI dollars
across the modes. No one else across the country had ever really done
such a thing, particularly with six different modes of transportation.
So initially for Prioritization 3.0 what was recommended by the work
group and ultimately approved by the Board of Transportation was this
approach where state-wide projects, there&#39;s no normalization. The
scores are what they are. And the reason for that is because the
majority of those projects were highway projects, one. And then the
other modes that were eligible, again, we had a few projects from Class
I railroads along with projects from your four major commercial service
airports. When you get down to the Regional Impact and Division Needs
category here, the work group recommended and the Board approved to
allocate a minimum of 90% of your funds to highway projects, a minimum
of 4% of your funds to non-highway projects, and the remaining 6% was
based on the total score, which included your local input points.
Ultimately what was approved was the night the ?? was funded in the
Draft STIP was that 95% of the funds went to highway projects, 5% of
your funds went to non-highway projects. Just keep in mind, those
numbers are from the Draft STIP and they are a snapshot in time. So real
quickly, in Prioritization 3.0 we scored about 3,100 projects, the
majority of which were highway projects. You can see the other numbers
on the screen up there. Ultimately what was programmed in the STIP, and
again this is a snapshot in time and these numbers are based on the
result of STI, there are roughly 560 projects programmed between highway
and non-highway. Just one thing to keep in mind, that is just the
projects programmed in the Draft STIP that were based on the results of
STI. Altogether in the Draft STIP there are close 10 1,100 projects
including safety, bridge and IM type projects. That concludes my
presentation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Joe, you&#39;re up next. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning. I&#39;m Joe Guerre with Cambridge
Systematics. I have a few slides on the highlights from our findings
from a review of the P 3.0 methodology. Cambridge Systematics is a
national transportation firm. We focus on transportation policy,
planning, project prioritization. We&#39;ve done these types of efforts
in a lot of states throughout the US in a lot of regions. The approach
that we used for our review was to take an outsider&#39;s impartial look
at it. We had no involvement in the process, the development of the
process over the past few years. And we have no stake in the results,
the types of projects that come out of the process. We had two tracks of
our analysis. One of them was a statistical side where we had a team of
statisticians who were even more removed from North Carolina or from the
actual project. They were just looking at the numbers and the data to
see what those told them. We also had a team of transportation experts
that looked into the details about the data that was used, the
assumptions that were used, the calculations and best practices,
national guidance from other agencies, et cetera. Put those together and
came up with a series of recommendations. So overall themes, we were
really impressed. It&#39;s a very mature process. Again, relative to
what other agencies are going at, it&#39;s the most comprehensive
process that we&#39;ve seen for project prioritization at the state
level. As expected, we did see some inconsistencies, some opportunities
for improvement, particularly across the modes. We had a number of
recommendations within the modes, a little low hanging fruit on how to
close some of those inconsistencies and improve the process going
forward. One of the things that we didn&#39;t find was we didn&#39;t
find any significant bias by type of project, one of the things that

  <p id="10:00">
  Look at where what it was if the process was giving priority to certain
types of projects over the other and we just didn’t sign that. I could
go through some recommendations. We have recommendations within each of
the six modes and then we have a series of recommendations across the
modes. And so from as David just mentioned, it’s important to remember
the prioritization process is within each mode there is a series of
criteria and they’re all ranked, reported on a scale of zero to one
hundred. Then those criteria are combined into an overall score. The
biggest statistical issue that we’ve found was that there were low
ranges, low values, low ranges of values on the scores and some
disproportional weighting. So what that mean is that if you have a zero
to one hundred point scale you can report on, we found a lot of
instances where most of the projects were in a very small window, a
small band of that. So you’re losing the ability to distinguish against
projects, but then also when you roll these together, there’s
implication in terms of the weighting that each of the criterion has in
the score. So, as an example of this table here, there is, it shows the
criteria that were used for the rail projects and the weights assigned
to them that’s the relative priority of each criterion. So in this
example, preventative cost is assigned a weight of twenty percent, but
if you actually look at the numbers the benefit cost of the projects
would have about a five percent, account for five percent of the overall
project. The other end of the scale is mobility where that was assigned
a weight of twenty but when you look at the numbers mobility was having,
accounting for over half of the total score.  So the issue with that,
the reason that this is happening is because of the different approaches
used to scale the results on a zero to a hundred point scale.  So one of
our main recommendations was to scale all of the criteria consistently.
And so this graph shows, attempts to show what that means. The blue
lines, straight line, this is just one criterion within the highlighted
mode that is how a raw score and adjusted score is converted to the
final score.  And so in this case, the score is a score until it reaches
a hundred. So it’s capped at a hundred. And all projects that get a
score over that are capped at a hundred. The approach that we are
recommending is grading on a curve. So you assign a hundred to the best,
the project that has the highest, assign a zero to the project that has
the lowest. And you then you grade a curve relative in between. And so,
what this, what some of the implications of that are that it will be
possible theoretically for a project to have a score of a hundred. If
it’s the best project in all the criteria and you roll that together,
it’s gonna get a hundred. The other thing that’s going to happen is that
you will see some in our cases, some projects that rank high, some that
rank in the middle, and some that rank in the low. You will see that the
results will reflect much closer the weights that were assigned to the
criteria at the beginning of the process and will also help with some
consistency across, when you start to look across modes. So for example,
the best bike-ped type project would be a hundred, and the best rail
project would be a hundred. So if you looked at those scores
independently, you would say, ok, I know that this is a really good
project on this mode and a really good project on this mode. Some of the
other global recommendations were, I mentioned opportunities to improve
consistency. We found cases in which some key terms were being used
inconsistently across the modes. So we flagged those and recommended
some definitions. It wasn’t possible to look at the impact of a project
to look at the congestion, or the safety, or whatever, before a project
is built and after it’s built and compare the difference and use that
when possible instead of just looking at current conditions. We
recommend using a measure of cost effectiveness when benefit cost is not
possible. Benefit cost is a monetary, monetized benefit by the cost.
Some of the modes it’s just not possible to monetize the benefits of
these projects. So when that’s not possible we recommend using some
other qualitative or quantitative assessments of the benefits. Dividing
by cost and referring to that or presenting that as a cost
effectiveness. We also recommend introducing a new, a new measure of
financial leverage which is for every dollar DOTC spends, how many
additional dollars to they attract to the state transportation program
[Speaker changes] Excuse me. Can you go back to what for every dollar
they spend, how many they attract, explain it out.
[Speaker changes] To the transportation program
[Speaker changes] OK
[Speaker changes] We also looked at opportunities and options for
comparing projects across

  Was directly to each other, so throwing all of the modal projects into
one big bucket, using the same criteria and prioritizing the highway
project directly against an aviation project, directly against a ferry
project, and that really comes down to an apples to oranges comparison,
and it&#39;s not mathematically, definitively possible to quantify an
apple against an orange.  So, but we do, we make these types of
decisions all the day, I mean, everyday, all the time.  And there are
some agencies, we saw examples were they&#39;re trying to prioritize
across modes, but except in one case it&#39;s always been done
qualitatively, and so we know that the priority here is to do it
quantitatively.  And so for that reason we recommend going forward that
NC-DOT not put all the projects together and have one single set of
criteria for them.  Because what happens is, if you do that is you would
start to defer to the lowest common denominator in terms of things that
you can calculate for each mode, and you start to lose a lot of the
advances that have been made over the past couple of years and your
ability to look at that and analyze the benefits of these project.
And then, the other recommendation and a final one was just to ensure
transparency when evaluating priorities across the modes.  There&#39;s
good reasons for assigning priorities to one mode over the other, and
sometimes the tendancy at agencies we see is to try to deal with those
within the calculations and get the math to work so that we get the
answer that reflects those priorities.  Our recommendation is to not do
that, to be very clear and transparent about what the policies are, what
the priorities are, and let, and don&#39;t get into the calculations,
work the calculations to try to get the answer that is desired.
So that was, that&#39;s a high level or quick overview of what we looked
at across the modes, so we also went into specific ones within the
modes.  And I won&#39;t go over all of these, but I just wanted to focus
on the highway side.  There&#39;s eight of them, the range, and some of
them are really low hanging fruit like increase, or update the value of
time associated with travel.  Some of them are very complicated and we
got into a lot of details, and wanted dependencies on how you calculate
travel time savings, and so they range across the board.  Some of the
other ones on here reflect the implementation of some of the global
recommendations I mentioned, for example, improving the safety and the
congestion calculations to look at the impact of the project before a
project is build and after the project is built.  Then the final one
wass specifically related to the connectivity and accessibility measure.
 On that one, it was unclear to us what they, the intent of the measure
was and what it was actually doing, and so our recommendation is to
clarity the objective of that and then to rework the calculation
methodology to make sure that it supports that objective.  And so with
that, I&#39;m.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Torbett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I may have been napping a
minute ago, but I have a question also.  Did you, are you or just
haven&#39;t got to it yet, looking at the proximity of a project to a
multi-modal facility?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If this has been in analysis of 3.0, they&#39;re now
involved with 4.0, too and they&#39;ll be presenting that next.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So in other words, they looked back at 3.0 and kind of
defined what the fix for 4.0 might be, and then she would.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is he done?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, I&#39;m okay, I&#39;m done.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are there any questions?  Yes, Representative Shepard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Mr. Chair, I have one.  I&#39;m not sure if
it&#39;s for this speaker or someone else, it&#39;s a question that came
at me a while back and maybe you could elude to it or you could discuss
it.  I had an air traffic, a manager at an airport ask me, how is it a
bypass scores higher than an air traffic control tower in STI?  So I
don&#39;t know if you can discuss that, or am I better to let someone
else maybe discuss it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The reason that that can happen is because the way
that the way that the  prioritization is done was within the modes, so
that  Bike-Ped project is competing against other Bike-Ped projects, and
the aviation project is competing against other aviation projects.  And
so what you&#39;ll see is, if it&#39;s all relative to those types of
projects, some of those will come to the top of the list.  There is, in
theory, the best aviation project that you can do and the best Bike-Ped
project that you could do, and so understanding, I think, the
recommendations that we&#39;re making in terms of the scaling will
provide some consistency and will improve the ability to interpret the
results.  If you see a project in one mode with 100, and a project in
another mode with 100, that means that they&#39;re the best projects for
that mode, but it&#39;s not making a distinction about the priority
across, between those two project.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.

  Conditions.  With respect to benefits, I didn&#39;t quite catch on to
how they arrived at conclusion after the project.  When your planning
your portiposi(?) when your looking after the project, tell me if you
can, briefly, how that&#39;s different than the crystal ball.
SPEAKER CHANGES
So we have data in hand that has existing characteristics; you know how
much traffic is on there, you know the accidents over the last three
years, you can figure out the traffic time, the delay, etc., and so
there are tools and techniques on the planning side to predict that
model after a project is built.  So for example; the (uppage summary??)
has done a lot of work that looks at if you implement a certain type of
project what is the expected decrease in accidents?  There has been a
lot of research over the years, they have consolidated all of that and
to the best of their ability, looking at data driven, looking at like
projects, like roads in other place and then try to model that going
forward.  With that it gives you the ability to say, we can look at a
project today and we can model what we think it will look like after the
project and take the change there as the benefit of the project.
SPEAKER CHANGES
I guess your looking at projected population was, project congestion
based upon that, that kinda thing?
SPEAKER CHANGES
So there are different levels of that but the important thing is all of
those assumption are consistent across the project. For example in the
current approach to looking at congestion it is based on current traffic
on a certain highway, a certain road. So you have a current amount of
traffic on so many lanes, so if you add a lane you can expect that
travel time will improve for the traffic level that is there, it&#39;s
less crystal ballish because you don&#39;t have to look at population.
SPEAKER CHANGES
I guess we will move on to the next presenter, thank you so much.  Susan
Pulliam
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you Chair, thank you coach Harris, thank you committee members.
My name is Susan Pulliam and I work with the department of
transportation and I&#39;m here today to give you an update on the
prioritization 4.0 work group process.  No recommendations have been
officially adopted by the board at this point but there are
recommendations that are sort of in process that we want to give you an
update on and get your feedback on.  My role in the process is to serve
as the facilitator for the work group, so I&#39;m going to give you just
a brief overview of the process which I believe most of you are familiar
with, talk a little bit about the consensus recommendations that are
being put before committees for evaluation, also look at topics that are
still under discussion where no decision has yet to be made, and finally
those topic that we have just yet to broach, we haven&#39;t yet had on
opportunity to even start dialog about. For the process overview, as you
remember, is a work group that is made up members of both internal and
external transportation personnel, so those are internal to the OT, as
well as, those that are interested stake holders like our MPO&#39;s or
RPO&#39;s and select others.  We use a consensus decision making model,
which means we rarely, if ever, call for a vote on an item. It&#39;s
more that the work group goes through a very deliberative discussion
process and says, &quot;ok we have consensus on this and this is a
recommendation we can support.&quot;  Our final recommendations are
expected to come to the board in June and we&#39;re expecting them to
approve those in July and of course, per legislation, and it&#39;s the
right thing to do, we will be giving you a report in December of 2016.
As far as the consensus recommendations that we have to date, so far,
the work group has agreed or put forward a recommendation that there
should be two 60 day periods during the local input process.  If
you&#39;ll remember during 3.0 we did the local input for both the
regional and division needs projects at the same time across a 90 day
span.  The work group agreed that it would be better if we could look at
the results of each of those instances before applying those local input
points and there is plenty of time in the calendar to accommodate this
recommendation.  The next consensus item that they have is that, which
project should be subject to reprioritization and the work group has
recommended that any project that has right of way or construction
applied to it through 2020 once this Stip is adopted, that those
projects would be able to continue moving forward and not be subject to
reprioritization.  In addition, you heard the presentations from Joe,
they have agreed to incorporate a majority of the global recommendations
particularly with the scaling emphasis to make sure that scores are
scaled appropriately across that 100 point scale, to address some of
those concerns you just brought up a moment ago about comparing projects
within a particular mode.   At the multi-moto freight area, I think this
addresses Representative Torbett&#39;s question earlier, they did agree
to

  [??] but I think about getting from A to B, not [??] and the further,
cause the sooner you get out of the congestion area you start to [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Perhaps it would help to clarify that the 20 mile
buffer is the limit, so the most points would go to a project closer to
the terminal and then we would still be able to continue to award points
up to the 20, but it’s the upper limit of when you are eligible to get
points for the project. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you wanna do [??] . [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Chair. We’ll look at the next criteria that you see up here is
accessibility and connectivity and again following the Cambridge
recommendations the workgroup spent a great deal of time deliberating on
what the intent and purpose of this particular criteria is and the best
way to measure it to accommodate that particular goal, and so at this
point the workgroup has defined it as improving access to opportunity in
rural and less affluent areas and improve interconnectivity of the
transportation network and the scoring criteria that they have
identified and the type of information that comes from the Department of
Commerce regarding economic distress indicators as well as the project’s
ability to upgrade the roadway function. For other criteria we sort of
lumped these together, pavement conditions, lane width, shoulder width
and economic competitiveness, the workgroup has agreed to continue to
use the criteria from [??] moving forward and that is consistent again
with what came out of the Cambridge recommendation. At this point
there’s still a lot of deliberation about some very important topics,
the [??] of which is the benefit/cost criteria and this is a particular
criteria where there are some recommendations to improve the effect on
scoring and to improve the financial leverage component of local
financial contribution to a project in this particular criteria, but
I’ll be candid, this particular topic has been something that the
workgroup has struggled with. They’re really trying to evaluate what the
impact of any changes might be so they’re deliberate and slow and
methodical about their evaluation of this criteria and the recommended
option and recognize that any change in this criteria could have
intended or unintended consequences and they want to make sure they
fully understand those before making a final recommendation. Some
examples of questions that have come up for dialogue and conversations
that the workgroup has had is that if I take a [??] to the complex
project and reduce the scope of it and such reduce the cost of the
project, that should hopefully improve the benefit/cost of the project,
but the downside of that then could be are we then prioritizing low cost
projects versus the best project possible, so they wanna continue to
talk through those types of examples. Another concept is the financial
leverage piece. If the local area is able to contribute money to the
project to reduce the overall cost to the state budget, you know,
looking at the trust fund dollars, should that not help improve the
benefit/cost part. That is a positive conversation in some ways, but in
others is it saying that, you know, perhaps having difficulty in certain
local areas to come up with that kind of money am I maybe accidentally
penalizing an area because they don’t have the ability to bring the
money to the table, and so these are the types of dialogues and
conversations that the workers are having and that’s why they have yet
to make a recommendation. They really want to sort through all the
possible implications of adjusting this criteria. Looking at peak and
seasonal traffic, I think it’s safe to say that recognizing that there
are peak volumes of traffic across the state, the workgroup really is
committed to trying to find a way to move beyond just average annual
daily traffic counts across the entire state and really try to find an
effective, confident way to look at peak fluctuation throughout the
state, and this may be seasonal traffic due to tourism, it may be
traffic due to other types of seasonality. For example, we noticed in
our study that there is a traffic counter in the Crabtree area, Crabtree
mall area that has a really high peak seasonality around the holiday
shopping season. Imagine that. Such a surprise, so what this map shows
you are the current 71 permanent count stations that we have and we did
work with the group over at NC State to help us evaluate what the
possibilities would be for defining a very consistent and confidence
building method for peak seasonal traffic. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] for factoring that information? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So these are 71 permanent traffic counters
that are, they maintain and operate and get that 24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Did we, can I get some of that, how would be the best way to
capture the data cause I’m interested in

  <p id="35:00">
  Will it show us migratory patterns? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I don’t believe
so. They’re permanent counters that just sort of stand on the side of
the road and just count the number of cars that are coming but they
don’t show relationship to other count stations. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Correct. How long would they have been doing this? Five years, three
years, two years, one year, ten years? [SPEAKER CHANGES] People were
looking at an average. It’s at least 5-10 years. I&#39;ll get you some
specific [??] Yes, we’ll be happy to answer this question. What this
graph then shows is what [??] was able to do by gleaning data from those
71 count stations and saying okay, we set the average on this graph at
1. Each one of the count stations is sort of set at a value of 1 for
their average daily traffic and then we see the ups and downs or the
ebbs and flows on the graph throughout the 12 months of the year, 1
being January, 12 being December. It shows you that there are some areas
where those peak areas do last for more than just a day or a weekend.
They, perhaps, last over a 30 or 40 or 50 or 60 day period so what the
workgroup said is this is encouraging information. This lets us know
that there is data out there, but we’re not so sure that we’re confident
with 71 count stations so we’ve asked [??] to continue to refine their
review of this information using 3,000 additional counts that we have
throughout the state and we’re expecting the results of that information
soon, but I can tell you today that the workgroup is very committed to
trying to find a way to see if this can be used in P4 planning. Other
topics that are still under consideration are future projections much
like Joe was talking about. We have a very meaningful way of capturing
the current condition of our roadway or the current congestion or the
current traffic demand on a particular segment. We now have at our
fingertips something called the North Carolina State Ride Travel Demand
Model that’s been under development for close to two years and it’s
looking at beyond what the Federal Highway’s recommendation the Chair
mentioned, looking at specific data here in North Carolina. Looking at
our land use patterns. Looking at some of our information that we know
about our state specifically and we’re running some tests with that
model and if that model is able to produce some confidence, future
projections, then the workgroup will continue to look to see if that
could be a way we could improve our benefit/cost criteria perhaps or
others. There’s multiple places where we could potentially use it and so
the workgroup wants to get that information from this pilot and test
from before they make any final recommendation. When we look at safety
criteria, one thing that the workgroup also wanted to think about, again
looking to those future projections that were recommended, is we are
able to say that the existing segment or the existing roadway or the
existing rail terminal has an existing safety rating of based on
whatever’s used to calculate safety for those types of projects. What we
are not consistently able to do at this point is project the safety
benefits of putting particular projects in place. So we recognize that
that is a deficiency and so we’ve challenged sort of a safety team, is
what I’ve been calling them sort of unofficially, to really look at what
are ways that we might be able to better evaluate the future safety
benefit of a particular project consistently so that perhaps we can
include that either in the safety criteria or even in the benefits of
the benefit/cost criteria. Another item under consideration again is
congestion. We understand that that’s a very significant criteria that
seems pretty straightforward, but when the group started to look at it
again they wanted to make sure that again, very much like the
benefit/cost criteria, that if we do make recommendations as a workgroup
to adjust this criteria that we fully understand the unintended or
intended changes that that might make in the overall scoring of that
criteria. So currently it’s using volume to capacity ratios and the
existing volume and the workgroup wants to make sure that that’s the
right way to do it, to keep doing it the way we did it in 3.0 or if we
can make some modifications to improve it that we do that as well. More
topics still under discussion as you’ll notice, we have more under
discussion than decisions made, but that’s part of the nature of the
workgroup, to make sure that there’s full, deliberate conversations
around every item before it becomes an official recommendation. The
non-highway modes criteria, we began to receive some presentations from
each of the bicycle and pedestrian and public transportation. We’re able
to share some of their recommendations based on what they learned from
the Cambridge Study back in our last workgroup meeting, so we’re still
in the process of just evaluating what those outcomes are. Evacuation
routes, this one’s been a little bit prickly for us. We, it’s very much
like benefit/cost. The workers have struggled to determine what the
benefit of including evacuation routes might be, perhaps for safety or
for congestion. They’ve talked about it, they’ve agreed, then they’ve
talked about it again and so it’s a topic very much up for debate and so
what they’re working to do is to determine what’s the best place for it.
Some options have been to perhaps make sure there’s data available so
that locals could use it in the local input periods as part of their
criteria for their local methodologies. Others are to find a data
element that could be incorporated into one of the scoring criteria, but
again no decision has been made to date, and normalization. This is one
where we were pleasantly surprised as our department and our team were
showing you

  I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ve got time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We&#39;ve got time. We need to move on. If you have
any quick feedback or you can send it to Brian or to Susan. But we do
need feedback.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We&#39;ll talk afterward. Representative Torbett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Since she&#39;s looking for advice, I would say if
it&#39;s monetary value not belittling a project to offset a monetary.
That&#39;d be like doing a budget based on a continuation budget, if you
would. So if you want ten and you&#39;re gonna get five, that&#39;s not
a, that&#39;s an increase, not a cut. So I&#39;m just saying, let&#39;s
work with real dollars and cents. If someone brings something to the
table, then I think that should be of value, and the scoring should
reflect that. And that was at least my understanding from day one, that
if another entity brought something to the table reducing the cost to
the state DOT, then that would be of value and that project would raise
higher in the scoring. And I heard nothing contrary to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One option to keep in mind, because we would love
feedback from everyone on this, one thing that the workgroup was
considering which concerned me, was that I felt it was a penalty. The
way the formula was working was that you could not score a maximum point
if you didn&#39;t bring money to the table. And so I was concerned that
doing an incentive, which is what I think members want, was becoming a
disincentive if you couldn&#39;t. And there&#39;s too many communities
that can never bring money to the table. And so that&#39;s something
also to consider when you ?? that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, thank you. Is there a possibility of
allowing close proximity municipals to pool or if it&#39;s gonna benefit
a general area or a region, could three municipals pool funds?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would actually ask that to our next speakers,
because their feedback probably ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Tine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You said there&#39;s several things that you feel that
we&#39;ve been silent on. You gave us a couple of examples. Could we go
ahead and get a list from the workgroup&#39;s perspective of the things
that you feel like you would like to have input from us, and then we can
try and develop a process in order to provide that feedback?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In this ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Did you want to talk to ???
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Before you ?? the next presentation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are you good, Representative?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I wanted to ask you something. You mentioned something
about some counties, some municipalities probably couldn&#39;t afford to
put any financial aid in there to bring it to our levels. Could there
something be factored in to that? And maybe a question for later on,
that takes consideration for the tier of that county as far as their
economic wealth and that kind of thing?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We can certainly take any recommendations for
discussion. Absolutely. Yes. We can talk about that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One more question. Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a question about
tolling for any of the staff that can explain. If a road is built that
the local MPO says, are we allowing them to use tolling as a local
incentive? So they&#39;re not putting any money in other than agreeing
to put a toll on a road? And we&#39;re counting that as, to their favor?
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;d like to recognize our next speakers. Paul
Black and Patrick Flanagan. Flip a coin, or are y&#39;all?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;ll go ahead. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Good morning.
I&#39;m Paul Black. I am the director of the French Broad River MPO up
in Asheville. I&#39;m also the current president of the North Carolina
Association of MPOs. And we wanted to just present some things today
that have come out of 3.0, and talk about some of our experiences, and
things we think we might be able to tweak but are outside of the purview
of the workgroup, and sort of put them in front of you today. So let me
go ahead and let Patrick introduce himself for the record.

  <p id="55:00">
  Thank you guys for this opportunity. So to start it off just an overview
slide of some of the things we’re gonna talk about this morning.
Overall, STI, really we thought worked very well. It really helped
improve transparency and we got a good mix of projects out of it. Some
things we learned along the way, revenue. You know, this is all about
revenue and we’re looking at balancing being good stewards with being
able to deliver the best projects when we know there’s not enough money
to go around. A couple of specific things we wanna ask for, we’d like
you to reexamine some of the things with some special pots of money that
come to the NPOs. We wanna look at some of the ways we classify regional
facilities. We wanna look at the fact that there is no local input on
the statewide tier. That was problematic for some of us, and then talk
about some of the non-highway modes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So first of all
we really do wanna say that this legislation is a big improvement. We’ve
seen that already. It’s improved transparency, the coordination between
DOT members, the division engineers, NPOs and RPOs, it has improved. We
do still have some work to do on that, but this did bring everyone
together and it really is fostering good communication and coordination
and then again the spot work that you were just hearing about really
continues to be the most effective way of making the small changes and
adjusting stuff based on, you know, lessons learned from the previous
round and hammering out all those details. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All right,
yeah, we talked about revenue and I think one of the things we continue
to struggle with is we know we’re not bringing in enough revenue
compared to how much people are traveling. People’s vehicles are getting
better mileage and so they’re still driving the same mileage they used
to but they’re not buying as much gasoline and we really applaud the
General Assembly’s efforts. We know that there have been many studies
over the years looking at many different options and we really wanna
applaud you for continuing to look at ways to fix the revenue picture.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right, these are the NPO slides. We want to talk
about two special pots of money, ths STPDA and TAP funds that come
directly to NPOs. We have 10, they’re called TMAs, Transportation
Management Areas, they’re scattered around the state. They are in 12 out
of the 14 divisions have at least a piece of a TMA and every single one
of the funding regions have a piece of a TMA. In terms of NPOs in
general, there is only one division, division one does not have an NPO
in it. These funds tend to get used on the division tier. They’re used
for a lot of different things. There are some eligibility requirements
from the feds that we have to deal with. They do get used for bike, ped
and transit, they also get used for roadway improvements. There are some
safety projects in here. They vary from NPO to NPO, but this is money
that the NPOs have a local process that they go through, decide what
projects to fund and then we talk to the programming unit at DOT and
they program that money for us. They are not exempt from SPI. What this
did was it reduced the amount of available money, particularly in the
division tier, for the areas outside of the TMAs. Around most of the
state it sort of came out of the balance. We had competitive projects,
they had competitive projects outside of TMAs and it all worked out, in
two divisions in particular, though, divisions 5 and divisions 10, there
was such a big chunk of STPDA that came out off the top that it made it
very difficult for projects in places like Rocksboro and Indian Trail to
compete for that leftover money and just as good neighbors we don’t
think that that was right by them and we would like you to reexamine
looking at exempting STPDA similar to the way that we currently exempt
CMAC and Appalachian Development Funds. We think that will make for a
fairer competitive playing field at the division level plot. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] So one of the things we’ve looked at is how some of these
different elements fell into the statewide regional or divisional tier.
So some of the things we’re kind of noticing is not all regional impact
roads function as thru traffic carriers and not all division needs roads
serve just local traffic, so perhaps there would be a way to look at the
federal functional classification of roads. We could help delineate what
roads fit best in what tier or something of that nature, but try to
really clean that up so that we’re really addressing the needs of how
the road functions in the tier that makes most sense, and then another
thing that kinda jumped out was the fixed highway transit systems.
They’re sort of large populations over large geographic areas and
support, you know, non vehicular commuting to employment centers, and
this is more consistent with the regional impact tier, so potentially
making those eligible for funds out of those regional dollars and then
kinda the same thing with the ferry system. All the ferry docks connect
regional impact highway routes

  <p id="60:00">
  very projects are only eligible the division needs here so potentially
allowing those very projects to be eligible at the regional impact level
as well. And then another one is kind of a very specific example but
something we found with the rail system. Short line rail that is
operated by a contract or something of that nature are not eligible in
STI however all of our ports and some of our other large state asset
have state owned rail on their property. That they then subcontract out
for operation which means they&#39;re not eligible for any funds in STI.
So we would like to maybe re-examine looking at because these short
lines are state owned and serve major state facilities potentially
making them eligible for STI dollars.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
May I stop you there. Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes sir go ahead sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I have a thought not a question. North Carolina happens to be the only
state on the east coast that provides general fund dollars to their
ports. Perhaps we should look at general fund dollars going to our ports
rather than putting two rail roads two short lines in STI, just a
thought. And then the port can direct that money where they want.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you Mr. Chair. The NBO&#39;s in particular had an issue with
public process at the state wide tier. We have some federally recognized
documents the short terms for those are the LRTP or MTP those are out
long range twenty five year fiscally constrained plans that we must
deliver to the fed&#39;s. They are also used for air quality conformity
in places that have negative air quality determinations. Right now there
was no way to communicate what was in those plans to the state wide tier
other than if we decided we didn&#39;t like a project to take it out of
the local TIP. And we don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good way to do
business it forces us to be bad neighbors and bad partners with NCDOT.
We&#39;d really like to see some kind of way to get some local input on
the state wide tier. Even if it&#39;s relatively small we think that
it&#39;s important to show the fed&#39;s even though their state wide
tier facilities they impact our local communities and there ought to be
some way for all of that input that went into creating those plans. Find
a way to sort of make at least a token appearance at the state wide
tier. Non highway strategies this was one of the places where the NPO
association we really had a lot of talk amongst ourselves about what are
some things we could do that don&#39;t open up a big Pandora&#39;s box
but target specific things that we wanted to look at. We really thing
that the prohibition of money on some of the bike ped projects is going
to hinder us in the long term. We know from twenty five years of the old
equity formula that building large four lane roads isn&#39;t always a
panacea economically for places. It doesn&#39;t necessarily bring about
exactly what we want. Really you&#39;ve got to have a combination of
things a work force and talent and how do you get that by having
amenities. We know from our work with the American planning association
that millennial&#39;s and rising boomers both target demographics for a
lot of places. They want to see these kind of spaces where they can not
have to get into a car. It&#39;s a huge economic development tool. From
a safety perspective looking from nineteen ninety seven to twenty
twelve, sixty seven percent of pedestrian fatalities were on NCDOT
roads. And we feel why is that sixty seven percent of fatalities a local
responsibility? We really would like to see the state get involved again
in the bike ped issue. We think it&#39;s important. On the rural side
it&#39;s very important. There&#39;s federal dollars sitting out there
that their having trouble getting access to. If you want to do a federal
project there&#39;s a lot of cumbersome reporting that comes along with
it so your not going to submit a small project it&#39;s not worth your
time. But some of these rural areas, towns under five thousand have
specific money set aside for them by the fed&#39;s can&#39;t access that
money because they don&#39;t have the match to do that big of a project.
That&#39;s where the state use to step in and take care of that. And
right now that money is gone and we&#39;re not able to get at those
funds effectively. We also would like to see cities and towns in
particular have new ways to get a revenue. If we are going to push that
responsibility down on the local governments, right now there is a
disconnect because counties are not in the road business. But counties
are the place where we have that ability to levy the quarter cent sales
tax. Finding some of these ways. Cities are left holding the bag and
only able to generate that through property tax revenue and that has
really been a non-starter for cities. So we just ask you for help trying
to find ways for cities in particular to try and raise that
transportation revenue so that

  They can help to fill that gap. And that concludes the presentation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have one quick question. So are you advocating for us to turn the
streets over to the counties and the cities? I just wanted to make sure
I was clear on that. Okay. Any questions from the committee? Having
none, thank you so much gentlemen. Thank you mister chair. I&#39;d  like
to take a moment of personal privilege here and I wanted, we&#39;re
talking about a lot of funding projects throughout the state, and
I&#39;d like to thank the House for their leadership and their vote
yesterday. I know y&#39;all have another one today but I wanna thank
y&#39;all for what y&#39;all are doing for the gas tax. Also, I wanted
to reach out to everyone in the audience that&#39;s been an advocate for
helping stabilize the funding for transportation. I wanna thank
y&#39;all for what y&#39;all are doing. I know y’all been doing some
hard work meeting with not only the Senate but the House, and also a lot
of peer groups. So I wanna thank y&#39;all for what y&#39;all are doing.
Also, I wanna thank the House for y&#39;all&#39;s leadership. Senator
Rabon or anyone else have anything for the committee? Okay. With that
being said, we stand adjourned.
