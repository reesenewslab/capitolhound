From Wednesday, January 30th, 2013, the following is a replay of
voterradio.com's coverage of the daily session in the North Carolina
House of Representatives.
[NEW SPEAKER]
The House will come to order.  Members will take their seats.  Visitors
will leave the chamber.  Sergeant at Arms close the doors.  Members and
visitors in the gallery, please silence all cell phones, personal
electronic devices, and anything else that will make noise.  The prayer
will be offered by Representative Larry Pittman. Members and visitors in
the gallery please stand and please remain standing for the Pledge of
Allegiance.
[NEW SPEAKER]
God's blessings on one and all.  Let us pray. Almighty God our Father
who alone rules over all creation.  We thank and praise you for all your
many blessings to us.  We thank you for the love and your spirit which
sustains us day by day.  And Lord, we need that power in our lives as we
have been chosen to govern this great people in the state of North
Carolina.  There are things we need to remember from your word, oh God,
and we pray that you help us to remember them this day.  Particularly
when the Apostle Paul tells us in Romans 13 that there is no power
except what is ordained of God.  That there is no authority but from
him.  Help us to remember that that authority that is given to us is
limited, that you only give us authority for that which is good and
right in your sight.  You do not give us authority to violate the rights
of our citizens, but rather the authority to uphold their rights. Your
word also tells us in Proverbs 25:26, that “like a muddied spring or a
polluted fountain, it is a righteous man who gives way before the
wicked.” Help us to be righteous.  Help us to draw closer to you, to be
filled with your spirit, your truth, with your love, for our fellow
human beings that their blessingness. Their best interest will always be
in our hearts and minds and all that we do and say.  That in all things
we may please you first, knowing that Jesus Christ is the one to whom we
shall give account for how we govern. Help us,  in his name we pray.
Amen.
[NEW SPEAKER]
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to
the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.

<p id="15:00">
The doctor of the day is Dr. Michael Mooten from Wilmington and the
nurse of the day is Pat Campbell.  She is also the President of the
North Carolina Nurses Association and she hails from my neck of the
woods, actually lives in Morrisville, works in Charlotte, welcome.
Members, we're about to conclude session through the day.  There are a
couple other courtesies that I would like to offer right before we move
into notices and announcements. One, is a extension of the courtesies of
the gallery to someone I consider a friend and welcome to the galleries.
 That is ex-Sheriff Philip Beyers from Rutherford County.  Please stand
and let us welcome you Philip.  The Chair also applying now the motion
for the member from Brunswick County, Representative Frank Iler.  The
Chair is happy to extend the courtesies of the gallery to John and Helen
Pinulo.  John is Vice-Chair of the Brunswick County Republican Party and
Helen is the Vice-President of the North Carolina Federation of
Republican Women.  They are over here to my right.  Please let us stand
and welcome you.  I'm sorry, they were to my other  right.  I could've
sworn I saw y'all come in over there, so welcome.  And, get a little
rest on yourself after about nine months of being out here.  Members,
just to give you an idea of how the rest of the week will go, we'll be
adjourning here shortly.  We are in discussion with the Governor.  One
of the second message that was read and was a message regarding the
appointments to the Board of Education.  The Board of Education has a
meeting on Wednesday and the Governor is trying to expeditiously see
these new board members and they've requested to do that and we will
have to have a Joint Session and we're in discussion with the Senate now
to determine whether or not that will occur on Monday night or Tuesday.
We will most likely have a committee meeting.  I think we will have an
announcement, potentially a meeting of the Rules Committee tomorrow.  I
do believe we have other committee meetings scheduled for tomorrow and
those also will be announced.  For the purposes of planning, tomorrow
afternoon, I think that we're planning on coming into session at 9:00
a.m. purely for the purposes of reading in Bills that will then be
referred to committees that will meet after that.  We will then come
back.  I think our planned time to come back into session is still
11:30.  We want to do 12:30, okay, I tried to do it earlier, so we're at
12:30 and we will be taking out two resolutions and it is our goal to
also try and take out the Bill that addresses the group home fix and
without objection we'll try and move that Bill out of the chamber
tomorrow and move it onto the Senate so we can get, what I believe, is a
consensus matter.  We can only go with the consensus of the Minority
Caucus.  Notices and announcements:  Representative Starnes please state
your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  For an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  The gentleman is recognized for an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  The republicans will caucus at two o'clock in the
auditorium.
[SPKEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Hager, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  For an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES];  The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I would like to announce that we will have a house
conservative caucus in Room 315 at 4:25.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Samuelson please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  To make an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  The lady is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Tomorrow after the second session, whether it's at
11:30, noon or 12:30, we're still trying to get that nailed down, 15
minutes after that session there will be Committee Chair Training, so if
you are a Chair or a Vice-Chair of a committee, we will have that
training.  Denise Weeks has got things together for us, as well as some
notebooks to help, so please note that on your calendar and plan to
attend.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Ladies and gentleman, I think one of the reasons
that we may have to move the session back is that with the request from
the Governor taking up the additional matter there's going to be a fair
amount of activity in the morning and I think it's giving us more
cushion for getting that done.  The Chair does not anticipate a lengthy
session, so I think if we go in at 12:30 I would expect an hour or less
for session for your planning purposes.</p>

Two announcements.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
First announcement, the democratic freshmen have met and have elected as

[APPLAUSE]
For a second announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The Democratic Caucus will meet a half hour
before session tomorrow, whatever time that might be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Pierce, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Make an announcement, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's loud this year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We're going to work on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the black caucus, don't forget our 3:00 meeting. Members of
black caucus, 3:00 meeting. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could you imagine if Representative Faison were here today just how loud
that would be. Representative Moore, please state your purpose. Are
there any further notices and announcements? Representative Luebke,
please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A question for Representative Howard, Senior Chair Finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady yield? The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Howard, there's, on the grapevine there is talk of the
Unemployment Benefits Cut Bill being on the agenda tomorrow for finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, that's correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There is, by my understanding, an Upjohn Report by that association that
talks about the costs and benefits of that bill. Is that report
available to members at this point?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm not sure of that [??], Representative Luebke, we've asked about it.
Upjohn usually takes a good amount of time to do the reports. That
report was requested by a senator in Revenue Laws meeting and we have
promised that that senator will have that information when the bill goes
to the Senate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This bill that we are taking up then tomorrow, it has been filed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And is it, did I hear right that it's about 70 pages?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's a rather lengthy bill, yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One final question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would you consider giving us members time to read the bill before
tomorrow, and that is to say not have the committee meeting tomorrow but
have it on Tuesday so that we actually have time to analyze the bill and
make comments?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke, I don't want to sound difficult but the bill has
been out there since November. All of the slides and all of the
information is public information. It is a 70 page bill but there's a
lot of boilerplate information in the bill. I have a summary that I
believe is very easy to examine and understand and I'll be glad to have
our staff to email that to you as soon as we adjourn session today so
you will have that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm sorry, Mr. Speaker, she's led to one other query. Could you email
that bill summary to all of us on the House Finance Committee?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely. Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further notices and announcements? Representative Catlin, please state
your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To make an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To remind our republican freshmen that we will have a freshman meeting
after the Republican Caucus this afternoon in the legislative
auditorium.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further notices and announcements. Representative Moore is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn to reconvene on
Thursday, January 31st at 9:00 AM.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore moves, seconded by Representative Dobson, that the
House do now adjourn to reconvene on Thursday, January 31st at 9:00 AM.
All those in favor say aye. All opposed say no. The aye's have it. The
House stands adjourned.</p>
