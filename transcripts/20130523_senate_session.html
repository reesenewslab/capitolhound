…What purpose you have?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To send forward an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator you can send forward your amendment. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Daniel moves to amendment the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Daniel is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President and members of the Senate this amendment
reflects an item on money report that is part of the JPS budget showing
on page 85, if you look at that page you will see there are number of
prison closures that have been made across the state most of which are
small facilities. One facility stands out from this list which is
Western Youth Institution showing on line 37, a closure of this unique
institution that is served as state well for 40 years by rehabilitating
youth offenders will result in the lost of 288 jobs in Burg County which
is a tier one county with the current unemployment rate of 10.2%. This
amendment would restore Western Youth to the budget but with a 10%
reduction in current staffing and operational expenses. In order to pay
for this change the amendment would eliminate some of the expansion
budget that creates new positions in the highway patrol and probation
and parole, it also directs the Department of Corrections to make flex
cuts throughout the department which currently has more than 1500 unset
positions, I ask for your support for the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator ___[01:14] what purpose you ask?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator ___[01:15] has the floor to speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you members Senator Daniel and I had a good discussion about this
and I appreciate his concern for what's going on his district then the
need to 5-4 positions in his district I will tell you that this facility
was number one on the list of those identified by Department of
Corrections for closure and I would also comment that I do think that
the money being moved in the highway patrol and into probation positions
are very important. So, I would ask that you defeat the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question for the
Senate is the passage of amendment 15, all in favor vote aye, all oppose
will vote no, five seconds will be allowed for the voting the clerk will
record the vote. 14 having voted in the affirmative and 33 in the
negative amendment 15 fails and the bill has amended as back before the
body. Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator Nesbitt for
what purpose you ask?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt you have the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President and members of the Senate I will be brief today
I think we had an excellent debate yesterday, the folks on our side of
the aye, ___[02:43] proposals to you to show how easy it would be to
restore those teachers that are being cut to restore those teacher’s aid
that are been cut, we gave you all alternatives, you could do that or
you could help with the economic development and restore those cuts, we
even showed you how to expand medicate and it actually made you about 70
million dollars. And we put all those forward yes to make sure that
everyone understood that this budget was about choices, we have pass the
time when we had to do things and there have been those times, we had
and you when you had it and we acknowledge that clearly when the state
was in ___[03:38] financially, we have the point of recovery and we had
a point where we are going to set the future of the state in motion and
I have heard Senator Burger talking about teaching every child to read
and I want that was anything I know I think that will solve any problems
and anything we can do. But then we come along and we get rid of 4,100
teachers, and 4,600 teacher’s aid and these kids aren’t gonna learn in
the back and they are not learn in the room, they are gonna learn when
they have good technology and people that would help them more. In
healthcare, we are putting our heads in the sand and saying that we as a
state can go forward and leave people uninsured out here when the
providers that have been taking care of them are not gonna be getting
the funds they have been getting to help take of the uninsured. And you
are gonna devastate these rural hospitals, they have written you a
letter and told you that. We are gonna cut up all the economic
development tools for rural North Carolina that works so well over the
years.

<p id="10:00">
the rural center i know that you feel strongly as we do that that was a
good program. people in rural areas know it is so why in the world do
people go away with it is beyond me if you think a corny razor in
volley. to take care of everybody out here in the rural areas in volley
all we have to do is look at history that's what we used to do back in
the early 80's and 90's. no body was coming out and helping anybody.
That's why we started the early economic groups. we realized the
triangle area and Charlotte and ? were getting all the jobs and we
looked to see why and they had all the economic development groups
sitting down here on every job that come through there we have all the
rural areas at state have the same thing, it wasn't the same thing were
not as good as they are but it was something. and those economic
development groups have helped the regions of the state ugh mildly over
those years. were just turning are back on all of that we don't need the
rural center we don't need the golden leaf we don't need an economic
development group to help the rural areas we will point it to volley and
they will take the drop. good luck with that message and after we got
moved it became clear to us that it is really about the number one party
that you have for the state is to give a big tax cut to a few wealthy
people now we spent a good deal of yesterday discussing whether there
was one or not there was maybe 770 million dollars reserved for one and
i wanted to give you a reference ugh if you want to see the one were
looking at its mctax.com Mr. president? it was on the budget in the
budget were debating what page is that on there is 770 million reserved
for a finance budget you unidentified it by name in this budget or not
yes the 770 million dollars reserved for a finance budget is in the
package. i'm not going to get and answer and we were asked yesterday are
information and i'm trying to get an answer to give it to you maybe this
is wrong theirs a video of senator talking about it and we listened to
the press conference where he bagged about it theres a website where you
can plug in your income and you can see how much your going to make out
of this deal and what it will tell you is is that if you make 30
thousand dollars and your a family of  four and married with
independence it cost you 900 dollars if you make a 100 thousand dollars
and your a family of four with independence you get back 2500 dollars if
you make a million dollars you get back 72 thousand dollars i don't know
if that's what you want to do its up yo you all its the one you talked
about and put on a website and i think i heard statements about people
who have bought them and have been getting a free ride to long now they
have to pay because anything they buy is going to have a tax on now
that's what this budgets about and thats your priority embrace it brag
on it if you think the key to the future of this state is tax price to
the wealthy tell the world that but your also going to have to tell them
that if your going to do tax the ones a dollar more and your going to
have to cut all these services to the people out here that need the help
that your budget you have a super majority</p>

You have the money and apparently you have the will but we will not sit
idly by and let it be blamed on faith anymore. This is your choice and
you live with it.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Tillman s for the purpose of
your ayes speak briefly on the bill[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman has
the floor to speak on the bill[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt you all
had tough times and know you raise the sales tax a penny 750 million
dollars that was your answer to it we came in tough times and we cut
that your temporary tax was going to be forever it wouldn't came off the
votes unless we took it off the votes your other plan for dealing with
this was to put a half a billion dollars worth of flexible cuts in the
budget let the schools figure out how to do it you didn't call that a
cut of teachers but that what they was forced to do and you're telling
me if we're cutting 4,000 teachers I heard 10,000 yesterday from the
back row back there it's neither I will get you after the first 20 day
report from schools the ADM count and the teachers are allotted per
school and then per class and you'll show me that you were wrong you
were dead wrong we're not cutting those teachers have longed been
removed from the payroll those positions are shown in the cut to
eliminate the demand for flex cut I'll get you the report it will be in
black and white we have one every year on the end of the first 20 days
it will show you every classroom has a teacher and the class sizes will
be very reasonable as they are this year and you and the MCA and
everybody else can say we are cutting  thousands of teachers and I will
show you we're not We're showing you that you;re so critical of the 770
million dollar in there and that's our plan is to cut taxes and put it
back into the taxpayers  pockets so they can decide where to spend it
and yeah we're proud of that plan and we're going to promote it I
believe you'll see some form of it pass.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. President
Senator Brown for the purpose of your ayes [SPEAKER CHANGES]Speak
briefly Senator Brown has the floor to speak on the bill.[SPEAKER
CHANGES]I too was on a mission about the tax bill that you put in place
we eliminate went directly to the poor poor people had to pay those and
they were supposed to be temporary taxes was proposed to make them
permanent that's what your side wanted to do and you're okay with that?
Also, this budget none of you want to talk about this adds 1.3 billion
dollars medicaid to take care of the less fortunate people in this state
1.3 billion dollars probably more money that has ever been spent in the
budget to take care of the less fortunate and you say nothing about that
fact I don't think a budget can take care of the poor any more than this
budget has it's taken priority over just about everything in this budget
and for you to say we're not taking care of the less fortunate is about
disingenuous as anything I ever heard this budget does exactly that and
I think we got a good budget considering what we had to work with and I
ask for your support[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Meredith for the purpose of
your ayes[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. President, I wanted to ask
Senator Brunstetter a question if I may [SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator
Brunstetter do you yield[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes sir,[SPEAKER
CHANGES]Senator Brunstetter I want to make sure I'm not confused I
understand from Senator Nesbitt that we are eliminating the Golden Leaf
and the Rural Center I just want to make sure[SPEAKER CHANGES]We're not
eliminating those two items in our budget are we[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank
you Senator Meredith both of those two entities  will be alive and well
after this I just do not receive an appropriation this year I believe
the Rural center has 100 million dollars so that its sitting on and I
think the Golden Leaf has 770 million sitting on they will continue
operating and the fact there is more money going into efforts of rural
NC in this budget than  were previously [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you
Senator [SPEAKER CHANGES]any further question or debate ?? question for
the Senate passage of committee substitute number two for senate bill
402 has amended its third reading all in favor, will vote aye opposed
will vote no 5 seconds will be allowed for the voting the clerk will
record the vote 87 having voted for the affirmative and 17 in the
negative you substitute number two for bill 402 has amended</p>
