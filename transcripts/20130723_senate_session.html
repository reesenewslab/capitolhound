[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca of the Rules and Operations of the Senate submits a
passage, House Bill 669. Unfavorable as to Bill but favorable as to
Senate Committee Substitute Bill titled, “An Act to Appoint Persons to
Various Public Offices Upon the Recommendation of the Speaker of the
House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate.”
House Bill 491, Committee Substitute Number One, “School Resources
Officer/Lee County.” Unfavorable as to Committee Substitute Bill Number
One but favorable as to Senate Committee Substitute Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 669, calendar. House Bill 491, calendar. Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A motion relative to the calendar please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca may state his motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, thank you Mr. President, members. House Bill 293 is on today’s
calendar towards the front and I ask that it be moved to the end of
today’s calendar, House Bill 293, Mortgages/S.A.F.E. Act.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. Senate Bill 127, “Economic Development
Modifications,” we’ve removed all committee referrals and placed on
today’s calendar for concurrence. We need to get that up as soon as we
can if we might. That’s Senate Bill 127, “Economic Development
Modifications.” I think it was sent back from the House.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’re working on getting that Bill out, Senator Apodaca. When it comes
out we’ll take it up. We’ll start off with local Bills. Third reading,
House Bill 726, Senator Hunt recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. This is third reading. I appreciate your
support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It has to be read in, excuse me. First mistake of the day. Clerk will
read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 726, “Wake County Commissioner Responsible for School
Construction.”
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hunt, you’re recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is the third reading and I just appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the Senate. We’ve heard how this
makes all kinds of business sense, “County Commissioners they’re
businesspeople, they know how to handle money. School boards are
concerned only about little kids, we probably shouldn’t let them handle
too much money. Let’s let the County Commissions be in charge of school
construction.
“We’ll leave education to school boards,” even though we all know that
schools are part of school education and how you design the school, what
facilities you offer in the school, these are all aspects of kids
learning. So, to that end I have an amendment to send forth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein you may send forth your amendment. Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein moves to amend the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, you’re recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I appreciate that. This amendment is exceedingly simple.
As you know this Bill targets Wake County and Wake County alone, but if
you believe this is appropriate for Wake County then you will support
this amendment because it gives every county in the State the authority
to take over school construction from their school boards.
So, this just makes a purely local Bill a statewide Bill and if you’re
planning on voting for the local Bill I fully expect you to support this
amendment. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Senator Stein would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, thank you. Is this a permissive amendment or does it
mandate that everybody in the State would have to do this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Bill gives the County Commissions around the State the option. It is
not mandatory.</p>

Yes, Senator Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a little more discussion on that one.  There are several things in
the bill that we agree with, but there are also a few things that had
been changed that we feel like need to be changed in that bill.  This is
a bill that does the new regions, and it's also the piece that
reorganizes commerce.  There are some things that we feel like need to
be changed, so we ask that you do not concur.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The bill's sponsor asks that you not concur on senate bill 127.  All

Senate bill 420  UI laws administrative changes
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clark, do you recognize?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, Senators.  Some time back we passed this particular bill
to the Chambers unanimously. at the time all it did was basically
provide technical corrections that clarified the UI law ad made it
easier to understand what an employer contribution  requirements were
for the unemployment fund. Since that time we’ve received communications
from the Department of Labor, which stated that the Unemployment Bill
that passed through this Chamber did not conform completely with federal
law.  As a result, some additional language has been added. I’ll
highlight some of the more saline things that have been added to that.
Language that has been added to expressly limit the use of funds in the
Unemployment Insurance Fund to the payment of unemployment benefits.
Language has been added to expressly state that governments, nonprofits
and Indians tribes are to be treated the same as other employers.
Language has been added to expressly the state that each claim stands
alone. Thus, allowing an employee to file a valid claim even if past
claims were denied. Language has been added to expressly exclude social
security retirement benefits. In other words if somebody is eligibility
for unemployment, their benefits will not be reduced if they are
receiving social security benefits. Language has been added to
expressively wave word search requirements</p>

for all training approved by the division. Other words, if somebody's in
a approved training program, they can still receive unemployment
benefits while they're not actively searching for a job. I ask for your
support for this particular bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Rucho, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir.
Members of the Senate, I want to thank Sen. Clark on doing a good job
explaining this bill. Everyone knows that there were some concerns
raised by the US department of labor, none of the concerns were
substantive and the clarification that Sen. Clark outlined in this bill
has been accepted by the Dept. of Labor and they say we comply with 100%
and I urge that you support concurrence of this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. McKissick, rise to speak on the bill. You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand why this bill is before us, I understand it's simply a
technical modification and it's necessary, the thing that really deeply
disturbs me the most though is the fact that right now, we have over
70,000 people here in North Carolina that aren't getting their long term
unemployment benefits because we went out and changed the unemployment
laws and did not change the effective date to January of next year. $780
million could be coming into this state to help people, and we've turned
our back on them in a time they needed us the most. The time when our
unemployment rate is the 5th highest in the country at 8.8%. At a time
when we are needing to create jobs,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President. Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Tillman, for what reason do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ruling from the chair, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
State your inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Inquiry is the amendment before us is what we're debating right now, or
the motion, is ??, well he may be on top, Okay. Sorry Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, the unemployment bill. We're talking about unemployment. So I think
that it's appropriate to address our unemployment in the state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead Sen. McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At a time when we really ought to be doing all we can to address
unemployment, I wish that what we could be doing right now is
considering an amendment. An amendment that would change the effective
date of a law that we just recently enacted, to take it back to Jan. 1,
so we wouldn't have 70,000 people losing benefits today, and before it's
over with there will be close to 133,000 that would have potentially
qualified that would not have money to pay their rent, wont have money
to put gas in their tank, they've got to look for jobs, won't be able to
pay for the necessities of life that we all are able to do each and
every day. That's what we should be amending, it shouldn't be just a
technical modification when we've got 8.8% unemployment in this state.
People are suffering, we need to take it seriously. We should have
compassion. We should have empathy. We should do all that we can to undo
what we did about 2 months ago. But instead, all we have here today is a
technical amendment when we should be considering a significant
amendment that would undo the damage that's having devastating impacts
on lives of many that are unemployed in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Bryant, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I'd like to speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Colleagues, I too have to stand in support of the almost 2800
constituents I have that whos benefits are cut off because they are not
eligible for the Federal extended benefits because of the timing, simply
because of the timing of the changes you made. So I'm urging you to vote
to not concur so we can use this opportunity, and you can take this
opportunity to do the humane thing as well as the fiscally responsible
thing, which is to postpone the effective date of the changes to the
unemployment program to Jan. 1st so that the 2800 people in my district
and the 70,000 across the state who are now ineligible for Federal
extended benefits would be eligible. I come from a community that has a
metropolitan statistical area in the Rocky Mountain area that has the
highest unemployment in the state. In Nash county alone, over almost 900
people have lost the opportunity for these Federal extended benefits,
some 800 and some in Wilson county for example, this is revenue that
would be circulating in the local economy, these are families who are
facing homelessness, who are not able to pay utility bills in the
hottest time of the summer, and</p>

And not get their children ready to go to school because of this
decision you've made, that you can change just by making a six month
extension in the time frame. And I urge you to vote not to concur, and
to take into account these thousands of citizens that we're putting in
distress simply by making this harsh decision that's unnecessary to
accomplish your overall goals with revamping the unemployment program.
Thank you for your consideration. Please vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, Senatur Rucho, for what purpose do you
arise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak a second time, please. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead, you have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant, we are
all concerned about the well being of the people in your district and
across the state. We are working diligently to try to solve this
problem. But one thing we all need to understand is this UIs fund was
never designed to be a long term solution to unemployment or needs as
unfortunately they have because Washington kept extending it. It's
usually about a 12 to 26 week period of time. And it's extended to 3
years. That change in philosophy overwhelmed the system and put it into
a nearly 3 billion dollar hole that we're trying to dig outselves out
on.
And we are concerned about that in the social safety net that exists
today is more there than they handle. The problems that you're
addressing. And what that means is we can have 2 things done. Those
problems will be addressed with food stamps and 4 other programs in the
social safety net. And we're also trying to be sure that this UI fund
gets back it's financial integrity so that it will be available for the
next group of people that are unemployed in this state. We can't leave
it go with a big deficit and assist somewhere it's failed financially.
And that's the purpose behind it. And don't confuse the fact, this is
not part of the welfare system. This is a unemployment insurance program
that is a short term relief that has been abused by the federal
government, has cost us go in a big hole. And that's what it corrected.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the
floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I appreciate your comments Senator Rucho and I
understand. And I'm not, at this point, debating the need to revamp the
system. And I agree that it's not a welfare program. It's a program for
people who are working and paying taxes and contributing to a system
that would help buttress them in harsh economic times when for reasons
of no fault of their own, because of the economic times we're in, and
for other reasons that are no fault of their own, they would become
jobless.
And I'm not asking you to abandon the goal of revamping the system or to
do any welfare. I was only asking you to extend the effective date of
your changes for six months so that the federal benefits that were made
available, because of this unusual recession we're in, could help our
citizens and families to 2800 in my district and 70000 around the state.
And also circulate in the economy that makes a profit for the very
businesses that are also paying for the unemployment insurance program
as well as those of us who work are paying for. The unemployment
insurance program.
So that is the change. And so I would disagree to that extent even
though I understand the overall change you're trying to make. Thank you.
Please vote no on the motion to concur. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President
soon to Meredith. For what reason do you like to speak to the bill based
on Senator Bryant's comments, I just feel led that I need to share
something. As a small business owner, unemployment benefits are paid by
the employer not by the employee. So I just would like to clarify that
as a small business owner and based on the decisions that we've made. I
got my bill the other day. So I wrote my check. So thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodacle, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Meredith yield a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Meredith, do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Meredith, can you share the story you shared with us
the other day about trying to hire some new employees and what's been
happening with that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for the question
Senator Apodacle. I ran an add in the news paper. I've been blessed with
some government contracts. I ran an ad in a newspaper offering 12
dollars an hour, full health, full dental, 401k, and a company truck.
I had 4 people apply for the job and two of them couldn't pass the drug
test. Now, I paid over 800 dollars for the ad. I ran a double column ad
where everybody could see it. Ran it in the newspaper, on the radio. I
had four people apply. Thank you for the question Senator Apodacle.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.</p>

How many people were you you trying to here?. I mean 15 people for a two
year maintenance contract. Thank You
[Speaker Changes] Follow discussion or debate.
[Speaker Changes] Mr President
[Speaker Changes] Senator Tucker For what reason do you rise?
[Speaker Changes] speak to the bill please on the motion
[Speaker Changes] You have  the floor
[Speaker Changes] Thank you sir. I have got a question if  Senator
Rucho. Would yield?
[Speaker Changes] Senator Rucho do you yield to a question?
[Speaker Changes] Yes Sir
[Speaker Changes] Senator Rucho We talked Senator McKisssick talked
about extending Senator Brock talked about extending federal benefits 6
months. Can you share with me who pays those benefits?
[Speaker Changes] Of course as Senator Meredith just described Senator
Tucker people like your self liar employers are paying those benefits
not the employees. Therefore as you have alluded to in a number of
occasions you say if you continue putting the burden on your business,
you are going to either have to lay off some people or not be able to
hire them which would only exacerbate the problem we have now. None of
us are happy with 8.8% unemployment. And that’s the burden on the
employer and that’s why we don’t want to punish them at this moment.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Sir.  Mr President, Just speak make no more
comments
[Speaker Changes]  Go ahead Senator Tucker
[Speaker Changes] My business this year, the first cheque that I paid in
unemployment insurance for a small business was $61,000. The second
quarter cheque that I just paid was $46,000. Ladies and Gentlemen,
that’s $100,000 worth of net profit. I know how is that I have go to do
to make up 100,000 in net profit. When we weren’t charged for the
problem back in the 90s. Allowed the firm to be depleted down to 450
millions when the recession hit it was gone  in 5 weeks and every one of
us in this state who own a business and I personally employ 83 people,
are being hit hard by this. But I had rather go ahead and do it and get
over with it. Bit I could tell you these employment benefits are not
futile.
[Speaker Changes] Mr President
[Speaker Changes] Senator Bryant, you have already spoken twice on this.
[Speaker Changes] I will not ask a question Mr President . But I would
yield to Senator McKissick for whatever he wanted but I would be
entitled to ask a question
[Speaker Changes] Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes] can I ask Senator Rucho a question
[Speaker Changes] Senator Rucho do you yield to a question from Senator
McKissick.
[Speaker Changes] I am sorry. Yes sir
[Speaker Changes] Go ahead Senator  McKissick
[Speaker Changes] Senator Rucho, could you clarify those that may not be
aware of the federal long term unemployment benefits that are paid in.
Are those that are benefits that come completely from Federal Government
that employers here in North Carolina do not have to repay.
[Speaker Changes] The money that is being paid by the employers of the
state goes to the federal UI fund and that’s where the money comes from
ultimately. Now what you are alluding to is the fact that the money that
the quote and unquote state of North Carolina doesn’t pay. But these
employers are funding the UI system. Senator  McKissick , OK. So, which
that means is those employers like  Senator Tucker, Senator Meredith and
any of the Senator Brown, they are paying for that. It doesn’t, it’s not
free money. So they are paying for that and that’s what is causing the
problem. And that’s what prevents us from increasing the job as Senator
Meredith alluded to.
[Speaker Changes] Mr President Can I ask one quick follow up question?
[Speaker Changes] Senator Rucho, do you yield to another question?
[Speaker Changes] I yield
[Speaker Changes] Go ahead Senator McKissick
[Speaker Changes] It isn’t true that the state of North Carolina would
have no obligations to repay those funds at all and they were projected
to be $780 million that they would have received from the time between
June 30th and January 1 . And those money are not money that North
Carolina  would have to repay it at all.
[Speaker Changes] I would answer that question. Senator McKissick. You
say that the state of North Carolina does not have to repay it all. Had
we not done this reform we would not have been in this situation of
changing those business and allowing them to may be pay a little bit
less to adjust the benefits which is still highest in the South East and
trying to make the plan solid and financially sound. We are concerned
about the well being of the existing and we are also concerned about the
future unemployed in the state  and if we have a dysfunctional and a
financially damaged UI system which is something we inherited at $3
billion level, it does no good for any body. So in reality the employers
are the ultimate contributors to the UI system. You can say as you want,
but they are not quote the state is not paying it they are paying it.
It’s just another way.
[Speaker Changes] Mr President, Just to speak the second time on the
bill
[Speaker Changes] You have the floor Senator McKissick
[Speaker Changes] we can</p>

Deal with this issue with smoke and mirrors, and try to ignore the
reality of it. Those funds would have come to long-term unemployed
people in this state who qualified, who had run out of their regular
benefits. That’s the only way you’re going to be eligible for it. It’s
projected to be about 780 million dollars. Right now there are over
70,000 people that are being impacted on a daily basis. And we are the
only state in the country that has put ourselves in a position where we
don’t qualify with those benefits. And it’s shameful because we didn’t
have to do it that way. When we were making these amendments, they could
have been made effective January 1 of 2014 and those people that most
desperately need those benefits at this point in their lives, would have
been eligible to receive them. The state does not have to repay them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman, for
what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
McKissick, you say North Carolina tax payers won’t have to pay for this,
and North Carolina employers won’t have to pay for this. Where do you
think the federal government gets its money? I know they’re 17 trillion
dollars in debt because they will continue unemployment benefits as long
as they can. And when we had benefits exceeding everybody else in the
Southeast, and length of term and in amount per week, and we cut it back
to a reasonable number, at some point you’ve got to say it’s over. And
we’ve got to get our businesses back in shape to where they can hire
people again. And we go to fix the problem, and all we can hear is
yelling and screaming about tailoring a program back to where it now is
a program that’s reasonable and makes sense and will get itself out of
debt in about what Senator Rucho, 2015 16, in about three years. That’s
the way we’ve got to tackle the problem. So you can say that it doesn’t
cost us anything, but I just want to know where the federal government
gets its money. That’s not a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I wanted to ask Senator Tucker a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tucker, do you yield for a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tucker, would I be accurate to suggest that
the workers who are employed in your business by their labor and work
every day contribute some if not all to the revenue you use to pay the
unemployment insurance benefits? Would that be accurate? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yeah, why certainly. Those employees would be there but I could
also share with you that if I didn’t have to pay $107,000 in
unemployment benefits because we’re in such a fix, I could hire at least
two more people. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, one more question, Mr.
President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you yield Senator Tucker? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] No, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tucker does not yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I ask Senator Rucho a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, do you yield to Senator Bryant for a question? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I wanted to clarify, I understand that
the federal emergency benefits according to what you say, come from
monies that our employers have contributed to for the federal
unemployment insurance fund. It is my understanding that the
contributions our employers have made to this federal fund are paying
these same benefits, are in the pool of money that is paying these same
benefits in other states throughout the country at this present time.
Would that not be accurate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will say to you that
every employer is paying money into the state. Some of them not at the
level that our people are because the debt that has been put upon us by
previous administrations. We asked for a grandfather clause in there and
submitted plenty of notice and actually Department of Labor had agreed
and when we went to our congressional delegation unfortunately Senator
Hagin did nothing to help us in getting that accomplished. And it would
have put us in a better situation. Unfortunately she ignored that issue,
and I think she should accept responsibility for a lot of this. But we
do have the situation in hand. We have it on a financial positive track.
It’s going to be there and available and as I alluded to you earlier,
there are programs designed to handle people that need help. This UI
program was never designed to be that, and therefore shouldn’t have been
abused to the point where it’s in the hole like it is. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, over here. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, for what
purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator has the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think folks are
confusing things. Senator Tucker’s absolutely right. This fund got in a
deep hole. We got in a fiscally irresponsible position. By the way,
every vote was majority Republican and Democrat when those votes
happened in the last decade. So we’ve got to get out of that hole.</p>

<p id="045:00">
...we need to reform the system. You all institute a whole lot of
reforms. We can debate the specifics of whether those reforms were the
right ones or whether you structured them the right way. The issue isn't
should there be reforms, the issue is when should they take effect. By
making them take effect July 1st, you all said to the Federal government
that we reject monies from you, the Federal government. And Senator
Rucho, it does not come from the UI Fund, it comes from the treasury.
And Senator Tillman, yes, the treasury is filled partly with North
Carolina taxpayer monies. We've paid that money. We are the only State
in the nation, 1 out of 50, which is saying to the Federal government,
even though we've paid the taxes into the treasury, even though we've
done that, we don't want that money. You keep it and spend it on 49
other States, not the people of North Carolina.
By the way, the unemployment rate in North Carolina is the fifth highest
in the nation. There are three people for every single vacancy that
comes along. Now, I hear Senator Meredith put out a post for a Federal
contract job and couldn't find enough people. I absolutely respect that.
But not everybody who is unemployed can do the labor required to do what
you do.
I got a letter from a lady who was an administrative assistant who lost
her job. She lost her job because technology came in. That's fine. That
helps the business be successful. I'm for profit, I'm for this business
being successful. But that lady lost her job. She said she applied for a
job, 280 applicants for 5 positions. That's what the folks are
struggling with out there looking for work.
And what you all have said is we're going to reject that money because
we're going to make these reforms take effect on July 1. Now, Senator
Tucker, whether those reforms took effect on July 1 or January 1, your
bill would have been exactly the same. The only time your bill
potentially would change is in 2015 or 2016 and we don't know for a fact
that we wouldn't have paid it off in 2016, even if we started on January
1 instead of July 1. And we could have ensured that we didn't.
Senator Nesbitt offered an amendment that would have made it guaranteed
that businesses would have been made whole and we would have repaid our
debt exactly in the same time as your July 1 effective date so that no
business was harmed. They didn't have to pay a dime more in unemployment
insurance to ensure that 70,000 unemployed people could benefit. That's
in one week. It's 135,000 over the next six months, could benefit from
it.
And I'm sorry, Senator Rucho, it is not abuse of the Federal government
to offer people extended unemployment benefits when we are coming out of
a recession and have unemployment rate of 8.8%. It is not an abuse. It
is not welfare. It is compassion. It is a recognition that people are
out there struggling.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] They are struggling and they deserve our help.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, would you yield to a question from
Senator Rucho?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, you talk about the word abuse and I
talk about the word of abuse of a system that was never designed to do
what it is doing today with a three-year period of time for unemployment
benefits. Don't you think that's abuse when the system has been changed
putting us in a situation where you have some financial, some severe
financial problems in this State?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No one gets three years of benefits, Senator Rucho.
They get kicked off at 80 weeks. All it does is help them from 26 weeks
to 80 weeks. Hopefully the get a job at week 28, at week 35. But the
fact of the matter is is not everybody gets a job at the end of 26
weeks. Therefore, we should put a helping hand out to people so they can
stand...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would Senator Stein yield to another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would be happy to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, early on we discussed the fact that the
State of North Carolina made this decision to reform the unemployment
insurance program. But I also talked about the fact that the
sequestration has caused at least 10 other States to have significant
changes in their UI program to the point where they have actually had to
cut people off the rolls because of sequestration. But the State of
North Carolina, because we made the right decision for the long term
future, which means as you made a statement, it would have no effect.
The numbers we looked at, it would have been six months of additional
payments by Senator Tucker for his business. So that's what you call the
problem you would have had by extending it, which...</p>

Describing what in reality there a spindle the states that have
presently a significant change in the UI program and unfortunately for
them they had to cut people off. What we did is made the right decision,
6 months of planning and we have a system available for their UI help.
Why wouldn't that be a better solution to the problem than what your
providing and that is just more spending on this program.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
More spending by whom, by the federal government and North Carolina
taxpayers? I don't have any idea what you're talking about Senator Rucho
but if you actually get something in this bill that provided more
benefits than what other states designed, I compliment you for that. But
that is not a reason to have the effective date be July 1. We should
have en effective date of January first, next year, therefore I ask that
we not concur. Let's go to conference and let'smove the effective date,
and we can institute protections to make sure that Senator Tucker,
Senator Meredith and every other business in this state will not incur
unemployment taxes in the future longer than ultimately necessary. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the motion, briefly I hope.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. First of all, when we talk about what the
businesses have to pay back for unemployment insurance, I think some of
you or many of you may know, and Senator Rucho I may not get this number
exactly right, but I think it goes up 21 dollars per year per employee
until the debt is repaid. So what has happened because of the state
owing the money back to the federal government were businesses were
paying basically that 21 per year per employee. By the time it gets paid
back that number, I think is correct, will be over a hundred dollars. So
120 dollars per employee per year. So 6 times. 6 times the weight that
it would normally be to pay back. So now think about that. Of all the
people who are employed in this state, and the employers are going to
have to pay 6 times the unemployment insurance compared to what it was
and yet we want to prolong it, and it make it cost us 8 or 9 times? Now
how smart would that be? And what would that do to the employment rate
in this state? Senator Tucker talked about what he had to pay and I can
tell you I have to pay about the same thing or a little bit more, and I
know Senator Meredith is paying it. And if you don't think that has an
influence on who you hire, you're badly fooled. It comes off the bottom
line, it's off the net. It's not off the gross, it's off your net that
you have to send those dollars in, and it affects employment big time in
this state. And that's one of the reasons we're stuck at our
unemployment rate, because the employers in this state are stuck with so
much debt as far as this and other issues that we're having to deal with
as far as tax policy goes. Another thing that Senator Meredith has
touched on. I too, Senator Meredith, have put some ads in the paper for
sales people and I had several come in. And you know what I get told
about half the time? I'll say when can you start, can you start next
week? They'll look at you and say you know, my unemployment runs out in
about 3 weeks, do you think you'll have an opening, or 3 months, do you
think you'll have an opening in about 3 months? That's the response you
get as an employer. So you have people that want to ride the system out
until it ends instead of taking a job there the next week. That's the
problem with the system. We've made it so easy on the people, to take
advantage of it, that that's what they're doing. They don't want a job,
it's too easy for them. They'd rather just live off the system instead
of taking a job. And I can tell you as an employer, you know how
frustrating it is when you need good people to come to work and they
tell you that. And you know that you're sitting there paying into a
system that makes that happen. That is mighty frustrating. I think we've
done a great job trying to fix this problem. I don't think anybody
thinks paying back two and a half billion dollars, especially when it's
employers that are paying it back, is an easy proposition. I ask that we
concur with the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Senator Rucho a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, it's my understanding that any new business that comes
here will also be subject to this increased tax on the unemployment. Is
that true?</p>

Thank you Mr. president on annual leave the subject are
only have some factual problems out out there with Republican and my
confusions and I am not alone in here would intend that
this money that goes to the long-term unemployment unemployed is one
hundred percent federal money. it has no impact on our North Carolina
portion of that trust on as no impact on what we have. it is paid one
hundred percent out of U.S. Treasury, not out of our money. we offered
an amendment out member to walk. they don't look back some time ago to
say you can move the signing of January and will guarantee our employees
and employers. it will be through November of his day, and that's when
the magic date that everybody says is out there and you rejected that we
showed you how you can do this and get one hundred percent federal money
I taxpayer money that we sent out there that every other sites on a
bandwagon back. we're not
him only, not her repairs, but helpful, but all you get him a guaranteed
date that is not long ago I went down all that all we're trying to do
today is giving this on the front runner, so that you understand here.
there's still time to fix it
if we exit we can go back and get those people that money for their
long-term unemployment, which might happen survivors Dylan get a job
in the face on my plate. everything I learned here. I've told you long
time ago. I don't try to describe people 's motives and unknown, and I
believe that they feel misunderstood illness and sorry people living in
your district. that's all I can tell you I don't have
an image where counties with outdoor rights. twenty five is twenty
percent to eighty percent eighteen percent sixteen percent. I don't have
a lather. I don't have a new job
and he got fifteen people find that one job
and if you think for a minute that the hard work force at here. this
unemployed is so sorry
that they don't want work was just following the time now where Cardinal
country, and we might as well give up. I believe that my people aren't
that way and if you are a you don't might need it. if you want us to
link and help you figure out how to find them probably wouldn't find our
way. I say that my unemployment writes about, probably around six to six
and a half no more than seven percent. people want to work there. not
all dead this is a job because of a recession that I was brought to this
country. they didn't do anything they want to master ignited and then
anything to do with the and we can't. I'm not now sit here and end and

in the desire of some compassion and a desire some help until I get back
on her face and heavily survive. they are not in the lower words how
much they got their world. you might get the lien here and I argued
about not inverse of that, we go fix this. I help a hundred thousand

Just one second please. Senator Wayne is excused for the rest of this
session. Senator Goolsby, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I’d like to speak on the motion to concur. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. We have
once yet heard again in this chamber that you can tax people into
prosperity. All we’ve got to do is keep spending money we don’t have and
everything’s going to be okay. We have some of the highest unemployment
in the nation. We’re the highest taxed state in the Southeast up to this
point. We’re fixing that now. And we wonder why we have the unemployment
rate that we have. The party sitting in the back of the room is to thank
for that. I just heard the minority leader tell us that they lost their
jobs due to a recession. Partly. Also the fact that North Carolina has
been so incredibly slow to recover, is based on our high taxes. Where we
have to bribe other companies to come into our state up to this point,
in order to do business. We wonder why we haven’t recovered. But to sit
here, and hear that our acts are shameful. To hear that we don’t know
what we’re talking about? No. We did know what we were doing for years
in this state as we drove our taxes so high, as we drove our people out
of business, as we’ve watched states like Texas, Utah. You can go over
the list. With the lowest unemployment rates and those are the ones with
the lowest taxes. The places that are the most business-friendly. ??
Senator Tucker can go out and hire people and create jobs. The
government doesn’t create jobs. Spending government money doesn’t solve
our problems. Lowering our taxes, getting rid of wasteful spending,
that’s what’s going to fix this state. That’s what we need to do. I urge
you to concur on this motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there further
discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question before the Senate is
concurrence in the House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 420. All
in favor will vote aye. All opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be
allowed for voting and the clerk will record the vote. [PAUSE] 37 having
voted in the affirmative, and 11 in the negative, the Senate concurs in
the House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 420. The bill will be
ordered enrolled and sent to the Governor. Senate Bill 501 for
concurrence. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 501,

Conference report for adoption, second reading roll call. Senate bill
402, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate bill 402, appropriations act of 2013.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Brunstetter, why do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To explain the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Brunstetter has the floor.
Thank you members, this is the conference report for the biennial budget
bill, the conference report does reflect a compromise between the House
and the Senate on a number of items. Conference report reports 20 point
D budget now appropriates $20.6 billion for fiscal year 2013 and 14, $21
billion for 14-15. The budget transfers $270 million over the biennium
to the savings reserve account, we're continuing to try to work to build
up our balance  sheet, and that will leave us with a rainy day fund in
13-14 of $651 million. It allocates to $162.7 million over the biennium
to repairs and renovations as we start to make that a priority after
years of ignoring those obligations. It provides funding to cover state
health plans, to save pension fund needs over the biennium, a few of the
things that were in contest between the House and the Senate, the budget
takes the House position and provides 5 days of bonus leave for state
employees. It takes the Senate position by eliminating the management
flex cut in the public schools, takes the Senate position by continuing
the implementation of the excellent public schools act with an
additional appropriation of 18.6 million in the first year, and $15.2
million in the second. It takes the House position by providing 9
million for school safety initiatives in the public schools.  It takes
the House position by providing $10 million for the ?? compensation
program. It takes the Senate position by not providing additional
funding to the rural center and establishing a new division within
commerce to address economic development needs in rural North Carolina.
It takes the House position by not transferring the SBI or eliminating
12 superior court judges in JPS. It takes the House position by not
closing the alcohol and drug treatment centers as in the Senate budget,
and continues as in both budgets to provide over $1.3 billion in new
money for increased medicaid costs over the biennium. I'd ask you to
adopt the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
Senator, we and you had a choice over the last two weeks. We did a
revenue bill last week, and we're doing this budget bill this week. And
the biennium, there's about a half billion dollars dedicated for tax
cuts. And we learned last week that the top 1% get 65% of those
benefits, top 5% get 90% of the benefits of those tax breaks. The
wealthiest 5% of people in this state. So that's how you've chose to
spend a half billion dollars. And we were told last week, we couldn't
talk about the cuts because there was nothing in that tax bill
identifying any cuts. Well we now have the second half of the story
today. We now see the cuts. And K-12, that's about 180 million over the
biennium. Senator, what we hear regularly, that no teacher's gonna lose
their jobs. But here's a fact, and I know that facts are important.
There are 4,000 fewer teachers today then there was 4 years ago. 4,000
fewer. There are 11,000 fewer school personnel, including teachers,
today, then there were 4 years ago. Now part of that is understandable.
Why? We just went through the worst recession in 80 years. We faced a$
4.5 billion shortfall, you all faced a $2.5 billion shortfall, there's a
lot of pain to go around over the past 4 years. But we are slowly coming
out of that recession, but what you all are doing is you're locking in</p>

<p id="070:00">
In the recession era budgets. I’ve got a chart here which you can see.
It’s two lines. The dark line are teachers, the light line are students.
We are blessed to be a growing state. Every year we have more children
in our schools than the previous year. And we’ve always managed to keep
those two lines together. Well, this started to be a diversion in 08 and
09. And what y’all are doing here is locking in and in fact widening the
gap between the number of teachers we have for the number of students.
120 million being taking out of teacher assistance. That is 3850 TAs who
will lose their jobs because of this budget. Our population is growing.
We have fewer teachers than we had four years ago. We’re now taking TAs
out of the classroom. You all are increasing class size in the early
grades. There’s not a pay increase in here. Our teachers over the last
five years have lost earning power. Y’all know what inflation is because
you stuck it in the campaign finance bill where contributors can give
$5000 indexed to inflation, so we want the wealthiest to be able to
contribute more money according to inflation to us, but our teachers,
they’ve gotten 1.2% pay increase over the last 5 years. Inflation’s been
about 8.5%. They earn less today than they did before. In fact you know,
we hear all about the Southeast and what our ranking is in the
Southeast. Five years ago North Carolina was second in the Southeast out
of 12 in what we pay. We were 25th in the nation. Today, we’re 11th out
of 12. We have fallen. We are 48th in the country in what we pay our
teachers. So we aren’t paying them, we’re reducing the number. We’re
taking away the TAs. And this has an effect on kids. There is no way we
can have improved education for our young people if we’re underfunding
our K12 schools. There are vouchers in this bill. We have never once,
never once debated the notion of vouchers. Not less session, not this
session. This is a radical policy change to K12 education. We didn’t
debate it once. It’s in this budget. That is wrong. It’s wrong on
process ground but it’s also terrible policy. You are draining money, 11
million dollars, from the public schools, to send people to
unaccountable private schools. There are all kinds of requirements in
here on what we’re doing to teachers in terms of raising standards,
raising accountability. But I guess if you go to a private school, it
doesn’t really matter if they have any standards. We don’t care. We are
undermining public education with this legislation. 37 million dollar
cut to the community colleges over the biennium. Raising tuition on
students who go to community colleges. A quarter of a billion dollar cut
to our universities on top of last biennium’s 434 million dollars from
our universities. Folks, they are precious. And you can cut them and you
can cut them and you can cut them, and one day you’re going to turn
around and see that they are not the crown jewels that they once were.
That is the risk you are taking. Under your budget, 11,000 fewer
students will get need-based financial aid to go to college. Pre-K this
year, 29,600 kids slot for Pre-K. Under your budget, 27,500. We’re
cutting 2100 slots for Pre-K with this budget. None of this is
necessary. If you hadn’t chosen to give tax cuts to the wealthiest 5% of
the people of this state, and to large, profitable out-of-state
corporations, we could have used this half-billion dollars and plug this
half-billion dollar cut you’re making to public education in North
Carolina. You can keep ten thousand teachers and TAs. We could have
smaller class size. We wouldn’t have to raise tuition at community
colleges. We could enable 11,000 struggling kids to get a college
education. We could actually debate vouchers rather than stuff it in a
budget bill, without a moment’s debate in any committee, at any point
over the last two years.</p>

But you’ve made the choice. You’ve chosen the tax breaks for the wealthy
over public education. It is the wrong choice in my opinion, for North
Carolina’s future. I urge you to vote against this Conference Report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Tillman was the name. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman, for
what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the Conference
Report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, that’s a good speech. I could have heard the same thing
at Democrat headquarters in Asheboro. Let me give you a little history,
since you’re lacking in a couple of areas, woefully lacking. You
mentioned the raise of one time in five years. I believe that was the
last budget, 1.2% given by the Republicans. You all couldn’t see fit to
give one when you had the chance. We fully fund enrollment in all three
of our education systems. If we fully fund enrollment and class size
maximums have not changed but very little. If we do that, then how do we
lose teachers? You need, there is a state budget, there is a local
budget and there’s a federal budget. The state budget is the only thing
we have control over. We are not cutting teachers so your rhetoric about
cutting teachers in 4,000 in over the last few years you used to use
10,000. Those are wonderful numbers but they’re not right. The state
budget fully funds enrollment in all three of our systems. If we’ve not
changed class size maximums, then we’re not losing state teachers. So
you need to go back and examine the difference between those items
there. And you take the available money you’ve got and you do the best
you can with it. Were there some things in this budget that I didn’t
like? You bet. You mentioned one of them. But you don’t get everything.
You win some, you lose some, and some of them get rained out. But
overall, when you take the money, you scream about the public schools.
Ever since we’ve had charge of this education budget, the smallest cuts
have gone to the public schools. The smallest budget cuts every time
we’ve had it, the last four years, have gone to the public schools. A
little bigger cuts to the community colleges and somewhat bigger to the
universities who have a lot of pots of money they can draw from. When
you look at the budget in that light, it’s not the thing that you all
said were going to devastate schools and we’re going to close them down
and they wouldn’t be able to operate. Well you know, two years ago, you
said that and we went and checked and the classrooms were operating
fine, they had about the same amount of kids in there. So I just want
you to take it for what it is, and know the difference between the three
budgets. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Hunt, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Just for Senator Stein’s edification and maybe some others,
actual spending for K-12 education last year, 7.7 million. Billion, 7.7
billion. Conference Report, almost 7.9 billion. That’s not a cut.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask
Senator Tillman a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman, do you
yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman, I
certainly respect your educational knowledge, but as we talk about the
budget, the monies that are now appropriated for vouchers and for
charter schools, especially for charter schools. Is that per pupil,
enrollment costs in the charter schools, and would that normally be in
the public school budget? Is that the ADM? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No ma’am.
It’s not taking a dime away from the public schools. ADM follows the
child. So the money goes with the child. So if they’re not in the public
school, they don’t get the dollars. They get them in the charter
schools, and vice versa. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So had they been in public
schools rather than going to charter schools, that money would have been
in public schools? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Of course, it’ll go with the
children. Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And another question, Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Go ahead, Senator. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. The
funding for the vouchers, can you tell me where that comes from? Where
that normally would, be that 10 million dollars in the budget? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] If we didn’t have the voucher program, that money would go to
the public schools. But these are public school students here again,
that’s going to be taken care, that are going to be going to private
schools and will be getting vouchers. And the voucher is going to be</p>

Less than we're spending in state dollars for those children. We spend
8500 dollars on, per student with the, with the state funding, and
they're getting considerably less than this for the voucher.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you. Speak on the bill Mr. Chair.
[Speaker Change]
You have the floor.
[Speaker Change]
Ladies and gentleman I don't quote all the statistics and all the
numbers that my fellow Senators do, I can quote some of them however.
But I do know public schools, I've been involved for 41 years. And I do
know that years ago when public schools were created, they were created
to level a playing field. So that kids who were then segregated, or poor
and not in an education system that could provide them a good job had
that opportunity. And so we've counted on our public schools to do that.
We talk about jobs Senator Rucho, but we know that people don't come to
states to employ folk unless you have an educated population. And that
education starts with early childhood development Pre-k, and Senator
Pate and some of the others of us went to Finland to see how that
starts. And it starts because of the 6 party's in that country all of
them agree that education of their children is the most important thing.
And they invest those resources in that education from early child
development all the way through. And then recruit teachers out of that
particular population. So we know that education does mean and improve
the economy. So as we look at where we're going even with the excellent
public schools act, a title that is deceptive at best. What we're doing
is eroding the public school funds, which at the end of the day after we
take out vouchers for private schools, we're allowing a limited number
of charter schools. And we don't require the same kind of regulations.
The public school system will still have to educate the majority of the
children who are low income, the poorest of our sectors, whose parents
may be unemployed, can't make those other kinds of decisions, or may not
be educated themselves. And then those teachers that we refuse to give
any kind of pay raise, one that I, several that I've heard from and ??
of you've heard from who are dedicated, they are educated, they have
worked hard, even without sufficient salary increases. But they will
have the new pay for performance standards rated A through F through
their schools, because they don't have teacher assistance to assist
them. They don't have the additional funds for instructional supplies,
and then their held responsible for educating children who happen to be
the ones that private schools ?? they won’t, Charter schools they won't,
and they'll have to educate the children who need it most, but with
limited resources themselves. And so we may see teacher flight, I would
not blame them because they don't have that. And so what we do is, we
move on up to community colleges, and higher education. And I know this,
that we've had one of the greatest higher education systems in this
country. And I don't disagree that tuition has always been lower, we
could've increased it a little here and there. But what we're doing at
the worst time in our country, was Senator Meredith said that he
couldn't find workers because actually they needed retraining. We're
increasing the cost in community colleges, so the people who are
currently unemployed will have to find more money to pay the per course
cost, so that they can get trained for those very jobs you're talking
about. And our higher education system, my universities have been
responsible for helping to improve the economy in this state. And I, I
would beg to disagree with those of you who would say that they don't
promote the economy, they do. As you go from one university to the other
you can point out programs, you can point out research, you can point
out entity's that help to promote the economy. Yet what we're doing is
we're cutting the budget again, we're raising tuition to make it
unaffordable, and yet our need based aid is decreased. 11,000 fewer
students will have the monies they need at a time when the federal
student loan rate is already double. And I heard on NPR this morning
that parents say they’re no longer paying those</p>

[Speaker changes.]  ...costs.  The parents can't afford it.  Like some
of us in here who help to pay for our kids' education or supplemented
they didn't have necessary scholarships, parents today cannot afford
that. So students have to work, they have to get loans and they have to
have need-based financial aid. So we've decreased it by 11,000 students
who cannot get that, who will not have the kind of education you and I
have...who will not be able to get those jobs, those high-paying jobs
ya'll are gonna bring into the state...and I hope you do cause I got
some folks who want 'em.  But they will not be able to get those jobs,
they will add to the unemployment ranks in this state because they'll
drop out of school and they won't be able to get a decent job and
eventually they won't have any because nobody will employ them!  I think
this is an atrocity to our education system.  At a time when you talk
about improvin' education, you wanna' cut out &quot;the least of
these&quot;, you wanna' get rid of them, you wanna' ignore them.  You
say that you want to improve the economy, you wanna' educate everybody
and make them job ready but yet the budget says exactly the opposite. I
vote against it.
[Speaker changes.] Mister President?
[Speaker changes.] Senator Parmon, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker changes.] Mister President, if I may, I'll yield to Senator
Jenkins.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Jenkins, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker changes.] To speak on the budget.
[Speaker changes.] Senator, you have the floor.
[Speaker changes.] We heard the chair of this Appropriations Committee
highlight this budget and one of things he spoke about...touched
on...was the impact on the rural parts of this state.  I represent one
of the bigger rural parts of the state and one of the lower wealth parts
of the state...and I too read over the weekend, the results of the State
Auditor's findings with the rural center...and I would agree that the
audit was very complete, very thorough..and from that audit, I think you
coulda' made some constructive changes and moved on...but the Governor
and the leadership in the General Assembly decided that they would
collapse that particular operation and move it into the Department of
Commerce. I asked this morning, along with some of my other colleagues
&quot;on the back row&quot; as ya'll like to refer to us...the staff is
what is the net effect, at the end of the day, to the rural areas as far
as economic development, education and other areas and got a fax sheet
and it's very telling.  At the end of the day, when you finish the
adjustment for the rural center, you add back a few things, you take
away the funding for the &quot;Golden Leaf&quot; for the next coupla'
years, you take away the money to the economic
development/non-profit...you wind up over the next several years with 80
million dollars less money going to the rural parts of this state. So I
contend that we're not helpin' 'em, we do not have a plan from the
Department of Commerce as to how they're goin' to address these issues.
We still don't have a plan from the Secretary of Commerce as to how she
is goin' create all these new jobs.  We've heard great outlines but no
facts behind it. So I would content that the...one reason that I have
alone, that I would not vote for this budget is that we are takin' away
money from the rural parts of this state, we're not addin' to it, we're
not makin' life easier for 'em so I ask you to vote against the budget.
Thank you.

I heard some rhetoric about where the funds were and why the small tax
cut that's out there in the next two years is devastating but...I'm
goin' take everybody back.  Gonna' take everybody to G12 and G13 and
their money report and I'm gonna' talk about what we're really dealing
with in this budget. We're havin' to keep up with an entitlement
program, a program that we can't control enrollment on, we can't control
utilization on.  We talked extensively about...oh boy, one of those we
needed to expand.  Medicaid over the biennium is growing over a billion
and a half dollars in the budget to where it's taking on...the re-base
alone over two years is now over a billion dollars that we hafta account
for in a time that our economic growth has been somewhere about 2%.  The
Affordable Care Act, that great piece of legislation...</p>

The affordable care act is getting ready to cause this state 243 x 10^6
(million) dollars alone. It would working affects, and moving children
on insurance to a medicaid. Those requirements, federal government is
straggling the budget of North Carolina. This is where it's coming from;
there's no way you can look at those two pages and say anything is
affecting the budget, at least changes we've had to make in education,
slow growth, tax cuts,  were reformed. Nothing compares to the scope
that we had to deal with in medicaid. I feel like for the first time we
were in a better position to forecast, moving forward, what those costs
will be. I feel like we've done a lot to control costs in the medicaid
area. But we can not continue to keep up with the federal government. It
is time we begin to reform this system in the state of North Carolina.
There is a provision in here that begins that, I am confident that will
be a lot of the discussion coming in the short session. But regardless
of what all these fights want to be about, about what we had to cut, and
what we had to reduce, I want people to see where the answer is, and
that's in the funded entitlement program.[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. President,
[SPEAKER CHANGE], for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGE], to
speak on the accomplished report.[SPEAKER CHANGE], senator has the floor
[SPEAKER CHANGE], thank you, Mr. President, starting Sunday afternoon, I
started getting questions and calls from the media, and from some of my
colleagues, saying that I should be very pleased that finally,
sterilization victims were going to compensated. And I have to say to
you, that I was very delighted to hear that. And as I reflected on that
information,that finally, we as a state was doing what was right. And
that's the compensate victims that gave North Carolina one of the
darkest periods in our history. So, I'm pleased that the compensation of
the sterilization victims is in this budget. But I sincerely do not
think it need to come on the backs of another vulnerable population, and
that's our students. Sterilization was an act by a state government, who
thought it had the wisdom to pick winners and losers in our society. And
I think this is what this budget is doing. It's compensating one set of
victims and creating another set, and I can not support a budget that
does that. Thank you.[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. President. . .[SPEAKER CHANGE]
just one second, Senator Mckissick, Senator Wade is back in the chamber.
Senator Mckissick, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGE] To
speak on the bill.[SPEAKER CHANGE] You have the floor to speak on a
concurrency report.[SPEAKER CHANGE] Like Senator Carmen, I was pleased
to see a eugenics report in our budget. I've worked closely with speaker
Carmen, speaker Tellers, and some others. It's good to see those
eugenics victims did receive compensation. At the same time, I might
add, one of the things that came forth, was a task force that
recommended that those victims be compensated by to the tune of fifty
thousand dollars each. What we had in this state was a program that
impacted the lives of over 75 hundred individuals, that took away their
reproductive rights. We really don't know how many are still alive
today, but we know that that program ran from basically the early
thirties all the way up to the mid seventies. So many of them are still
alive today, so many of them are still alive today, there will be many
claims to be filed. But when we look at the 10 x 10^6 (million) dollars
that are in place there, I hope that we view this as a beginning and not
as an end. Because it's predicted that 1500 to 1600 victims are still
alive. Yet there in fact, 1500 to 1600 alive, they do come forth and
present claims, we actually don't know how many of them are alive today.
Or, they'll be too embarrassed to come forward, because many of them
felt embarrassed about losing their reproductive rights. But if so,
rather then getting them compensated</p>

Two hundred fifty thousand dollars, as was recommended.  They might
likely receive only about six thousand dollars. And while we are moving
in the right direction to recognize this wrong that North Carolina
imposed, this egregious wrong by taking away reproductive rights of
people who had no say-so, we need to also look at that original task
force and its recommendations. And as the years pass, and there's a
three-year window that's established under the special provision to this
budget, if all those victims come forth I hope that we will fully fund
the compensation of these victims in a meaningful and significant way.
I would like to also shift gears to some of the other parts of this
budget.  When I sit here and I look at places like Granville County
which is part of my district, that's primarily rural places like
Stovall, Stem, Butner, Oxford and Creedmoor, but there's losing the
money that they have for public safety.  When all of it, the vast
majority of their service calls on the state institutions and people
housed in those state institutions. It may be only one point seven
million a year, but to them that's a significant amount of money. We
look at biofuels, which is headquartered over in Granville County.
Those monies are gone.  There are many people in Granville county and
counties like that throughout the state.  I thought Senator Jenkins did
an excellent job in pointing out how this budget has the potential to
negatively impact so many of our rural counties.  We need to be deeply
concerned about that because we cannot forsake those individuals that
live there.  We may have had an institution that had a charge of trying
to serve them in a meaningful way that perhaps did not follow all the
rules the way that they needed.  But we need to make sure that those
people residing in those areas do have what they need to have jobs, to
have water, to have sewer, to have the same things that we all benefit
from.  And yes, our community colleges.  I looked there and seeing
further tuition increases for those that can't afford to go to public
universities, particularly as need-based grants are being reduced again.
That troubles me, because we want to make certain that our community
colleges are affordable, particularly at a time when we're encouraging
more people to go there and begin their education before they transfer
on to the public universities.  And we realize that it all starts, that
educational experience, from the time that people were born up through
the time they hopefully graduate from high school move on in life.  It
troubles me to see the twenty one hundred slots for ? those that need
those type of opportunities early on in life, that they are not going to
have it.  They're not going to have those opportunities the way they had
in the past. We shouldn't be cutting those positions, and we shouldn't
be cutting these teaching assistants. These teaching assistants are
needed in our classrooms, they're the backbone that help our teachers.
And we eliminate teacher tenure and it's hard to attract the best and
brightest to our schools.  We will once again suffer. North Carolina has
had a tremendous public education system. Right now were right about
forty eight in what we're paying our teachers, not giving them tenure
and giving them these contracts, it's going to be hard to attract the
best and brightest, and to make sure that the students in our schools,
our most important natural resource, our population and their minds,
their intellectual capacity is developed to the point that they can hold
and compete for jobs of the future. So for that reasons I cannot support
the bill.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. Several points I think I'd like to make.  First
I think maybe touch on education and I guess pay too. You know, when we
think about pay, we did give a pay raise last year, first one in several
years. We did do that. When I look at funding, I look at funding for the
ten eleven year, the last year that the Democrats were in control,
funding for K-12 education that year was seven billion two hundred sixty
one million dollars. For the fourteen fifteen year that'll be over eight
billion dollars. Eight hundred million more in spending on K-12
education. We fully funded our growth all throughout our education
system. We have fully funded our retirement and health care plans, kept
them whole. We eliminated a flex cut that was created years ago, that
was only a way to say we're going to give you some money and ask you to
give it back.</p>

<p id="100:00">
Just played some tricks with some numbers. We got that off the books
this year. Senator Hise mentioned it. This budget takes care of the
least fortunate more that it ever has, with over one and a half billion
dollars in Medicaid dollars that are being spent. One and a half billion
dollars. It also puts two hundred and thirty million dollars in a rainy
day fund and it funds over a hundred million dollars in R&amp;R,
something that hadn't been done in a long time. We think in other areas
it funds twenty two additional magistrates and about a hundred and
seventy five probation and parole officers to make us more safe. It
restores funding for sixty nine trooper positions.
In our rural communities, Senator Jenkins, maybe Golden LEAF dollars but
other than that, this budget does well for rural North Carolina. It
spends more money on water and waste water infrastructure in rural North
Carolina than probably any other budget ever has. It also creates a new
rural infrastructure authority within Commerce that will look at rural
North Carolina needs and I think get those dollars out on a quicker
manner than what has been done through the rural center, that still has
over one hundred million in reserves that still hasn't gone out to rural
North Carolina. It provides sixty million in job development grants that
will be available to rural North Carolina in particular. It fully funds
VIPER, a system that will surely enhance our emergency response
throughout the state.
And one thing that I think was misquoted on early childhood, I think we
might want to go back on that. This budget actually funds more early
childhood slots than last year's budget does. This is a good budget.
It's a prudent budget and I think it's a transparent budget. I think
when you take a look at this budget, there is no fluff in this budget.
It funds priorities for this state and I think funds them well.

[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you Mister President. To speak on the bill.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
You have the floor.
[CHANGE SPEAKER]
Thank you Mister President. I'm going to commend Senator Brown for
bragging on this budget and taking ownership for it. I've sat back here
today and I've been hearing things like the federal government
strangling the state. Said it's Senator Hagan's fault. Inherited the
problem. The Governor the other day said Obama did it on the
unemployment insurance. I heard do the best you can with what you got.
And I even heard that the unemployed are part of the problem. Folks, I
don't how to tell you all this but this is your third budget and at some
point you're going to take ownership of what you are doing down here.
And I think this session ought to be the time you take it.
We tried to tell everyone out here two months ago where we were headed
and we said you're going to give tax cuts to the rich and out of state
corporations at the expense of the middle class. And I remember being
chided as to where does it say that what tax cut we are going to give in
this bill. It didn't and it just was a reserve but we had other ways to
show what we thought was going to happen. Well, it happened and we
passed the tax giveaways to the wealthy and to the out of state
corporations. We did that part. It increased taxes for the middle class
people, not a lot but a little.
And then here we are today with the third part of the trifecta cutting
education, rural economic development, services affecting middle class
families. This is what you had to do to do that. The tax giveaway was
about a half a billion dollars, cuts to education about a half a billion
dollars. And you can't say you had to do it because you didn't. If you
hadn't have done your tax giveaway you</p>

Who would have the money here and not cut teachers, not cut teacher's
aids, not knock students of off scholarship money, etcetera, but you
made that choice.  I told you all back a week or two ago, when you all
were giving us a drubbing here about 8 o'clock at night, on abortion,
that you did pretty good fighting 3 strong women on the back row.  I
wanted to see what you did when 10,000 showed up.  I didn't take but
about 500 to show up.  We had every body with a gun and a badge in
Raleigh over here, protecting us, and they were swinging from the

as you called them names, you said they're outsiders.  Everybody's that
check behind you said, Uh,uh, they're not outsiders.  They're clergy,
they're women, they're teachers, they';re doctors.  They're people down
here trying to tell you that what you're doing to the people of this
state is unconscionable.  That's what they're trying to tell you.  And
of course, you aren't listening to them, and I've asked a couple of
times, What's the plan?  I can't figure out what the plan is.  What's,
where's the punch line.  Well, we saw that this morning.  You're going
to try to rig the election so they can't go vote against you.  And I'm
going to tell you something, if you want to make them a bigger crowd,
madder, than you made the women the other night, just carry through with
that bill, and tell people they're going to have to stand in lines like
they did down in Florida, and you're just going to make it more
difficult for them to get to the polls, and we're going to
disenfranchise children, where they can't vote, and that way they can't
vote us out of office.  Let me tell you something.  they know what your
doing, they're angry, and they're coming for you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. President
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Brunstetter, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To debate the bill a 2nd time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yup.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Nesbitt's
abomination to take ownership, to take ownership of this budget.
Senator Nesbitt, I have been blessed with 2 good colleagues here that I
have been able to work on this budget with, and I will take ownership of
it.  But, I want you to take ownership of a few things too.  I can tell
you, for having a front row seat, looking through the decay of the state
budget over the last couple of years, what we have had to deal with.
Senator Brown touched on a few of these things.   Our state health plan
was going bankrupt.  Boy, we would have loved to spend the money
elsewhere, rather than $500 million bailouts, 2 years in a row.  But
we've managed to get that thing, with the help of the treasurer, back on
the right path.  Senator Robinson, you mentioned 11,000 students on
financial aid, I guess you are forgetting the fact, well this was before
your time here so, forgetting the fact that when we got here, the
S-cheat fund which funds a good deal, this was going bankrupt.  And we
had to make decisions, that were difficult decisions that affected
financial aid, to put that plan back into solvency..  The funding on
financial aid this year, I guess we're being punished in your mind for
allocating lottery overages to financial aid last year, which don't
exist at the moment.  We saw continually, one-time money used for
recurring obligations.  One-time money.  So decisions would be made for
this program, or that program, or this initiative, and time and again
the gap was filled with one-time money, hoping that the tide would rise,
that the economy would be there.  I remember just thinking when we were
sitting in the back row, there's going to come a time of reckoning here,
because you cannot budget that way and keep it going.  We've seen budget
tricks all through, all through this.  We had a Medicaid system  in
shambles.  I can't describe that, any better than Senator Hise, and
we've had to deal with it.  I can tell you our information technology
systems have been completely ignored, completely ignored, and we spend,
what? a billion and a half, $1.7 billion a year, trying to fix that
situation.  Repairs and renovations, taking care of the things that you
have decided to invest in, ignored.  Ignored.  So yeah, we had to make
decisions to start taking care of the things in this state, the capital,
ignored.</p>

<p id="110:00">
ignored. Talk about thousands of teachers, well again that's slightly
revisionist history. I think one of the biggest tricks that was used and
one of the biggest problems was that prior leadership in this chamber
decided to take one time money from federal government to try to fund
recurring obligations to teachers. I've got charts in front of me, too,
and the biggest cut in teacher population has come when the folks in the
back row were running this chamber. I believe that this budget continues
to put us on track, we're healing our balance sheet, we're doing the
things necessary that we need to do and they're not always popular
decisions. As an appropriator, we've had a constant battle with our good
friends on finance because we like to spend money and Senator Rabin,
Senator Rucho and others, they keep telling us to behave ourselves. We
would like to be able to spend on some of these initiatives you
describe. I would love to pick out a line item here or a line item there
and say, &quot;boy isn't it awful that you people aren't funding
that?&quot; Well, I'll tell you what, the responsibility here is to put
together an entire budget. To put the state back on track to start
growing the state, make it healthy, get our revenues in place and
Senator Nesbitt, I will take ownership of this budget. You take
ownership of some of these past practices.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate. Senator Berger, for what reason do
you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak briefly on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the Senate. This budget does what
needs to be done for the state at this time. Are there some choices that
many of us wish we didn't have to make? Yes, but the reality is you can
talk about cuts and you can talk about how this budget spends less money
buty\ if you look at the simple facts of the numbers that are there what
you will see is last year's budget was 20.2 billion dollars. This year's
budget is 20.6 billion dollars. Now, a lot of the increase is because of
Medicaid but increase it is. So saying that we're spending less money is
just not accurate. We're spending more money. K12 education, last year's
budget was 7.7 billion dollars for K12 education. This year's budget,
7.9 billion dollars. These are not cuts. The reason you can say there
are cuts is because of the device of the continuation budget, which is a
fiction. That is a number that's a starting number but it's not a number
based on what you spent in the past. If you look at what we have spent
in the past and what we're spending in this budget we have increased the
amount of funding in K12 education. We've increased the funding into
community colleges in terms of real dollars. We've increased the total
spending and we've done that all in the context the economic situation
that we have. I think it's a reasonable budget, made some hard choices,
did a number of things, does a number of things that puts us in the
right place. I urge you to vote for the motion.

matters related to the pistol purchase permit. The house did not concur
with our effort to repeal that permit process, and that is why we went
to conference. The compromise that we reached, that was important to the
senate, was that we closed a loophole that allowed felons to acquire
guns that were not supposed to. That was the purpose of repealing the
permit, but we compromised on that and what we have done is instituted</p>

No surprise of course, I voted against it then and I voted against it

than in the entire seventeen years that I have been here. Of course,
that’s been on every subject. I can tell you on the guns it has been
absolutely overwhelming. People have been so upset, concerned and
frightened by this bill. I have heard from people not just once but over
and over and over again about what a dangerous situation this is
creating. They’re worried for their children, they’re worried for
themselves, and they feel utterly helpless. What’s interesting is if you
look at the polls, people want more gun control, not less. To me it is
very upsetting that we’re not listening to our constituents. We’re not

There are two statistics in this whole gun debate that to me are
probably the most frightening. The first is that 1/3 of the gun deaths
are suicides. Suicides. People who have a gun handy who choose to kill
themselves. A lot of those are young people. The second statistic that’s
every interesting is that of those people who have a gun in their home
to hit intruder with are 43 times more likely to be killed by that gun
themselves than to kill an intruder.

Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton, I was scrolling very fast trying to find out this
information, but maybe you could tell me. One of my concerns with the
move to make all the information confidential regarding the permits. I
presume the purchase permits are back is confidential for the purchase
permits as well as the concealed carry, but I can’t get to that place.
Is any public information available statistics, reports, anything about
these permits and how they’re issued?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for the question Senator Brown. We maintain the
confidentiality of the records that was in the original bill and the
conference report, except for as it related to the pistol purchase
permits. We do require the sheriffs to maintain data on those that they
deny, and that data with the non-identifying information in it for
people…You can’t tell who got denied. It is required that they maintain
the data of how many are denied and the reasons why they’re denied. The
public can get that on a quarterly basis. For example, if a gun rights

...Wrongfully to give these permits out. They'd be able to look at that
sheriff's data and see why it was that they weren't given permits out.
On the other hand, we'll also have information to find out what it is
that they're finding that it would, it would be a good reason to not.
And as we go forward that will be data we think that is useful to
further strengthen our background check system. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you. One more question Mr. President if I may? [SPEAKER CHANGES] ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And overall though we ask here that we have
information on the denials and that, at least that's better than
nothing. But on those granted we have no information on the number, the
volume, in terms of even compliance with those provisions, some sense of
how they are varying by county or region or are and time or frequency,
that kind of thing? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President that information is
collected and held but is not public information. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion? Further debate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.President
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Mcissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ask Senator Newton if he would yield for a quest.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Newton do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Newton of course these ?? course come back and
you know on the calendar and it's hard to kind of review them real
quickly but is this the bill where we were allowing guns in funeral
processions, restaurants that serve alcohol, sporting events. It seems
like you've even got added in there the bill with hunters using
silencers. Is this the compilation bill that had all of that in there
and is all of that still in there? Because I know we had some separate
bills but then they got kind of compiled into one. So if you could
clarify what actually came out and if the rest of that's in there. Just
say that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure Senator Mckissick thank you for the
question and I will answer your question in a long enough manner that
allows everybody in the Chamber to skim through the bill and re
familiarize themselves with it. This is in fact the bill that we debated
earlier in the session that includes an expansion of second amendment
rights for those who have concealed carry permits. It does include a
clarification that they can carry in parks and that cities can't overly
restrict that. It includes that you can, if you're a concealed carry
permit holder, having gone through the training and lawfully holding
your permit. You can in fact carry in an Applebees when you go to eat
with your family. It also includes all those other provisions in there
that we talked about earlier that the cameras and the media seem to
forget, which is that it significantly strengthens the penalties for
those who wrongfully and illegally use their guns in the commission of a
crime. It also significantly strengthens the reporting of felonies and
criminal convictions and mental health issues so that our background
check system is strengthened. So, yes, it is the same comprehensive bill
that my voters and that my constituents keep e-mailing me, telling me
that they want so badly. And it does strengthen our second amendment
rights in the state at the same time we strengthen our background check
system. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Speak briefly on the bill. My
greatest concern with this bill is simply that we, the more we increase
the availability use of firearms in the locations where they are
permitted to be used. I can see any good that can be brought from
carrying a funeral, a gun to a funeral, or to a restaurant, or to a
park, or to any of these other places. Or having silencers on hunter's
rifles. The greater the potential for misuse and abuse. That's my
greatest concern. I understand the constitutional rights, and I
certainly respect that but my belief is that the more you increase the
use of these firearms in a variety of locations where they would not be
allowed today, the greater the potential for problems to occur that will
result in the loss of life or either serious bodily injury. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Further discussion? Further debate? Senator Goolsby for what
reason do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I rise to defend the second
amendment. Mr.President I'd like to speak on this notion to concur. I'm
looking after I heard Senator Kinnaird's comment and Senator Mckissick
was speaking. And I'm looking on the web US News and World Report. An
article from jsut last month in June. &quot;Study: Using Guns for
Defense Leads to Fewer Injuries&quot;  And citing actually four specific
studies from 1988 to two thousand-</p>

<p id="135:00">
...the assessment from the Institute of Medicine and the National
Research Council say &quot;Crime victims who use guns in self defense
have consistently lower injury rates than victims who use other
strategies to protect themselves.&quot;
I disagree with my colleagues regarding the use of guns. We live in a
society where not everyone obeys rules, with a Second Amendment that
protects us. And, Senator McKissick, your concerns about the people who
are allowed to carry weapons more freely are the concealed weapon carry
holders. Those are North Carolinians who have undergone the most
in-depth background check and training. They're citizens we can trust
the most. They're the people who come to our aid when some crazy person
is trying to harm us. They're the people that we don't have to worry
about. And I ask you to support this motion to concur.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion for the debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Senator Goolsby a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Goolsby, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Goolsby, have you read what was in the Second Amendment decision
that was made on this very subject, and the fact that they allowed --
they think that it should have gun -- there should be reasonable
controls? That they have said, in the decision, that the Second
Amendment right, like all other rights, is not unlimited and has
limitations which can be applied to the right to carry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma'am, and I do agree with reasonable limitations on that
constitutional right, and I thank you for acknowledging that. Is the
Second Amendment to our Constitution extremely important right. I
believe that the changes we have made to it to protect that right, and
to see to it that the right people are actually carrying firearms -
those who are trained, those who are carrying them concealed - and that
we make sure that the people we can trust the most in this society are
able to carry out that duty. Thank you, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
