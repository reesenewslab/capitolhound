  That we looked at where it was, that the process was giving priority to
certain types of projects and the other and we just didn’t find that, so
I’ll go through some recommendations. We had recommendations within each
of the 6 modes and then we had a series of recommendations across the
modes, and so from, as [??] just mentioned it’s important to remember
that the prioritization process is, within each mode there’s a series of
criteria and they’re all reported on a scale of 0-100, then those
criteria are combined into an overall score. The biggest statistical
issue that we found was that there were the low, the low ranges, low
values, low ranges of values on the scores and some disproportional
weighting, so what that means is if you have a 0-100 point scale that
you can report on, we found in a lot of instances where most of the
projects were in a very small window, a very small band of that, so
you’re losing the ability to distinguish against projects but then also
when you roll these together they have the, there’s the implication in
terms of the weighting that each of the criteria has on the score. So as
an example on this table here there is, it shows the criteria that were
used for the rail project and the weights assigned to them. When weights
are assigned that’s the relative priority of each criteria. So in this
example, benefits cost is assigned a weight to 20% but if you actually
look at the numbers the benefit cost of the projects who had about a 5%
or accounted for about 5% of the overall project. At the other end of
the scale there’s mobility where that was assigned a weight of 20, but
when you look at the numbers mobility was accounting for over half of
the final scores. So the issue with that, the reason that that’s
happening is because of the different approaches used to scale the
results on a 0-100 point scale, so one of our main recommendations was
to scale all of the criteria consistently. So this graph shows, tends to
show what that means. The blue line, straight line, this is just one
criteria within the [??] about how a raw score, a suggested score is
converted to the final score and so in this case the score is the score
until it reaches 100 and then it’s capped at 100 and all the projects
that get a score over that are capped at 100. The approach that we’re
recommending is grading on a curve, so you assign 100 to the project
that has the highest, you assign a 0 to the project that has the lowest
and then you grade a curve in between. So some of the implications of
that are that it will be possible theoretically for a project to have a
score of 100. If it’s the best project and all of the criteria and you
roll that together, it’s gonna get 100. The other thing that’s gonna
happen is that you will see in all cases some projects that ran high,
some that ran in the middle and some that ran low, you will see that the
results will reflect much closer the weights that were assigned to the
criteria at the beginning of the process and it would also help in some
consistency across when you start to look across modes. So for example
the best bike/ped project would be 100, the very best rail project would
be 100, so if you look at those scores independently you would say.
okay, I know that that is a really good project on this note and a
really good project on this note. Some of the other global
recommendations were, I mentioned, opportunities to improve consistency.
We found cases in which some key terms were being used inconsistently
across the notes, so we flagged those and recommended some definitions.
When possible, to look at the impact of a project, so look at the
congestion or safety or whatever before a project was built and after
it’s built and compare that difference and use that when possible
instead of just looking at current conditions. We recommend using a
measure of cost-effectiveness when benefit/cost is not possible. If
benefit/cost is a monetized benefit divided by the cost. In some of the
modes that’s just not possible to monetize the benefits of these
projects, so when that’s not possible we recommend using some other
qualitative or quantitative assessments of the benefits, divide them by
costs and referring to that or presenting that as the
cost-effectiveness. We also recommended introducing a new measure of
financial leverage that is for every dollar that DOT spends, how many
additional dollars do they attract to the state transportation program.

  Move to some health indicators now and these are largely based on the
available data and also based on how important they are for children’s
health. Children’s health is the foundation of overall development and
ensuring that they are born healthy is the first step toward increasing
their life chances. Poverty, poor nutrition, lack of preventative care,
substance abuse, maternal depression, family violence, all of these
things put children at risk and poor health in childhood impacts all the
aspects of a child’s life such as school readiness.
[00:35 - other meeting cuts in, completely drowning out prior speaker]
Perhaps it would help to clarify that the 20 mile buffer is the limit,
so the most points would go to a project closer to the terminal and then
we would still be able to continue to award points up to the 20, but
it’s the upper limit of when you are eligible to get points for the
project.
[00:54 - HHS meeting cuts back in softly, but audibly and other meeting

And children as you can see died from a broad array of factors, physical

[01:03 - other meeting again drowns out HHS meeting]
Thank you, Senator. We’ll look at the next criteria that you see up here
is accessibility and connectivity and again following the Cambridge
recommendations the workgroup spent a great deal of time deliberating on
what the intent and purpose of this particular criteria is and the best
way to measure it to accommodate that particular goal, and so at this
point the workgroup has defined it as improving access to opportunity in
rural and less affluent areas and improve interconnectivity of the
transportation network and the scoring criteria that they have
identified and the type of information that comes from the Department of
Commerce regarding economic distress indicators as well as the project’s
ability to upgrade the roadway function. For other criteria we sort of
lumped these together, pavement conditions, lane width, shoulder width
and economic competitiveness, the workgroup has agreed to continue to
use the criteria from [??] moving forward and that is consistent again
with what came out of the Cambridge recommendation. At this point
there’s still a lot of deliberation about some very important topics,
the [??] of which is the benefit/cost criteria and this is a particular
criteria where there are some recommendations to improve the effect on
scoring and to improve the financial leverage component of local
financial contribution to a project in this particular criteria, but
I’ll be candid, this particular topic has been something that the
workgroup has struggled with. They’re really trying to evaluate what the
impact of any changes might be so they’re deliberate and slow and
methodical about their evaluation of this criteria and the recommended
option and recognize that any change in this criteria could have
intended or unintended consequences and they want to make sure they
fully understand those before making a final recommendation. Some
examples of questions that have come up for dialogue and conversations
that the workgroup has had is that if I take a [??] to the complex
project and reduce the scope of it and such reduce the cost of the
project, that should hopefully improve the benefit/cost of the project,
but the downside of that then could be are we then prioritizing low cost
projects versus the best project possible, so they wanna continue to
talk through those types of examples. Another concept is the financial
leverage piece. If the local area is able to contribute money to the
project to reduce the overall cost to the state budget, you know,
looking at the trust fund dollars, should that not help improve the
benefit/cost part. That is a positive conversation in some ways, but in
others is it saying that, you know, perhaps having difficulty in certain
local areas to come up with that kind of money am I maybe accidentally
penalizing an area because they don’t have the ability to bring the
money to the table, and so these are the types of dialogues and
conversations that the workers are having and that’s why they have yet
to make a recommendation. They really want to sort through all the
possible implications of adjusting this criteria. Looking at peak and
seasonal traffic, I think it’s safe to say that recognizing that there
are peak volumes of traffic across the state, the workgroup really is
committed to trying to find a way to move beyond just average annual
daily traffic counts across the entire state and really try to find an
effective, confident way to look at peak fluctuation throughout the
state, and this may be seasonal traffic due to tourism, it may be
traffic due to other types of seasonality. For example, we noticed in
our study that there is a traffic counter in the Crabtree area, Crabtree
mall area that has a really high peak seasonality around the holiday
shopping season. Imagine that. Such a surprise, so what this map shows
you are the current 71 permanent count stations that we have and we did
work with the group over at NC State to help us evaluate what the
possibilities would be for defining a very consistent and confident
building method for peak seasonal traffic. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] for
factoring that information? [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] So these are 71
permanent traffic counters that are, they maintain and operate and get
that 24 hours a day. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes,
sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Did we, can I get some of that, how would be the
best way to capture the data I’m interested in

  Will it show us migratory patterns? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I don’t believe
so. They’re permanent counters that just sort of stand on the side of
the road and just count the number of cars that are coming but they
don’t show relationship to other count stations. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Correct. How long would they have been doing this? Five years, three
years, two years, one year, ten years? [SPEAKER CHANGES] People were
looking at an average. It’s at least 5-10 years. I&#39;ll get you some
specific [??] Yes, we’ll be happy to answer this question. What this
graph then shows is what [??] was able to do by gleaning data from those
71 count stations and saying okay, we set the average on this graph at
1. Each one of the count stations is sort of set at a value of 1 for
their average daily traffic and then we see the ups and downs or the
ebbs and flows on the graph throughout the 12 months of the year, 1
being January, 12 being December. It shows you that there are some areas
where those peak areas do last for more than just a day or a weekend.
They, perhaps, last over a 30 or 40 or 50 or 60 day period so what the
workgroup said is this is encouraging information. This lets us know
that there is data out there, but we’re not so sure that we’re confident
with 71 count stations so we’ve asked [??] to continue to refine their
review of this information using 3,000 additional counts that we have
throughout the state and we’re expecting the results of that information
soon, but I can tell you today that the workgroup is very committed to
trying to find a way to see if this can be used in P4 planning. Other
topics that are still under consideration are future projections much
like Joe was talking about. We have a very meaningful way of capturing
the current condition of our roadway or the current congestion or the
current traffic demand on a particular segment. We now have at our
fingertips something called the North Carolina State Ride Travel Demand
Model that’s been under development for close to two years and it’s
looking at beyond what the Federal Highway’s recommendation the Chair
mentioned, looking at specific data here in North Carolina. Looking at
our land use patterns. Looking at some of our information that we know
about our state specifically and we’re running some tests with that
model and if that model is able to produce some confidence, future
projections, then the workgroup will continue to look to see if that
could be a way we could improve our benefit/cost criteria perhaps or
others. There’s multiple places where we could potentially use it and so
the workgroup wants to get that information from this pilot and test
from before they make any final recommendation. When we look at safety
criteria, one thing that the workgroup also wanted to think about, again
looking to those future projections that were recommended, is we are
able to say that the existing segment or the existing roadway or the
existing rail terminal has an existing safety rating of based on
whatever’s used to calculate safety for those types of projects. What we
are not consistently able to do at this point is project the safety
benefits of putting particular projects in place. So we recognize that
that is a deficiency and so we’ve challenged sort of a safety team, is
what I’ve been calling them sort of unofficially, to really look at what
are ways that we might be able to better evaluate the future safety
benefit of a particular project consistently so that perhaps we can
include that either in the safety criteria or even in the benefits of
the benefit/cost criteria. Another item under consideration again is
congestion. We understand that that’s a very significant criteria that
seems pretty straightforward, but when the group started to look at it
again they wanted to make sure that again, very much like the
benefit/cost criteria, that if we do make recommendations as a workgroup
to adjust this criteria that we fully understand the unintended or
intended changes that that might make in the overall scoring of that
criteria. So currently it’s using volume to capacity ratios and the
existing volume and the workgroup wants to make sure that that’s the
right way to do it, to keep doing it the way we did it in 3.0 or if we
can make some modifications to improve it that we do that as well. More
topics still under discussion as you’ll notice, we have more under
discussion than decisions made, but that’s part of the nature of the
workgroup, to make sure that there’s full, deliberate conversations
around every item before it becomes an official recommendation. The
non-highway modes criteria, we began to receive some presentations from
each of the bicycle and pedestrian and public transportation. We’re able
to share some of their recommendations based on what they learned from
the Cambridge Study back in our last workgroup meeting, so we’re still
in the process of just evaluating what those outcomes are. Evacuation
routes, this one’s been a little bit prickly for us. We, it’s very much
like benefit/cost. The workers have struggled to determine what the
benefit of including evacuation routes might be, perhaps for safety or
for congestion. They’ve talked about it, they’ve agreed, then they’ve
talked about it again and so it’s a topic very much up for debate and so
what they’re working to do is to determine what’s the best place for it.
Some options have been to perhaps make sure there’s data available so
that locals could use it in the local input periods as part of their
criteria for their local methodologies. Others are to find a data
element that could be incorporated into one of the scoring criteria, but
again no decision has been made to date, and normalization. This is one
where we were pleasantly surprised as our department and our team were
showing you

  I hope we have got time now
[speaker changes]so we need to move on. I mean  If you have any quick
feedback, you can send it out to Daughtry or to Susan.  but we do need
feedback.
[Speaker Changes] We will talk out. Representative Paul
[Speaker Changes] Since she is looking for it. I would say if it&#39;s
the monetary value, not belittling the project to offset the monetary
that they would like doing a budget based on that continuation budget if
you would. So, If you want ten and you are going to get five, that&#39;s
not an increase on cut. I am just saying, Let&#39;s work with the real
hours. someone bring something to the table . I don&#39;t think that
should be the value and the scoring should reflect that. And that was
our at least my understanding from day one that if another entity
brought something to the table reducing the cost to the state DFT then
that would be a value and that project was right kind of get going. And
I have heard nothing contrary to that.
[Speaker Changes] One option that you could mind [?? inaudible
01:10-01:44]
[Speaker Changes] Follow up
[Speaker Changes] Follow up Thank you. Is the responsibility of allowing
close proximity municipals to pool or it&#39;s going to benefit a
general area or rating through municipal school funds.
[Speaker Changes] Actually I would say co-ordinate with speakers to get
the feedback
[Speaker Changes] Thank You Mr Speaker
[Speaker Changes]  Representative
[Speaker Changes] You said there are several things that you feel that
we have been silent on . You gave us a couple of examples. Could you go
ahead and get a list from the work group&#39;s perspective of the things
that you feel like you would like have  inputs from us and then  we can
try and develop a process in order to provide that feedback. I am sorry
[Speaker Changes] [?? inaudible].
[Speaker Changes] Okay
[Speaker Changes] Are you going Representative
[Speaker Changes] Well. I want to add something. you mentioned [??
inaudible 02:48-03:05]
[Speaker Changes] We can certainly take any recommendations for
discussions. Absolutely. Yes, we can talk about that.
[Speaker Changes] [?? inaudible]
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr Chairman. I have a question. Tolling for
any of the staff can explain . If a road is built, the local mbo says
are we allowing them to use tolling a s a local incentive. So they are
not putting any money rather than agree to put a toll on a road. and we
are caught in that is to their favor. Okay. thank you
[Speaker Changes] All right. would like to recognize our next speakers,
Paul Black and Patrick Clanigham
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr Chair. Good Morning. I am Paul Black. I
am the director of the French Broad River mbo up in Ashville. I am also
the current president of the North Carolina association of mbo&#39;s.
And we wanted to present somethings today that have come out of 3.0 and
talk about some of our experiences and things we think we might be able
to tweak for outside of the purview of the work group and put them in
front of you today. So Let me go ahead and Let Patrick introduce himself
for the record

  <p id="55:00">
  Thank you guys for this opportunity. So to start it off just an overview
slide of some of the things we’re gonna talk about this morning.
Overall, STI, really we thought worked very well. It really helped
improve transparency and we got a good mix of projects out of it. Some
things we learned along the way, revenue. You know, this is all about
revenue and we’re looking at balancing being good stewards with being
able to deliver the best projects when we know there’s not enough money
to go around. A couple of specific things we wanna ask for, we’d like
you to reexamine some of the things with some special pots of money that
come to the NPOs. We wanna look at some of the ways we classify regional
facilities. We wanna look at the fact that there is no local input on
the statewide tier. That was problematic for some of us, and then talk
about some of the non-highway modes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So first of all
we really do wanna say that this legislation is a big improvement. We’ve
seen that already. It’s improved transparency, the coordination between
DOT members, the division engineers, NPOs and RPOs, it has improved. We
do still have some work to do on that, but this did bring everyone
together and it really is fostering good communication and coordination
and then again the spot work that you were just hearing about really
continues to be the most effective way of making the small changes and
adjusting stuff based on, you know, lessons learned from the previous
round and hammering out all those details. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All right,
yeah, we talked about revenue and I think one of the things we continue
to struggle with is we know we’re not bringing in enough revenue
compared to how much people are traveling. People’s vehicles are getting
better mileage and so they’re still driving the same mileage they used
to but they’re not buying as much gasoline and we really applaud the
General Assembly’s efforts. We know that there have been many studies
over the years looking at many different options and we really wanna
applaud you for continuing to look at ways to fix the revenue picture.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right, these are the NPO slides. We want to talk
about two special pots of money, ths STPDA and TAP funds that come
directly to NPOs. We have 10, they’re called TMAs, Transportation
Management Areas, they’re scattered around the state. They are in 12 out
of the 14 divisions have at least a piece of a TMA and every single one
of the funding regions have a piece of a TMA. In terms of NPOs in
general, there is only one division, division one does not have an NPO
in it. These funds tend to get used on the division tier. They’re used
for a lot of different things. There are some eligibility requirements
from the feds that we have to deal with. They do get used for bike, ped
and transit, they also get used for roadway improvements. There are some
safety projects in here. They vary from NPO to NPO, but this is money
that the NPOs have a local process that they go through, decide what
projects to fund and then we talk to the programming unit at DOT and
they program that money for us. They are not exempt from SPI. What this
did was it reduced the amount of available money, particularly in the
division tier, for the areas outside of the TMAs. Around most of the
state it sort of came out of the balance. We had competitive projects,
they had competitive projects outside of TMAs and it all worked out, in
two divisions in particular, though, divisions 5 and divisions 10, there
was such a big chunk of STPDA that came out off the top that it made it
very difficult for projects in places like Rocksboro and Indian Trail to
compete for that leftover money and just as good neighbors we don’t
think that that was right by them and we would like you to reexamine
looking at exempting STPDA similar to the way that we currently exempt
CMAC and Appalachian Development Funds. We think that will make for a
fairer competitive playing field at the division level plot. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] So one of the things we’ve looked at is how some of these
different elements fell into the statewide regional or divisional tier.
So some of the things we’re kind of noticing is not all regional impact
roads function as thru traffic carriers and not all division needs roads
serve just local traffic, so perhaps there would be a way to look at the
federal functional classification of roads. We could help delineate what
roads fit best in what tier or something of that nature, but try to
really clean that up so that we’re really addressing the needs of how
the road functions in the tier that makes most sense, and then another
thing that kinda jumped out was the fixed highway transit systems.
They’re sort of large populations over large geographic areas and
support, you know, non vehicular commuting to employment centers, and
this is more consistent with the regional impact tier, so potentially
making those eligible for funds out of those regional dollars and then
kinda the same thing with the ferry system. All the ferry docks connect
regional impact highway routes

  And I would just mention healthy North Carolinians, we used to take a
county-wide survey and we know through that survey some of the local
factors, but so am I getting at what the next step might be? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] So you have a healthy North Carolina 2020 strategic plan which
does have some targets for children specifically. You could consider
some of this information today and other information’s been presented
and do a child’s health 2020 plan if you wanted to do something specific
for children. That would be an option. You could look at the counties
that have the greatest risk factors based on these particular indicators
that you’re focusing on and then assure that you have funds available to
local communities for them to address those particular problems. I think
what this state has tried to do through the healthy North Carolina 2020
plan is to provide for the variation kind of counties so that counties
can identify which targets to work on but then also as a state something
like obesity where none of the counties are meeting a target of 5% for
preschoolers, a statewide strategy makes a lot of sense, so depending on
the particular targets there may be a state wide strategy or there may
be locally driven strategies, but in either event there needs to be
enough infrastructure through your public health system to assure that
the funds are being used in the most impactful way for the populations
that are, you know, disproportionately impacted by poor health. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So
let’s assume that we, that one of the directions we wanted to go was to
increase our revenue for our local health departments and I understand
the state doesn’t really give a lot directly of state dollars. If I
remember correctly from my county commissioner days it was about 3% of
what’s spent actually comes from state dollars and that may be wrong and
it it is I’d like to know, so we could, even if we were to pick an issue
like obesity, it would be most effective to do that through our local
health departments at the county level. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Your local
health departments in this state are your greatest asset in terms of
driving improvements at the county level and so investing in those
public health agencies I think would be a strategic investment because
they’re already at the hub of the community health assessment, the
community health improvement plan, they’re already bringing partners
together to address these problems, they just don’t have the resources
to move the needle, so I think if you’re really hoping to make
investments where you’re gonna see results that would be the place to do
it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe Chairwoman Avila had a follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, and it’s kind of built on the question that
Senator Hise asked on page 34 about the ranking of number 34. That’s an
overall ranking as I’m understanding you that’s based on four individual
factors ranking. Do you have the ranking of each of those individuals? I
mean, like are we 12 on one and 52 on another for the 52 states. I mean,
just, what are those to get us to the 34th overall. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
do have those, I just don’t have them with me, so I’d be happy to
provide that as follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Members, thank you for your questions. Dr. Silenti, thank you
for being here today with your presentation. If we have no other
questions we’ll stand adjourned. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
