[Speaker Changes] Is there reverend Peter Milner, the chaplain of the
senate.
[Speaker Changes] Let us pray. Almighty God, heavenly Father, you are
our light and our salvation. Lord, you have been our dwelling place from
generation to generation. Nothing can be hidden from your sight. You
have placed each of us here today in your sovereign will. You’ve placed
these senators here in a position to serve the people that have elected
them. May they serve them with humility. As we come before you today,
Lord, on this holy ground, we come with fear, with anxiety, and even
with gladness. And as we travel together, this course of history may we
be reminded of what the great hymn writer said: “Ye fearful saints,
fresh courage take, the clouds ye so much dread, are big with mercy and
shall break in blessings on your head. Judge not the Lord by feeble
sense, but trust him for his grace, behind a frowning providence he
hides a smiling face. Lord your purposes will ripen fast, unfolding
every hour. The bud may have bitter taste, but sweet will be the flower.
Blind unbelief is sure to err and scan his work in vain, but God is his
own interpreter and he will make it plain.” And we asks all these things
in the name of Christ Jesus, through him and in him, in his blessed
name. Amen.
[Speaker Changes] You may take your seats. The sergeant at arms is

[All speaking] I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of
America, and to the Republic for which it stands one nation, under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

To make a nomination.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor for your nomination, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members, guests, it's another great day in the
North Carolina Senate. It's a day we look forward to every two years.
Many of us have been here more years than we'd like to think and add up.
Senator Allran was here in 1870 and then 1898 or second Lincoln
Administration maybe, we can't get it straight. That being said, we made
history two years ago. We made history this year. And it is my pleasure
today to nominate the man who led us over the last two years and I think
any of us that served with him over the last two years and those of us
that are serve with him prior to the last two years will tell you that
he follows in the great tradition that we've seen in this Senate of
President Pro Tems. With compassion and caring for the great state of
North Carolina. And I think, with the actions we've seen the last two
years, that we can expect even more the next two years. So it is my
honor and pleasure today to nominate Phil Berger to a term, the next
term as President Pro Tem of the North Carolina Senate. Thank you, Mr.
President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brown, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To second a nomination and to make a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor for the motion, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, members, Senator Apodaca, I couldn't have said it any
better. I think Senator Berger's done a great job leading us the last
two years and it sure is a great pleasure for me to get to do this a
second time as well. I rise to second a nomination of Senator Phil
Berger to President Pro Tem of the 2013 North Carolina Senate. I further
move that the nominations be closed and that Senator Berger's nomination
be accepted by acclimation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator. The motion is that the nominations be closed and
that the nomination of Senator Phillip E. Berger as President Pro
Tempore of the 2013 Senate</p>

<p id="30:00">
Amber, I thank you for being here and for your support over the years,
and all of understand the importance of our families and the support we
have from our families in order to enable us to serve in public office.
And so I thank you, and I know all of our colleagues thank their family
members as well.
Today we renew the fight for reform that started two years ago. When the
voters sent a new General Assembly to Raleigh to change the way our
government operates. For too many years, North Carolina tried to tax and
spend its way to prosperity. For too many years, North Carolina lost
jobs, lost businesses, failed to educate many of our children, and
struggled to compete. Our leaders had lost their way. And our state lost
its place as the leader of the South and the envy of the nation. We
vowed two years ago in this chamber to begin fixing those problems. And
we've made great progress in just the short period of time. Today, that
work continues. Senators, as we make tough decisions, I want us to be
thinking about the families out there struggling to make ends meet.
Sitting around their  kitchen tables balancing their checkbooks. Saving
for retirement or for the college education for their children. Think of
them as we craft bills and cast votes. Ask yourself how can we help them
create a better life. How can we work together to help small businesses
become more successful. How can we work together to help working
families take home more in their paychecks. Ask yourselves, how can we
help their children get a better education. Regardless of the political
consequences. Ask yourselves how we, as a body, can come together to
help our towns and communities compete in order to create jobs and grow
our economy. The voters have placed in our hands enormous trust and
responsibility. We have the opportunity to set sweeping policy, to
change the direction of North Carolina and to make a real and lasting
difference.
To my Republican colleagues: We must show our constituents, this state,
and this country that there is a real difference between a Washington
Republican and a North Carolina Republican. North Carolina Republicans
deliver. We kept our word, and we act on the promises we've made. We
made that clear last session. We cut taxes, unleashing private
enterprise to grow our economy and create new jobs. We cut government
red tape and bureaucracy. We began the long process of retooling our
public education system to make it more focused on delivering positive
results for our children. Those were great achievements, but they were
only the beginning. These next 2 years, Republicans and Democrats must
set the bar even higher. With Governor McCrory, his administration, and
leaders in every branch of government, we will reform our old and
outdated tax code. Today, our tax system slows economic growth, kills
jobs, and hurts businesses. It's one of the single greatest roadblocks
to our recovery and we will not stop until it's improved. We will
continue making government more efficient and more responsive. Taxes on
working families are still way too high. Regulations on our job creators
are still way too cumbersome. And we have an obligation to change that.
We will never back down from the effort to reform our public schools No
child. No child in North Carolina should be forced to attend a failing
school. And while we are committed to rewarding and recognizing our best
teachers, no teacher should be guaranteed a job if they fail in their
responsibility to educate our children. Every month, every week, every
day that we accept mediocrity, another child slips through the cracks.</p>

We will move on this critical lift issue and we will move quickly most
of you know me I grew up in a working class home my dad worked with his
hands throughout my life I had to work hard as many of you had. I worked
multiple jobs while raising a family to work through college and through
law school. My wife and I both understand what it takes to makes hand
meet. We have seen firsthand, how hard work and determination makes
anything possible. Education reform, tax reform, regulatory reform they
ate lofty goals but if we work hard we can change our state. We can make
it more competitive more successful and help the families of North
Carolina. I know many North Carolinians have lost home, feel stuck. They
wonder will they ever get ahead. Each and every day when we walk into
this chamber remember we have an obligation to those in our state who
are working hard and doing their best to provide to their families. Now
is the time when we the leaders roll up our sleeves and get to work. We
will not waste this great opportunity. Will there be tough battles? You
bet. Will we have to make decisions that take us outside of our comfort
zone. Yes. But it's the right thing for us to do and no matter how
difficult or daunting the task. We must keep our eyes on what's best for
the people of this great state. I want to thank you for the trust that
you proposed in me and I thank you for the opportunity to serve you and
for the opportunity to serve the people of the state of North Carolina
and may god bless this body and the people of our great state. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please be seated. The next order of business to come
before Senate is the adoption of rules and procedures by which this body
shall govern itself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President this morning I thought Senate resolution
number one 2013 rolls. A move that the resolution be walked before the
Senate for immediate consideration. I understand that the members do
have copies.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you senator. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate resolution number one. Senate resolution
adopting to permanent rules in the Senate for the regular session of the
2013 general assembly, sponsored by senate Apodaca.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca you are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. Members with the rules we
were able to send out yesterday about around noon to 12:30. There's not
a substantial change I don't believe in any of the rules from previous
session. There are roughly 16 changes most of them are non-substantive
pretty simple I am gonna hit some high notes as we go forward. We have
worked on out emergency provisions to deal with of there is an emergency
and we have to meet somewhere else. The parliamentarian if you remember
last year never pointed it so we just decided and set it aside go forth
the way we have done it before. Ordinary resolutions we worked in last
time we are tweaking it trying to get it exactly where we wanted. We no
longer allow pagers in chamber. Senator Tillman I know this gonna be
tough on you but you get rid of your pagers we have cell phones now.
Your granddaughters will be happy to help you with that. We are
eliminating a couple of committees, the mental health will roll back in
the health committee and the redistricting committee I know many of
others will like to go through senator.</p>

e-corresponding. You can't do that with a fax machine so we hope that we
move in to the computer age, we can save some trees, and be a little
more efficient in how we operate the chamber. Senator ?? loves this one
so. This will help us all. We last year we had kind of a gray area
brought up in our rolls by former Senator Berger on who has the
authority to move bills around, we've cleaned that up, we call that the
Berger Amendment. The conference reports, the way they're calendared, ??
this questions. We have operated Senator Stein as a courtesy in the
chamber and we just tightened it up and clarified it as we have been
doing it in the past to bring it into the rolls. This is one I think
many of us enjoy, we're going to put a 15 minute cooling off period
after session before a lobbyist can enter the floor of the senate. That
will give us all time to gather our things and get back to our offices
before we're covered up. Maybe we can sneak out another door. The rest
are basic non-substitute non-stylistic changes. I'll be happy to answer
any questions. Encourage and ask for your support. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator. The question for the senate is the adoption of Senate
resolution number 1, is there any discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator ?? for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President, to ask the gentleman a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator you have the floor. Senator Apodaca do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do since he called me a gentleman I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator do you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A right friendly gentleman I might say. Congratulations to you. Could
you share with us what committee you plan to handle redistricting
matters in so that we can make sure that we the proper people requesting
the committee that may hear redistricting matters as we move through
session. It would be helpful.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It was my understanding if we need to we'll start a Committee back, but
we're hoping we don't need to. But if we do, we'll start the
redistribute back and appoint most of the same members that were there
before.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Question Senator Apodaca.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, I was looking at rule 40 and in particular A1, and of
course as it reads now as proposed, it says any senator wishes to
co-sponsor a bill or resolution we just going to file may do so no later
than one hour following the adjournment of the session during which such
bill or resolution was first read. But only electronically in a
procedure approved by the clerk. Now I know frequently, as we all know,
in the chaos of bill deadlines, there are literally many bills which are
filed, and many of those bills are simply read in. And determined
whether one might want to join in cosponsoring a good piece of
legislation sponsored by a colleague or not and that one hour deadline
after it being read in seems to be somewhat restrictive and a deviation
from the procedures we've followed in the past. So I guess I was
wondering what your thoughts were about that particular provision in
particular, and I mean I guess it's always with these things we can see
how it works but you know, historically, there have been bills which
many of us may not have been aware are out there until they appear in
our committees and they were debated and discussed and many times I know
myself in particular and many other persons have gone to the clerk's
office and arranged to sign on to specific bills that we thought were
meritorious legislation. So, one hour after it's first read in you're
only getting the title, you don't know much about it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Senator McKissick thank you. I had the same question myself. And
the process will be, the bill will be filed and then it will come to the
rules committee, it will be assigned to a particular Committee then it
will be read in, so the reality of the situation is you're going to have
a minimum of about 26 hours to look at a bill. It will be posted by the
clerk's office on a screen so you can just scan down, see what you like
there, see if you want to become a sponsor of that bill. And hopefully
that will cut out having to go to the clerk's office and see what was
actually filed. Then the next day it will be read in in session. Again,
you can listen to see if there's something you may, if you haven't had a
chance to look at it, tweak your interest, and so you have an hour after
that, after we adjourn from that session, to go on and cosponsor. The
reality of the situation will be 26, 27 hours during the week and
&lt;/h3&gt;</p>

And you would possibly have all weekend if it was filed on a Thursday.
So it's not the same day as filed, it will not be read in.
[Speaker Change]
Quick follow-up.
[Speaker Change]
Senator do you yield?
[Speaker Change]
Sure.
[Speaker Change]
Yeah I would guess ?? that we will see how this new procedure works, and
if necessary revisit it, because it does seem like as you're aware this
has not been a part of our practice in the past ??. So it's something
completely new and I think it's gonna take kind of a trial and error
period to see if it's
[Speaker Change]
Absolutely.
[Speaker Change]
Functioning as intended cuz my best guess is they'll be many people. You
know how bill filling deadline ??, there are hundreds of bill’s

Right.

Thank you.
[Speaker Change]
Yes, this will be a work in progress. We're not gonna put this in stone,
so yes. Thank you.

Is there any further discussion or debate? 'Kay hearing none all those
in favor of the adoption of Senate resolution number one will vote aye,
that is the green button, or no the red button. You will have 10 seconds
to vote, and the clerk will record the vote. 47 having voted in the
affirmative, and none in the negative. The rules of the 2013 Senate are
adopted. Let the record show that leaves of absence for today’s session
are requested for Senator Clodfelter and Senator Wade. Now we'll move to
the election of other officers within the Senate. Senate rule 65
establishes the office of the deputy president pro tempore and
nominations are now in order for the deputy president pro tempore for
the 2013 Senate.

[Speaker Change]
To make a nomination.
[Speaker Change]

[Speaker Change]
Mr. President, members of the Senate. I rise to nominate Senator Louis
Pate to serve as the deputy pro tempore. Louis Pate first served as a
member of the general assembly, representing the state house 11th
district from '95 to '96, and again from 2003 to 2008. His district
included constituents in Wayne County, he was elected to the Senate in
2010 representing the 5th district, and now represents the 7t district.
Which includes Wayne, Pitt, and Monroe County. Senator Pate is a retired
merchant, mayor, and city council member of Mt. Olive, North Carolina.
He served 20 years in the air force, and retired as a major in 1982. In
Vietnam he navigated B-52, and later F1-11's. He is a father of three,
and a grandfather of 9. He is joined by his wife and other family
members today. He was a strong member of our freshman caucus in 2010,
and we are honored and privileged to serve with such a great gentleman.
With that I formerly nominate Senator Louis Pate to serve as our deputy
pro tempore.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Senator Hise.

Pate to serve as the deputy president pro tempore. I further move that

acclimation.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Senator. The motion is that the nominations be closed, and
that the nomination of Senator Louis Pate for the deputy president pro
tempore for the 2013 Senate be accepted by acclimation. Is there any
further discussion or debate? If not those in favor will say aye.
[Speaker Change]

conscientious.  I think she is friendly and helpful to any member or any
person that needs help. She frets, she worries, she probably hasn't
slept in a week and she has done a magnificent job. So it is with no
hesitation at all I stand today to nominate Sarah Clapp, our Principal
Clerk for the 2013 session of the North Carolina Senate.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Members, what we have in
front of us is an Adjournment Resolution. Don't get excited. It's not
for the whole year. It takes us till we come back the 30th, so we can
get back on the 30th and hit the ground running. As you know, this is
the first time we've done the organizational session early so we can get
everyone appointed, get committees set up and come back and be ready to
go. Since we are adjourning for longer than three days, the Constitution
requires that we adjourn by Joint Resolution. So that's what this does.
Everybody has one on their desk, and I certainly  ask for your support.
And I'll be happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator. Is there any further discussion or
debate? Hearing none, the question before the Senate is the passage of
Senate Joint Resolution 2 on its second reading. All those in favor will
vote Aye. Opposed will vote No. Ten seconds will be allowed for the

[Speaker Changes] ?? Sweeping tax reforms to improve the economy. Today,
unemployment in North Carolina is 9.1%, among the highest in the nation.
In 1963, gas cost .29 cents per gallon. Today, we pay more than that in
taxes for gas in North Carolina. Many of our families are struggling
just to make ends meet. We have the responsibility to get the burden of
taxation and regulations off the backs of our families and small
businesses and put people back to work. It is time for sweeping reforms
that will simplify the tax code and jumpstart the economy. We have the
opportunity and we will have the courage to take advantage of it. In
1963, the first purposed built ocean drillers were launched in the Gulf
of Mexico for deep water offshore drilling. Thanks to the efforts of
many of you, 50 years later we have an energy jobs act in North Carolina
that will allow us to explore our energy options, both onshore and off.
And design an energy plan suitable for the 21st century. It is time to
get busy exploring and producing natural gas and oil to make North
Carolina the first energy independent state in the US. We have the
resources and we will have the courage to use them. In 1963, the concept
of cloud computing was invented at MIT. It was called time sharing. For
the first time in modern history, we have the opportunity to take
advantage of cloud computing to transform the world of education through
virtual learning. We have the opportunity for the first time in history
to customize education curriculum to each student in North Carolina,
through the online classroom. It is time to break down the barriers of
education through school choice and open the world of learning to all
students, black, white, hispanic, rich, poor, and middle class. We have
the tools and we will have the courage to make it happen. A significant
work of architecture, like this building is only realized and remembered
because of design leadership. Architects are visionaries, planners,
creative problem solvers and consensus builders, and these are the
qualities that will be demanded of you as leaders of our great state. An
architect knows that a great building starts with a solid foundation.
And a solid foundation starts with a well thought out plan. And that
plan starts with a vision. The designer of this building envisioned a
future where the leaders of our state could come together despite their
differences to work for the common good. They designed a building
deigned open for the people, solely devoted to the legislative branch of
government. So Senators and Representatives could work alongside each
other in close proximity, to solve the challenges of our great state. We
have many challenges that face us in North Carolina in 2013, but as
designers of North Carolina’s future, we will tackle these challenges
with boldness and courage. We will build a strong foundation for our
future and design a North Carolina that our children and grandchildren
will be proud of 50 years from now in 2063. A great trust has been
placed in you by the people of our state. I know each of you are up to
the task of ensuring that trust is never breeched. I look forward to
working with you and getting to know you over the next two years, and
you have my word that I will preside over this body with fairness and
transparency. May God bless each of you with wisdom, knowledge, and
courage as you lead our great state. Thank you.
Now Senators, having received your oath of office, adopted rules and
procedure, and elected your officers the chair directs the principle
clerk to send a message to the House of Representatives, informing that
honorable body that the Senate of 2013 General Assembly is organized and
ready to proceed with public business. Are there any notices or
announcements?

[Speaker Changes] Senator Burger, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes] Make an announcement.
[Speaker Changes] You have the floor, Senator.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. President. Members of the Senate,
earlier today I submitted a list of committee appointments. In a moment,
I’m going to ask that those appointments be read in by the reading clerk
after we adjourn. Before thats done, I want to give the Senators a sense
of what to expect as far as the committee calendars are concerned and
what the calendar will look like between now and the 30th. Generally, we
do not expect committees to meet or need to meet before we come back on
the 30th. That being said, in specific instances, the speaker and I are
willing to entertain requests from Committee chairs to allow for
particular committees to meet for organizational purposes only. This
authority will be granted on a case by case basis. So I'd ask that the
committees...</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I served as with a lot of other members of this senate chamber with
Senator Ed Jones. Senator Jones and I represented a large quadrant of
north east and North Carolina. That was represented largely ruled low
wealth counties, symbol of problems, symbol of issues with all the
counties. It's been a lot of time working directly with Senator Jones
and I just wanted to make a simple comment to Mr. President, the members
of the senate, the chamber and particularly Mrs. Jones, I got a call
very shortly after Ed's death from a news reporter who asked me what my
thoughts were about Senator Jones and my comment was quick and that was
Ed Jones was a pure gentleman. And I'd ask this chamber to adjourn with
senator Jones and his family in their thoughts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

lost another dear member during the recess and if you don't mind Senator
Jenkins I'd also like to add Senator Don East to our adjournment motion
