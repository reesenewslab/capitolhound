[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. Let’s bow together and truly pray. Heavenly father, we
come before you confessing our sins. Acknowledging that without you we
can do nothing that is riotous. Lord how I thank you for these Senators,
for their families, for their sacrifices they make to serve others. Lord
I know that each one has challenges that have nothing to do with
legislation. Family, friends, finances, health, I pray that you will
administer to each one in a special way. And now Lord we ask your
blessing upon this session. I pray oh Lord, you would sanctify this time
by your truth, for your word is truth. You are the one who raises one up
and brings another down. It is to you that we all should give account.
We’re not playing so we pray the prayer of second President, John Adams,
when he said, May none but those who are wise and honest ever rule under
this roof. And we proclaim to all that would hear, to the world that is
seen and the world that is not seen, that Jesus Christ is Lord of this
habitation. And we pray these things in the name of him who said, I am
the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father, but by
me. In the name of Jesus, amen.

<p id="30:00">
[Speaker changes.] Since that time, these cases have plummeted. I'm
proud of that work.  The imposition of the death penalty has dropped
precipitously since those measures were passed.  Such that last year no
death penalties were awarded by the jury in North Carolina. I believe
this reflects the feelings of the people of our state. I was also
instrumental with medical doctors in persuading the medical board that
killing a person is inconsistent with their life-giving and
live-sustaining mission. Apparently my colleague agrees with that, as
this bill allows anyone...not a health professional to administer the
chemicals to kill the inmate. I was also an author, with Senator
McKissick of the Racial Justice Act.  The bill was the result of several
studies that showed the unfairness of the imposition of the death
penalty. We have on our desk, a concern that that was not accurate.
That those studies were not accurate but I wanna' tell you the way that
those studies were carried out. UNC law school graduates went into 100
counties' court houses and looked at every death penalty jury selection
in the results so you can argue with statistics as percentages but you
cannot argue with their findings. And, of course, what we found in
addition, is a poor defendant, person from a rural area...and finally
the race of the defendant and the race of the victim will more often
result in the imposition of the death penalty. And, of course, this is
most dramatically reflected in jury selection. The studies done after
the passage of the Racial Justice Act reveal the role of racial bias in
jury selection. In one case, tried last year, the District Attorney's
notes from the capital trial were found with explicit comments about the
potential jurors race. Victims families.  Senator Goolsby says that
those victims' families need closure. They need justice but not all
victim's families speak in one voice.  There is an organization called
Murder Victims Against Death Penalty and they are against this bill.
They are against all killing, including by the state. What difference
does this make? We must have a system that is fair and untainted with
racial bias. Over and over, since I have been engaged in this debate, I
was told that there are numerous court reviews which guarantee that
mistakes can't be made in imposing the death penalty, but what happened
in those seven wrongfully convicted people? Over and over, repeal after
appeal said the conviction was fair but they were not fair. What
difference does all of this make? Dead is dead. Those with numerous
court reviews were still wrongfully convicted. Those outside the system
who believe in a fair and just system, have found those seven innocent
people on death row who were exonerated, and, may I say that two of
those prosecutors who hid exculpatory evidence in those cases...in one
case...did not lose their jobs and were not even censored. But those
seven people lost their lives, their families lost the years of their
lives together. We cannot afford more wrongfully convicted people. We
need safeguards.  The District Attorneys seem to feel they are under
attack..that this questions their competency, their integrity.  I ask
the District Attorneys to work with us for a fair and just system.  We
can all be proud when we have the most fair and just system possible.
This bill does not do that.  It takes that away. I ask that you vote
against this bill. Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] Mister President?

Tell the body how RJA impacts the guilt or innocence of the defendant on
Death Row.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Pate, what it impacts is a system of jury selection, and we know
that guilt or innocence is decided by a jury, and we also know that an
impartial jury - and that's the word in the constitution - would reflect
the people of the state and that's why it is so important that we have
impartial jury selection and we know who picks the jury - the prosecutor
and the defending attorney.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird, you tell the body how RJA impacts the guilt or the
innocence of a defendant on Death Row. How does RJA impact their guilt
or innocence?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You may answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We will find out through trials, such as the two that have taken place,
whether a person was perhaps - in these cases they were found guilty,
that's not...  But there are other cases where the jury that was
constituted may very well have been biased and at that point it would
affect the guilt or the innocence.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Last follow up, Mr President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, isn't it a fact that the Racial Injustice Act's impact on the
guilt or innocence of a defendant on Death Row is zero?  The only thing
that can happen under Racial justice is for a defendant to be taken off
death row and placed life in prison.  There is no impact. This is a
cold-blooded, deliberative killer, and everything that you say beyond
that is completely irrelevant. Am I not correct, ma'am?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You may answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They get a re-trial and they can have an MAR, at that point we would
start over again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm sorry, Mr. President. One more question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Have you read the Racial Justice Act and are you familiar that it is
simply appealing on whether or not racial bias was used to put you on
Death Row instead of for life in prison, it has no impact on a motion
for appropriate relief or for any other type of appeal? It's not a
constitutional appeal, it's one simply based on statistics, and it's
used solely to get someone off Death Row and to put them in prison for
life. It has nothing to do with their guilt or innocence whatsoever.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Kinnaird, you have the floor to answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are right within a certain parameter, but it can lead to further.
And that's what I think we need to consider.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. And to the members of this body.  I'm
certainly not an attorney, I don't profess to be - I guess in this sense
I'm probably one of the normal people. But I am certainly concerned
about this being brought up again in this body.  We all remember that in
2012 Senate Bill 416, Section 3G said that if the court finds that race
was a significant factor in decisions to seek or impose a sentence of
death, in the defendant's case at the time the death sentence was sought
or imposed, the court shall order a death sentence not to be sought or
that the death sentence imposed by the judgment shall be vacated and the
defendant re-sentence to life imprisonment without possibility of
parole.  And since that time, we all should be aware of the findings,
let me cite a few of those. Black jurors have been intentionally
excluded from jury service in capital trials, and this is evidenced
information, you can have a copy. Four Death Row inmates have proven
that qualified African Americans were intentionally excluded from their
juries.  All four were re-sentenced to life in prison without parole,
and just as Senator Kinnaird said that we all should expect, and we have
a right, and I hope we're saying...</p>

I just want you to ask yourselves that.  I think we would err on making
sure that fairness is afforded to every person that's in our courtroom
and particulary in capital cases.  'Cause once you kill someone, we
cannot go back and get a bill to bring them back to life.  With that,
Mr. President I'd like to send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do members have copies?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.  Send forward your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
OK, we have it up here.  The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Parmon moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Parmon has the floor to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President and members.  This amendment would simply allow
the racial justice act portion  of senate bill 306 to be removed so that
members that's in favor of the death penalty can vote on the death
penalty, and support the racial justice act.  I've heard time and time
again that people support the death penalty, but also support the racial
justice act, because they want to ensure that people we may kill in the
future was given a fair trial.  I ask you to support the amendment thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate on amendment one?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Goolsby, for what purpose do you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd like to point out in this section of the law that it does reiterate
all the rights available, and I've heard two of the members the last to
speak about unfairly convicted, about minorities being excluded from
juries, and again, as I question senator Connaird, all RJA does is
attempt to take a cold blooded, convicted killer off death row and give
them life in prison.  RJA does not address in any way the murder.  And
the people that have totally been forgotten about in all of these
discussions, as I heard senator Connaird talk about how wonderful it was
to deal with the death penalty, and to do all that we could in the grand
debates, I keep thinking about the families of the murder victims that
I've met.  I met Fayetteville police officer's Roy Turner's family.  He
was murdered in cold blood.  His murderer appealed under RJA, and right
before udge Wakes made his ruling have retired, never to face the
voters, he took of the murderer of Officer Roy Turner, Fayetteville
police department, off death row.  Now here's the ultimate irony.  Roy
Turner was black.  His murderer was black.  And that's a result of RJA.
One more even crazier, for those of you who were at the ??  committee
meeting last week.  When senator Harrington's district attorney, Lot
Bell appeared and stood up and said I'm accused of being a racist.  I'm
a white district attorney.  And the three people I put in Gaston county
are in death row, have accused me of being a murderer.  I mean, have
accused me of being a racist, the murderers have.  All three of them.
And the evidence is that I put only people of one color on death row.
Guess what the color of the three murderers accusing Lot Bell, a white
man of murder, I mean of, forgive me, of racial discrimination.  Those
three murderers are all white.  They're accusing the white district
attorney, under the racial justice act, for only seeking the death
penalty against white men.  And Lot said, I looked at all the cases, and
the only people that I thought warranted the death penalty, black or
white, were these three white men.  Racial justice act, because it uses
frequency, allows those individuals to appeal under the racial justice
act and claim that they've been discriminated against.  Folks, the
racial justice act is bad law when you have those kinds of results.  The
last person I will tell you about his Marsha Howell.  She was the mother
of murder victim Yvette Howell.  Those of you at the ??  meeting, you
heard her mother's impassioned plea to please put this to an end.  It is
time for my daughter's murder to meet his maker.  He was sentence back
in 1994 to death row, and he has appealed under RJA.  Yvette Howell</p>

was a black 17 year old woman who was murdered with a shotgun blast, by
a black criminal who has appealed under RJA.  It is wrong, it needs to
be repealed, and I ask you to vote against this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Further discussion or debate on Amendment 1.  Senator
McKissick for what purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]First, I believe it's a good amendment, we need to pull
this out.  Secondly, I heard Senator Goolsby speak about a variety of
cases.  There's one way to resolve those issues, let the judge in
Superior Court, whose going to hear these Racial Justice Act claims,
hear them one by one.  If they have validity, the person will stay in
jail for life without the possibility of parole.  If they lack validity,
they will be strucken down, and they will remain on death row.  It's
very simple.  That's what we do, we let judges hear the cases.  The
claims are claims that a Superior Judge can hear and render an
appropriate decision based upon the facts of that case.  No 2 cases are
alike.  Never have been, never will be.  Different defendants, different
victims, completely different circumstances.  One thing we know, that
race ought not to be a fact in these cases.  And if we look at Judge
Weeks, and we look at his decision, he talks about the systematic
exclusion of African Americans in these juries, and in these states, the
courts find no joy in these conclusions.  Indeed, the court cannot
overstate the gravity and somber nature of these findings, nor can the
court overstate the harm to African Americans, and to the integrity of
the justice system that results from racially discriminatory jury
selection practices that purposely exclude black persons from juries,
undermines the public confidence in the fairness of our system of
justice. That's what were talking about.  And let me tell you, every
claim that's been called on the Racial Justice Act is valid.  If they
don't have validity, they ought to be strickened down.  But the problem
is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Wilford, yield a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator McKissick, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I do not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]He does not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The fact of the matter is, the facts of each case will
determine the outcome of each case.  It's not a broad brush answer to
every case, but when it's appropriate, that person stays in jail for
life without the possibility of parole.  What we passed was commendable.
 What we passed sent a message to our prosecutors.  don't sit there and
let racial bias come into the court room.  And the last thing we need is
seminars to tell them how to get around the constitutional law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Will the Senator now yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Goolsby, for what purpose do you rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I'm sorry, to ask if the Senator will now yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator McKissick, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]He does not yield.  Further discussion or debate on
Amendment 1, to Senate Bill 306.  Senator Nesbitt, for what purpose do
you rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. President, to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. President, and members of the Senate.  I
rise today to point out what all of you know.  This is your opportunity
to vote to get the Racial Justice Act out of this bill so you can
support the death penalty.  I guarantee the vote for the death penalty,
and get this out of the way if you care as we do about racial bias in
death penalty cases.  I've listened to the debate, and here's kind of
what we're all about.  I'm an officer of the court, all of us lawyers
are, judges are, DA's are, and we are bound to make that system fair,
and impartial, and balanced, and to do everything in our power, I think,
to make</p>

to earn the public's respect for the court system. We don't like it when
the system fails but were all thought from the time we start studying
law that it is not a perfect system and that injustice can occur.  The
person that should win civil cases doesn't always win them, they can go
either way.  We've got a little saying you go to a jury when you ?? it's
kinda like jumping out of a burning building you go to a jury when you
got no other place to go because you lose control when you do that and
bad things can happen to good people and I think were sitting here were
trying to do what the court system has always done and that is good at
the ability to clean up it's own mess.  We did that with DNA, when that
came along you know some people thought it was snake oil and we didn't
know what it was and we didn't know if it was really pure you know they
used to have breathalyzers that said they were perfect and we found out
they weren't and so we didn't know what to do but we adapted and we
started accepting scientific evidence and we found out we have totally
innocent people on death row some had been there in the teens of years
waiting to be executed that were totally innocent.  We did another thing
we realized if those people are innocent there might be some more out
there.  Justice I Beverly Lake who was a republican lead us in an effort
to create the innocence commission they go and look at cases to
determine if somebody else is in prison that shouldn't be there and have
their case heard so that if in fact they are in they must prove their
innocence you can get them out of there they let two people who had been
convicted in my county of Buncombe out of prison last year because they
were innocent.  They were charged in a home invasion.  This is how we
clean up our mess, this is how we have a court system that keeps the
respect of the public because were all willing to admit its not perfect
we are willing to admit mistakes are made and fix it so going forward it
doesn't happen again and to the extent you can remediate it.  If you
wanna see something you cant fix wait till one of these people who have
been in prison for 12 or 15 years on death row appear before one of your
committees and say that they are not angry at anyone most humbling
experience you'll have in your life that someone can have their life
taken away and not be biter about it and be willing to go on with life
but they cant sleep at night etc, etc, etc.  If you can imagine being in
prison as an innocent man sitting there waiting for the death penalty
and we passed the racial justice act for a simple principle.  Is racial
bias playing a part in people being put to death if it is then we don't
want them put to death we want to have life without parole their
probably murderers their probably the most despicable people in the
world so we want to keep them there for life without parole but just on
the outside chance that they got the death penalty because of racial
bias we don't want them executed.  Now to some of you all that might
look like good versus evil and all this stuff but those of us that
practice in the courts we don't want the courts to impact someone
society in that way and racial bias can occur in any number of ways a DA
can decide whether to charge a death case or not well he probably not
going to prove that one way or the other cause only the DA knows then
you pick a jury</p>

<p id="60:00">
When we passed the Racial Justice Act, we did not know what we would
find when we looked at picking juries.  You've been read what the Judge
found.  He found handwritten notes from the D.A.'s that they were using
race to throw people off the jury.  Now, the genie's out of the bottle.
When we passed the Racial Justice Act, none of us in here knew that that
was going on.  It can be any number of other things during the trial.
Well, we told the courts, look at these cases, see if it's there.  If it
is, give them life without parole and let's go forward and sin no more.
And, we found that there is, I believe, in virtually every case that's
been heard.  I haven't kept up with how many have been heard but the
ones that I've heard about, they have found this problem.
Now the answer apparently today is I don't want to talk about it
anymore.  It's kind of like the bill we had last year to stop the sea
level rise by introducing a bill.   I just don't want to talk about that
anymore, so I'll pass a bill and say don't talk about it.  The sea is
going to keep rising and we're going to bury our heads in the sand.  I
was reading a clip today where apparently there's some theory now that
we can create a state religion because the Supreme Court doesn't matter
in North Carolina and we can do what we want to or something like that.
You can't just do what you want to.  And, I don't  know what's going to
come of all of this but you can't put this genie back in the bottle.
Now, I'm telling you.  We gave these people the right to be heard.  The
ones that have been heard, they found a problem, they remedied it.  The
world is still as safe as it was before the hearings and we need to
continue to let the court clean up this mess.  I said when we passed
this bill that I hoped that no one got relief under this bill.  That
would mean that we didn't have a problem. That's what we all wanted to
find. That's not what we found.
The best thing we can do, you all amended the bill last year the way you
wanted it and I thought we were done and the cases would move forward.
And the way to allow that to happen and for us to clean up this mess in
a timely and orderly fashion is to pass this amendment, get this out of
the bill and then you can proceed on with what you want to do with this
bill, the main thrust of this bill which has to do with the death
penalty.
And I would ask you to please consider this amendment and vote for it
and give us a chance to clean up the court system so that we can earn
the respect of the people.  The only way the court's can survive is if
they have the respect of the people who stand before them.

Thank you Mr. President.  Members of the Senate, I have listened to the
debate here and we continue to use Cumberland County as an example of
how this is a poster child for doing the right thing to look at the
facts and based on those facts make a decision.  I'd like to let the
members of the Senate know if you don't know a little bit about the case
in Cumberland County.
The District Attorney, with all the facts that he needed, went to Judge
Weaks and asked himself to recuse himself from the case based on his
prior knowledge and being involved in the case prior to it coming back
to his court.</p>

now ?? share with y'all, if everything that was stated here, about
racial bias and the facts being as they are in this case, why did Judge
Weeks not recuse himself after being asked by the local district
attorney, all the facts being presented to him, why did he feel led to
not recuse himself? If everything was there that needed to be there, and
racial bias could be proved and was proved, why did Superior Court Judge
Weeks decide that he needed to hear the case? That is what I would like
to share with the Senate, that if we're going to be fair, and equitable,
and each one of these cases are going to stand on their own, then why do
we need a judge, a minority judge, who knew the facts, prior to this
case, why did he need to hear the case? Why could he not recuse himself?
And with that said, I cannot support this amendment because of that fact
alone. If each one of these cases can stand on their own, let them stand
on their own. But I think that is a poster child of them not being able
to stand on their own. Because a judge would not recuse himself after
being asked to recuse himself. So I cannot support this amendment, this
is not something we need to support in this chamber, and I'm glad that
I'm here at this moment at this time to be able to vote against this
amendment and vote for this bill. Thank you and I appreciate y'all's

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate? Senator Bryant, to what
point do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the Senate, Mr. President, as a
constitutional officer myself, I want to say that I am disappointed that
our district attorneys are determined to push us to proceed to cover up
the actual deeds and misbehaviors and actions that have been unearthed
in the cases that have been heard so far on the parts of their staffs in
implementing and perpetuating racial discrimination in these particular
cases where that has been found. While it is true that the symptoms of
this problem were indicated to us by the frequencies and the statistics
that have been noted, and though they surely have amplified the nature
of the problem, the underlying racial prejudice involved in the actions
of the prosecutors in these cases have been clarified in detail and with
direct evidence from their own words and deeds, not based on statistics.
And they are, by pursuing and pushing us to repeal this bill, drawing
all of us into the web of racial prejudice that afflicts the criminal
justice system in some instances. They know as well as many of you know
that our current procedures and avenues do not provide a way in the
existing cases for these issues to be raised. That is the reason that
the Racial Justice Act was needed, just as we need the innocence
commission to judicate and investigate the cases of actual innocence. We
need that process because our existing post conviction and appellate
procedures are in many instances not sufficient to address these issues.
Yes, most of these folks are probably guilty, and even they have the
constitutional right to not be convicted or tried in a racially
discriminatory manner. Our fidelity to the constitutional principles
that we are sworn</p>

--to uphold and the integrity of our system, our only assurance that
innocent people will not be convicted, and that those who are convicted
are done so fairly.  This cover-up that the DA's want here and want to
draw us into, through the appeal--repeal--is the same dynamic that we've
seen with the bogus crime lab statistics and hiding DNA tests and not
coming forth with files and evidence and we can go on and on in terms of
these behaviors that we've seen.  We make a mistake in thinking that
only black and brown people can be hurt by racial prejudice.  Indeed, if
you all are discriminating against me as a person of color--as an
African American representative--you not only hurt me, you also hurt the
white people that I'm elected and sworn to represent.  Similarly, if
Senator Hise is a DA, and he has some thinking in his mind that he can't
trust me to serve on a commu-on a jury because of my background or
experience somehow.  He thinks I won't be favorable to his side, and
Senator Newton is the defendant, it just--it doesn't just hurt me, that
he is--has a prejudice against black people serving.  It also hurts
Senator Newton, who is white who will be the defendant in the case, who
is entitled to a jury of his peers and a fairly selected jury that
include [sic] all kind of opinions from the community that might raise
questions, look at the evidence, make sure there's an adequate
consideration of his consideration of his case.  So these behaviors of
racial discrimination are not just isolated and against any one person,
they weave everybody in the courtroom into a web of racial
discrimination--that--and then ultimately it pervades into the whole
community.  And, we are being brought into that web today by being asked
to repeal this bill.  Our complicity here in repealing the Racial
Justice Act, rather than our fidelity, to the principles of fairness and
justice, put at risk our whole system.  And for that reason, Mr.
President, I'd like to send forth a motion, and I have that motion in

The ayes have it and Senate Bill 306 having passed its third reading,
will be sent to the House. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Blue, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rule 15, point of personal privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the
floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, fellow
Senators, I just want to make a quick observation. Because what we say
on the floor of this chamber is immune from anybody attacking on the
basis of slander or libel. But I must rise to say and I’m sure he didn’t
mean it in this context, but when I see individuals, especially elected
officials, attack on this floor, I think it’s our responsibility to
defend them. Judge Greg Weeks, I’ve known for 30 plus years, he served
with distinction on the Superior Court from Cumberland County, one of
the most highly respected judges in the state. And not only by legal
groups across the spectrum but among judges and received many rewards
from them. There is a process or procedure within the Judicial branch,
the Judicial Standards Commission and the court itself, to determine
whether judges should recuse themselves when they hear certain kinds of
motions. And in fact with Judge Newby, the same kinds of issues were
raised and I respected the Commission as well as the court in
determining when a judge is so enmeshed in a case that he or she can’t
be impartial. And I’m sure that that procedure probably occurred with
respect to the death penalties in the Fayetteville cases. And I know
that Senator ?? did not mean to impugn the integrity of Judge Weeks but
I just wanted to point that out to you. That he retired recently but
again was one of the most highly respected judicial officials in this
state, across the bar and across the judiciary. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, I would point out that Rule 15 is in the rules for the purpose
for explaining a vote, and not for any other purpose. It is also in the
rules that under Rule 15 to explain a vote, it should be the last order
of business for the day. As a courtesy, I recognized Senator Blue. We
will not generally do that in the future. Senate Bill 445. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, for what
purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] A motion, please. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] You have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 445, House
Bill 139, next two items on our calendar. I ask that they be removed
from this calendar and placed on tomorrow’s calendar. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection, so ordered. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, will
Senator Goolsby yield for a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Goolsby,
will you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Reluctantly, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I’ll speak with you Senator. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senate Bill 316, are you ready to go on that? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that Senator McKissick’s bill from yesterday? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, I am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senate Bill 316, the clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate
Bill 316, pretrial release rebuttal resumption. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Goolsby is recognized to explain the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President, that’s Senator McKissick’s bill. I just objected to third
reading yesterday, that’s all. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick, any
further discussion or debate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No further discussion. I
think Senator Goolsby’s concerns have been addressed. We’ve already
discussed it privately. It’s already precedent for this being done in
the state of North Carolina. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or
debate on Senate Bill 316 on third</p>
