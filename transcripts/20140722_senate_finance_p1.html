<p id="00:00">
Finance Committee, please come to order. Would all the members please
get to their seats and everyone quiet down so we can get through this
meeting today. First thing first, we have our pages and we really enjoy
having them here and I’m going to read them out, would you just raise
your hand please?  Marquita Samuelson, I hope I pronounce that
correctly. Is that right? Good, nice to see you.  Nicholas Cole,
Nicholas, good to have you with us.  Paris Lewis, Paris, good to see
you, glad you’re here.  Fulton Gatin, Fulton, good to have you.  Kendell
Gillespie, Kendell, nice to have you with us.  And Jenny MacDonell.
There you are, thank you.  We’re delighted to have you here and we hope
that your time with us is going to be very valuable and maybe even a
little bit of fun. Members of the Committee would be missing, not
recognizing our Sergeant-at-Arms who help us make this successful.  Matt
Urban, Ernie Sheryl and Ed Kesler.  Good, thank you everybody. Let’s
move forward and our first bill will be House Bill 10044. Excuse me,
1044, and that’s Representative Lewis, are you here today?  Don’t see
him, we’ll put that in the back.  Can you present that?  Senator Rabin
will present that bill. It’s Averasboro Township TDA Changes.  Senator
Rabin, you have the microphone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is a simple bill.  It is not a new tax, I’ll say it again, it is
not a new tax. The people of Averasboro would like to have it enacted,
the Chamber of Commerce in the area of Dunn would like to have it
enacted.  I ask your support in passing the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the Committee, is there anything that we need to add to that?
Very good, I have Senator Cook for a motion for a favor report on House
Bill 1044.  Any questions from the Committee?  Seeing none, all in favor
please say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed, nay. Ayes have it. Thank you, Senator Rabin, will you be
handling that out on the floor?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes I will, thank you.  Thank you everybody.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. Next bill, House Bill 1054. Spindale Cape Fear Sewer Fee
Collections. Representative Hager, welcome to the Committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. chairman.  This bill’s pretty straightforward. It allows
the town of Spindale to collect, if you read the summary to collect
sewer fees as other cities have done and the background gives you a list
of other towns and cities that do this and the bill analysis gives you
the alternative ways they can collect the sewer fees.  Member of
Committee, I got a favor report from Senator Hise for House Bill 1054.
Any comments or questions from the Committee? Senator McKissick,
question?
 
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He’s up in the left corner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Over here. Over in the left corner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Far corner right there. Left.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right over here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Left.  By the left.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, the other left. That’s exactly right. Let me ask you this.  In
terms of authority to charge these delinquent sewer availability fees,
is this one of those sewer availability fees that someone has to pay
even when they’re not hooked up to water and sewer?  Because that is not
exactly the kind of charge I’d like to see passed on to folks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There are some utilities that will now move to the point where they’re
charging fees where you are not connected to water and sewer, but they
charge you the fee because you have the capacity to be hooked up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager, would you respond to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for the question and if staff has any clarification I’d really
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff, would anyone help?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, that is the type of fee we are discussing.  It is an
availability fee and it is a fee that can be charged for individuals
that are not taking advantage of the water system but do have the
ability to tie into the water system. Its most often charged on empty
lots that have not yet connected to the water sewer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up if I could?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that fee can also be tied to a residential dwelling, whether
it’s  one.</p>

...when it's personally occupied or a rental property. I guess because
the sewer line is out there, even if you do not receive water and sewer
services, they can charge you each and every month. Do we know how much
those fees are in this particular case?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Skaff??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do not have that information. I can get that for
you, but at this time, I don't know what the parameters are on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just one quick followup Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hager, I would just go back and check
with these folks, to see if that's what they really want to do. Because
when you start sending these cases to collection agencies, when I'm not
even receiving water or sewer char-,I'm not receiving water or sewer
services, but your charging me an availability fee, and it could be 40,
$50 a month. It, maybe you can let it accrue, start sending those cases
to collection agencies, can hurt some folks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is that a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah. I guess the question is, could you go back and
check with them to see if that's what they really want to do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hager.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thanks Senator McKissick. I think this is a town that,
as many of you guys have in your districts, that used to be a strong,
textile mill town, that now basically has almost zero revenue from
textile mills. And this is a way to actually keep their systems up. And
to keep the right, the environmental issues in the right manner, to keep
the service right. And this is, basically, some of the only revenue that
they have because of the situation where the town is. Many of you have,
whether you're in the East or in the West, have these towns that, that
have these, these infrastructure needs, and have these costs to them
that can barely, barely pay for them. So folks that are in the system,
basically gives them the mechanism for delinquent fees on these, on
these available fees to go after those. And a lot of times they're very
small, as Senator McKissick included. But what I would do, Senator
McKissick, is vote this bill out today, and I will get with Senator
Hise, and we'll get back with the town ?? before it gets to the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Very good. Senator Barringer. Over on your right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. This could, this may be a
question for staff as much as anything. I know that this does allow
garnishment of wages, and I know that in North Carolina we don't do,
don't allow that very often. What are the other circumstances in which
we do allow, by statute, the garnishment of wages to collect delinquent
whatever.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Skaff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This actually is allowed for all collection of
property taxes. So basically, all of the remedies that are allowed for
property taxes are also allowed in this situation. And on your summary
is a list of other local legislation where we have given this authority,
in regards to delinquent water and sewer fees, to other cities. So for
example, the city of Durham, Davie, Duplin, Lenoir County, Montgomery
County, and the cities of Locust, and the towns of New London and
Stanfield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Barringer, you all set? Members of the
Committee, any additional questions? Seeing none, I need a motion for,
motion from Senator Tommy Tucker for a favorable report on House Bill
1059. No, check that. On 1054. Any comments, questions? Seeing none, all
in favor, please say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed nay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ayes have it. Who would you want to...Representative
Hise will carry that on the Senate floor. All right. Members of the
Committee, House Bill 1059, New Hanover Occupancy tax use and there is a
PCS. Senator Curtis makes a motion that we accept the PCS for discussion
before this committee. Senator Goolsby, welcome.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I was asked by Representative Davis to run
this bill for him. He is in court in Brunswick County this morning. I am
happy to try to help. What this basically does is, the way these
proceeds were originally set, Mr. Chairman, it was, all the money was
supposed to go to beach re-nourishment. But the area where this tax is
collected currently, that incorporated area, doesn't have any beach that
needs to be re-nourished so this resets it, and sets up a different
scheme for the money to be spent. It is a local bill. We'd appreciate
your support of Representative Davis' bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right. I don't see any questions. I got a motion
from Senator Wade for...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I'm sorry. Where are you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? Right here. Soucek.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry. Senator Soucek, I'm sorry. I didn't see you
there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. I've got a question. Is, does this bill have
anything to do with the Venus Flytraps as well?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It originally did, but that's been PCSed out. And I
understand that the Venus Flytrap legislation is currently in our Senate
Reg Reform Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. All right. I have a motion from Senator Wade for
a favorable report on House Bill 1059 PCS and unfavorable to the
original bill. Any comments or questions?</p>

Seeing none, all in favor please say aye. Opposed, nay. Aye's have it.
Thank you.
Alright, House Bill 27 &quot;Workman's Comp. Fund Safety Workers
Allocation&quot;. Let's go ahead and we'll be having a meeting later
this afternoon, members of the Committee, at about five o'clock. We're
going to move that one to the five o'clock meeting.
Let's do Senate Bill 763 &quot;Revenue Laws Technical Changes&quot;,
Senator Rabon. And we have a PCS. Senator Hartsell makes a motion that
we adopt the PCS for discussion on Senate Bill 763. All in favor please
say aye. Opposed, nay. Aye's have it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chairman. Members, these are four
changes you see to Senate Bill 763. These changes are all for technical
and clarifying. I will have staff go through each one if you have a
question on them all or individually. One section was pulled out that
was controversial. It had to do with sales tax collection on admission
charges. That has been pulled out to be studied in Revenue Laws because
there was quite a bit of a discussion and it created quite an uproar and
needed some studying. So other than that, if staff would like to run
through it, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rabon. Would you like to submit your amendment
and then we'll have the staff go through the entire bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chairman. I was ahead of myself. I
do have an amendment which addresses those four changes that I've spoken
of and so Mister Chairman, I think everyone has that amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Staff. Yes, Ms.Avery, would you please explain
this amendment to the Committee?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chair. At the last meeting, we
distributed the Revenue Laws Technical Changes Bill and the Chairs left
it out there so people could see it and have an opportunity to comment
on it.
The Chairs have instructed us that this bill is to be purely technical
in nature. After the last Finance Committee meeting, we had some
concerns raised by some interested parties that instead of clarifying,
which was the intent, they were concerned that we were making
substantive changes. So this amendment addresses those concerns plus it
adds a couple of revisions that the Department of Revenue has come to
the Body about since the last meeting.
So just in looking at the amendment, and those are the only questions
we've had raised, so in the length of time this bill has been out there
since your meeting last week we've had no questions raised on any of the
other sections in the bill.
But on the amendment that you have, that Senator Rabon's offering,
beginning on page five, these, beginning on page one of the amendment,
line nine, page five of the bill. This had to do with service contracts
and clarifying the effective dates, and after some discussions with the
Department of Revenue and the Service Contact Industry, we have
rewritten this to clarify when the different things become effective
going back to the original effective dates of the bill. As far as I know
we're good there.
The change on the amendment, on the second page, line ten is just a
grammatical change, adding a comma. And then the change on lines 13 and
14 is the one Senator Rabon was just talking about. There's a statute
that deals with the basis of reporting. And the intent was to clarify
when some of the sales tax on admission charges, prepaid meal plans, and
pipe natural gas, the basis for those to be reported. We thought it was
clarified. The industry with the admission charges did not, so admission
charges have been removed. The other two changes for pipe natural gas
and prepaid meal plans remain in the bill.
The two sections that have been requested by the Department of Revenue
is on the first page of the amendment, the first six lines and Johnathan
can explain those. The second is on the very last page of the amendment,
beginning on line 16 and Heather can explain those.
Mr Chairman will be happy to explain any other sections of the bill, but
it's been out there for several days and these are the only ones we had
any comments about.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the Committee, any questions on this
amendment? Senator Tucker, question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. Thank you, Mister Chair. Ms.Avery if you
would just revisit for me page five, number 62 on the service contracts
and just give me that clarity once again on real and tangible property?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A service contract is taxable if it is to maintain or
repair tangible personal property. If it is a fixed real estate, it is
considered real property.</p>

If an item is affixed to real estate it is real property and is not
subject to the tax on service contracts.
[speaker changes]Thank you Mrs. Chair.
[speaker changes]  Senator Apodaca, question. OK.  Senator Brown,
question.
[speaker changes] Yes if I could, on the piece on the escort.  Explain
it. It looks like it clarifies the intent.  Can you go over that one
more time with me if you would, please.
[speaker changes] Johnathan, would you help us with that question?
[speaker changes] Sure, Senator Brown this just restores a provision
that was inadvertently eliminated in the tax reform deal. Businesses
that never been allowed to take a deduction for state taxes paid in
calculating their state income.  It was inadvertently eliminated in the
tax reform deal. It just restores that provision.
[speaker changes] Senator Brown, OK. OK, we have an amendment before us.
 Members of the committee no additional questions.  All in favor please
say aye.
[speaker changes] Aye.
[speaker changes] Opposed Nay.  Ayes have it.  As amended, Mrs Avery[sp]
 will you continue through the explanation or,
[speaker changes] Mr. Chairman we'll be happy to answer any questions
for you.  We'll be happy to go through it a section by section, but it
has been out for several days with the amendment.  We've had no
questions raised.  And to the best of our knowledge they are all purely
technical.
[speaker changes] Members of the committee.  Senator Hartsell.
[speaker changes] Mr. Chairman I  would like to send forward an
amendment. It has been my ?? to duplicate sufficiently though.
[speaker changes]  This is not a technical...
[speaker changes] No, Sir.
[speaker changes] No, this is not technical.
[speaker changes]  Senator Hartsell, one of the reasons why we pulled
back on the other portion of that is that this is not a technical
amendment and would not be in the right place. And secondly, the revenue
laws is going to be studying this issue over the interim for any type of
action come 2015. OK. Yes sir?
[speaker changes]  But I still want to run the amendment.
[speaker changes]  Well you can't do that.
[speaker changes] Since when, Mr. Chairman?
[speaker changes] Well, since the fact that this is a technical
amendment's bill and where I rule it's not technical, so therefore it
can't be in there.
[speaker changes] I would object to that ruling because I believe it is
technical.
[speaker changes] Well, then, they, we've already decided that.  I am
making that decision and that will be it. Go on to the next part please.
 Any additional questions?
[speaker changes] Mr. Chairman?
[speaker changes] Yes, sir.
[speaker changes] Reluctantly, I would like to send forth an amendment.
[speaker changes]  We have a permanent license plate bill?  Senator
Apodaca, I think this deals with permanent license plates and I believe
we have a bill that relates to that.  I think that would be appropriate
in that bill rather than in this technical corrections.  With all due
respect to the members we are trying to make sure technical corrections
remain technical corrections so there are no surprises.  Thank you,
Senator Apodaca.
[speaker changes] Thank you and I am surprised.  I appreciate it.
[speaker changes] OK.
[speaker changes] Mr. Chairman?
[speaker changes] Excuse me,Senator Hartsell
[Speaker changes] May I point out the title of the bill is omnous[sp]
tax law changes.
[speaker changes]  Well that is our technical corrections bill and we
are trying to stand by what the purpose of it is. OK. Members of the
committee, you have had a few days to study this.  Senator McKissick.
[speaker changes] Yeah, there are a couple of provisions that I wanted
to ask staff about if they could give us a little more information.
[speaker changes] OK.
[speaker changes] And I will identify those by section number. ...  If
you could let me know what is going on in section 4 this provision here
dealing with the new tax on vapor products. As well as number 10
dealing,
[speaker changes] OK. One at a time so we can get it.  Number 4 was the
first one?
[speaker changes] Number 4 was the first.
[speaker changes]OK. Number 4.  Staff, can someone help us with that?
[speaker changes]  Yes, sir. Thank you.  As you may recall House Bill
1050 imposed a new tax on vapor products. And it will be taxed and
administered similar to the OTP, which is the other tobacco products.
When the tax on other tobacco products, it accrues by the first
individual that touches that product in the state.  So if you are the
manufacturer the manufacturer will normally pay the tax.  However, under
the OTP statutes they are allowed to pass along the tax and have someone
further down the distribution pay that tax as long as they have gotten
an agreement from the secretary to do so.  This allows</p>

Representative: vapor product manufactures in the state, being able to
use that same process, wehre they can apply to the secretary, and as
long as there is someone else collecting the tax, vapor product
producers can have someone else collect the tax rather than at the time
of manufacture.
Representative: I appreciate that oversight.
Speaker: Okay, that was question number 4.
Representative: Some explanation to number 10 and 16.
Speaker: Alright, number 10 and 16, staff, who can help us with those?
Representative: Mr. Chairman, over here. Number 10 is just adding to the
definition of retailer, anyone who is qualified to collect the sales
tax. We realized, as we expanded the sales tax base last session, the
definition of retailer does not necessarily collect all of those
entities required to collect the tax, such as, the universities with
your prepaid meal plans. So that is section 10.
Speaker: Senator McKissick, are you alright with that one?
Representative: Okay.
Speakr: Number 16 staff?
Representative: This is the one that was also in the amendment as to
when a person has to report the sale for purposes of sales tax
collections, whether they do it on a cash or accrual basis. Currently,
electricity telecommunications is required to be on as it is billed.
This would also pick up pipe natural gases, a similar entity that is
billed monthly, and it also picks up your prepaid meal plans. That is
the way it is currently being administered. We have also put admissions
charges thinking that was a technical clarifying change, but the folks
in that industry did not believe that, so we removed admissions charges
by the amendment. I believe this cash or accrual method basis of
reporting is an issue that revenue laws may spend some more time on in
the interim.
Representative: Follow up Mr. Chair?
Speaker: Follow up.
Representative: So, [xx] charges are pulled by virtue of the earlier
amendment. So that will be dealt with, I guess, later on when we deal
with revenue laws?
Speaker: That is where it will happen.
Representative: And as it stands now, what will occur as it relates to
those admissions charges in terms of how we will be proceeding, because
I know that has been a controversial issue?
Representative: In house bill 1015, the policy decision  was made that
they would come under sales tax laws, as any other retailer, which,
would mean that the tax would be due when the sale occurs.
Speaker: Okay, very good. Ms. [xx]?
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chair. I need some clarification on this
section 16 since we are trying to keep this to be truly a technical
amendment bill. What this thing does is – where it says, basis of this
article and the sales tax of gross receipts as derived from the sale are
considered to accrue when the retailer bills its customer for the gross
receipts – that changes the definition of accrual under the generally
accepted accounting principles. To me, that is not a technical change.
That is a substantive change to accounting principles. Could you address
that please?
Representative: Yes ma’am. I believe that – I have not seen him, but I
believe Eric Wayne, from the division of the department revenue division
of sales tax, is here. There is a difference between your gap method of
accounting and what we do, and the tax statutes, specially the sales tax
statutes. This is a statue that has been impressed for decades as far as
the accrual or the basis on which your retailer reports. So, the intent
– it does not necessarily match gap, but that is not the intent of this
section of the sales tax laws and perhaps Mr. Wayne can…
Speaker: Mr. Wayne, are you present? Anybody from the department of
revenue? Okay, there he is. Please come forward, identify yourself, and
assist us with the question please.
Wayne: I  am Eric Wayne, department of revenue. Just to go along with
what Cindy was saying, we have never, to our knowledge, administered the
sales tax, when tax was due on the gap method for income tax purposes.
So, basically, the transaction occurs and you may or may not report the
income at that time for tax purposes. There has never been a
correlation. Today, there are many retailers that bill for sales tax
that are on the accrual basis. The accrual basis meaning that the sales
tax was billed, the receipt was created, the tax is due not assuming
[xx] will be received.
Speaker: Question, Senator Hartsville? I apologize, let me go ahead,
Senator Barnesville, first. Senator Hartsville?
Representative: Eric, if I go to home depot and buy a gift card, do I
pay a sales tax on it at that point?</p>

Of municipalities, as well as the city of Charlotte, participate in the
finishing up of this particular bill, and the things that we added after
that subcommittee were the following. Local governments can require an
annual permit. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s the guy behind
you. [LAUGHTER] [SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s okay. My apologies. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] No problem, I know you all get confused from the House.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If the city in
charge [SPEAKER CHANGES] by God I am. So I move for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We, before we proceed forward, I do have an amendment
for House Bill 625. I think you have it before you. Miss Frenell, you
going to explain that amendment for us please? It’s strictly technical.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, sir. The amendment actually makes three changes. The first
change is on page 2 and actually corrects the citation. The second
change actually changes the effective date because this was submitted
last year. The effective date was July 1, 2013, this changes the
effective date to October 1, 2014. And the last change is to clarify
that the fee that the cities and counties are allowed to apply for these
structures does not apply to any structure that’s currently built. So it
only applies to new structures on or after October 1, 2014. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Members of the committee, you heard the explanation of the
amendment that’s before you. Questions, comments? Seeing none, all in
favor please say aye. Opposed, nay. Ayes have it. Representative
Moffitt, Senator Moffitt, question? Okay, question, Senator Hise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just to clarify this, and I’ll try to get, zoning is
not one of my specialties where I represent west North Carolina, but
this allows individuals to use a mobile home or other device placed on
their property, that’s got an appropriate setback, for the care of an
individual most likely in their family or others, if a mobile home would
not otherwise allow by some arcane rule. [SPEAKER CHANGES] An answer for
that please, sir? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. That is
correct, but these are specifically designed differently. And they can
be put on a foundation but once its use has been concluded, then it has
to be removed within 60 days. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All set, Senator Hise?
All right. Senator McKissick, yes sir. Good to see you here. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Good to see you again. [LAUGHTER] Representative Moffitt, let
me ask you this. Because it talks about people who are ill or disabled.
I mean are these basically intended for use by senior citizens or, I
mean how do you determine the status of the occupant, who’s actually
staying in it? So you really can avoid situations where that, what
you’re trying to create is being exploited by someone who isn’t really
qualified, let’s say a teenager who wants to live in one of these units
and is tired of living in the family home. Or whoever else who may be
involved. If you could explain that a little bit more. How do you get to
the actual status of the individual who’s the occupant, since you’re
looking at really a 360 foot unit. And where does the League of Cities
stand on this? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator McKissick, Mr.
Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, let
me just read through the provisions that we added at the, in working
through the subcommittee with the League of Municipalities and the city
of Charlotte. A licensed North Carolina physician needs to provide a
certification regarding the condition of the person that would actually
be in this particular structure. That can be asked for on an annual
basis for recertification, at the request of the city. Local government
can also revoke the permit if they feel that it’s being used for an
unintended, for against the intended purpose. So the cities do have an
opportunity if they do sense that it’s being used inappropriately, they
can revoke the permit, which at that point would require the structure
be removed in 60 days. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes. So does the League of Cities support this in its current
form, and to what extent does local government have setback requirements
or other abilities to control what the placement would be so you don’t
end up with one of these in a front yard in a subdivision? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Answer that please, sir? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. To answer the first part of your question, the League of
Municipalities I spoke with prior to the meeting today. They are in
support of the bill. I also spoke with Mr. Fenton with the City of
Charlotte and their position is in support of the bill. In regards to
the second part of your question, I would have to defer to staff on
that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff, Miss Frenell. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
If you look on page 2, lines 12 through 15 of the bill, it requires that
