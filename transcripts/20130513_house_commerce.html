Good afternoon everybody. Welcome to the Monday afternoon meeting of the
house commerce and job development committee. We have some sergeant at
arms with us today. Please welcome Carlton Adams, Bob Brossy, Young Bay
and Anton Marshall are our sergeant at arms today. We've got a couple of
amendments being drawn up for House Bill 201, so we will not start
there, we will start with House Bill 842. There is a proposed committee
substitute before us. Representative Brown moves that the proposed
committee substitute be properly before us. All those in favor say aye,
all opposed say no. The aye's have it. Representative John Bell, you are
recognized to explain the proposed committee substitute to House Bill
842. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the
committee. House Bill 842, the committee substitute would enact the
study, to study the sale of Spiritus liquor by the holder of distillery
permit to patriots who have participated in the tour of the distillery.
This bill was originally filed after talking with all of the parties
involved, realized it needed a more study and input needed to go in to
this, so we can make an informed and well versed decision and I want to
ask for your support in this study today. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, you're recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] At the
appropriate time, move for favor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion,
further debate? ?? Representative Avila. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Chairman. I just have a question. Just looking at this, it looks a
lot like what we're allowing at wineries now and we've done for
breweries recently. What do they feel like are that need study? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] You're recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The issue with some of the
parts of ?? to like it would open a door to privatization of our ABC
system and so that's the reason why we want to go and look at what's
done in other states and what have we done? What we can work with, as
far as with the distilleries. The distillery industry is actually new to
the state of North Carolina and it's growing and we want everybody to
coexist and be able to get along and promote the distilleries and their
job potentials. This will be a way that we can look and find a good
solution to some of the concerns that were issues. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Phill Shepard, you are recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes
sir, Mr. Chair. I guess I'm sort of picky about ?? offer it,
representative Allen on his comments, because I thought last session we
voted on a bill similar to this for representative McGrady and his
district to allow this. I guess my thoughts are, is this not something
that we could just do statewide and do it one time to have a limit of
these in the future? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Allen. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Shepard, this is what this study would entail
on. This will be a statewide bill, I'm not familiar with what went on
last session. I do ?? on to this bill, on this very similar version was
actually filed to go into law. It did not pass the muster on some of the
committee and so that's why when it was Randy Sheer with the concerns
that were reached. We wanted to have a conference, a study to look at
what can and can't be done to make all parties happy, but also to file a
strong piece of legislation where all parties are informed and happy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Shepard, additionally the legislation
that McGrady worked on last session only dealt with wine and beer, and
this deals with distilled liquor as well, so this is a little bit
different area, so that's why the study. Further discussion, further
debate? Representative Bumgardner. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. Question for the sponser. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You're recognized
for a ?? question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you know of any other industry
that takes people and takes them on a tour, shows them what they do and
how they do it and then doesn't allow them to buy any of their products?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're recognized too. [SPEAKER CHANGES] At this time,
no I do not. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate?
Rodney Moore, you're recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. I move that we propose committee substitute for House
Bill 842 in favor to the original. Is there a referral? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] No, there not a subsequent referral of the motion being
properly before us, so many is in favor of the legislation wil say Aye.
All opposed say no. Pending chair, the aye's do have it. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Bell, congratulations on passing [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will temporarily relinquish the
chair so we can address Hosue Bill 168 as the amendment for House Bill
201 is continuing to be developed. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chair. Next bill before us is How Bill 168, we</p>

A PCS. Representative Catlin makes a motion that the PCS be before the
committee. All in favor say aye.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]All opposed. PCS is properly forced. MR chair you have the
floor[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chairman. The original bill as filed
has now been signed into law by the governor and so we developed a
proposed committee substitute to address fee disputes between attorneys
that practiced before the industrial commission for workers comp cases.
Currently those fee disputes clog in precious court time and so were
moving those fee disputes between plaintiffs attorneys only and go
before the industrial commission and with that I would make a motion for
a favorable report to house bill 168 unfavorable to the original and be
available to answer any questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Any questions for
members of the committee? Motion be improperly enforced for a favorable
report on a proposed committee substitute to House bill 168 unfavorable
to the original. All in favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Aye [SPEAKER
CHANGES]All opposed, bill passes. Thank you Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]We will go ahead and get started with House bill 241.
Representative Torbett you are recognized to explain the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chairman Members of the committee I trust everyone
had a short sweet weekend and brought their blankets and pillows with
them for the duration of the week. Ladies and gentleman in front t of
you in not a simple bill. It is pretty much bill saying to reinstate the
energy conservation codes back to what they were in 2009. Last session
the house ran a bill in answering to a request from the department of
insurance in receipt of a federal load or grant and we accepted that and
later to find after examination during the interim was that some of the
offshoot that it had top the receipt of funding which took both the
residential and commercial building codes to a new perspective. Here is
a copy of them I have them in here pretty small print y’all can feel
free to take a look at it. What it does is tell people building homes
and building commercial facilities that what you do you have to make
them 30% more energy efficient so now imagine your building your house
and or business and you have to buy state mandate make them 30% more
efficient. Personally I have nothing against any energy efficient home
or business. For example the house I have you may have an energy bill of
four hundred dollars. Someone can come to me and say I can do this and
that and the other to your house and reduce your power bill down to two
hundred dollars chances are I would jump on it because that by and large
would make me save money down the long haul. Is there anybody here that
would not agree that is you could take a four hundred dollar house power
bill and reduce it to two hundred dollars that you wouldn’t try to do
that. Everybody here agree to that right? Pretty much. The difference
being is here is that the decision would not be mine. The decision is
made at the state which in other words a new builder would have to build
it with that in mind., so when I found out about the intricacies of this
bill I went and looked at what was in place currently in 2009 and felt
pretty much very strong that in one the worst home building recessions
in the state in forever pretty much recent memory should we add
additional cost and impact onto the home builders and onto the
commercial builders and developers and my answer obviously came out as
no we shouldn’t do that. After finding that out I had a great deep long
lengthy discussion with the home building group and they said that they
too felt the way I did and that’s why they went in during this process
and negotiated the energy efficiency level down to fifteen percent which
to them they felt was more ??. that their people would be more inclined
to support something like that in a a reduced level from 30% to 15%.
I’ve got numerous emails. Honestly they’re</p>

50/50 some supporting the energy code, some not supporting the energy
code, and we'll discuss that at a later time. the big one that really
came to me was the call I recieved from a local developer, no excuse me,
a local company. He said &quot;John, I got a problem&quot;, I said
&quot;what's your problem,&quot; he said &quot;I'm trying to rent what
use to be a mill, I'm just trying to rent some space to store stuff in,
I've pretty much stocked up with all I have at my current facility and I
just need additional space to stock more inventory, until I can ship it
to the customer.&quot; I said &quot;well whats the problem?&quot;, He
said &quot;I went to lease one of these buildings and I couldn't lease a
building until I had applied 150000$ worth of lighting improvements in
this warehouse.&quot; I said &quot;You've absolutely got to be
kidding.&quot; he said &quot;no its the truth.&quot; Because your
changing in the current code, your changing the use of that facility to
a different use, thereby you shall provide the upfits as mandated in
this piece of legislation which ended up being the energy conservation
code. So I told him up here I would do what I could to address that
issue, I think its unfair to both the builders in the community, I think
its very unfair to commercial developers. In a time when we need to have
businesses operating, this is with less restrictions as humanly possible
from their government. I talked to my economic developer back home he
said, &quot;this is killing folks in Gadston County.&quot; Cause as you
may or may not know Gadston county was initially a textile, pretty much
the textile king for years and years and years, and we have plenty of
available empty buildings now that could serve, in this case for
example, as a warehouse, but are currently unavailable, because no one
has the out of pocket capitol to invest in a facility just to use as
storage, and with that Mr. Chairman I would also like to enter a
technical correction. Hearing the drafting it was brought to my
attention that some things need to be changed, I think a copy is before
you and with your permission I would like to have it distributed to the
committee members.
[Speaker Changes]
Recognized to explain the amendment.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you, if I would, I would like to yield to staff for the
explanation please.
[Speaker Changes]
Copies of the amendment are being distributed by Serrgeant at arms.
Jennifer your recognized to explain the amendment.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, The amendment thats coming around to you right
now is purely technical as representative torvin had indicated. It just
cleans up the effective date clause typically and coded bill drafting,
we don't have multiple sections addressing effective dates where you see
in the first addition, section 4a and section 4b, this is just cleaning
up to get it all into one section, I'm happy to take any questions you
may have.
[Speaker Changes]
Amendment is being distributed, further discussion further debate on the
amendment. Representative Torbid moves for  approval of the amendment,
all those in favor will say aye, all those oppse say no, Pending the
chair the ayes have it. Representative torvid, you're recognized to
continue discussion of the bill, I do have representative stone, would
you like to make some comments on the bill?
[Speaker Changes]
just briefly on the bill, thank you Mr. chair. I just wanted to start by
saying I thank Representative Torbid for bringing this bill before us. I
think that as representatives all back in our districts we can look and
see some of the buildings. This will also help out in some of our
poverty stricken communities, where some of the buoldings that maybe
minor repairs need to be made, but people wouldn't want to put a vast
investment in. in order to do storage or some other type of relocation
of small busineesses, but anyway int his political climate or what we're
facing now in the current economic times, I can't think of a better
thing to help us out back home, so its a great bill and I thank you for
running it.
[Speaker Changes]
Further discussion further debate? representative katlyn your recognized
[Speaker Changes]
thank you, a question please.
[Speaker Changes]
representative katlyn your recognized to [xx] your question to
representative torbit
[Speaker Changes]
yes, whats the difference between the 2012 standards and 2009 standards?
[Speaker Changes]
mr. chairman I have the answer to that
[Speaker Changes]
a lot of it pertains to making a house, for lakck of a better term
without getting into the wages, makiing a house air tight. That seems to
be the way its leaning towards. I'm hearing down the pipe that they'll
come back and ask for sprinkler systems throughout residential
properties and thats the course of action, they may end up doing away
with crawl spaces, in an effort to make it as tight</p>

possible, is humanly possible. Which, in itself, is not a bad thing to
do, but it also drives up the cost, because when you have that, you have
a [HBAC?] system that has to comply with that, for example. So, that
altogether is going to drive up costs, and it's my feeling is that, do
we make that determination or do we let that determination be market
driven by people that want those efficiencies of, of um, of increasing
their or, lessening their cost in power to their home by increasing the
efficiency of their home?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Uh,...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're recognized for [crosstalk]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [inaudible] It's, it's, it's your discretion now.
Where in 2012 it was mandatory. Is that the main difference?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Run that question by me one more time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Energy efficiency standard of, is, is discretionary of
2009 but mandatory in 2012?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No sir, it was still mandated in 2009 but not to the
degree and level as they were increased to in 2012. They, at the initial
outset of the, of the um, what they brought forward was a 30% efficiency
increase to home building. Which, what it was was a-, you can ask them
it would've been a cost multiplier. By a large sum. They were able to,
housing, the home builders were able to negotiate that down to a 15%
increase. And I find that a little disturbing in itself because here you
are, they're negotiating with a third-party, who in turn turns around to
a government entity and mandates that 15% to increase instead of letting
it be market driven.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One more follow up, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Recognized for a third question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I hope I'm answering your questions [Tony?].
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, you are. And does this include public buildings?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's a good question, I have no answer, I would only
assume that would be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Perhaps staff can answer that for me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms. Mutton [Spelling?], you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I believe that the building
code applies to buildings whether public or private. And if anybody's
here from the building code counsel that would be helpful as well.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Larry Bell, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to know if there
was anybody opposing the bill, or, [hasn't?] everybody [present?].
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We have a list of speakers from the public that are
signed up to speak in opposition.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And I will get to them after Representative Moffitt, I
believe, has a, an amendment he would like to run. Representative
Moffitt, you're recognized to explain you're amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. Members of the committee, the
amendment, I'll let staff go over it in greater detail, but essentially
what it does is it strips out all the references to the residential
aspect of this bill, and makes this bill applicable only to commercial
structures. One of the things as Chair of Regulatory Reform that I've
had to really come to grips with is the fact that we have a lot of
regulations on the books that've been negotiated in good faith by
industry and our state agencies or third parties that have that
responsibility. So I'm being sensitive to the fact that the home
builders had negotiated a 15% level and I would like to honor that and
strip out the residential aspect of this particular bill. But, if we
could Mr. Chair, recognize staff to explain the bill, um, explain the
amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ms. Mutton, you're recognized to explain the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Representative Moffitt
actually did a very good job of explaining this amendment, and
unfortunately you don't have it in front of you, I scribbled it out just
as quickly as I could at the start of committee, here. But essentially
what this does is strip out all references to the 2012 residential
energy code and rem-, and keeps or retains only the commercial code. So
all of those analagous changes that would have to be made to the bill to
conform to that are made to this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Torbett, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, speak on the amendment, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're recognized to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I support the amendment and I trust each and every one
of you will as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Represent-. Further discussion, further debate on the
amendment? Representative Bumgardner, you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Why? Thank you Mr. Chairman, I have a question for the
bill sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're recognized to propound you're question on the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Why are you supporting the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moffitt pretty much explained it the
same way I did. In talking with the home builders, they were perplexed,
when they were hit with the possibility of a 30% increase, they went
whole hog and, I hate to say fought, but they countered, and they were
able to agree with the, on the, with the other people that were
proposing a 30% increase</p>

??if I could, they would be the most honest response to your question.
I think that is what you are looking for. Please state your name and who
you’re with.  You are recognized for time not to exceed two minutes to
answer the question.
[Speaker Change]
My name is Mike Carpenter.  I am the Executive Vice-President of the
North Carolina Home Builders Association.  What Representative Moffitt
and Representative  Torbett indicated is correct.  There was an original
thirty percent increase in energy efficiency.  We negotiated a
compromise with Representative Brody to bring that down to fifteen
percent, and to also eliminate existing provisions in the North Carolina
building code to offset the costs associated with going to the
additional fifteen percent.  So, essentially the deal that we made with
the prior administration had a minimal impact on the affordability of
housing.  So that is why we support Representative Moffitt’s amendment.
We made a deal and we are standing by our word.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Blackwell is recognized for a second question.
[Speaker Change]
Follow up with Mr. Carpenter, if I may. The deal with the prior
administration that you say you offset the cost of the fifteen percent,
by there changing something else.  If the bill is not amended and were
to pass as it is, would you then be forced to give up the benefits of
whatever it was that the previous administration agreed to?
[Speaker Change]
Well, the requirement was that the Building Code Council removed
provisions of the then existing code.  It would be up to the Building
Code Council to restore those requirements that were eliminated if that
were the case.  I guess it’s speculative to know how that would turn
out.  We would hope that would not happen.  But on the other hand,
again, I am here to defend the deal that we made and the word that we
gave.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Jeter, you are recognized to debate the amendment.
[Speaker Change]
As many of y’all know, I am from South Carolina, so I am a little slower
than the rest of y’all.  After hearing Representative Speciale’s
comments and then this reaction, I am a utterly confused about what this
amendment actually does or does not do at this point, because I heard it
differently than the rest of this crowd.  Is it possible that before we
vote on this amendment we can actually see it?
[Speaker Change]
Mr. Chairman.
[Speaker Change]
You are recognized, Resentative Torbett.
[Speaker Change]
As far as see it, no you can’t Representative Jeter.  No, I am kidding.
Yes you can.  For clarity, this bill has two components of which we are
trying to enact the same piece of legislation on both components.  One
component is the residential side which had been asked for a thirty
percent energy efficiency.  They themselves reduced it to fifteen.  So
on the residential side that is sitting at fifteen percent.  Then there
is the commercial side.  So what Representative Moffitt’s amendment
would do would just have no bearing relative to residential but take the
commercial back to 2009 levels.
[Speaker Change]
Follow up real quick Mr. Chair.
[Speaker Change]
You are recognized for a second question.
[Speaker Change]
So, if I understand this correctly then, under the Moffitt amendment
there would be no change for residential housing than currently exists
today based on the passage of this bill?
[Speaker Change]
Mr. Chairman
[Speaker Change]
You are recognized
[Speaker Change]
Absolutely
[Speaker Change]
Mr. Chairman
[Speaker Change]
Representative Bumgardner you are recognized to debate the amendment a
second time.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.  I wanted to ask Mr. Carpenter a question if he
is willing.  If not, maybe Mr. Torbett, Representative Torbett can
answer.
[Speaker Change]
You are recognized to ask your question.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. Carpenter you alluded to the fact that something about the offset of
costs associated with this.  Could you explain that and expand on that a
little bit, please.
[Speaker Change]
Sure.  The original requirements that were proposed would have increased
energy efficiency by thirty percent.  When we cut back to fifteen
percent, we eliminated a number of provisions that would have otherwise
taken it to thirty percent.  We gave then the Building Code Council a
list of choices of existing code…</p>

Recognized for a third question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] How would we
ascertain as to whether we've met that thirty percent measure if we're
just doing cosmetic stuff like changing lighting and this kind of thing?
How do we know when we've arrived there or when we've gone too far?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman? [SPEAKER CHANGES] You're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All that is listed in the code then I have the book
here. And it goes pretty with specificity on how you check, how do you
determine, you hire separate entities come in and check - They're
certified - come in and check the air volume, see how much leakage you
may be losing in an HVAC system, for example. There's people that do
that. And so that's pretty much how they would qualify or quantify that
they were getting that thirty percent addition in the new code. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Bumgardner, you're recognized to debate the
amendment a third time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is that my limit? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] You've exceeded your limit, but you can go ahead. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Sorry. I'd like to hear from a commercial builder if we have
any here. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is any commercial builder would like to
debate the amendment? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm Dave Simpson with Carolinas
AGC associate general contractors. I'm not a commercial builder. To be
honest with you, I'm kind of sitting back and enjoying this particular
one. Our folks are all kind of all over the board on this.
Representative Corbett has an excellent argument when he says that you
could drive down the cost for commercial construction significantly. You
definitely could. We did not cut any deals. We still have the thirty
percent. I know a lot of builders who say that they can build a lot more
without the thirty percent energy efficiency regulations. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on the amendment?
Representative Collins, you're recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd like to
echo what Representative Hager said. The building code should be what it
used to be, something that's designed to make sure we have safe
buildings so that what happened to the people in Pakistan recently
doesn't happen to our people here in the United States, should not be to
push a social agenda or tell people what kind of light bulbs they have
to have, or anything like that. So, I cannot support this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on the amendment.
Representative Moffitt moves the adoption of the amendment. All those in
favor will say &quot;aye&quot;, all opposed, say &quot;no&quot;. Pending
the Chair is unable to determine, all those in favor will raise your
hand, and all those in favor of the amendment will please raise your
hand. All those opposed, raise your hand. Amendment passes twenty-four
to nineteen. We're back on the bill as amended. Further discussion,
further debate on the bill as amended. We do have individuals that are
signed to speak up. But, since the bill has been amended, I'm going to
call individuals up and just see if they still want to speak on the bill
as amended. Erin Parker GreenFiber. Mr. Parker, you're recognized for a
time not to exceed two minutes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good afternoon, Mr.
Chairman and fellow members. Thank you for the opportunity to speak
today. My name is Erin Parker, and I work for GreenFiber Cellulose
Insulation. We're a manufacturer in Charlotte, North Carolina,
nationally based. Keeping the energy code current is critical to our
success because we rely on continually turning new ideas into new
products. For GreenFiber, many of our new products and applications rely
on new codes and new technical concepts, such as the current vapor
retarder and barrier code language that promote new technology and
remove potential product liability from outdated ideas. Reverting back
to outdated codes means significantly slower innovation adoption and
longer lead times to get new technology to market. The effect of
adoption of house bill 201 will be to hinder the ability of small firms
like GreenFiber to commercialize new products, create jobs, and build
revenues that contribute to the tax base in North Carolina. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have Dan MacFarland from Southern Energy Management.
Mr. MacFarland, you're recognized for a time not to exceed two minutes.

<p id="40:00">
Ladies and gentlemen. I’m simply here to ask you today to vote no on
HP201 and to please support the amendment that was originally given by
the representative to make sure that the 2012 North Carolina residential
energy code remains as is. The North Carolina building council goes
through an extensive multi-year process.  When they look at any new code
changes, new codes or code changes. This is a multi-year public process
to develop these codes. The stake holders at the table include home
builders, architects, engineers, and those associated in the building
trades as well as state and local officials. This a reflection of the
extensive public comment in the process. It reflects that input that
folks had as we look to go forward. Our company works with over 200
builders here in North Carolina to make homes more energy efficient. At
this point, it’s about business stability and growth. Folks want to be
able to move on and know what is known in the building trade to be able
to move forward. Thousands of homes have been built in this code. There
are a thousand more that are coming out of the ground as we are looking
at s resurgence of the home building industry. We want to position
builders for success and the market’s responding by were seeing more and
more certified energy efficient homes being built. The last note, this
comment was made about first time home buyers. Energy efficiency is why
we want to help our first time home buyers. Energy efficient homes by a
study by the U of NC Chapel Hill found that energy efficient homes had a
1/3 less likelihood of defaulting in their mortgages. Absolutely why we
want energy efficiency. What we want is we want more money in the
wallet. This is about a home and land security act. This is why we ask
you to support and vote no on the House bill 201.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. McPhone. I have Chad Ray from Old Heritage Builders to
recognize.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good afternoon everybody. Listen, I’m a pretty simple person. I know you
guys have a very complicated agenda and especially this week. I want
everybody to just slow down a minute. Clear your head and I want you to
listen to me very clearly. What I have to say is very important and very
simple. The last two years since the energy conservation code has been
in place, or a little less than two years. North Carolina has built
better homes for more people. Builders are selling more homes than most
places in the country even with this standard that we’ve done. Here’s
the one group that nobody’s mentioned here today, and that’s the
homeowner. That 3,300 dollars which in my opinion, and we debated this
for a long time, still high. But, it was offset. The builder did not
have to raise the cost of the house one dime. Not one dime.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Ray. I just want to point out, we did just pass an
amendment that took residential out of the legislation. So, you’re
recognized to continue your comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.  Thank you Mr. Collins, I’m in your district. It’s so
important to think about the homeowner who’s saving $15 a month in net
energy costs. People who don’t deserve to work in sick buildings and be
hot and cold in their buildings. But, they sure don’t deserve to build a
new home and have a home they can’t afford to pay the utility cost on.
And, make them sick as well. This is very important. I appreciate all of
your service. Thank you for your consideration on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for your comments Mr. Ray. I also have Delaine Wizner,
American Chemistry Council. Mr. Wizner, you’re recognize. I concede two
minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity
this afternoon. My name is Delaine Wizner and I live here in Raleigh,
NC. I work with the American Chemistry Council. In addition to building
owners, there are others that have a stake in this process. That’s the
employees of the companies that make energy efficient products. North
Carolina is the tenth largest chemical producing state in the country,
employing over 41,000 people. Many of the products of chemistry produced
in North Carolina go into construction applications including energy
efficient roofing, insulation, paints, windows, sealants, siding, piping
and house wraps. Our members: Dow, BAYER, Dupont, and BASF have major
facilities in North Carolina. House bill 201 if passed would effectively
roll the energy codes back for builders…</p>

2006 energy efficiency levels because the 2009 code here was watered
down it will cause our state to miss out on significant energy
conservation and will put North Carolina in the bottom tier for states
for energy efficiency this is because all of the east cost states have
adopted the 2009 version and [??] the 2012 of these codes without
weakening amendment please vote no on the adoption of house bill 201.
thank you Mr [??] further discussion further debate on the bill
representative Torbett you're recognized.
thank you Mr chairman all good words and I just wanna [??] on our
support trying to create and adopt and implement as much conservation as
we can on energy but I much rather prefer it be done by the market not
by state [??] I just heard Jim was saying it pretty much that a lot of
business is done in North Carolina based on the government saying so it
shall be and so it was done type of actions I just like to read this I
also had someone talk about how the codes are formed let me tell you
about this one the [??] state building codes is usually done by the
building code council what the gentleman referenced and the office of
the state fire Marshall which is a division of the department of
insurance in this case however the department of commerce estate energy
office requested and received a federal grant to develop the 2012 ECC
which is the energy conservation code a grant of 499 thousand 190
dollars was received from the US department of energy commerce that is
the North Carolina department of commerce contributed a recipient's
share of 166 thousand 422 dollars for a total project cost 665 thousand
612 dollars commerce acted as the conduit for the funds sending them on
to Appalachian's state university in an engineering firm ASU and the
firm worked jointly to improve the state's ECC by 30 percent over the
2006 international energy conservation code a code used by most states
trained building inspectors and seek improvements in building code
development so this is one process that wasn't implemented under the
normal building code implementation process thank you Mr chairman.
alright I will..
[??]
thank you sir motion is probably [??] by representative Torbett I have
representative Stone representative Collins and then we will take the
vote representative Stone you're recognized.
thank you so much Mr chair and this to finalize this is kind of brings
it all back around for me I wanna let the committee know that in 2010 I
had a retired builder that does commercial contracting came back and
build in he build up a full structure about two blocks [??] and this
conversation really comes full spectrum I don't think there was a week
that went by he didn't come down and complained about how much the
building codes had changed and how much dollars it was adding to the
commercial structures and you know at that time I didn't know what I
could do about it I didn't have a clue that it would be sitting in front
of this committee discussing this but the poor gentleman had retired and
he had this complain vigorously everyday at how much it change and it
[??] the cost that added to the project so I'd ask you to support this
bill I think it's a great bill and it'll move us in the right direction
thank you.
representative Collins is recognized.
[??] to remind the committee one thing that representative Torbett said
when he first started pointing this out this is a bill about putting
already existing buildings that are now vacant back into use and I don't
know if your area has many vacant [??] and everything else [??] but we
need to let businesses who are willing put these buildings back yo use
so I hope you'll vote in support of this bill.
I saw representative Wills earlier representative Wills final comment.
I expect I've built more buildings than anybody on this committee there
are two costs involved in that and I like production one is the cost of
actually doing something but what amounts to a bigger cost is figuring
out how to do something different now we're looking at changing a code
that just got changed last year and I can't tell you how big a pain it
is to go to your builder and say I wanna build another building just
like the last one and they say you can't do that they changed the code
again now from a philosophical point of view there's no conservative
argument to change this to 2009 either we'd leave it alone or we
eliminate the energy code completely.

to new PCS and unfavored to original bill. All those so many favor the
bill say aye all those who oppose say no.?? all those in favor will

call for division could we have account ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] 25/14.Next
up we have representative MacGrady and Representative ?? Representative
MacGrady will recognise to present house bill 440. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]House bill 440 creates a new type of corporation. Right now you
have for profit corporation and non-profit corporations. Non profit
corporations have some sort of public benefit and what we trying to
create is something in the middle. Its for profit corporation that
allows for a public benefit. This bill has already passed out judiciary
B and unfortunately there is been a lot of e-mails back and forth about
this being some sort of socialist threat. So I quickly address that
representative Hailey of south Carolina  ?? were among sponsors of this
legislation of the respective states. I have given you a handout that
reflects the number of states were ?? were about to deliver and once
delivery happens. This will be the corporate law that is recognised most
through out the United states many corporations were there. Many
conservative groups have supported this. I gave you a hand out from ??
of family council. The south Carolina Chambers of commerce fro example
supports it. Representative ?? called the other day from south Carolina
trumpeting their new benefit corporation statutes. Both Virginia and
south Carolina among the states have passed this. The senate passed it
last year 48 nothing. So despite watching some may be getting in your e-
mails. This is not that type of entity at all. This bill is really about
economic freedom.This gives people who have economic initiatives but
have something that they give back to community. The bill need a form of
for profit company that does non profit sorts of work. Its a mission
driven corporation and i will tell despite some of the emails that are
going right now. In few years we will be laughing if we do not soon
adopt this. let turn to representative do ??.[SPEAKER

...jobs for you to do, and so they started moving people from one, from
their house to their new house. You got to be a moving company and it
got to be very successful and it got these drug addicts a salary and it
became very successful. Many of them were able to withstand the urges of
drug addiction. Today that's the largest moving company, one of the
largest moving companies in the State. He would like to have had a B
corporation because he can take the profits that you make from moving
people and pour it into helping people that are addicted.
Another good example is Paul Newman who made a lot of money making
movies but he had this great desire to make a camp for kids who were
disabled. So he would take the money that he made from selling salad
dressing and put it in these camps. It's a corporation that you don't
have to buy stock in it. It's entirely up to the people. If they have a
right to organize as they want to organize, and this is just a simple
way to be, to do a benefit corporation for many people.
When you go to law school they tell you that when you are a director of
a corporation, you have an obligation, a fiduciary obligation to
maximize the profits of that corporation. That's what you're to do. To
make sure that your corporation is doing well. This would be, another
general purpose would be maximize something that would help a certain
benefit. That's all this is a vehicle for people to use if they chose
to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Malone, you're recognized to debate the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Quick question for the bill
sponsors. You referenced some of these e-mails that are coming out. I
guess you call it misinformation or what not. One of the things I heard
had to do with agenda 21, it's sustainable growth and what not. Would
you please address that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm not aware that the word sustainable is in the
entire bill. I haven't done a word search. There's nothing, agenda 21 or
sustainable development in this bill. If you're thinking about what this
would look like, this would be like Whole Foods. It's the type of
corporation you're talking about. A corporation that has a profit
motive, but also has other purposes. This will make some group of
people, rather than going out and forming non-profits, they'll form for
profits and that's where I see it being good.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're recognized for a second question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So where do you think this comes from? These concerns?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I, frankly, don't know. I'm sort of puzzled by the
whole thing, but maybe because it does have the word environment in it
or something. I couldn't, I'd be speculating.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lucas, you're recognized to debate the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. This sounds like a great bill to
me because it allows these folks to generate profits but at the same
time, it's helping a lessor group of folk who...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speciale, you're recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We're talking about e-mails and everything, I don't
understand this whole concept, so I'm looking at an e-mail right here.
Let me read a little part of it to you and see maybe you can explain it
to me. It says, &quot;A non-profit group called B Lab is the primary
third party evaluator of B corporations. One of the perks of becoming a
B corporation is joining a network of other companies to take advantage
of discounted services provided by other B corporations, largely
promoters of sustainability measures. Over time, however, it would not
be,&quot; well, I'm not going to go to that. But it says they don't do
it for free, this third party is going to charge up to $25,000 for a
corporation to join the membership roles of B corporations. So this is
all kind of confusing to someone like myself, so if you could explain
this to me, what B Lab has to do with anything.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll do two things. I'll try to answer your question
but we actually have a representative of B Lab here. Just like for
profit entities have to get their financial side certified, according to
generally accounting principals, this entity has got to do that and have
this corporate purpose certified. So there's a transparency. Somebody
can look at thing and saying, &quot;You know, this has been certified by
some other group.&quot; I believe in some States, B Lab is an entity
that has literally a monopoly...</p>

<p id="60:00">
On being able to do this third-party certification that’s not true in
this bill. And we do have a representative of B lab here and she can
speak to that and what B lab does also if that’s ok, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please recognize, tell us your name and who you’re with.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Chairman. ?? and thank you Committee members. Ashley
Perkinson, I do represent B Lab ?? so have taught a class on benefit
corporations for the due non-profit management program. And if you look
in the bill, the bill does provide a third-party standard.  But it
allows the business person to pick who puts together that standard. And
the way that the public can see the standard, that information is
public. It must be provided to the public and it’s also the benefit
corporation will do an annual report to the Secretary of State so what’s
nice about this, these are mission driven for-profit companies and
there’s a lot of transparencies. There’s also the distinction think a
lot of folks talk about B Corp. B Corp is a brand, it’s like a stamp.
It does not benefit corporation legislation, so they’re two different
things and this bit of corporate legislation does not say anything about
B Lab or who can do the reporting. It’s left up to the individual
businesses to pick that third party standard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Ms. Perkinson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And that could be someone other than B Lab, is that right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Ms. Perkinson, I do have 2 members of the public who would
like to speak in opposition. I have 6 and now 7 members of the Committee
who would like to additionally debate this legislation. The Chair
intends to take a vote on this bill today in this Committee.  So I will
recognize Ms. Winn Cohen, for a time not to exceed 2 minutes to discuss
House Bill 440.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hello, I’m from Raleigh. I served for 18 months on the Wake County
Sustainability Task Force.  My Minority Report influenced the Wake
commissioners to reject the Consensus Report. It is interesting, you
could bring up Agenda 21 if you want to but this is really about the
philosophy of sustainable development and this bill was a model
legislation that was funded and conceived out of the Rockefeller
Foundation, the own corporate Governor’s lawyer.  Last year he spoke to
Judiciary Subcommittee C confirmed that.  And it is a very definite
philosophy and its steeped in socialist ideas. I can’t go into them at
the moment but if you go around and look you’ll see this everywhere,
this is the structure for the socialist type of structure and the words
environment, economy, and social equity are built into this. And that is
why I ask if you’re going to blend the nonprofit and the private and the
nonprofits to help the corporations fly that’s really crossing checks
and balances that isn’t economic freedom. But also what it is does is it
enables the standards of environment and society to be written in here
when actually why don’t you ask them what is a nonprofit. There are a
lot of ?? definitions of nonprofit. Why didn’t they choose the exact
three critical terminology that all the international socialists, all
the international United Nations use, economy equity and social equity
and environment. I have to question that completely. Also I don’t think
North Carolina should let worldview foundations like the Rockefellers
who are the founding architects of sustainable development, way before
Agenda 21 to drive our model legislation. Make your own bills, make your
own laws. Write your terminology your own way where you don’t use
environment and society, say nonprofit, though I don’t agree with the
blurring of the sectors which is the other goal of this. The fourth
section initiative coming out of Cabarrus Chapel Hill, the Obama
administration has expressed an interest in this. But it’s about
blurring and blending the sectors.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Ms. Cohen. Thank you for your comments, Ms. Cohen.  Scott
Dadong you’re recognized for a time not to exceed 2 minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, my name is Scott DeGaud. I’m here as a citizen, my background
is an engineer. I develop international standards for multinational
corporations. I want to bring attention to one small but very essential
term in this bill. It will change the nature of this bill. And that’s
the term third-party standard.  The implications of not passing this
bill without this in my opinion are staggering. There are two kinds of
standards, there’s proprietary standards which are imposed to the
dominate technology by a single company or regular for a mandate. The
danger is that a single company or compliance entity has total control
over the market. Open standards are developed and adopted with open
governments ?? participation.  With an open standard, no one possesses
the standard. But everyone uses the standard. The third-party standard
definition in H bill 440 is not open standard.</p>

...fiduciary duty is to maximize value for the shareholders. If a
shareholder objected, the director would be in violation of his
fiduciary duty. For example, if you are a director in -- what's the name
of that food company? -- Whole Foods, and you're using containers they
want to use that cost five dollars more than another container you could
buy, it would be in the board of directors' best interest to insist that
you use a less expensive container, in this particular case, with a
general purpose of, not only making money, but being good using certain
products.
They can do what they want to do, but here's the thing, Robert. You
don't have to invest in this company. This is something somebody does
voluntarily. Nobody makes anybody.
The Chairman: Representative [Brawley?], you're recognized for a third
question.
Representative: Yes, Representative Daughtry, I understand that, but my
job down here is to not just protect me, but all the citizens of North
Carolina.
The bill as I read it does require a higher percentage of vote by the
board of directors to make a decision. But it also exempts them from
being held responsible for those decisions and totally eliminates the
fiduciary responsibility.
The Chairman: Representative McGrady, you're recognized.
Representative McGrady: I don't believe that's true. The B corp, because
on the one hand, on the benefit side, it has this third-party evaluation
of what it is doing and whether it is achieving those goals, and on the
financial side, it's got the same financial oversight that any
corporation has. So I don't believe what you understand to be true.
The Chairman: Followup then. Recognized for a fourth question.
Representative: Does it not exempt the board of directors from some of
that responsibility that you have in a normal corporation? That's the
reason for the bill itself.
Representative Daughtry: No. You have the same fiduciary duty. It's just
different in this particular case.
Representative: Wait a minute, wait a minute, Representative Daughtry.
How can you have the same fiduciary responsibility, it's just different?
Representative Daughtry: Because in a C corporation, a regular
corporation, the directors' fiduciary duty is to maximize profits;
that's his fiduciary duty. In this particular corporation, it's not
necessarily to maximize profits.
The Chairman: Representative Brody, you're recognized to debate the
bill.
Representative Brody: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I just want to ask a question and preface it by saying, here's something
here that we just don't know, and maybe we'll find out before it becomes
law. But let me ask you, a corporation makes profit, a corporation
decides to spend that profit on some type of program, some
nonprofit-type program. Are these expenses, then, actually considered
the costs of doing the business, or are they going to pay taxes on the
full amount and then use whatever's left, for their benefit?
Representative Daughtry: They pay taxes like anyone else.
The Chairman: Representative Bumgardner, you're recognized to debate the
bill.
Representative Bumgardner: Yes, sir, thank you.
I just have a couple comments about this, this thing. I wish I had more
time to go through this, this bill. It's complicated and very
open-ended, in my opinion. It lays out a lot of stuff here. Just a
cursory reading over it here, it's got definitions, and then it's got
&quot;specific corporate purpose, conferring any particular benefits to
society or the environment, including, but not limited to any of the
following&quot; -- this bill's very complicated, and I think it's
opening a can of worms, and unless I have more time to study it, I can't
support that.
The Chairman: Representative Speciale, you're recognized to debate the
bill.
Representative Speciale: All corporations by their nature are benefit
corporations. They can spend their money on what they want to. They can
organize the way they want to, with regard to their purpose, as long as
they have shareholder permission.
I think this bill brings up more questions than we're able to answer in
one committee, and I suggest that we give it an unfavorable report.
The Chairman: Representative Jeter, you're recognized to debate the
bill.
Representative Jeter: I hate to say it again, but I'm from South
Caroline, so I'm a little slow, but I just don't quite get the issue
here; it's a voluntary company that's forming a B corporation whose sole
purpose of the B corporation is to allow the directors to have multiple,
or a different set of, fiduciary responsibilities. It does not absolve
them of their fiduciary responsibility; it just gives them a different
set. And we're going to have companies that otherwise could be
nonprofit, and not pay a dime in taxes, who may opt to be for-profit now
and provide taxes for the tax rolls. It forces no one...</p>

To do anything. It hurts nobody to do this other than seeing men in
shadows where they usually don't exist. I see no reason not to approve
this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson, you are recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just coincidentally had a conversation with a business development
person this weekend about LLCs and the history on LLCs and they made the
comment that North Carolina was one of the later states to do LLCs, and
we had lost business because we were one of the last, and how great it
was that we finally did it. So when I look at B Corps and I look at the
number of states that are doing it and I go on what Representative Jeter
said, we often say that we want to be comparable to what our neighboring
states. Our neighboring states are doing this. And so I don't see a
reason why we shouldn't. Why would we be last again to the party?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lucas, you are recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chair. I'd like to offer a motion for a favorable
report to the PCS unfavorable to the original bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is, there's not a PCS though, but motion is properly before us. So
many as in favor would say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All those opposed say no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The chair is unable to determine. All those in favor will please raise
your hand. So many as opposed, please raise your hand. Twenty two in
favor, fourteen against. The motion passes. This meeting is adjourned.</p>
