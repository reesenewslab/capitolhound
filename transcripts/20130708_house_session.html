SPEAKER CHANGES:
Lord I come before you today with great praise and thanksgiving you have
poured out such great blessings among this body and Lord I want to first
want to thank you for this great nation. And for this holiday of the
independence day that we could celebrate and for the wisdom of our
founding fathers who recognized that we are one nation under God. And
also recognize Lord that as they came to this point in their session of
developing the Constitution that they needed a recess before the fourth
of July and that they needed to call on you. And Lord you have blessed
us with a great state of North Carolina and your word says that there is
no authority except that which God has established. Lord I thank you so
much for all the people represented in this body and that you have
called them to this leadership. And that you have given us an important
job to do and at this point Lord that I come before you with humility
and say that we need you. And that unless the Lord builds the house the
builders labor in vain. Unless the Lord watches over the city the guards
watch in vain according to Psalms one twenty seven. Lord don't let us
labor in vain. I pray that you would pour out your holy spirit on us now
and help us to do the work that you have called us to do. Whether it's
ego, whether it's pride or whether it's just our humanity getting in the
way of what is right and what is your will for your people. I pray Lord
that you would help us to put it aside and to compromise for the good of
the people. Don't let us compromise just because we're weary and tired
and we want to go home. Help us to do good and to do your will. Above
all things Lord that is what we need. Wherever there are disagreements
Lord I pray that you would give us understanding and good communication
and fruitful collaboration. With what you're word says that many are the
plans in man's heart but it is the Lord's purpose that prevents. Lord I
just ask these things in Jesus name that you would bless our time
together as we move forward. Amen.

Mr. Speaker, I noticed Representative Graham is out of the chamber, it's
my understanding that all of the party's in agreement. I would move that
the conference report be adopted.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Further discussion, further debate?
If not, the question before the House is the motion to adopt the
conference report for Senate Bill 231. All in favor vote aye. All
opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote.
The clerk will let the machine record the vote. 109 having voted in the
affirmative, none in the negative. The House has adopted the conference

[SPEAKER CHANGES].
House Bill 568 would de-annex five tracks from the corporate limits of

of the Asheville Regional Airport. We had a good vote on this before,
and I ask for your support again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Representative Fisher, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
The lady is recognized to debate the bill. The House will come to order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen of the House. This is a
bill, if you recall, I know we've had a little break here in the action,
but if you'll recall, this is the bill that would de-annex the airport
property from the corporate limits of the City of Asheville. The City of
Asheville acquired the property in the 1950's, they developed the
airport, and when we looked at this bill before, I brought out the idea
that the City of Asheville has been very supportive of what the airport
is about. They started the airport in the 1950's. This again is another
attempt to sort of take power away from the City of Asheville, I know
that you are really tired of all of these bills, and I would ask that
you just vote No, and hope that we don't see another one like it in the
future. Thank you.

If not, the question before the House is the passage of the House
Committee substitute to House Bill 568 on its third reading.  All in

[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman's recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Speaker, members, we had a very good vote on this
bill, last time we were here, it's been a few days now.  And this is the
bill that had to do with the property rights.  I won't get back through
an explanation of the bill, but I will tell you that the language of
this bill was drafted on consultation.  This is Senator McKissick's
bill, who's with us tonight in the chamber on the floor. In consultation
with the city attorney there, a former city attorney, with our staff,
with attorneys for the folks wishing to develop this property, I know
there is some lack of unity in the delegation from Durham, but I do
think, Members, this is a fair bill.  This is a bill that has to do with
property rights, and I urge the members to continue to support the bill,
and oppose any amendments.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Larry Hall, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman's recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker, and I think Representative Moore
got it partly right, when he indicated that the House delegation members
are opposed to this, and that there may be a differing opinion in the
Senate, as we all know there often is.  But many of you were convinced
based on information you had received of supposed good intentions of
people to come to the rescue and provide opportunities, at the same time
avoiding working with the local government, and doing that.  And so, if
that is in fact the case Mr. Speaker, to send forward an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman is recognized to send forward an
amendment, the clerk will read.  Gentlemen, please state the amendment
number.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]ALB109.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]This is amendment ALB-109B1.  Representative L. Hall
moves to amend the bill on page 2, line 6, by adding the following
between lines 6 and 7.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker, and  members of the House.
Again, as we've decided to be in the roll of local government, and to
take over their responsibilities to the community of Durham, I think
it's only appropriate that we now say since this is an experiment, and
the first time that the House has every gone against the wished of the
local government and done this type of action, that we ensure we have a
record of what actually comes out of the promises that were made, and
then.</p>

Incidence we had, and so this would require that that there be a report
filed buy those folks who had developed this property over the period of
time that they say it would take to develop it, and see if the jobs
somewhere between 300 to 3000, and again heard one person say 30,000.
Don't know where that came from but certainly didn't sound realistic.
But have them report over that period of time just what jobs were
generated, what kind of economic impact there actually was, and was your
intervention merited. And so I'd ask that you support the amendment.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Amendment ALB-110B3 representative L.Hall moves to
amend the bill on page two, line six, by adding the following between
lines six and seven.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and members of the House. Once
again the public representations by many people in support of this bill
that takes the responsibility and authority from the city of Durham,
many have said it's going to be great for the local community and all of
these things are gonna happen that will inure to their benefit in
essence that this is a great deal. And as such, the local community
would benefit. Now we know that Charlotte, Durham and many other cities
have bills that provide the local business have a fair shot to
participate in what happens in their communities. And so this amendment
would ask that you support the idea that's been put forward by the
developers that they'll produce and create jobs for Durham residents in
Durham by building this project. And so I'd ask that you support the
amendment, be true to what you say you believe in and be true to what
you say the project is gonna do for Durham and make sure that happens by
supporting this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, members, I hope you will read this
amendment and see what it says. This is an amendment offered by the
gentleman from Durham that would require a private, that would by
statute require a private property owner and dictate with whom that
private property owner contracts. I do not know if there's ever been
such an amendment filed on the floor of this house, as a result if I may
be recognized for a motion.

representative Hall?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Mr. Speaker, this is the last one I have right
now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The court will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Amendment ALB-111V1, representative Hall moves to
amend the bill on page two, line six, by adding the following between
lines six and seven.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and once again I'm prevailing
upon my fellow legislators, although many of whom are on the other side
of the aisle who have accepted whole cloth this theory that this project
is going to provide these jobs for Durham and that it justifies
something that we've never done before. Which is to subvert the will of
the City Council of Durham in development matters, extending water and
sewer. And this amendment would ensure the developers hold true to the
promises.</p>

Representative: made and testified to for those of you in the public
hearings in finance. Where members of the African American community
came forward and indicated they were promised that jobs would be created
for the high employment African Americans in the Durham county and city
area. So, once again, this amendment, I am going to ask you to be true
to what you claim to be the basis in supporting taking away the power of
the citizens of Durham to have their council handle these type matters.
This simply says that those promises that were made to create
opportunities for minorities in Durham, will be carried out. Again, if
you support the bill based on the representations made to you, then you
should support this amendment so in fact it does happen, and you are not
mislead. I ask for your support.
Speaker: Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
Representative: To debate the amendment.
Speaker: The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
Representative: Mr. Speaker, members, again, this is an amendment that
would purport – that would treat a private party, a private individual,
would put mandates on what the government has. I would question,
frankly, whether it is constitutional. I do want to address a couple of
points the gentleman from Durham had mentioned, and that is the comments
about these folks giving jobs. If you recall from the public hearing
there were a lot of folks speaking about how a lot of the folks involved
in this development were involved with CREE. This company has a great
reputation, it has a diverse work force, and it is giving jobs to folks
in the local community in Durham. I think you have got a track record to
look at with these folks, and they have done that, and I think you will
see that. But, again, to try and put this kind of mandate on a private
business is unprecedented. As a result, actually, I would ask to be
heard for a motion.
Speaker: The gentleman is recognized for a motion.
Representative: Move for the amendment I put on the table.
Speaker: Motion made by Representative Moore, seconded by Representative
Burr. The question before the house is the motion to lie upon the table.
The amendment as set forth by Representative Larry Hall to the house
committee substitute 3, for senate bill 315. All in favor vote aye, all
opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock the
machine and record the vote: 72 having voted in the affirmative, 37 in
the negative. The motion passes and we are now back on the bill.
Representative McShaw, please state your purpose.
Representative: To speak on the bill
Speaker: The gentleman is recognized to speak on the bill.
Representative: Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentleman of the house, I
have been called a relic in this body because I have been here so long.
One of the advantages of being here as a relic of this type is that you
learn things, and you learn what goes on in here, and see things happen
in here. In the years that I have been here, this is the first time that
I have ever seen people ignore the wishes of a delegation that comes in
and says, “no, this is not what our city wants,” and goes really against
the wishes of that city. The city councilman and I voted twice not to
accept this project, because a lot of things and promises made on that
were not tenable. For instance, the promise of 3000 jobs, this is the
figure that was used – 3000 jobs and a 165 acre planned use development
project, which includes housing and other services. The only way I know
that you are going to get 3000 jobs is to put a plant to give 3000 jobs
to somebody – it is not going to do that in this type of project. The
second thing is simply this: we have seen a plethora of bills come
through here that takes away the authority of citizen counties. There is
the astro bill, for instance, that took away – that gave the water to a
water authority. Then there is the Charlotte bill that took away – is
taking away the airport of Charlotte and is giving it to an authority,
by the way, if that happens, you may regret that system there: Charlotte
is now the new secretary of transportation.
Speaker: Senator McShaw, the chair would encourage the member to stay
focused on the content of the bill.
Representative: well, that is what I am trying to do Mr. Secretary.
Speaker: The chair is not quite certain as to how the new secretary of
transportation relates to the content of this bill. The gentleman will
please focus his comments.
Representative: My comment is based on the fact that</p>

[Speaker changes.]  ... the project is trying to take away the airport
at Charlotte and now you're entering into the Durham situation and I
understand there are others that are comin' up so, in order to stay in
line as the Speaker's told me...I'm glad you're trying to keep me in
line, Mister Speaker, please do...I appreciate it to great extent. I
just don't understand why you wanna interfere in anybody else's
business...you wouldn't appreciate anybody coming into your community
and doin' the same thing to you. So I would ask that you vote against
this bill.  Oh and Mister Speaker, by the way, I failed to mention that
those...just by some coincidence...those three matters that we've been
taking up here...as for Charlotte and Durham...by some coincidence
happen to have black mayors.  Thank you.
[Speaker changes.]  Representative Luebke, please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.]  To speak on the bill.
[Speaker changes.]  The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker changes.]  Thank you, Mister Speaker...members of the
House...we had a discussion on this bill last week.  It was in the
Finance Committee of course and then, here on the floor and my
impression at the...from the whole that debate both in committee and on
the floor is that each of you had been visited by a lobbyist on behalf
of the project and that that lobbyist basically said, &quot;look at what
a great project we have...and it's such a great project that you really
should ignore what the city of Durham has decided is best for the
city&quot;.  In terms of..for the city of Durham, there's issues of
watershed protection. It was issues of cost benefit analysis in terms of
water/sewer and it was some doubt as to whether in fact this 3000 job
figure in fact had any veracity to it.  And the city looked at that for
a long time...as Representative Michaux mentioned a couple years ago
there was a unanimous vote against it...seven/zero.  Just last month,
the vote was four to three. And what's happened...apparently happened
before Finance Committee and then before the floor, was that the
lobbyist got to each of you and said...&quot;look, not withstanding what
Durham wants...not withstanding what that City Council's done...not
withstanding that City Council stands for election in the November
either '13 or '15...not withstanding all that, you should tell Durham
what's best for Durham.&quot;  Now, I'm hoping that each of you, as you
went home and thought about your town council, thought about your county
commission, asked yourself the question...&quot;would I really like it
if someone shepherded a bill...someone 150 miles away from my
district...shepherded a bill through that told my town what it had to
do?&quot;  In this case, telling Durham it must provide water/sewer to
the project when the city of Durham voted otherwise.  I hope all of you
have had an epiphany...many, many of you have had an epiphany and
recognized how wrong that is to tell a town what to do.  For this state
government...or State House...to tell a town what it's supposed to do in
terms of local policy.  So I very much urge you to rethink what you did
last time and vote no on this bill.  Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Larry Hall, please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] Speak on the bill.
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker changes.]  Thank you Mister Speaker and, ladies and gentleman
of the House, I again recognize your authority to make the decisions you
wanna make and this is a bill again where, in all honesty,
representations were made and we decided not even to discuss the
amendments that were being put forward and instead we decided...to lay
'em on the table and just go ahead and talk about the actual bill itself
and not give any consideration to what the promises were that got you to
vote for the bill in the first place.  Well, we decided to take the
authority of a city away but we didn't decide to take the responsibility
that city has to the citizens and discharge that as well so it's fine if
you're gonna displace the city's authority but take the responsibility
that goes with it.  And that's to see that this development does what it
was represented to you to do.  We think the city had it right...that
they should evaluate and make the decision based on their financial
ability, their budgets, their planning, etc.  But since we've decided
we're gonna take away that authority from them, based on promises being
made...then we should protect ourselves and say &quot;let's insure those
promises are kept&quot;...this bill doesn't do...

??  This bill provides for no mechanism by which the promises of those
illusory jobs that you've talked about and many have hailed and said
that they would want this development in their district, well you
wouldn't want it in your district if it didn't have any jobs.  You
wouldn't want it in your district if it just took up water and sewer
capacity that could be used for something else.  You wouldn't want it in
your district if it displaced several years of hard work on small area
plans in your district.  You wouldn't want it in your district then.
You wouldn't want it in your district if your city council didn't want
it.  And so, take the easy out.  That's what you're doing.  But
remember, you had a chance.  You had an opportunity to make sure this
bill actually did what it represented to you that it would do and you
decided to pass every time.  I would recommend to you that you displace
it, put some provisions in it to make it really do what it represented
to you that it would do, rather than taking the easy way out, throwing
your hands up, just voting, and then walking away leaving Durham
damaged, in debt, and if they came to the General Assembly for help I'm
sure the cry then would be they're an independent municipality, they
should have planned better, they should have done better on their own.
You've taken that authority away from them.  I'd ask that you vote no.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House.  Again, this isn't my
bill, this is my good friend Senator McKissick's bill, but I've worked
with him on it.  And I'll tell you that I wasn't going to speak again,
but I wanted to address a couple of things.  The mayor testified in this
finance committee meeting that there is ample water supply for this
project.  You had the folks involved with the development who are folks
who live in Durham and have lived in Durham for years come forward and
state what their going to do.  Their personal reputations are on the
line for this.  You also have a signed contract that the property owners
are doing with the city of Durham regarding the utilities and all the
other matters.  The developers are going to make road improvements at
their expense.  They're going to pay twice the water rate of folks who
are inside the city.  This is going to be a money-maker for the city;
it's going to create jobs, not just for folks in Durham County but for
folks all over this state projected to create up to 3,000 permanent
jobs.  It's going to provide affordable housing.  This is a great
project that I would submit most folks in this chamber would love to
have in your district.  That being said, I would urge the members of the
body to continue to support this bill.  Thank you.

objection to grouping any one of those.  We will try and group those if
there is objection to any one of them.  We'll come back to those in a
minute.  House Bill 14, the Clerk will read.

have voted in the affirmative, none in the negative, the amendment
passed as were back on the bill.  The lady has the floor to debate the
bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker.  I'll be glad to go section by
section, but it's Monday night, and I don't believe you might want to do
that, but I'm willing to do so.  Sections 1-24 are recommendations that
came from the revenue law study committee.  Sections 30-53 are
additional changes that have been requested, mostly requested by the
Department of Revenue.  In this section, the amendment that you just
passed has to do with section 34E, and that is a substantive part of the
bill that deals with bonus depreciation, and how we treat bonus
depreciation.  When we were in the finance committee, you say that there
was a $2 million fiscal impact on this particular section, if we left
the date at 2008.  But we are moving the date forward, so it's only
applicable to anything in the year 2012 forward.  So actually there will
be no fiscal impact on that part of the bill.  Section 60 makes some
technical changes dealing with occupancy tax, and this was approved by
the Occupancy Tax Subcommittee.  And section 70-72 are changes related
to the tax and tag together, combined motor vehicle property tax system.
 And with that Mr. Speaker, I stand and try to answer any questions, but
I would ask for your support on the bill.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker.  This amendment  is the exact
language for House Bill 242, which we passed back in April, 114 to
nothing.  This is really technical changes dealing with local fire
departments.  The IRS made a change that made it so you don't have to
have 501C3 status to get your sales tax back.  This just makes us in
compliance with that, and I thank Representative Howard for her
assistance in putting this on this bill.

Yes, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Howard, back on the section
50 again which authorizes less than all of the counties in a Regional
Public Transportation Authority to levy a regional registration tax of
up to $8 for transportation purposes. This would impact Wake, Durham and
Orange Counties, and under current law all 3 would have to agree to levy
the tax, but under this bill 1 or 2 counties could levy the tax. Is that
correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, that is correct, but it would only be in

Speaker, members of the House, we don't like to affect pending
legislation when we don't intend to. There's at least one lawsuit out
there under current charter school law, and so all this amendment says
is that nothing we're doing in this bill gives a boost to the plaintiff

tomorrow we intend to have session at one p.m. Most likely we will be at
two p.m. on Wednesday and depending upon how the week progresses, we may
be able to have an earlier session, a noon session on Thursday. This
week the, the committees, except for appropriations, finance and rules
will be winding down their work. As a result, it is possible. You would
have to speak to the Committee Chairs to be certain. It is possible
there may be committee meeting on Friday. We do not anticipate a session
on Friday but I would encourage you, if you have Bills pending in
committees, all committees certainly, especially committees other than

Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House. On July Fourth
Nineteen Twenty, James Marshall Coley, my father was born. And I was
raised to truly respect and honor the Declaration of Independence. My
brother and I heard him refer to it, read from it numerous times. A
little bit of information for you and I wanted to share this tonight
with you because I found it a little ironic of the dates and the days
and how they coincide together. The Declaration of Independence was
printed, late afternoon on Thursday, July the Fourth, seven...</p>

1776. We just celebrated it last Thursday. Copies were sent to all 13
states and it was first published July the 6th in the Philadelphia
Evening Post. It was announced that it had been adopted July 5th. It was
proclaimed that the Declaration of Independence was first read publicly
on July the 8th, today, by Colonel John Nixon of the Committee of Safety
at the State House in Philadelphia. It was read again that evening
before the militia on the commons. It was read as well that evening in
Trenton, New Jersey, July 8th, 1776 and Easton, Pennsylvania. These
first readings constituted the first celebrations of the 4th of July,
which was, would be today with the ringing of bells and with that, Mr.
Speaker, with your indulgence, I would like to read on July 8th, 2013,
the Declaration of the United States. When in the Course of human
events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political
bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the
powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of
Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the
opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which
impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident,
that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator
with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and
the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are
instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the
governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of
these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and
to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles
and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most
likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will
dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for
light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn,
that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable,
than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are
accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing
invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under
absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off
such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future
security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and
such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former
Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain
is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct
object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To
prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker and ladies and gentlemen of the House. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Carney, I re-read the declaration on the 4th of July and
I think that should be a tradition that others will carry on from year
to year. I'm not sure that that's happened since I've been here, but
that was wonderful and thank you for that. Representative Dixon, please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For an announcement. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for an announcement. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, members of the House, the House Committee on
Agriculture will meet tomorrow at 11AM in room 644. We will consider two
bills, Senate Bill 386, Senate Bill 455. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jeter, the gentleman was not here when the notice of the
Committee on Ways and Means was announced. The gentleman can come
forward and receive his gavel.</p>

Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman of the
house, I am saddened to report to you that since we have last met the
mayor of the city of Eden, which I represent, passed away. Mayor John
Grogan passed away on the 4th of July at the age of 78, after a battle
with cancer. Mayor Grogan was in the process of wrapping up his eighth
year as mayor, and served a previous 20 years on the Eden City Council.
So he served the City of Eden for almost 28 years. Mayor Grogan has
received many local honors. I will not go through those, but I think
that it is of not that he is a recipient of the order of the Long Leaf
Pine, and I know that you understand that is one of the highest honors
that the governor of our state can bestow on a NC citizen. So members I
hope you will join with me in offering condolences to the mayor’s wife,
Sylvia, and family at this time. Thank you.

Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker. After Representative Jones spoke
I felt compelled to tell you to that Representative Elmore and I lost a
special person from our district this weekend. The district court judge
from Wilkes County who was swimming at sunset beach and was attempting
to rescue two people and drowned. Representative or… Judge McClain was
only 54 years old I believe. Down there with his two children and wife,
attempting to save someone and collapsed on the beach and died. So we

up house bill 695, family, faith and freedom protection act. The
committee will meet again tomorrow afternoon fifteen minutes after
session in room 643 to take up senate bill 553, LME MCO enrolling
grievances and appeals.
Speaker: Ladies and gentleman, just one clarification on the
announcement fro the morning session. We are taking up a bill that
passed out of the senate but has not arrived in the chamber, but given
the focus on the bill, we thought it was appropriate to have a couple of
hours of hearing in the house and that is why we are bringing it up. We
will be brining up the content of the bill and expect to receive in the
chamber tomorrow when the senate returns. Representative Schaeffer,
please state your purpose.
Representative: For a moment of personal privilege.
Speaker: The lady is recognized for a point of personal privilege.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman I rise to
ask you to help me in honoring a very special member of this body. This
member, many of you may know, he wears many different hats. Some know
him as the first man whip, some know him as the M&amp;M bank, the
organizer of very early premier meetings, and some of us recognize him
as the culprit who turned our light on when she was not looking, a few
months ago. I would ask for you all to stand and recognize
Representative Dean Arp , his birthday was yesterday, and hope you will
join me in wishing him a very happy birthday.

[Speaker Changes] The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[Speaker Changes] Following up on your earlier comment, Mister Speaker.
Does that mean that Health and Human Services Policy Committee will not
vote on the bill in the morning?
[Speaker Changes] That's correct. As a normal course we do not vote on
motions to concur and committee. I had determined the fate in light of
the discussion that went on last week, that some of the content of the
bill that is in the bill coming back to us for a potential concurrence
vote that needed a lengthy debate, and that's why we've set the two hour
meeting. Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
