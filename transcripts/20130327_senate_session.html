that our high schools and schools aren't really achieving, you remind
them of Southeast Raleigh Magnet High School. And the other 21 high
schools in Wake county. But we have with us today that choir and chorus
from Southeast Raleigh Magnet High School, and they've been recognized
across the state. They're constantly getting invitations to perform. And
again, if you weren't over here, you missed a real blessing in not
hearing them in their various renditions. So, Mr. President, I'd like to
send forth a Senatorial Statement acknowledging this great high school,
this great choir, its leadership, and acknowledging that we're all in
good hands for a bright future tomorrow as long as it's young leaders
like this and young students like this who will be the ones setting the
stage for us. And I would ask that you would please acknowledge the
presence of that choir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator. You can send forth your Senatorial
Statement. And members of the choir, please stand and be recognized, and

Senator ??, recognize to explain the bill? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Mr. President. This bill is to fix the flawed Mecklenburg County, two
thousand and eleven property revaluation. The purpose of this bill is to
ensure that all the residents and property owners in Mecklenburg County
receive a fair and accurate value for their home after this process. Now
that the Mecklenburg County Board of commissioners voted unanimously
nine to nothing to ask for the legislatures help to remedy this
situation and enable refunds for overvalued properties. That the Senate
Finance Committee unanimously supported this piece of legislation and
that all five delegate members from the Senate, all five senators have
supported this bill, with that I ask for your support for this piece of
legislation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If we
could have the reading clerk read in the title to senate bill one fifty
nine please [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate bill one fifty nine required
certain general reappraisal [SPEAKER CHANGES] senator Apodaca for what
purpose do you rise [SPEAKER CHANGES] will senator Tarte yield to a
question [SPEAKER CHANGES] senator Tarte will you yield [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I do [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tarte in your comments did I
hear you say that Mecklenburg delegation agreed on something? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] scary thought isn't it? OK I'm for it thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt, for what purpose you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President, would the gentleman yield to a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tarte do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
well consider me frightened. I was looking at this and if I'm not
mistaken this is a state wide bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] it is [SPEAKER
CHANGES] so the rest of us will be impacted to could you tell us what he
does? [SPEAKER CHANGES]  This bill has four criteria that have to be met
before it will require a county to consider doing a revaluation of the
bill and currently there is only one county that meets all four
criteria. [SPEAKER CHANGES] will he yield to another question? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Tarte will you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Under current law you have to do a reappraisal every so often I
can remember what it is, it’s  eight years, four years? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Eight years is correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does that remain in
effect? [SPEAKER CHANGES] it does. [SPEAKER CHANGES] will you yield to
another question [SPEAKER CHANGES] senator Tarte do you yield [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So weather they meet the criteria or
not they got to do it every eight years? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That is my
understanding correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES] senator gentleman for what
purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President to ask senator
Tarte a question [SPEAKER CHANGES] senator do you yield for question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] this is a as you said a public
bill and one county right now meets all four of the criteria? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] that is correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES] eventually some of them may
want be like Charlotte not many but some. If they grow into the
eligibility requirement that will affect them also. I guess my question
is why not make it a local bill? [SPEAKER CHANGES] well as I understand
it constitutionally this has to be classified so we are not creating
special classes or groups of citizens in the state. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
and one follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] senator do you yield for follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] who gave you that advice?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] several attorneys, including in-house counsel here
within the legislature, individuals from legal counsel within
Mecklenburg County and also within the school of government. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] thank you very much senator. That’s what worries me. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] senator Rucho. [SPEAKER CHANGES] yes Sir
if Senator Apodaca would yield to question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] senator
Apodaca do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
senator Apodaca is there any chance that the Buncombe County delegation
could get together and be on the same side one time? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
every day, senator every day. [SPEAKER CHANGES] is there any further
discussion of the debate? Hearing none requesting for the senators, the

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator you have the floor for point of personal

[SPEAKER CHANGES] I arise to send forward, Mr. President, a senatorial
statement recognizing the town of Conway in Northampton County for its
100th anniversary. The area of the little community of Conway was
started really in about 1888. It’s been a very prosperous community ever
since then. It’s entrenched in the agricultural community, as you can
well imagine, a little bit south of the Virginia line. Conway has always
been a community that’s been known for the pride of the citizens and how
they look after it but it’s also been known pretty much all in that part
of the state as a very high producer of both cotton and peanuts. They
have done so year in and year out and I’d like to send forward this
senatorial statement and if you would, Mr. President, I think that some
dignitaries in the gallery, if you’d recognize. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. Thank you Senator you can send forward your
senatorial statement and upon a motion, Senator Jenkins of Edgecombe
County , the chair’s happy to extend courtesies of the gallery to the
people from the Town of Conway, North Carolina, Mayor Brian Bolton -
Town of Conway – Nancy Jenkins - Town Administrator, Peggy Davis and
Shelby Ritz. If you’re with us today please stand and be recognized.
