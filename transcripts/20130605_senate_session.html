with me and pray. Lord, you are a fortress. Not just for one but for a
people. Our thoughts are often singular, but you’re a God that’s
revealed himself in community. Lord, you’re the only thing that can
buffer us and so we before you down here today reaffirm our dependence
upon you, as expressed best by the authors of this state constitution,
written back in 1789. It was these writers that suggested that we are a
people that must be thankful to almighty God. It was these writers that
said that we must acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, for the
continuance of these blessings. Let us put our hope in you, the mighty
fortress that is our God, as we continue to be your people of this great
state. And it’s in Christ’s name we pray, Amen. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

House Bill 24, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 24, DV Abuser Treatment Programs Amendments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Daniel is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the Senate. This bill was
recommended by the Domestic Violence Commission and the North Carolina
Bar Association and basically what it does is just creates a better
system for tracking whether domestic violence abusers who are ordered to
go to a treatment program actually show up and comply with the program
and actually pass the program and it gives the court a better way to
track their progress. I ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

24 on its second reading. All in favor will vote aye. Opposed will vote

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 25, Amend Felony Breaking or Entering.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Daniel is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President and members of the Senate. This bill cleans up
a loophole in our breaking and entering laws. Currently if you break and
enter with the intent to commit a larceny it's a class H felony but if
you, for instance if you were domestic violent, if you were a husband
and you broke into your ex-spouse's house with the intent to terrorize
that person it would be just a misdemeanor breaking and entering. So
this creates a new class of offense that's a person who breaks or enters
with the intent to terrorize or injure an occupant of the building is
guilty of the class H felony which is consistent with the larceny
statute. I would just ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question before the Senate
is the passage of House Bill 25. All in favor will vote aye. Opposed
will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. Clerk will

House Bill 125, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Bill 125, Public Agency Computer Code Not Public Record.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Parmon is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President and members. House Bill 125 simply clarifies
that in a proprietary computer code that's written by an agency of
subdivision of the state or government is not a part of public records.

support. Thank you.

So some years later I went to a taxidermist, andI said, I’d like to
stuff this bird and give it to my son for his birthday. And they told me
you can’t do that, its against the law. I called two or three and then
they told me to call the wildlife, and I couldn’t do that. Well several
hurricanes later, then finally my son threw it out of the freezer, so I
asked if this bill would have helped me when I wanted to take this to a
taxidermist and apparently it still isn’t true, is that true Senator
Brock, I still couldn’t have done that?
[Speaker Changes] Uh, Mr. President, I don’t know if you keep a frozen
bird in your freezer for twenty years if it would be salvageable at that
point. So it still may not help your case.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Gunn, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes] To speak to the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Gunn has the floor to speak to the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Well I just wanted to say that I do support this bill,
and I didn’t have my glasses on though when I originally looked down at
it, and I read it as, and I’m glad to see it wasn’t, but I read it as,
“trophy wild wife sale permit”. “wife”.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Speak briefly on the bill.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bob Shaw served nine terms here and a lot of
you don't know this, but he owned the best seafood place and Mark ??
will tell you that to this day called Friendly Road Inn up there on
Friendly Road in Greensboro. And I ate there for 25, 28 years. And hated
to see it close. In fact I was there the night, the last night that it
closed. But sitting at that table in Friendly Road Inn, Bob told me that
there were going to be some redistricting done and there was going to be
a Senate seat that had my name on it. And I said, &quot;Oh, no. You're
not getting me into anything like that.&quot; But he kept talking. He
convinced me that with his help that I could probably do this thing. So
he was the one responsible for me running. And Bob has an illustrious
career. As you all know, he served as County Commissioner and he served
as State GOP Chairman for a few terms. He served his State in many
capacities. His wife, Linda, who I've not seen today would certainly be
honored by this happening. Served as National Committeewoman, Guilford
County Commissioner and I will stop my remarks because I see Tom Apodaca
giving me that look. He wants to go to Hilton Head or somewhere today.
But I'm honored to be able to speak on behalf of Senator Shaw and this
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator
Robinson, for what purpose do your rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Robinson has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. I simply want to say that I also
knew Senator Shaw and from the other side of the aisle, he was a person
that he and his wife both supported the entire community and that inn is
open again, Senator Tillman, under other ownership and still has good
seafood.</p>

I will not talk about what we said about the growlers unless, of course,
I had one or two. They're a quart, Senator Bingham, they're a quart.
Now, they're not just a single. But I also will not bring up how fast
you and Don East were driving in that Dodge Charger. I will not bring
