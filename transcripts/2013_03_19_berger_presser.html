<p id="00:00">
Good afternoon, I appreciate you all being here today. The primary
purpose of our being here is to announce the filing of Senate Bill 361.
Senate Bill 361 is the Excellent Public Schools Act 2013. The days of
accepting a broken education system in North Carolina are over. We must
continue to demand better and positive change for our kids. That’s why
last year the General Assembly passed major education reforms to
strengthen student literacy, improve graduation rates, reward effective
teachers, eliminate the cap on the number of public charter schools and
give parents the tools they need to make better informed education
decisions about their children. There is still work to be done, that’s
why we’re introducing the second major education reform package to build
on the positive changes we made last year. This Bill has five major
components: The first, it will strengthen student literacy. It’s a
proven fact that being able to read by the beginning of 4th grade
dramatically improves a student’s opportunity and chance of finishing
high school and having success in their educational career. Senate Bill
361 strengthens teacher education programs, licensure requirements and
professional development, with an increased emphasis on improving
student’s reading skills. Senate Bill 361 also continues our effort to
increase literacy by allowing state employees to volunteer, during
business hours, in public schools reading for up to 5 hours per month.
The second major component is to maximize instructional time, testing is
important but we must ensure that students master their subject first.
Traditionally, and this is up to this school year, the last 22 days of
the school year were available for end of grade testing. In the
2012-2013 year, the last 15 to 20 days are available. Senate Bill 361
reduces that to the final 10 instructional days for end of grade or end
of course tests for year long courses and the final 5 days for semester
long courses. There is an exception for students who have IEP
requirements or for those who are taking AP or International
[Baccalaureate] exams. The 3rd major component of the Bill is to
increase accountability and reward effective teachers. Our current
system, in many respects, rewards mediocrity, punishes excellence by
granting unlimited job security to all who teach a few years. Senate
Bill 361 will immediately boost accountability by doing several things.
First, it will eliminate a career status for any teacher who has not yet
achieved career status. Any teachers in the 1st 3 years of teaching,
Senate Bill 361 will eliminate career status. The second thing that it
does, is for all teachers who have taught 3 or more years, between the
passage of the Bill and the end of December of this year, it will offer
LEAs’ the opportunity to grant those teachers contracts of 4 year
duration. The LEAs’ are encouraged to move through an evaluation process
and determining the excellent teachers they have on staff and they will
have the authority to offer those teachers 4 year contracts, between now
and the end of the year. If a teacher is not offered a 4 year contract,
then that teacher will continue in the status that they’re currently in,
through the end of 2014 school year. On June 30th 2014 career status
will be eliminated for all teachers and at that time the LEAs’ will have
the authority to offer 1 year, 2 year, 3 year or 4 year contracts based
on evaluations and based on local decisions for teachers that have
taught for more than 3 years. Teachers with less than 3 years of
teaching experience will still be on 1 year contract. One of the
critical things that we have to do and one of the things Senate Bill 361
does is continue the work towards a comprehensive and adequate teacher
evaluation tool that will provide the LEAs’, provide the teachers and
provide the parents with a fair measure of whether or not a teacher is
actually a success in the classroom and is improving students</p>

performance.  That evaluation tool is critical for our ability, for the
???LEA's ability, to make decisions on whether or not to award multi
year contacts.  That evaluation tool is also a critical component of us
being able to move to a pay for excellence plan and to really reward
those teachers who excel in the classroom.  The fourth component of the
bill is to give parents the tools to make better informed decisions.  As
you know, the Excellent Public School Act, or the portion of it that
were enacted last year, moves the grading of schools from the system
that has been in place where you have honor schools of excellence and
schools of distinction and schools of progress and nobody really knows
which is a good one and which is a bad one to taking the same 100 point
scoring system and converting that to an A-F scale.  That scoring system
is in effect for the schools at the end of this year and what we do is
we expand on that by also evaluating schools on whether they exceed,
meet, or fail to meet student achievement growth goals.  Together, those
two measurements will
foster greater transparency, encourage struggling schools to improve and
allow parents to determine the best options for their children.  The
fifth component of the bill, Senate Bill 361, requires the Department of
Public Instruction to review the quality and value of common core,
smarter balance consortium assessments when they become available and
obtain approval from the General Assembly before purchasing or
implementing those common core, smarter balance consortium assessments.
This could relieve teachers from the burden of learning yet another new
test and also save taxpayers money.  The bill was filed before the press
conference.  Copies will be available from the Clerk's office and should
be available on the internet at this time.  At this point, I would be
happy to take your questions.  Scott?

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I think this time will be different because this is a different
General Assembly and the problems still exist.  There are things that
need to be done to deal with the tenure issue.  The public wants us to
address the issue; it is critically important for us to do that in order
to ensure that we do everything
that we can to make sure that our kids have a highly qualified teacher
at the head of the classroom.  We have known for years that the one
thing that does the most for improving student performance is to have a
high quality teacher in the classroom.  It is our belief that by
allowing the LEA's to offer teachers contracts ranging from one year to
four years and to allow them to offer their best teachers four year
contracts at the outset, will improve the ability that we have to put
that great teacher at the head of the classroom.  We have tens of
thousands of great teachers in North Carolina and we want to make sure
that those teachers are rewarded with the security of multi-year
contracts and are ultimately rewarded with the opportunity to earn pay
for excellence once we can get the evaluation tool where it needs to be.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The bill, last year, or the provisions of the budget bill last year,
allowed for LEAs or DPI to come back to us with ideas and suggestions on
the pay for excellence or the pay for performance and I believe that is
due to come to us sometime in April of this year and we look forward to
seeing the recommendations that we receive from the LEA and DPI and hope
that that will help us move in that direction.  I don't want you to
monopolize it; okay, here we go, Kelly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Couldn't hear audio???
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is a very complicated process and as you know, DPI has been working
for a good period of time to work on an evaluation tool and of course
what you have to have in an evaluation tool, you not only have to
evaluations, or peer reviews, supervisor reviews, parental reviews
maybe, student reviews, but there needs to be</p>

the component where objective data is available. Everyone needs to have
confidence that the evaluation tool is one that's fair to the teachers,
fair to the kids, fair to the administration, fair to taxpayers. We've
not gotten there yet. A lot of states are struggling with exactly the
same thing. I think that the tool that DPI's currently using is better
than what they've had in the past, but it still isn't quite there.
Barry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There are some funding, some expenses for these provisions. I don't know
that I have the costs  that I can tell you now. As you know, we're
hopefully later this week going to hear from the governor as to his
budget proposals, and we'll be working through the budgetary aspects of
this and everything else as we go through the next weeks and months.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Basically we're looking to continue to work on that particular issue.
Presently, we have as I said, a tool that's better than what we've had
in the past. One of the struggles we have at this time, as I understand
it as part of the arrangements that were made by Gov. Perdue and DPI to
draw down some rates to the top dollars. Any modifications to the tool
will require approval or at least a signoff by the Federal Government,
and that's one of the challenges we're going to have modifying or at
least making improvement. Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? he asked about more money ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It would be my understanding, and my thought that to the extent that
we're paying for excellent, that it would be additional dollars for that
and I don't see there being any push for actually reducing the dollars
the teachers are currently making.
Gary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can you envision a situation where the days of flat raises for everyone
would be gone ?? other teaches who are doing well get more?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Now I would, this is just my thoughts on it, what I would say is a pay
scale that would be similar to what we have now in terms of paying folks
for the length of time that they've been serving as teachers,  there
being some sort of a structure for a bonus a salary supplement or
something of that nature based on teachers who are actually performing
above and beyond. Now that's my thought of it, but how we get there from
here is a path that's not quite at the present time fully mapped out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? do you also see ?? now I want you ?? getting teachers to ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think it can be. You know what, teaching is a profession but like a
lot of other jobs, human nature will work its way into any dynamic. And
what we're concerned about is the incentives that are out there, and
trying to make sure that we have incentives for folks to excel as much
as possible. The first part of your question, the perception of
problems, I can just tell you the feedback that I'm getting from
parents, feedback I'm receiving from school personnel, feedback I'm
getting from volunteers who want to work in schools about the continuing
problem of there being teaches that really are not helping students, and
we need to have teachers who are helping. Now is that a large number of
teachers? I don't think so. I think it's a very small number of the
teachers that we have. But if it's one teacher, and it's a teacher
that's teaching you child, it's a huge problem.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]You know, when we introduced the Excellent Public
School's Act, Senate Bill 795, last year, once of the things we did, we
sent requests for information, sent packages of information to the
superintendents all over the state, requesting feedback.  We got some
feedback from some.  We, individually, the members of  the pro tem
staff, individual members of the Senate, have spent a good bit of time
talking to our local school teachers, our local administrators,
administrators from various districts around the state.  It's been more
of an informal process as opposed to any kind of day for this, or day
for that.  Question?  You can quote me on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Anything else?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]You know, we all have a deep concern for the safety of
the kids and the professionals at our schools, and we want to do
everything we can to make sure the schools are a very safe place for
students, for parents, and for employees.  I have not had an opportunity
to review that proposal.  Obviously that, as well as everything else in
the budget will be looked at, but we are interesting in taking steps to
the extent that steps are needed to make our schools safe, and it may be
that the Governor's proposal is something that we'll find common ground
with.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]It should be in the Education Committee within the next
couple of weeks, I would think, but it may take a little longer for us
to get there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]There are some fiscal implications to it.  There should
be some data we'll get to you soon as we have the numbers.  We may have
it now.  I know that I've seen some information but I don't have it in
front of me, it's not part of the packet that we've released.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I think the first thing is, it depends on what he
recommends.  But we are interested in the suggestions and the proposals
that Governor McCrory will make.  Does he offer some structural changes
in terms of how we build the budget?  Does he offer some different ways
to move money into places of need?  what does he do with Medicaid,
because that's something we've struggled with a number of years?  So, we
are interested in what he has to say.  Obviously like anything else,
once it gets to the Senate, we will put our print on it, and whether or
not that changes it a lot, or leaves it pretty much as it is, sort of
depends on how the members feel about some of the proposals that the
Governor makes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I have not.  Our appropriations folks have had an
opportunity to speak with the Governor's people over the course of the
last months, since the beginning of the year.  Those discussions, I
would describe as more 'where are you', scheduling kinds of things, but
I do think that there have been some substantive 'we're thinking about
doing this', 'what did you all do about something else'.  There's been
some exchange of information, but nothing that I would describe as
writing the budget in cooperation at this time, with the Governor.  We
hope that that''s what the will be the case as we move along.</p>
