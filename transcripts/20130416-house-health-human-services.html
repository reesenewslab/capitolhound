[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opening house comity.
This bill is a result of a study comity that representative Murray and I
did after several meetings we came up with this bill. It is a consensus
item from all the members its one of those things thats nice when you
have a study comity. And at the end everybody seems happy with what
you've done its pretty simply it basically does exactly what it sets out
there. It sets up the department of health and human services to work
with the North Carolina medical board to develop rules dealing with the
release of pathological materials. For instance, if you ended up having
cancer surgery and and they pulled out a part of your esophagus and they
saved it at a lab and it was later needed. It deals with how thats
transferred at times that will ?? suits result from things or theres
potential discoveries that happen later. How do labs then share this and
make sure the material is not destroyed thats what this deals with. We
don't currently handle that very well and this sets up a protocol for
making that happen and I would just appreciate your support of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any questions from members of the comity?

programs senator ?? to present the bill.
Welcome to community house senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mr Chairman, its almost like a home coming. Thank you very
much for being here today. And I want to introduce senate bill 336 to
you collaboration among state diabetes programs. Representative Murray
and myself, he must stay a busy man 'cuz he was just mentioned with
senator Goosby's bill. Representative Murray and myself were, were
chairing a diabetes task force in the last session and we heard a lot of
reports from people all across the state, people who know that diabetes
is not only a state wide issue but a national issue. It imposes so many
bad things on people and their families, and their income, that we need
to do something about it. And he and I were firmly convinced that we
should and this is probably one small step that could be taken and he
filed a bill which is identical to this, to the original bill here,
before you, and mine has landed over here so I am going to just briefly
add a little bit more to it. There are three......[end of recording]</p>

<p id="05:00">
There are agencies in our state that have quite a bit of plans already
developed for the populations they serve as far as diabetes is
concerned. The division of medical assistance,the diabetes and control
branch of public health and the state health plan under the division of
the state treasury,these three deal with diabetes all the time and so
this bill merely says that they should continue to emphasize diabetes
and up the ante on diabetes so that the patients who suffer from
diabetes will have all the options and all the information that is
possible to attain and from that we hope we will have a much more robust
plan of attack on diabetes among our citizenry. So I would appreciate
the support of this bill. Any questions from members of the committee?
Representative Insko? Thank you Mr Chairman. This is very similar to a
bill we had last week that had more collaboration among these three
agencies on all of the chronic illnesses. I asked the question then
about the involvement of Community Care of North Carolina. The division
of medical assistance now contracts with Community Care of North
Carolina to manage our medicaid population and diabetes was one of the
first diseases that they tackled so I think this is a good bill. I'm
curious about whether or not the division of medical assistance is
mentioned here because its the agency that contracts with CCNC and that
you don't anticipate that there could be any changes in what CCNC is
directed to do. I see that CCNC has developed these proposals and
implemented them pretty much independently of any direction from CCNC so
I'm curious if there will be any change in direction from the division
or whether you know anything about that or not. I don't really know
anything about that however, I would think that there sould be no
obstacles thrown  up in the way of getting information out there to our
diabetes sufferers. Those that even don't know they have the disease.
Well I think it makes a lot of sense. This is a pretty big endeavor and
all of the divisions of our health care system are under a lot of
pressure right now. It makes a lot of sense to take one chronic illness
and get that right first so if this bill passes it would be used as a
model before we move to the entire scope of the other bill. Rep Thank
you Mr Chairman. Thank you Mr Pike for bringing this bill forward. It
was perfect timing.  Sir? One more time.To approve senate bill three
thirty six. ??? Representative Grism moves for a favorable with referral
to appropriations.. All those in favor say aye. Those opposed? Ayes have
it. Motion passes and the bill will be sent to appropriations. Thank you
Senator. Thank you members. That completes the agenda for today. Watch
your emails. We'll probably be in the other building next time around
for a two hour meeting. Were starting to get a lot of bills in the
committee and we want to make sure we make the crossover deadline. This
meeting is adjourned. Thank you.</p>
