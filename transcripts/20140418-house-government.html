Order in the court. Members, please have your seats. Ladies and
gentlemen in the gallery, please turn off all cell phones, any other
device that might be a disruption. Everyone, welcome to the government
committee. I'd like to welcome our pages this morning, Ms. Ivy Burgess
from Lee County, sponsored by Representative Stone. Good morning, Ivy.
Collin.. Draham? Did I say that right? Drahn, okay, from Duplin,
sponsored by Representative Dixon, and Adam Rydel, from ??? county,
sponsored by Representative Jones. Did I miss any pages? Our Seargent of
Arms today is Young Bay. Bob Rossi, Doug Harris, Martha Gaddison, and
Carl Morello are staff today. Erica Churchill, Shelly Theatter, Kelly
Quick, and Shara Graham on the front line.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentleman, our first bill this morning is House Bill 636. The
chair will try to follow the agenda as it is today. The creek name
change, Representative Alexander, you have the podium.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. This is a bill that
essentially changes the, or directs, a committee, within state
government to request that the federal government that handles names of
geographical entities make sure that this name is corrected from the
inward creek to steward creek. The commissioners in, I'm sorry, Salem
creek, the commissioners in Union county some 28 years ago passed a
resolution to make the name change. There seems to be some controversy
as to whether or not it was ever done, and I would..
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Alexander, if you'd hold for just a minute.
Representative Collins, did you have a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I'd like to make a motion to ??? time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, are there any questions for the bill sponsor?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
None.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I see no questions, Representative Collins, you're recognized for a
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd like to make a motion to give a favorable report to House Bill 636.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All in favor, please say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed say no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The ayes have it. Thank you, Representative Alexander. Our next bill is
House Bill 238, Representative Cleveland will cheerfully present the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. House Bill 238 is coming forth in its design to
help protect the physical health of the North Carolina water and sewer
systems. It'll establish criteria for the local government commission to
take over and actually run if necessary local government water systems
if they get into trouble. There are three things, one of three things
have to happen over a period of three consecutive years: experience a
negative working capital; experience a quick ratio of less than 1.0, the
quick ratio is their ability to pay their bills.. if it gets less than
one, they're in trouble; and experience a net-loss of revenue in the
enterprise system using the modified accrual budgetary basis of
accounting. There have been, I believe, about four systems that the
local government commission has had to take over, and presently there's
about 18 to 20 systems that are experiencing difficulty, and this is a
proactive move to make sure that before these systems become defunct,
the local government commission can get in there, take 'em over, run
them, and make sure that they don't go belly up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cleveland, if you'd hold for just a second.
Representative Floyd?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, I think this is a good bill that</p>

Appropriate time
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, are there any questions for the bill sponsor? Seeing none.
Representative ?? excuse me. Representative Holly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Than you Mr. Chair. The question- After this, is there any point in time
that the entity can get it back? Or is this just.. is it permanently
gone from .. if the ?? has a problem?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, it is not permanently gone. Once the system is fully functional and
operational, it will transition back to the local authority
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brown
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. Just a quick question or comment. I believe the
treasurer.. this bill was at the treasurer's request was it not?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, it was
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is an excellent bill that will help us begin to get a handle on
debt across this state, and I totally support you and this effort, thank
you for running this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Seeing no other question, representative Floyd you are recognized for
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I move for favorable report of house bill 320-338.. referral ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There is no referral
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The referral has been stricken
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There is no referral
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Floyd you would want to mend that motion, there is no
referral. It has been modified or stricken, so the motion before us for
favorable report on house bill 238, all in favor please say Aye,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed say no. The Ayes have it. Representative Cleveland thank you
for an excellent job.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Our next bill is actually a PCS. Representative Hastings, are you..
There he is. I need a motion from the floor from representative Burr.
All in favor to ?? listen to the PCS. All in favor say Aye
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed no. The Ayes have it, representative Hastings, the floor is
yours.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you  Mr. Chairman. It is fairly self-explanatory to modify
internal auditing statutes and before I start Mr. Chairman, I would say
that Miss Baldwin from OSBM is here to help with technical corrections,
and so is our controller Mr. McCoy, if that is in order Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, and so basically what the bill does is exactly what the bill
summary says. We modified some of the existing language, and we also
addressed some of the experience required for auditors, and we also
added the president of the UNC system to the council of internal
auditing, and I will stand for any questions Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hastings, would you like your guest to speak first?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Who do we have?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. McCoy the controller and Miss Baldwin from ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, if you all please would sign in in the back, and then be sure to
push the button so your green light comes on. Identify yourself for the
committee please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning. I am David McCoy, I am the state controller, and let me
begin by saying thank you for your interest and support for this bill.
State auditor Wood could not be here this morning. She is traveling but
she wants you all to be sure to know that she is in support of this
bill. It is a very simple bill as Representative Hastings indicated. The
State Internal Auditing Act was passed in 2007. Since that time, state
government has changed somewhat, but fraud likewise has. We have
fraudsters out there that are continually trying to undermine our
business operations, trying to steal from the state. We also were trying
to promote efficient government and that's what internal auditors are
about. They do performance audits, they do financial audits, they do
compliance audits, and so at the request of the university system we
have asked that you add the president of the UNC system to the bill, and
we also included some teeth in the bill with regard to obstruction of
audit. You will notice that it calls for there to be a class two
misdemeanor if somebody tries to deliberately interfere with an ongoing
audit. Again, I appreciate your support and I will be glad to answer any
questions that you have. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. McCoy. Representative Burr.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a question for the bill sponsor if I could ask it at the
appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Now is appropriate
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On the council of internal auditing, what is purpose of adding the
president of the university system
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, if it is in order Mr. Chairman, I would also have Mr. McCoy help
with that too.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That would be fine Mr. McCoy if you don't mind
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman. The univer..</p>

[SPEAKER] the system asked that the President be included. They have, of
course, the 17 campuses. They have the internal audit functions at those
particular campuses. And they felt like it would, and I as the chairman
of the Counsel agree with them that it would be beneficial to have a
representative of the University system sitting on the counsel.
Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to make a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members do you have any other questions? We’ll hold on
to that motion just a second. Representative McNeill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have a question for someone. Is this correct that
it’s taken the Department of Construction out of the auditing?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, as the bill reads, it does. And, Mr. McCoy, if
you want to explain it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McNeil, it does not exclude the
Department of Public Construction. The Department of Public Construction
is a Counsel of State Cabinet, I’m sorry, Department. And, as you know,
from the bill it says that the Counsel includes all of the counsel of
state agencies.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Ms. Baldwin, did you want to speak?
Members, any other questions? Seeing none, Representative Collins,
you’re recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to make a motion that we give a favorable
report to Proposed Committee Substitute for House Bill 417 in favor to
the original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, we have a motion on the floor. All opposed
please say aye. [aye] Those opposed no. The ayes have it.  Our next bill
is also a PCS. I need a motion from the floor for Representative
Collins.  Representative Burr once again makes a motion for PCS. All in
favor say aye. [aye] Opposed no. The ayes have it. Representative
Collins, the microphone is yours.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] House Bill 427 is a very short bill. It does two
things. The first, if you will notice they have a lot of lines scratched
out. I told people before, my favorite type of bill is those that only
have things scratched out because generally we’re lessening state
statutes. But what this is, the town charter of Middlesex has been out
of date for a long time. And one thing we’re doing is allowing them to
operate according to their town charter by changing it to fit what
they’re actually doing. If you notice, on about line 15 or 16 there,
excuse me, line 13. This thing hasn't been changed since before 1909
because that date is mentioned in here.  They don’t have aldermen
anymore. They don’t have constables and a lot of other things that are
mentioned here.  So, that’s the first thing it does, it just cleans up
their town charter so it actually matches practice.
The second thing and the only substantive thing it does is on lines 25
and 26. That’s the last sentence in that paragraph. Apparently Middlesex
is the only town in Nash County that has a two year mayoral term. This
will change that to four years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It doesn't help the present mayor unless he’s
re-elected but it’s for the next election. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, can I interrupt here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Cleveland, you’re recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, do we have any questions for this intense
bill? Representative Mobley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I did one similar to this for my county. And, of
course, the concern that I had was making it effective upon when it
becomes law. And my concern was that it’s affecting someone who is
currently in office or does it? Tell me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I answer that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Now, if you looking on, beginning on line 24, the last
two words there of the last sentence of that paragraph, it says “in 2013
and quadrennially or every four years thereafter, the mayor shall be
elected for a four year term.” So, it has no, the past election that has
already occurred is not affected by this. It’s whoever gets elected in
the next mayoral race that this will affect.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Further questions? Seeing none,
Representative Cleveland, you’re recognized for your motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Favorable report on Proposed
Committee Substitute for House Bill 427 unfavorable to the original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You hear the motion on the floor before you. All in
favor please signify by saying aye. [aye] Opposed say no. The ayes have
it. Our next presenter will be Representative Dollar. We have a need for
a motion on a PCS. Representative Burr, once again comes to our rescue.
All in favor of the PCS, please say aye. [aye] Opposed no.
Representative Dollar, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee.
What this bill would do, is it would, it was a quasi judicial process
that was put into place effective 2010. It has been somewhat problematic
particularly for some of the smaller communities and it particularly has
hit APEX</p>

<p id="15:00">
Created some difficulties with them with some of their land use
planning, and what we're asking for in this bill is to exempt the town
of Apex, in other words, the quasi-judicial process would roll back for
Apex to what it was prior to 2010 and this would allow greater ability
to communicate, have communication, citizen communication between the,
particularly the members of the council and members of citizens on
issues that are land use issues that are coming before the board for a
decision. I think that this would be a good idea to do from the
standpoint of let's have an experiment. Let's see how this works, in
Cary. If  it doesn't work well, we can always say well, that's a failed
experiment. I think it would certainly help them out of some binds that
they've been in where the citizens had felt like other entities with
greater resources had opportunity to maybe have their voice heard more
in the process than maybe the citizens. And this is being asked for
unanimously by the town of Apex. Be happy to try to answer any
questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Burr, you are recognized for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just for a motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members do we have any questions for the bill sponsor. Seeing none,
Representative Burr, you are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. I move that we give a favorable report to the
proposed committee substitute for House bill 538, unfavorable to the
original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have a motion for a favorable report for the bill in front of you.
All in favor please signify by saying aye. All opposed no. The ayes have
it. Thank you Representative Dollar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you chairman, members of the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Our next bill is another PCS, on a motion from Representative Bell we
will take a vote on it. All in favor please say aye. That is House bill
548, the PCS on 548. And those are coming out to you now. Members, just
a, to give you some warning, the next one, two, three, four, five, the
next five bills that we are going to see are all PCSs too. Are there any
members who do not have the PCS? Raise your hand. Okay, Representative
Steinburg, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. Good morning. Ladies and gentlemen, the PCS in
front of you is really a very simple, this should draw nor ire or
probably, few if any questions. What you have in front of you is at the
direction of DENR. This is something that will save DENR about $28,000 a
year and basically, what it does is it's changing the opt in and the opt
out, and what we would like to see happen is that a notification an opt
out, meaning that you get an email notice before you request otherwise,
rather than an opt in. Meaning that you have to specifically request an
e-notification. So, this, they estimate, will save the state $28,000
just by this very slight change. So if you have any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cleveland, you are recognized ??

<p id="20:00">
-Representative Bell again. All in favor say aye. And opposed, no. We
have a PCS, then, for House Bill 659. Representative Moffitt, this is
your show.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Before moving into House Bill 659 I did want to
mention that 625 was displaced to next week, simply because some folks
from industry that helped work this bill very thoroughly last session
are not able to be present this week to answer any questions you may
have, and they'll be present next week for that bill introduction.
Moving to House Bill 659, it's a rather straightforward bill, and
essentially what it does, it takes the standards of conducts and ethics
that apply to us here in Raleigh as elected officials and moves that
downstream to also apply to folks elected at the local level.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does that complete your presentation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll be more than glad to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wasn't sure, Representative Moffitt, if you were looking for any
response. Questions for the bill's sponsor? Representative Moore, you're
recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Quick question for- in some instances, you have county
officials, like, say, of county commission serving on transportation,
regional transportation board, who will already have a set of ethics
that they have to adhere to from that particular standard. Are you
putting them on this particular standard that we're on as well, or are
they exempt from this because they're already city officials and they
already have another set of a code of ethics that they're doing by being
elected officials in their county or city?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One moment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley, would you like to take that one?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. Representative Moore, I think you're referring to MPO members
that are covered by the same ethics that we are. What this would simply
do is create or eliminate the conflict where county commissioners may be
covered by a different code of ethics for their own body, so that rather
than exempting them it would just bring the remaining members of their
body under the same report (??).
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cleveland?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I believe we just did something to remove
people from the requirement of the SCI because of the workload that was
happening, and now we're increasing the workload again. Has the ethics
folks signed off on this and said they can handle the workload?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Cleveland. Actually, this workload would not
apply to the state ethics commission. These economic reports would be
filed with the clerks of the board for which the people serve, so this
would be filed locally so folks could have access to it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moffitt? Did you want staff to address that at all?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, by all means.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think, going back to Representative Moore's
question, this does not change the current statutory requirement that
all county, city, and local schoolboards have adopt a code of ethics and
receive two hours of training on each year, or within each time they are
elected. It would say specifically that in addition to that, in any of
the other current statutory requirements they have that are criminal or
conflict of interest provisions, that they have to file a statement of
economic interest, but they do file it with their own clerk to the
board, not with the state ethics commission. They would also not be
allowed to use their public position in non-governmental advertising
that advances the private interest of that member or anyone else. They
could not use public funds in any type of service announcement except
for fundraising on behalf of public television, and they could not use
or disclose non-public information for private gain.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Ramsey is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, motion for, at the appropriate time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We'll come back to you. Representative Earle? Okay, that was easy.
Representative Ford? These just get easier all the time, don't they?
Okay, do we have any other questions for the bill's sponsors? Then,
Representative Ramsey, you're recognized for your motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr. Chairman. Motion for favorable report of House Bill 659 and
referral to appropriations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We want to be unfavorable to the original-</p>

favorable report to the PCS unfavorable to the original with a referral
to appropriations. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I appreciate you helping this
freshman make the appropriate lesson. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think we've
all been there. Alright, ladies and gentlemen we have a motion before
you. All in favor please say aye, opposed no. The ayes have it,
Representative Moffitt thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair
and members of the committee. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Kallan
here. Okay we're going to skip over House bill 646. Representative
Kallan may be joining us in progress. We'll go down to House bill 810
and we are going to handing out a PCS on that and a summery and we need
a motion from the floor. Representative Collins recognized for a motion
to accept the PCS. All in favor say aye, opposed no. So we have the PCS
for 810 handing out to you now. Where is Representative Bowles? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr Chair? Can I request - is this the end of the calender?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would you approach the podium please? Alright ladies
and gentlemen the Chair begs a members indulgence here. We are going to
comply with the bill sponsor's request to move him towards the end of
the agenda and we will go on to House bill 441. Actually we're not going
to do that either, I've been informed we're still working. We only had a
week to prepare for this. We'll move on down to HP545 in our search for
something to talk about. Representative McGrady are you present? Does
anybody want to take a shot at House bill 353? Representative Wilkins
you can't get out of this, I see you. Let's go to House bill 353.
Representative Wilkins. There is no PCS so we can move right along here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. Members, this is one of those add
a county to an existing list bills. Representative Baskerville is on the
bill with me in this instance Granville county would be added to a list
of entities being given authority to have leases, long-term leases,
20-year leases for renewable energy facilities in this instance a
private company is seeking to locate a solar farm on Granville county
owned property at the landfill and members if there are any questions
I'm sure Representative Baskerville would be more than happy to answer
them. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you. Have you identified an entity and what would be - do you know what
the term of that lease would be and the time - the length of time and
what details would be as far as how it would effect what you're doing?</p>

It, Representative Moore, it would be a 20 year lease which is the
standard and yes, there is a private company that is now in negotiations
with Randall county.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At the appropriate time, mister Chair, I see that this is a money making
venture.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Setzer. Representative Fisher. Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just had one question for the bill sponsors. And I wasn't here when
all these other deals were done, but, and normally I don't have any
problem with these, adding something on them, the only wording that
bothers me here, I see a couple of times is like down on line 26 and 27.
Without giving notice by publication of the intended lease. What exactly
does that mean? Does that mean we can, we're giving the county carte
blanche to slip something in on the citizens without letting them know
or, I'm just, and I know, Representative Wilkins, you're like me. You
like full disclosure. You're a newspaper man from way back, and on some
bills with me for that, so I'd just kinda like to know what that means
in this particular instance since I don't know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go right ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins, that, that is existing law, but I do know that
in this case, there is public knowledge of what is transpiring. The
community knows, although the community may not know the name of the
entity.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, are there any other questions? Seeing none, recognizing
Representative Floyd for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Chair, I move for a favorable report of House bill 353. Is this
going to finance, or?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. ?? with referral to finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right. Members, we have a motion on the floor. All in favor, please
signify by saying aye. Those opposed no. The ayes have it. Thank you
Representative Wilkins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chair and members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, we're gonna jump back up now to House bill 545, Representative
McGrady will take the floor. This is a bill that will be referred to
finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister chairman, thank you. This is actually a bill simply to make some
corrections in an occupancy tax bill we passed last year. Inadvertently
we have Henderson County, North Carolina. We've also got Henderson,
North Carolina, but the name ended up Henderson, and so it's causing
some confusion. And the other thing, as funny, Representative Howard and
Starnes fought a good battle over the designation of certain monies from
the, our occupancy tax, specifically to the flat rock play house, that
was in last bill's, last year's bills. The House didn't want it in
there, and lo and behold neither did the county commission. So I'm
coming back now to fix the bill the way the House wanted it. So we lost
the battle and won the war, assuming we pass this bill and we'll get it
back to the way it probably ought to be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins, you're recognized for a motion. What do you want
that motion to be, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd like to make a motion we give a favorable report to House bill 545,
referred to finance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. All in favor please say aye. Opposed no. Okay, thank you
mister, Representative McGrady. Thank you. Representative Ross.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In the absence of Representative Catlin I will, I can do 646, House bill
646.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, God bless you. Okay, if you'll come up, and I assume
Representative Burr is making the motion to accept the PCS. All in favor
say aye. Opposed no. Okay, we have the PCS for House bill 646.
Representative Ross is going to present.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman. This, this bill is pretty straightforward,
very simple. A couple of paragraphs. This is an act to prohibit a county
or a city from enforcing an ordinance that regulates the trimming or
removal of trees on property owned or operated by a public airport
authority. As a pilot, I can tell you there are places where you don't
like trees, and it becomes critical to be able to remove those trees or
at least trim those trees. And so it's pretty straightforward. That's
what this bill does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. Representative Cleveland, you are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members do we have any other questions? Representative Cleveland, you
are recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Favorable to the proposed committee substitute for House bill 646,
unfavorable to the original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members all in favor, please signify by saying aye. Opposed say no. The
ayes have it. Thank you, Representative Ross.</p>
