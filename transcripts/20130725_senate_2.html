  <p>The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
VIVA/Election reform. House Bill 589.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brunstetter for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We seem to have everything but Senator Rucho now. Can we stand at ease
at our desk for a moment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? Anybody seen Senator Rucho. Senator Rucho. Senator Rucho, you ready
with your amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Send your amendment forth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Amendment is forward and sorry, it should be on the dashboard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is it on the dashboard madam clerk?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho has the floor to explain his amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  I think everyone has it before. We shared it
earlier with Senator Nesbitt and Senator Stein and other members and
what it does in this amendment is one it reestablishes the criteria per
request of the Cherokee as far as their ID is concerned complying with
the law. It has a couple of technical clarifications requested by the
Wake County Board of Elections. There was a change we discussed with
Senator Stein, the formula we used yesterday on that bi-partisan
amendment dealing with a number of hours has been clarified and I think
is now clearly delineated and will be better understood by the  boards
of elections.
There is also a provision, some boards had asked us. We are holding 2012
hours or 2010 hours based on which day election is and that might be
more than we actually need so we offered them an opportunity to change
the number of hours by a unanimous decision of every member of the local
or county board. Once that is done, a request to the state board for
full approval by the majority of the….excuse me, full unanimous approval
by the state board of elections. There was a change in the issue of how
the check off funds were utilized. As you all know, the check off funds
are there, but the money comes from the state general fund to the
different parties. We are eliminating that, but we thought there was a
commitment made since an amount is due on August of 2013 and that means
half of that money goes to the parties based on a pro-rata share. We
decided the best thing to do was to live up to our obligation and let
half that money go and be paid as of August 2013 and then the remainder
of it, once this fund is eliminated, will go into the general fund and
there’s no guarantee, but there’s a good possibility that some of that
money could be utilized for the presidential preference primary.
Mr. Chairman, I’ll respond to any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Nesbitt for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if the gentleman will yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I apologize to you for not raising this earlier, but I just realized
what we were doing here on this last one about the tax check off money?
Isn’t that money that people checked off out of their money?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s not how the - I’ll answer that question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s not like you and I when we check it off. It’s not our money or our
preference, what that is, is that money belongs and it goes in to just
say the state will spend this much money towards the parties on a
pro-rata share, so it’s not a direct link.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If he would yield another question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The question that I’m asking is though, when they check off, they aren’t
saying give some of my state dollars to somebody else.

  <p>?? giving some of my personal dollars to this fund.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
No sir what they&#39;re saying by checkoff is I would not want you to
use this much tax dollars out of the general fund to do that.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
?? Alright thank you.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Ok.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Further discussion further debate on amendment eleven. Here none
question before the Senate.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Mister president...
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Senator Bryant for what purpose do you rise?
SPEAKER CHANGES:
You a little quick to trigger. I didn&#39;t know I was gon&#39;...I
don&#39;t want...Mister..
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Senator Bryant what purpose do you rise?
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Yeah yeah I wanted to ask a president mister president sorry.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Senator ?? Senator Bryant?
SPEAKER CHANGES:
No Senator Stein.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Senator Stein do you yield?
SPEAKER CHANGES:
I yield.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Senator Stein I don&#39;t understand this amendment. I&#39;m trying to
read it this is my first time seeing it. I see that they&#39;ll be
accumulative number you look at the total number of hours during the two
thousand twelve primary. In general elections and then it says something
about during a presidential year you would offer the same amount but
then it says something in two thousand ten and during the presidential
year...I just don&#39;t understand it. Can you help me...can you explain
it?
SPEAKER CHANGES:
?? please
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you. What the language does is it sets a baseline minimum for the
number of hours of early voting that&#39;s going to be required and it
sets two standards because the turnout is so different in an off year
election from a presidential year so it sets the standard for the off
year and then the minimum however many hours cumulatively sites were
open early and twenty ten and that&#39;s what you&#39;ll have in twenty
fourteen and twenty sixteen. The countys can clearly offer more and as
population grows I surely hope that they offer more &#39;cause not only
are their more people but more people are choosing to vote early and so
as the trend they need to keep opening up more sites. The same thing on
the president. For presidential years it said there was a baseline
minimum twenty twelve which was a big turnout year in North Carolina so
it says however many hours there were early voting sites over seventeen
days you have to have the same number of hours over ten days.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Follow up mister president.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Senator Stein do you yield?
SPEAKER CHANGES:
I yield.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Why does it repeat this language because it&#39;s hard for me to compare
and correlate to the original bill at this point, this quickly. Why does
it repeat the language about the presidential candidate in both of those
subsections that what is confusing to me.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Twenty ??
SPEAKER CHANGES:
In the twenty twelve section it talks about the presidential election.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
The...
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Then in the twenty ten section it talks about the presidential election.
Why would it do that? It talks about elections including the
presidential candidate in both subsections. I&#39;m sure that wiser
minds can answer that but...like do you...I&#39;m sorry mister chair
I&#39;m just following up ??
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Just give him a second Senator. I think he&#39;s trying to find your
answer.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Not having been the author on these words on this page...
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Sure take your time Senator Stein...no problem.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
I&#39;m not sure...I mean I think...If I can mister Tripp join me
I&#39;d appreciate that.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
That&#39;d be fine.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
We&#39;ll stand at ease just a second let them get the info.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you mister president.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Mister president.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Yes m&#39;aam?
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Rucho ask me to repeat the question.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Yes Senator go ahead and repeat the question.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
The question is that on page one in the section regarding the formula
the cumalative hours, on page one in lines twenty seven through thirty
two it talks about for elections which included presidential candidate
they shall ensure that at least the same number of hours is offered for
absentee ballots. And then when you go to page two where you talk about
the cumalitive number of hours during two thousand ten it still says
lines five or so down for elections which include a presidential
candidate the county should ensure that at least the same number of
hours offered in two thousand and twelve...do we need to say that twice
or is it something I&#39;m missing?
SPEAKER CHANGES:
?? Senator Stein are you ready for the answer.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
I am
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Senator Stein has the floor.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Senator Bryant is correct in there needs to be a perfecting amendment
which I understand Senator Rucho will be working on.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Okie dokie let&#39;s stand at ease a moment.

corrected, further discussion or debate on Amendment 11.

Mr. President, if we could just have a few minutes for it to…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
…do its thing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I mean I don’t have it on my thing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have it now, Senator Bryant.  Do you have it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I just got a circle turning and a white screen, circles turning.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Still turning, Senator Ford? Do you have it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m trying to read, I’m doing the best I can do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, can someone who’s, somebody, can we have the amendment
explained?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, would you explain your amendment, the change you made in
the amendment please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I will sir, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It reads for elections which do not, that’s the part you want to
clarify.  For elections which, it should have said, do not include
presidential candidates, that’s why we go and the county ?? at least the
same number of hours offered in the 2010 which was a non-presidential
year number. So therefore it ends offers that ?? ballots and so forth so
that clarifies your concern. Correct? Thank you Mr. President

  <p>On Amendment 11 for House Bill 589. ?? question for the Senate is
Amendment to House Bill 589 Amendment 11. All those in favor vote aye,
all those opposed vote no. You have five seconds for the vote, the clerk
will record the vote.
Senator Woodard, ?? aye?
OK. Amendment 11 passes by 46 in favor, zero in the negative. House Bill
589 as amended is back before the body. Further discussion or debate?
Senator Blue, what purpose do you rise for?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Will Senator Rucho yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho, so that I clearly understand this, if I
could call your attention to the actual version seven of the bill, page
50 lines 20-21. Relate to corporate money to political parties. In
looking at that, under the current law, you can actually take corporate
money for buildings. Am I correct that this changes it so that you can
also take corporate money to provide for personnel as well as operating
expenses for parties?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sir, our understanding on that is, that what we’re
saying, and primarily because of the fact that by eliminating the check
off money we’re trying to not injure any groups. So what we’re saying is
that you can use the money that you described for building funds and/or
nonpolitical activities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But this is allowing corporate money to be used in a
way that is now currently not allowed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, OK. Corporate money was always allowed to be
used in building funds, but now it does allow it to be for other
nonpolitical activities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up? Senator Rucho, follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] As I understand it, actually you can use corporate
money directly to hire up to three people in the campaign or in the
party headquarters. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Primarily nonpolitical, but yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Another question, Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho, you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] On page 52, lines…I think it’s page 52. It’s page 53,
lines 5-50…Page 53, line 5 through page 53 line 24. That has to do with
the electioneering communication period?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. What that is is the dates for when the
electioneering communication window starts. Rather than trying to go
back and say, “Well look it’s 60 days,” what we’re trying to do is make
it simple and say from that day forward. That’s what it means. There’s a
lot of confusion by having people subtract from a number. So we’re
trying to lay it out there so that no one can potentially get into some
problems.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up, Senator Rucho?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is it fair to say that when you choose the specific
date, I think here it’s September 15th, you actually enlarge the amount
of black out time? That is when you don’t have to have an accounting of
contributions or expenditures?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Blue, we picked September 15th as the day. You
can pick any day you want on that one. But what we were trying to do is
have a definitive date to say that’s when that next cycle begins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho, a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Logically then, September 1st would be as good a date
as September 15th?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. One other area I’d like to ask you a question
about if I may, Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The provision on page 54, line 50, relating again to
independent expenses…

  <p>And electioneering communications. That eliminates the requirement that
the top five contributors be disclosed, or top five donors be disclosed,
does it not? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No sir, not completely. Because it just
doesn’t require it to be on the media. They are still available and
documented accordingly. It’s just not on the piece of media. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Senator Rucho. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] But if you pair that with the last
question I just asked you about, the electioneering period change,
doesn’t it create a period in the Summer that is from the end of the
primary until the beginning of the next electioneering period, which in
this case would be September 15th, that there is no tracking and there
is no direct reporting of either funding or expenditures against a
candidate? A ?? candidate. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes sir. Our understanding and what we believe is the
independent expenditure committee will have to still make a disclosure,
and that same information will be readily available. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho, follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] As I understand it, Part 48 which is
candidate specific communication, that’s on page 51, that is a section
that requires that during a certain period that you list people who give
you a certain, give you over a certain amount of money. So for example,
so that you could know who is spending $10,000 against you, during the
summer lull. Is that not what that section does? It repeals the current
ability to know who’s spending against you between those periods.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My understanding is that the, we’re repealing that
because that information is superfluous for independent expenditure
committees, both political committees and independent expenditure
committees, so I don’t see that being a problem or any type of
contradiction. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Last follow up, Mr. President. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Rucho, follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Blue. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do, so you’re saying it’s not
your intention to create a dead period, that is between the primary and
until the next electioneering cycle begins. Electioneering communication
begins. So that somebody could spend an unlimited amount of money,
anybody, no restriction on the source, could spend an unlimited amount
of money against you and you not know who it is that’s spending the
money against you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. Senator Blue, that was not the intention and if it is, and if
it does, we’re not sure we see it that way. But if there is, we surely
would be delighted to sit with you and talk, if you have a solution to
what your concern is. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Send forth your amendment. [PAUSE] Senator Blue sends
forth his amendment. Read the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Blue
moves to amend the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Everybody have it on the
dashboard? Senator Blue is recognized to explain his amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. I’ll start in reverse order. I asked
Senator Rucho about the changes in the independent expenditures and
electioneering communication, and the disclosures that are required.
I’ve been informed that if in fact we leave it as it is in the current
bill, that from the end of the primary period, until in this case it
would be the middle of September, that there could be a barrage of
spending against you and this applies to all of us regardless of what
party you may belong to, a barrage of spending against you, unlimited,
no restriction on the source, and you wouldn’t know who is laying all of
this stuff on you.

  <p>And so this amendment would basically return the law to its current form
so that there would still be a requirement that people who contribute up
to these amounts. It&#39;s generally your top five contributors or
expenditures would in fact have to disclose it and you would know
who&#39;s spending money against you, I think those who&#39;ve been in
competitive races would be best served by knowing who it is that&#39;s
aiming at you and who&#39;s starting to spend huge amounts of money
against you and it would be helpful to know that before your sixty days
from the actual election.  That&#39;s the third part of the amendment.
The second part of the amendment would basically take us back to the
electioneering communication period.  Senator Rucho said it wouldn&#39;t
matter if it was September 1st and I agree.  I think that the earlier
you do it the better off we are.  The current rule changes it to
September 15th,  I think the general practice is now it happens
somewhere around September 7th but we&#39;re shortening the period and
what concerns me is when you shorten, you lengthen the period rather,
that somebody can spend between the primary and when the electioneering
communications kicks in again that you make yourself vulnerable, not
that you make yourself vulnerable but you make candidates vulnerable,
unreasonable.  So in the last portion of that is simply saying that
corporate contributions can be used to build buildings for headquarters
but it would restore it so that it can&#39;t be used for operating
funds. The bill as it is before you would allow direct corporate
contributions to be used for three employees in the headquarters for
operating funds, for supplies, for all other things relating to
operations rather than capital projects.  And lastly it does have a
provision too that says if you really want to sling something at a
candidate and you&#39;re a candidate you gotta let folk know who you are
you gotta stand by your ad.  If you want to say bad things you ought to
be willing to let folk know that your the one who&#39;s sanctioning
these bad things against other candidates.  I vote for adoption of the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Would Senator Blue yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Blue do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Surely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Blue we had a chance to discuss this earlier
where there are a couple of areas  that we, you&#39;ve got three parts
to your amendment.  We may feel that you have some validity on one part
of it.  Would you withdraw your amendment for the moment and have a
chance to speak with us about it?  Specifically on the one section that
is the blackout time and then the others we&#39;re not too distressed
over and I think you probably aren&#39;t bent out of shape over them
either but would you be willing to withdraw your amendment and have a
chance to speak with us on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Sure I&#39;m an accommodating fellow.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Blue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mister President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Blue has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Based on the request from Senator Rucho I would
temporarily withdraw the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Okay.  Senator Blue withdraws his amendment.  Senator
Stein what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mister President and members of the Senate.
 The core value of America is freedom.  The original immigrants who came
to our shore came because they wanted to exercise their freedom of
conscience. The sons and daughters of liberty who declared their
independence from the crown.  They did so because of a simple
proposition, that to secure our inalienable rights governments are
instituted among men driving their just powers from the consent of the
governed.  They risked everything for their right to vote for their
government and we in the world are forever grateful.  Voting is our most
fundamental freedom.  It is the basis of our representative democracy
and much of our political history has been struggling over expanding
that right to suffrage to more and more people. The post civil war 14th
and 15th amendments, they guaranteed the right to vote to all men above
the age of 21 including African-American.  A right that they have for
about a quarter of a century.  Women achieved their hard earned right to
vote with the passage of the 19th amendment in 1920. In the 1960&#39;s
with both the 24th amendment, eliminating the poll tax and the voting
rights act

  <p>Right to vote that existed on paper for African Americans became real.
Finally in 1971 we guaranteed the Right to every young adult of age 18
or more. Yet even with all these developments, because of our states
legacy of disenfranchisement and discrimination, North Carolina ranked
among the worst states in civic participation throughout the entire 20th
century. The general assembly addressed this deficiency with a number of
reforms to remove obstacles and barriers to participation. We passed
laws to allow absentee ballet voting for people who couldn’t be there on
election day, and they have continually made that process easier. In
2010, I mean, in 2012, 218,000 people voted in North Carolina, Absentee.
Early voting was enacted in 1997 providing more people more convenient
times to cast there vote because some people were working on Tuesday.
Last election, 2.5 million North Carolinians voted early. North Carolina
enacted same day registration because they knew that some people weren’t
registered and may not have it on the top of mind to register in advance
before election day. In 2012, 100,000 people voted registering the same
day. We as Legislator passed preregistration for 16 and 17 year olds so
that they can preregister, and when they turned 18 they automatically
got their card. 50,000 kids have preregistered so that they could
participate in the democratic process. These reforms have benefited the
people of North Carolina and here’s the fact, in 1988 only 45 percent of
voting age adults cast a ballet for president. North Carolina ranked
48th in the nation in civic participation. Just 24 years later in 2012,
65 percent of the voting aged people in North Carolina voted for
president, and now we’re ranked 11th in the nation in terms of peoples
participation in choosing their government. Do I have to tell ya’ll that
that is a good thing? When people vote they take greater ownership of
their government. They become invested in their society. The more people
who vote the greater legitimacy of that government. Because everybody
has voted not one can complain that the government is not truly a
representative of the people. To impinge on people’s right to vote, to
limit their liberty is to undermine government, and it is wrong. Yet
this bill does precisely that in a host of ways. It started out as a six
section bill. On Monday night, we got it over night, it had grown in to
a 60 page election bill monstrosity. Senator Nesbitt talked about the
bill yesterday and he actually said something where I disagree. He said
he couldn’t find a single provision that actually made it easier for
people to vote. I went through the bill, counted about 20 provisions
that affect peoples right to vote in measures large and small. I
actually came up with one. Ya’ll make it easier for people to vote
Absentee and that’s a good thing I supported. Every other provision in
this bill has the effect of reducing peoples participation in choosing
their government. The bill eliminates preregistration of young people.
As I said, 50 thousand a year are doing this. The idea is that they has
Civics class in highschool, they get excited about government, and they
preregister. We want kids to take Civics but when 50,000 of them want to
exercise and put into practice their Civic obligations, we’re saying to
them, “You can’t do that anymore.”  I asked Senator Rucho, “Why are we
doing that to our young people?” His answer was that he and his son were
confused by a letter they had received. I am sorry, but that is a sorry
reason to keep young people from registering to vote. We gave you a
chance to fix this yesterday, and you voted on party lines to eliminate
preregistration, denying young people and easy opportunity in Civics
class to become Civic Participants. The bill ends Same Day Registration.
In the last election 100,000 people did this.

  <p>That is fantastic. You know why we instituted registration before the
election, it was done by Democrats
in the late nineteen hundreds to minimize the participation of African
Americans in the election. By eliminating same-day registration,
y&#39;all are going back to that sorry old history that we should not
embrace. It also hurts young people, because young people are the ones
who as a cohort coming into the election process. So they go to a
college town, and they can&#39;t pre-register.  They&#39;re worrying
about settling into their dorm rooms, not  going to the county board of
elections. We should help young people participate. The bill shortens
early voting by a week. Nine hundred thousand people vote in that first
week. Two and a half million vote early. We discussed this yesterday,
and I think the amendment we passed, and perfected today, mitigates the
damage, but it is still a bad idea. Because we had an amendment by
Senator McKissick that would have ensured that on the Presidential
general election let&#39;s keep it seventeen days. But y&#39;all voted
that down thereby creating problems, potential problems for election
lines. Those problems are going to be dramatically expanded because
y&#39;all are taking away from the citizens of North Carolina their
option to vote straight ticket. It is an option. Nobody has to vote
straight ticket if they don&#39;t want. And yet the majority of the
people of North Carolina including more than a million Republicans said
that&#39;s an option I want to exercise. Two and a half million people
vote straight ticket. If you estimate that it takes about 10 minutes
more to complete the entire ballot rather than straight ticket, by the
two and a half million people who vote straight ticket, divided by the
sixty minutes in a hour, that&#39;s four-hundred and sixty thousand
hours more collectively that will be spent in the polling booths as a
result of this elimination of straight ticket option. You all are
substituting your judgement for that of the people, and that is a
convenience you should not deny the people of North Carolina. I asked
Senator Rucho what analysis have you all done to analyze the impact on
election administration by the combination of eliminating straight
ticket, and shortening election period early vote. None. None. We will
see what happens, and when there are long lines, that have the effect of
deterring participation in the election, y&#39;all own that. According
to the state board of elections which crossed-checked it&#39;s database
with DMV&#39;s, there are more than 300 thousand registered voters who
do not have a driver&#39;s license. A hundred and thirty-eight thousand
of them voted in the last election.
Because of this bill, tens of thousand of North Carolinians who have
participated in our election, likely will not. You&#39;re extreme
version of voter ID means that people who have a drivers license, but
have
forgotten the driver&#39;s license when they go to vote, have to do one
of two things, either they have to go home and come back, which if they
do, a number of people wont make it back. Or, they have to vote that
day, and then after the election then go to the courthouse to cast that
ballot. That happened in Indiana, in an analysis that I saw of certain
precincts, one out of thirty-two, one out of thirty-six of people who
cast those provisional ballots ever made it back to the courthouse. Why
if somebody goes to the trouble of casting a vote do we want to make it
harder and create another barrier for them to actually get their vote to
be counted. Senator Robinson offered an amendment that would have made
it absolutely parallel, the same process for identifying who you are as
an absentee voter, that&#39;s what we will put in place for in person
voting. The number of instances of absentee fraud, it&#39;s something
like a factor of seventeen more for absentee fraud than in-person fraud
when the number of people who vote absentee is a miniscule percentage of
those who vote in person. And yet, you all are making it easier to vote
absentee, but making it harder for people to have their vote count.
People who go to the polls to vote. That is wrong for the people of
North Carolina.

  <p>Disproportionately affect certain people. It will disproportionately
affect seniors. You make it more difficult to site satellite sites for
disabled and the elderly. Seniors are less likely to have driver&#39;s
licenses. The length of time that you&#39;re going to require everybody
to vote will make it longer to vote and longer to wait in line, will
have a disproportionate affect on seniors and the disabled. Young
people. We&#39;re losing, eliminating same day registration. You are
eliminating preregistration. Young people are less likely to have a
driver&#39;s license, and you, unlike Georgia, which we spent a lot of
time talking about yesterday, will not permit them to use their state
issued college ID. They have an ID, but it&#39;s not good enough. No, we
have to make you go to the DMV and get another document. We&#39;re
trying to create a step and then a step and then a step knowing, you
know, that at every step people will fall out of the process. That&#39;s
not democracy. That is not freedom. You will disproportionately affect
minorities. Minorities take advantage of early vote and in particular
the first week of early vote more than the general population. They take
advantage of same day registration like college students do more than
the general population. They disproportionately don&#39;t have
driver&#39;s licenses and the biggest instance where they do things
disproportionately as Senator Bryant talked about yesterday was trade
party voting. You wrap all of these election changes into one. In fact
it was in today&#39;s Washington Post, the Department of Justice is
readying their complaint to file against North Carolina when this gets
enacted because of its impact on the participation of minorities in
North Carolina in the electoral process and that is wrong. The only good
news about this bill is that when congress revisits section 4, which the
Supreme Court ordered them to do when they struck down the covered
jurisdictions in Section 4 is you&#39;re giving them a poster child for
what state, and not just 40 counties in North Carolina, the whole state
of North Carolina will be subject to be Section 5 in the future. Why are
you making it harder for seniors, young people and minorities to vote?
Might it be because these folks disproportionately vote democratic?
Might it be that? Yesterday Senator Tillman informed us how more people
voted in Georgia in 2010 than they did in 2006 after the voter ID law
went into effect in Georgia. What he didn&#39;t tell us was that in 2006
there was no senate race and it was an incumbent Governor running for
reelection. In 2010 there was an open Governor seat and a US Senator
seat. No one is saying that the changes you all are making are going to
overwhelm or underwhelm what happens in the main, but in the margins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It will effect the
outcome of elections. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman, what purpose do
you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Senator Stein will answer a
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will be happy to when I&#39;m finished
with my remarks. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Continue Senator Stein. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. I know you all love governing by
anecdote, but I prefer a broader view. In states with voter ID there has
been a resulting decline in the registered population of about 2%. In
states with voter ID, Republicans have done better by about 1.2% than if
they didn&#39;t have voter ID and Senator Graham gave us some quotes
yesterday from some Republican officials in other states who were a
little more frank in the way they spoke about election law changes than
perhaps they should have been. They said it was going to deliver the
state of Pennsylvania to Romney. It, of course, did not. I expect many
of you, my colleagues, are sitting there thinking well, you know,
frankly that might be true, but hey, the Democrats, they just made civic
participation easier because it helped them in elections. My
predecessors made these reforms because it is the right thing to do for
the people of North Carolina to make it easier for them to participate
in the political process. They did so even when it was to their
electoral disadvantage. The one area where Republicans vote more than
Democrats is absentee voting.

  <p>. . . you represent about 31% of the registered voters, but you are half
of all absentee ballots cast. Democrats have repeatedly over the last 20
years made it easier and less onerous to cast an absentee ballot. Not
because it was going to help you but because it was going to help the
people. The people have a right to participate in this political
process, a right that you are impinging. This last couple of weeks it
has become clear as day that we have different agendas, different views
for what is right for the state of North Carolina. Your budget cut
education in order to finance tax breaks for the wealthiest one percent
and corporations. You are pushing legislation --

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sen. Stein, I&#39;m going to ask you to stay on this
bill, not on others, please, thank you. Continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I am debating House Bill 589, which is about
participating in the political process. If you all had self-confidence
that your agenda was the right agenda for the state of North Carolina,
then let&#39;s open the doors to the polling place to as  many people
possible as we can, and the people will ratify it. But if what
you&#39;re doing is limiting who can vote in elections, then what
you&#39;re telling me is that you don&#39;t have self-confidence. What
you are doing is shameful, unAmerican, and shows clearly to every person
in the state of North Carolina whose side you&#39;re on, and it&#39;s
not theirs.  I urge you to vote against this legislation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sen. ??, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We&#39;ve got this bill which came to us purportedly
because voter ID was necessary to prevent fraud. So what do we have? We
have three pages about voter ID and 53 pages  -- 53 pages -- about
reducing access and subtracting options, making it harder for people to
vote. Fifty-three pages: Early voting decreased even though 10 million
people use it, and 75% of the voters used it and 86% of people approve
of early voting. Straight-party voting eliminated. Same-day registration
eliminated. Onerous requirements for those without driver&#39;s licenses
or listed acceptable listed documents. Eliminating the opportunity of
young people to register early. Not accepting university or college IDs.
Repealing judicial public campaigns even though 14 of the appeals court
judges asked you to keep it. Repealing your Stand By Your Ad for
transparency. Impeding satellite sites. Fifty-three pages when all you
said you wanted to do was prevent fraud through voter ID. So why
didn&#39;t you just stick with the three pages of voter ID instead of
making it harder for everybody in North Carolina to vote?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sen. McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This bill greatly greatly concerns me and disappoints
me. This bill really basically reverse decades of progressive
legislation that we&#39;ve had here in North Carolina that have
increased voter participation. I spoke yesterday about the early vote
period. It deeply concerns me that we&#39;re now decreasing it by a
week. I respect the fact that we adopted Sen. Kline&#39;s, excuse me,
Stein&#39;s amendment, but at the same time it doesn&#39;t solve the
problem. There are 900,000 people that won’t be able to vote during that
early vote period. And we look at the increase from 2008 and 2012. Two
hundred thousand additional people were voting. We look at the fact that
when it comes to early registration and being able to go there and vote
the same day, same-day registration. Same-day registration&#39;s
completely prohibited. We need to be able to encourage open people to
get out there and vote during that early vote period with same day
registration. We look at our students. We get them all --

  <p>All active involved in our schools through civic programs and other
programs, through our DTA’s and  parent organizations. Get them involved
in student voting, and we encourage them at 16, 17 years old to go ahead
and preregister. We’re stopping that. We want to use that opportunity.
Use those classrooms as a tool to get them involved in a political
process. We need to be encouraging all our high school students to be
able to get preregistered to vote. If we look at the fact that now, once
they get out of school they get out of school, they get student ID’s,
they can’t use them to go out there and vote and prove who they are.
That doesn’t make any sense to me.  We need to make certain that we
enhance their ability to participate in political process. There’s no
straight-party ticket voting that’s being done away with. Right now, I
guarantee the vast majority of people don’t know all the candidates
running for public office.  They may come out to vote for one or two
particular candidates that they identify with. That they support. Maybe
a Republican, maybe a Democrat. But what do they do? They identify with
one of the parties.  And they might vote that straight-party line.  They
don’t know all the down ballot candidates. Now we’re stopping them from
doing so.  That’s not a good idea. A lot of people need that additional
guidance that can come from that identification with a party. That
impacts all of us in North Carolina. And then the voter IDs’ them self.
An unnecessary tool.  An unnecessary obstacle that many people are now
going to have to overcome. You can say, yeah they can go out and get a
birth certificate and do it but now they got to make two trips and go
out there and get that birth certificate. Now they gotta get that voter
ID. It’s doing nothing but suppressing the vote. If we look at this bill
in its totality all about suppressing the vote. Trying to make certain,
that those who we may not want to see come out and vote do not have an
opportunity to do so. And when I look at it in its totality, and I’d
like to think that its design is to somehow to enhance integrity in this
process. But I’m reminded of the fact that North Carolina is not really
a red state or a blue state, we’re kind of a gray state.  And I’m
reminded of that fact that Obama went into this state by about 12,
13,000 votes back in’08 and he lost it by about 100,000 votes. But in
2012. And I’m also reminded by the fact that about 318,000 people that
do not have IDs that are government issues that may be adversely
impacted and not be able to vote. And I looked at all these measures in
their totality, and I can’t help but wonder, if the goal is simply to
maintain political power for those that are in power today. Not
withstanding the fact that we’re stepping upon the constitutional rights
of people, by not enabling and enhancing their ability to participate in
this process, as opposed to decreasing that opportunity.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak briefly on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein reminded us that In Georgia, an off-year election the vote
was not that much significant.  If you’re going to compare off-years
Senator,  you oughta take off-year prior to off-year before.  And the
increase was 44% among minorities, 67% increase among Hispanics and 12%
among whites.  Then if you want to take the next year, which you
conveniently forgot, 2012, you mentioned 2010 which was a national
election.  How about checking those results, and then you’ll have the
whole picture. You gave us a partial picture, which you’re good at. But
if all the Democratic talking points are the same, we’ve heard the same
things and not anything different, that were suppressing votes.  Folks,
we’re trying to guarantee that your vote counts. And I don’t think
there’s anything more important that we can do than make sure that my
vote and your vote counts the way it was intended to count. No ?? I will
not yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d like to see if Senator Stein will yield to a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m going to yield just like you did Senator. When I finish.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d be happy to wait.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’ve got a good bill. We’ve got a bill that ensures integrity to the
voting place. It increases voter turnout, and it increases voter
integrity and you keep bringing up voter ID as if it’s gonna suppress
votes. The fact is it increases votes in nearly every state that’s done
it. And I don’t know anyone, even minorities, that when they look at
this thing and say, yes I oughta be able to identify myself if I’m going
to vote. Even that polls in the positive for minorities. And about 80%
of the other voters say we oughta have photo ID so you’ve got a  lame
argument there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
See if Senator Tillman will yield to a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman do you yield?

  <p>
They all have something to do with reforming the electoral process and
by doing that the rules are going to be the same for everyone and we
have set the rules in place. But if we voted for over 200 years on one
day, and now we can&#39;t vote in a week, there is something wrong with
that and if you don&#39;t think enough about voting until the elections
comes up you haven&#39;t thought about the election much at all, and it
doesn&#39;t mean that much to you.
Its like saying I didn&#39;t register.We normally had to wait 30 days,
and now you want to cram everyone there on election day and vote them
and thats when you have all sorts of confusion and all identification
has to be verified and thats what leads to confusion and thats what
leads to potential fraud and were going to try to eliminate that.
Thank you Senator, let me take care of a couple of housekeeping matters
quickly.
Number one senator Mclawren is back in chamber and I also believe you
were here to vote on amendment number what was it 11 or 12.... it was
11, and I believe you voted I and you weren&#39;t recorded the machine
wasn&#39;t on and we are going to recorded I ( 47-0 ) .
Also just in time the nurse of the day here. Jenelle simpson from my
hometown of Durham, welcome and thank you.
Further discussion and or debate  house bill 589.
Senator Graham what purpose do you have today, ( speak to the Bib)
Senator has the floor.... thank you Mr. president.
On Yesterday I went home on after session and reflected on yesterdays
debate and one thing that I realized that I know every senator here has
a different background, different perspective, different viewpoints,
different constinuents. And I realized that two senators can take a look
at the same bill, read every word that is the same and interpret it
differently.
I stand here today and share my comments on this bill from my life
experiences as a African American man from Charleston North Carolina. A
mother who worked and was a domestic worker, working in the big houses
in Calhoun street in Charleston, and from a father who was a truck
driver. My perspective is going from the country as we would call it and
listening to stories from my grandparents about their experience growing
up as an African American in the south.
Hearing stories from their perspective as doing something as simple as
voting could be deadly. That is the perspective that I bring. I also
bring the perspective of someone who is fascinated with history who
loves to read and watch the old black and white films about World War 1
and 2 and Civil rights movement and other number of historical facts
about the world. Particularly interested in African American History.
So I stand here today with that perspective on this bill and this bill
to me is not about election reform, it is not. Its really not about
voter ID, if it was about voter ID, I might stomach it. But what its
about is systematically creating artificial barriers for those who are .

  <p>Those who are students creating an artificial barriers impeding their
right to vote. Senator Stein did a great, great job today outlining a
whole series of reasons why this bill is bad and I agree with him. And
from my perspective, when you eliminate straight party voting it
disenfranchises African-American voters who customarily vote straight
parties. There was a debate yesterday about vote for the man and not the
party. You can do that today. You can walk into the voting booth, take
as much time as allowed, and go down every race on the ballot and vote
for the candidate of your choice. You can do that today, with all the
change in the law. But to change this provision systematically
disenfranchises Democrats and the African-American community.
Early voting is wildly popular. Wildly popular. It has enhanced voter
turnout in major urban areas throughout the state and in small towns and
communities. But it has been very successful in the African-American
community. Souls to the polls. Folks who work different shifts, not
everyone has a job like I do with 8 to 5. Some folks work from 5 to
midnight. All type of hours and the convenience of having a 2 week
period to vote and cast a ballot is significant to them and important.
African-Americans and students and those who have trouble getting to the
polls use this time frame to exercise their constitutional right to
vote. By eliminating it and shortening it, it disenfranchises those
individuals and those particular groups. The pages in the room today,
many are 15 and 16 year olds who are here because they care about their
government and want to see their government in action.
As Senator Stein said earlier that, no, no, no, they can come here and
work, but they dare not pre-register to vote. Because somehow that’s a
little bit too complicated for them and their parents. North Carolina
has 16 outstanding public universities. Chapel Hill and East Carolina,
UNC Greensboro, UNC Charlotte, ANT Winston-Salem State. They all have
college IDs They may be different, but I’m pretty sure they all have a
picture, they all have the student’s name, they all have the address of
that student, and they all are a legitimate form of ID and should be
used in this process. But you say no.
Not only do we have fine public institutions, but we have flagship
private institutions. Duke, Elon, Wake Forest. Johnson C. Smith, Bennett
College for Women. They all have IDs. They all have pictures on them.
They all are eligible to be used. But you say no. This disenfranchises
students. College students and high school students. This bill is bad.
This bill is not about voter identification or voter fraud or bringing
integrity back to the voting booth

  <p>It&#39;s about limiting access, creating artificial barriers,
disenfranchising minorities and the elderly and students, and providing
a competetive advantage for the GOP.  Shame on you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate, Senator Goolsby, what
purpose do you ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One thing that was not discussed-- and I found an old
article I wrote back about the beginning of the session-- and it was
revealed to us in the press that there were eleven thousand voters that
registered during the last election through a system paid for by the
Obama campaign.  They paid about twenty-five thousand dollars and they
had the help of the Democrat appointee to the state Board of Elections
who thankfully has since been replaced.  Eleven thousand votes possibly
came in through the people that registered through All Points.  Let me
tell you how this worked.  People went online with their cel phone,
their  smartphone, or their computer, and they were able to take their
finger and sign a voter registrartion card and mail it in.  When these
started showing up at the Board of Elections around counties-- a large
number of them came in right after training-- and a number of the county
Board of Election members called the state Board of Election and said,
&quot;What&#39;s going on?  We got all these cards and they look like
they were signed by exactly the same person.&quot;
According to Mr. Bartlett and his counsel at the time, and only one
member of the state Board of Elections-- the other four didn&#39;t know
about it until about the time we found out about it-- after the
election-- they were told, &quot;oh no, you can take those.&quot;
&quot;But wait a minute, we just went through election training and we
were told you can&#39;t take computer online registration in our state,
there&#39;s a lot of problems with that and we dont know who these
people are.&quot;
&quot;But it&#39;s ok.  It&#39;s been approved.&quot;
That&#39;s eleven thousand right there that we caught after the fact.
How could that have been stopped?  Well, it&#39;s something called photo
voter ID, which 30 states have in the United States.  Almost every other
state here in the south has it.  And the Democrats sure don&#39;t want
it, and they&#39;re using the same talking points that were used in
Georgia back in 2005:  voter suppression, Jim Crow era, gonna reduce the
vote.  And we&#39;ve seen from Georgia that it&#39;s not done that at
all.  And we&#39;ve seen polls done by Elon College recently on how many
North Carolinians think it&#39;s reasonable to have to show and ID when
you go into the election booth.  72% of North Carolinians, over half the
Democrats in our state polled, said they&#39;d like it.  And the people
when they were polled, 97% of those stated they already had an
acceptable form of ID.  Now folks, those of you who were here last time,
you remember when we passed this bill.  We passed it.  Went to Governor
Perdue.  What did she do?  She vetoed it.  And you guys remember, the
same night, after she vetoed our bill she had a party at the
governor&#39;s mansion.  Guess what you had to have in order to go in:
a photo ID.  It&#39;s not a Constitutional right to see Beverly Perdue.
It is a Constitutional right to vote.  And to reasonably expect people
to identify themselves is not ridiculous; it&#39;s reasonable.  It&#39;s
what the people agree on, and it&#39;s what we should do.  And I just
wonder why the other party is so against making sure that legal,
authorized North Carolinians are voting.  That&#39;s a question we
should all ask.  &#39;Cause they sure are fighting us awfully hard on
what the large marjority of North Carolinians believe in.  Think about
it, folks-- what&#39;s reasonable, what do the people want, and why do
all these Democrat polititians not want it?  I wonder!  I just wonder.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Soucek, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President and members of the Senate.
Yesterday we heard
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh, speak on the bill, I&#39;m sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yesterday we heard Senator Nesbitt say he couldn&#39;t
find anything that would help encourage participation.  Senator Stein
went and scoured pages and found one.  Well let me give you two more.
Senator Tillman alluded to this idea.  I&#39;ve talked to people, I know
you have as well.  You talk to them on the campaign trail, you talk to
them in your community, and you ask-- they say, &quot;That&#39;s great,
it&#39;s really nice to meet you, but I don&#39;t intend to vote.&quot;
And you ask why and they say, &quot;I don&#39;t think my vote&#39;s
gonna count.  Why should I spend the time doing it?&quot;  Well we
increase...

  <p>Integrity of the election. When people say I&#39;ve got an I.D. I go in
it is who I say I am and the person in front of me and behind me and
everywhere else the person voting is who it says it is. That gives them
confidence. That gives them the encouragement to go and vote. I say you
disenfranchise people by the discouragement of saying we have an
electoral process that has a lack of integrity. I say that this
encourages people to vote and we see the evidence in other states with
photo id and it encourages people to vote.  The second thing a term
I&#39;ll call fractional disenfranchisement. What happens here is,
I&#39;ll give you an example: every-time you have someone who votes
fraudulently you diminish everybody else&#39;s vote who voted. You
believe in one person one vote. A fraudulent vote makes your vote less
than one person. I&#39;ll give you a small statistical example to
illustrate the point. You have ten people voting. Each person has ten
percent participation.  If one person votes twice or fraudulently you go
now eleven people that gives you a nine percent participation. Every
fraudulent vote which we heard dismissively there was only forty or
fifty that&#39;s kind of like blindfolding someone in a crowd then
swinging their arms around and saying hey there&#39;s only five people
in this crowd because that&#39;s all there is. That&#39;s what happens
when you don&#39;t have an open process, when you don&#39;t have
something to be able to look at and say here&#39;s how we have integrity
in our electoral process. I say let&#39;s encourage people to vote with
integrity with voter ID and I say let&#39;s every vote count because
your not being fractionally disenfranchised with fraudulent votes.
Thank You.
[Speaker Changes]
Senator Hise what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes]
Speaker to the Bill
[Speaker Changes]
Senator has the floor
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Mr President member of the Senate.  You know I have heard a
lot from the minority party about how much they expanded early voting
and how they allowed opportunities.  I wanted to let you know that they
did that within a period in which they also controlled all the election
boards in the state. So I stand here and tell you about the counties I
represent that out of the entire early voting time period had four hours
of early voting that did not occur between nine am and five pm Monday
through Friday.  Did not occur during working hours as they
systematically put it together and I will tell you that thanks to the
changes in this bill and some to the amendment that came forward.
Individuals working a full time job now will have for the first time the
ability to early vote in my area because it&#39;s forcing them to look
at hours outside of nine to five and the last Saturday of the election
to put it forward. We&#39;ve heard a lot about these straight ticket
voting numbers. I just want everybody to know that, that encouraged,
they are counting every individual who checks the party Republican or
Democrat not excluding the individuals who still go through the rest of
the ballot and mark every other election. Their counting anyone who
marks within the party affiliation straight ticket voting.  I think you
will look and you will see most of the blue or yellow or red handouts
that are given out at poll locations all over the state indicating a
parties nominee encourages individuals to not only vote the party
affiliation but vote each and every race that is coming forward
that&#39;s what&#39;s handed out that&#39;s what&#39;s printed and given
out. So of course a lot of individuals vote in that manner, a lot of
people believe that it&#39;s asking which party their in. Those results
exist for why people fill that out.  It is not the extensive time change
that is going to happen by not having people come in and just press a
button.  Cause you&#39;ll find most people just don&#39;t press a
button.  What I have looked for in this bill as far as election
regulations is it is time we begin to add uniformity to the system
across this state.  That we are starting to move to a time that based on
which county your in doesn&#39;t mean what access you have to the polls
and I think we have done great steps in moving forward to make it more
uniform across this state for how early voting exists and where early
voting sites are in doing this and I continue to ask for your support.

Thank you Mr President ladies and gentlemen of the Senate.  I&#39;s like

it and I mention that to you because you learn

  <p>When you were young and it was sort of emphasized to me when I got to
law school one of my property, real property law professors said,
&quot;You know the way you can tell whether and the way they go about
doing things if you want to divide land or do anything else, he said you
let them divide the land and then you let the people who are going to
receive it including the one who is going to divide it transverse. That
will keep them honest and keep them fair because you don&#39;t know
which side you are going to end up on at any given time. And so I warn
you about this kind of deal. Be careful of how you stack things because
you don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s gonna be stacked against you. And if
you were really interested and I think observing the fundamental I think
the most fundamental of the fundamental rights in this country, and that
is the right to vote. You would first set out by devising or creating a
system that is absolutely fair. Wouldn&#39;t matter which side of the
political spectrum you are on. It would be a system that if you were the
last one to choose, you would still get a fair shot out of it. Now, this
bill, and I don&#39;t think any of you can really argue it seriously,
makes it harder for legal registered North Carolinian&#39;s, legally
registered North Carolinian&#39;s, to vote. Now, I don&#39;t know what
you are going to do when you come back and start changing the
requirements for registration. You know we have a registration system
that has evolved over time. And I say evolved because when I was in
college the only way you could register was to go to the courthouse or a
specific person at a designated time, had fixed registrars. Then we came
up with the system of floating registrars, who could register people
within their precinct. And they would get the ID&#39;s and they would
register them. And then we came up with the system of floating
registrars that could register people anywhere in the county. And we
realized that if we truly believed in this democracy and full
participation we needed to make it easier for folk to get registered.
And so we eventually evolved to so that you could register with any ID
and send in your registration. I don&#39;t know what you are going to do
about having people legally registered. Are you going to require this
same strenuous system of ID before they register? Because if you&#39;re
not, you&#39;re creating a system of legally registered voters having
greater difficulty to vote than is justified. Now, I say that it&#39;s
the most fundamental of all of our basic constitutional rights. You know
the interesting thing is North Carolina joined the union after eleven
other states but after the Bill of Rights was ratified. And I believe
that we still place importance on the Bill of Rights. And I believe in
every single one of them, whether it&#39;s the second amendment, or
whether it&#39;s the first amendment, fourth amendment or fifth
amendment, Senator ??. But you know the interesting thing about it is
that we make certain presumptions about these other fundamental rights
in our constitution. We presume that you are innocent until proven
guilty. Most famous quote, the most famous quote, by one of the most
famous jurist in our country&#39;s history. Oliver Wendall Holmes says
it&#39;s better for 99 men to go free than for 1 innocent man to be
convicted. You know, we have a system that believes in these basic core
fundamental rights. We believe in the first amendment, that you should
publish anything you want to unless you come back and show by hard,
empirical evidence that somebody is going to cause harm. You have fire
in a crowded theater. But otherwise you can pretty much exercise your
first amendment rights. Establishment, religion, speech, and all of the
others. The presumption is that you&#39;re properly exercising that
right. Here in the most fundamental of all of the rights you are
adopting a presumption that everyone that wants to exercise it is
somewhere whether crooked, or somebody who is looking to break the law.
I ask you, what parent is going to spend twelve, fifteen thousand
dollars, or more than that now probably, sending somebody to one of the
state universities to get a false ID card? In fact, that ID card is
probably more reliable than any of the other ID cards that you&#39;d
come up with, because people are paying so much to get it. Some schools
you are spending fifty thousand dollars a year to get that ID card. If
somebody is going to forge that card, what are they going to forge it
for? To go into the cafeteria and

  <p>...to get a free meal? Are they going to forge it to go vote? They may
as well forge a legitimate card that you got here. It&#39;s crazy to
think that these forms of IDs are not legitimate. Let&#39;s get back to
the fundamental issue. This bill, I believe, goes further toward
undermining these fundamental rights and it&#39;s counter to what we are
and who we are as North Carolinians. The amazing thing is is that we do
adapt as North Carolininas. We adapted when you had to go all the way
down to the courthouse regardless of where you lived to register. We
adapted with all of the other impediments that have been imposed on
voters - not just black voters. We&#39;ve put impediments in the way of
average, working people that we ought not have to do. It&#39;s
convenient for people to vote at different times. It&#39;s convenient to
assume that when you take your kids... Kids voting is one of the most
popular things that happens here in Wake County. Where you take 10, 11,
8, 9 year old kids and show them what the process is. Many of us on a
national level have been involved in the process of the democracy
project and other things, where we get legislators to go into the
classrooms to talk to people, to encourage them to participate. Some of
you have done it over the years. If we encourage them, it makes sense
that we encourage them to participate and believe in this democracy of
ours and that what they do makes it stronger. I believe this bill
undermines this democratic process and it flies in the face of the most
basic, most basic of our fundamental values and that is government by
the people. That means the more people who participate in government,
the better that government is. That&#39;s why we want people to
participate, not to cheat, not to do anything else in the presumption
for it to be that those who participate are rightfully participating.
The burden ought to be on the government to show that they&#39;ve done
it wrongly. If they&#39;ve done it wrongly, let&#39;s do the same way
that we do when somebody has used a firearm exercising their Second
Amendment to buy, to own it. Let&#39;s punish the person, very severely,
who uses it the wrong way, but don&#39;t take away the right. I hope you
see how inconsistent this is with the way that we&#39;re dealing with
our other fundamental rights. Now, one of the things that I&#39;m
concerned about, and that&#39;s why I was trying to amend some of these
corporate positions out of this bill, because what we do is as much
governed by  perception as reality. Perception plays a big role in
political leadership and in politics. People perceive that special
interest. Big corporations, wealthy people have a special sway with
elected officials. That&#39;s why many of these laws that we have have
evolved the way that they have. When we put provisions in that makes it
seems like government is going to the highest corporate bidder,
that&#39;s what eliminates belief and faith and confidence in our
government. That&#39;s what we should be concerned about, not just how
it is but how it is perceived. I will tell you, when you start allowing
additional contributions, corporate contributions, in any form, then you
are letting people perceive that their government is open to the highest
and wealthiest bidders. I want you to look around the globe. Just look
around this earth of ours. Every day almost you see where somebody is
moving toward freedom because that&#39;s the natural order of things.
People overturned the government in Egypt again because they didn&#39;t
like the suppression that was happening. Every day people are marching
toward freedom. Who&#39;s the greatest example on the face of earth of
what freedom is, and who has been for almost 200 years or longer and
more so in the last 50 years? The United States of America. We are the
model across the country for a participatory democracy. That&#39;s why
it was so important to increase the number of people participating in
the elections so that it wouldn&#39;t just be something that seemed, but
something that is. Here we are, here we are now flying in the face of
that in North Carolina, making it more difficult to participate in this
democracy of ours, not giving the presumption of legitimacy to what we
do with our most fundamental rights. I say to you that, and I&#39;ve
said before.

  <p>Their arrogance and ?? are what destroys great nations. It’ll destroy
our great state if we think we got all the answers, and we think we know
it all and not willing to listen at other opinions and other viewpoints
because we know it all. It is the recipe for the beginning of the
decline of this state and our democracy. I have you know that I’ve given
you the benefit of the promises that you made because you’re my
colleagues, and if you say that the major thing that we’re going to do
is create jobs and expand opportunities then I take your word that
that’s what we intended to do. But I will tell you, when you look at
perception and you look at how people are talking about what happens
down here, you have to take a moment to pause to think that you don’t
believe that you’ve kept your promise, and somewhere of it you believe
that you have to do something out of the ordinary to make people believe
what you say. Let me remind you because nobody has mentioned it. You
have absolute control of the election machinery. The Republican Party
controls the election machinery in North Carolina. It’s designed that
way. If you think that something is going wrong at pre-sanctioned
polling places, you control all the judges, all of the judges, at
polling places who can put an end to it. You control Registrars. You
control every state board of elections. I mean every county board of
elections. You control the state board of elections. They’re the ones
who have expertise in the stuff and can tell you what ought to happen to
make sure that it still has the integrity. What I want to believe, my
friends, is that articles that I read and things that I hear aren’t
necessarily so because as you get painted, so do all of us get painted.
I’ll close my comments by sharing with you an editorial that many of you
may have seen this morning because it has a bearing on how people
perceive you’re behaving when you try to act, enact a bill like this,
and it talks about pay cuts for teachers or cuts of teachers in the
classroom. It talks about the tax breaks to the wealthy, and special
corporations are getting special treatment. But then it says with these
approaches to taxing and spending North Carolinians will be motivated to
vote in 2014, but Republicans have a plan for that, too. Those are not
my words. On Wednesday the General Assembly was on the verge of
approving the strictest voter id requirements in the nation, and it
didn’t even go on to talk about not just a voter id requirements. But
these ways that you’re rolling back the evolution of voting rights in
North Carolina and voting opportunity and opportunities to participate.
Does not talk about the way that you’re rolling back and putting
barriers to the election’s participatory process, but it says the
requirements are supposed to protect the voting process, but they’re
real intent is to protect Republican office holders. If there were any
doubt Senate amendments to the House Voter Id Bill make it clear. In it
delineates the way that you have not only dealt with voter id, but all
of these other things that we’ve been talking about, that’s what we’ve
been trying to tell you about. You know, you come to us. We could reach
an agreement on an acceptable voter id bill. All of us want integrity in
who votes. We could reach agreement on something like that, but these
other things are things that have evolved to make this democracy be a
richer, more meaningful and fuller democracy that gives great
justification for our Bill of Rights, our Constitution and even our
Declaration of Independence.  So I say to you that I don’t want to
believe necessarily what newspaper editors around the state are writing.
I don’t know whether the Wall Street Journal will write one or not, Mr.
President, but I do want to believe that as we go about this process
that we have integrity, that we’re not taking steps to enshrine
ourselves, to ensure that we stay in office, but that we’re taking steps
to ensure that this democracy which we all profess to love so much gets
strengthened over time, and it gets strengthened by ensuring that
everybody, a hundred percent of eligible Americans or North Carolinians
can participate. So I

To speak to the bill.

The Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, Mr. President and members of this body another
hit land this morning and I can’t tell you where it came from Senator
Apodaca I have to look for but it says what&#39;s the matter with North
Carolina, the state has gone from a beckon of tolerance to abstain the
voter suppression in one month and then it goes on to say that North
Carolina is proving itself to be the poster ___[01:21] for all that is
wrong with modern American democracy may the Senator Stam can hear me
found that but I thought it was so point yet because North Carolina to
me has been the place that we could see progress and we could expect
progress because it did begin to value all of the citizens and what they
could put in and I learn that as a student I had been at college, it
wasn’t been at college for woman then but when I came to North Carolina
in the mid 60s but then I also know the history and I wanna share with
you the history of voting and most of you know it too because you know
that in 1848 the Woman Suffrage Moment and it was black woman who
actually propel the efforts of white women to get the right to vote
because women at that time did not have the right to vote and men
thought that they should be at home, taking care of their children and
all of the other things and you all not to be allowed they are voting,
there was some black women who came in who helped and later on it was
black men that got the right to vote and they took to 1920 for women to
get the right to vote. I say all of that because the history of voting
has been something about struggle the whole turn and especially for
African-Americans, the part of history says that in 1898 there was a
voting during preconstruction era in North Carolina and you know that
because we did have legislators here, we had African-Americans who were
legislators but that was a smart white young lawyer who came from
Northern side and he is black so he have a right to vote. So, you all
need change this and so I started at Wilmington and they began to change
that because they did not feel that people had the right to vote. So,
the issues about suppression then went all the way from skin color to
the ___[03:42] tax and literacy and all of the other issues we have
heard about. But North Carolina has made tremendous progress and I had
been proud of this state and you talk about Georgia well I’m from
Georgia and I don’t know if anybody else in here is from Georgia but I
don’t live there and I was proud to come to North Carolina in the 60s
and I was proud to help to be a part of the changes that occur it.
Registering people to vote and it wasn’t just black folks who were black
and the white folks and everybody else who believe that folks had a
right, they had a right to vote, a right to select the people to
represent them. So, we work through and we began to do that and we got
and where folks can vote and it became a society and always say to
people they say, “Well, who has a different?” I said, “Because we
respect education and the educational institutions, we propel them, we
have supported and yes we may not be the highest in public education but
we have worked on it.” And we worked on it…

  <p>collectively to make sure children have opportunities and our
universities are some of the best in the country and they’ve helped with
that too. But now, what we see in the headlines is we’ve come full
circle and we are dipping all the way back. You know, they say that when
people are afraid they do strange things. Well, I don’t understand what
you are afraid of because the redistricting process made sure that the
districts were drawn in your favor and you can elect the people you
want. So, what are you afraid of? What is the reason for voter
suppression? Why not allow people to exercise their right to vote? Why
make it difficult? Voting for us, for the people I represent, has been a
struggle all of our lives, all the time. And it ought to be a time in
which you don’t have to do that. If we have to fight for it, we’ll
fight. But it ought not to be like that in this state and this country.
It ought to be that everybody who wants to vote, and you know everybody
doesn’t want to vote anyway, so I don’t know what you worried about
other folk who don’t want to anyway. But the people who to vote, want to
do it because they understand it is a constitutional right and it’s a
responsibility. Voting is a responsibility. It says that I am
responsible for electing people who represent me. I am responsible for
the laws those people are going to make. I am responsible for what’s
going to happen in my community, what’s going to happen at the state,
and even at the national level and if I don’t like it, I can vote and
change it. And people have done that and they will continue to do that,
so I don’t understand your rationale and I think it’s probably no real
rationale. It’s probably about power more than anything else, but
whatever the rationale is, it ought to be that people are given a level
playing field, are given whatever support it is, when elderly people
need to able to come in on a walker and punch one button as opposed to
twenty-five: that would send a person like my mother back home, or
someone else, and people in my community even in Pleasant Guard asked
about it the other day. Why do we have to do it? A lot of them are
Republicans and they vote for you. But they are used to coming in there
and pressing that one, one button. Why make it difficult for them to do
that? You know, you’ve talked about we’ve decreased times that they can
vote, all kinds of things against photo IDs when, when I was a student
at Bennett, my photo ID was a good as anybody else’s in North Carolina.
And yes, a lot of my constituents have been students sent to a private
college, but they have valid college photo IDs. And it is a college
recognized in the state producing some of the greatest women leaders
like me. And so, we have plenty of those and it makes our state rich.
Our colleges and our universities, our community colleges make our state
rich. And they propel economic development, so these students should
have the right to exercise their voting privileges. Elderly people
should have the right without barriers. People of color, if they are
registered voters, should have the right to exercise that. North
Carolina is becoming a place, and I guess it’s your desire to add to
whatever’s going on in the south. You talk about Georgia, well, I’m glad
I don’t live in Georgia right now, but soon I’ll try to find somewhere
else maybe, not really Senator Tillman, because North Carolina wants to
be like the other southern states that denies opportunity for people.
And North Carolina has not been like that. And I really think that there
are some of you in here, who don’t really want North Carolina to be like
that. You genuinely love the state like I do and you genuinely believe
that people ought to have opportunities. But there is something that is
almost dark in the air, very dark, that is turning the sunshine in this

  <p>A state that people want to live in and want to come to. This whole
issue of voter suppression is making it a state that folks, our
students, will not want to come to. I don&#39;t understand what
you&#39;re doing. You&#39;re going to do it, but I agree with Senator
Blue. It may backfire on you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brock, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak, hopefully briefly, on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And also to help Senator Robinson. That article you wrote was by an
online magazine called The Slate, by a Canadian, a left-leaning
Canadian, just to let you know. And Senator Blue, talking about control,
this bill will put the control back into the hands of the people. By
quality. With extended hours that extend for voting for those that work
third shift. Like my brother that, when the normal voting hours,
especially under a Democrat regime, was during his night time, would
wake up, go vote, to him in the middle of the night. My sister-in-law
was a med tech in a hospital, also working those hours. She&#39;s a
Democrat, but this helps her vote those extended hours. And looking at
it, opening up the polling places across the counties in equal areas,
not looking at it as targeting certain precincts that benefited the
party that was in control of the Elections Board, which were the
Democrats. And this will secure elections. Senator Blue, when you made a
comment about cutting up some land and then letting the people look at
it, Mama taught that to me and my brother when I was little. My brother
was five years older. Where was the cookie? She asked Neil to cut the
cookie and he did. One piece was bigger than the other. And I thought to
myself oh boy, I get a piece of that cookie. My brother grabbed both
pieces, put them in his mouth, and took off running. And that&#39;s
exactly the safety and security this bill will bring. Because you said,
well let things happen after the fact. Elections are on a schedule, on a
timeline. And when you allow people to break the law, bend the rules,
break the rules, Election Day comes and goes and it&#39;s over. What can
you do try to go back? We saw the issues we had in Florida in 2000. And
that&#39;s just not Florida. It happened in Chicago, many times. That
decided the fate of the nation because of who was going to be president.
They had the evidence. But Nixon decided not to challenge it, of what it
would put the nation through. It happens in ?? County in ??, city
councilman. Numerous people trying to break the rules for their own
benefit. We are a beacon to all other countries in this world. The thing
we have is to allow the people the chance to vote. It is our most sacred
right we have as this nation to vote. How many people have died for
this, to get that chance? How many Americans died on our own land? For
that vote? Of all colors? Men and women, to get that chance. And
whatever we can do to protect that from people that would subvert that
for their own cause. It happens now, it happened in my own district. And
it wasn&#39;t right. This will help protect the process. It&#39;s fair,
it&#39;s equal, and I urge you to support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is this the second time, Senator, I believe?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I haven&#39;t debated the bill. I asked a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Senator has the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I asked a couple questions. Thank you. I just want to make three points,
members, not to try your patience. The first is in relation to
straight-party voting. My precinct, I think, is number seven on this
list of the top 100, and I have worked in GOTV since I was a teenager,
and in my precinct and in the others and in the work in training I do,
we never instruct people to mark, we never have it on our flyers or
instruct people to mark the straight-party ticket and every candidate,
because that can set them up for

  <p>?? you can easily mark something...a candidate of the other party. We
encourage them to mark the straight party ticket. Only mark a candidate
if you want to vote for a candidate of a different party. And then vote
for the judges or the referendum or whatever else is on the ballot so we
never instruct that people...in my fifty years of working and getting
out the vote, the mark the straight party ticket and also every
candidate so I just wanted to clarify in my area in Eastern North
Carolina where I&#39;m familiar with getting out the vote. Second thing
I just wanted to respond to the notion that people who do same day
registration somehow don&#39;t care enough about voting to have
registered early to vote. Because in many instances people have are
registered but they moved or there is some other situation that has
their registration be out of date. And in my particular town where in
rocky mount is in two countys, you can move a block away and be in
another county and if you&#39;re busy and not paying attention you can
easily then be in the wrong county when the time comes for you to vote.
And our ability to change the address only applies if you are registered
to vote, if you move within the same county. Not from another county and
I run into so many people who have moved they&#39;re working two or
three jobs. Got child care issues and didn&#39;t meet that registration
deadline. Same day registration allowed them to vote so they care about
voting it&#39;s just the things they do everyday in their life kept them
from meeting that particular cut off date. And thirdly just to make the
point that Senator Tillman referenced well we&#39;ve been voting like
this way for two hundred years on one day so what&#39;s wrong with it
now well most of us are from groups and most of the people in the voting
electric are from groups that haven&#39;t been voting for two hundred
years. For some of us fifty years is about as long as we are from groups
who have a history of voting and our electorate is to tremendously
expanded and rightfully so if everyone is exercising they&#39;re right
to vote so that is the reason we need of these multiple strategies for
people to vote and just wanted to emphasize those three points. Thank
you.

Mister president.

Senator Farm?? for what purpose do you rise?
SPEAKER CHANGES:
To speak on the bill.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Senator has the floor.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you mister president I know it&#39;s getting late and we are all
getting tired but it&#39;s some things unlike Fannie Lou Hamer I&#39;ve
been tired of and this is one of the things that I think we have to take
time to debate and in two thousand and eight. I was the member of a
North Carolina House. And one of the proudest moments in my legislative
career was the passing of House bill ninety one. Which was then Senate
bill one ninety five. Which was same day registration one stop voting I
was one of the major sponsors of this of that bill. Today is one of the
worst times in my legislative career as I see the passage of this bill
that will dismantle that piece of legislation that created opportunities
and increased the opportunities for citizen participation in the
electoral process. And I heard Senator Brock talk about people fighting
and dying for this right. And that&#39;s true. Many people gave a lot to
ensure that we have a fundamental right as groups to vote. So today I
know the rhetoric as some of you all may refer to it. Maybe to you
rhetoric but what I want to say to you today is this is real. Voter
suppression is a real issue. And it&#39;s at the heart of dismantling
democracy in North Carolina. And I will say to you and I want you to
aware that as we pass this bill today. That we&#39;re in the process of
creating victims in the elderly. In our students and other minorities.
colleagues I would submit to you and I&#39;m gon&#39; cut short what I
was gonna say &#39;cause it&#39;s not gonna make an impact. But I want
to remind you that this bill is so totally unneeded it&#39;s
unnecessary...

Senator Rabin,for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes]
I can&#39;t resist because I&#39;d been listening for ??
[Speaker Changes]
For what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Changes]
I am going to speak on the bill.
[Speaker Changes]
Senator has the floor. Thank you.
[Speaker Changes]
Lots of personal opinions going on today. When I stand up and speak up
in this chamber, you&#39;d better believe I&#39;m speaking for my
constituency because that&#39;s the only voice that really should count
here. The provisions that I see aren&#39;t really restrictive. Like I
said yesterday, and we heard a lot today that we heard yesterday,
anyhow, these are the things that protect my rights and the integrity of
my vote. It&#39;s not in any way repressive at all.
When we get the point even about, let&#39;s have no straight party
voting, I think it&#39;s incumbent on each of us when we go to the poll
to know who we are voting for and most importantly why.
And unless you have that sort of a provision in there, I don&#39;t see
how that works out very well. You know, we all have our perspective like
I said before, and mine comes from considerably earlier where folks were
supposed to take the initiative to go after what they want. I do not
want a system, personally, when it comes to my vote, that models on what
I think I&#39;ve heard some people would like to have in here. And
that&#39;s the model of the American Idol where everybody can just dial
it up on the phone and vote for whoever they want to vote for or however
they want to vote, and we can&#39;t count who&#39;s voting how many
times.
I think that this is a good bill. I support it. Everything that I&#39;ve
heard from my constituents supports it, and I certainly hope everyone in
the room will vote for it.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Blue for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Change]
To send forth an amendment.

Court will read. Senator Blue moves to amend the bill.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you, Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, this
amendment simply takes a fixed date of September 7 as opposed to
September 15, when the electioneering communication kicks in, so
you&#39;d have to start reporting everything after that date. I move the
adoption of the amendment.

To debate amendment number thirteen.

Senator has the floor.

We thank Senator Blue for bringing forward an amendment and something
that we think might improve the bill and we&#39;re glad to accommodate
Senator Blue&#39;s point on the election communication window. And
therefore, we urge you to vote for amendment thirteen.

question before the senate is amendment thirteen to house bill five

  <p>Corporate money out of campaigns. Two things remain in this amendment.
One is it&#39;s still a requirement that if you want to talk trash about
somebody in an ad you gotta get on the ad and say this ad is paid for
and sponsored, or I support this ad. It doesn&#39;t let you hide behind
somebody else. If you want to really to ?? of somebody, you need to be
willing to stand up and admit that you called them whatever it is that
you&#39;re calling them. That&#39;s the first thing it does. The second
thing it does it still preserves the requirement that people who give
big amounts to campaigns during the ?? period will still have to be
disclosed. It&#39;s my interpretation that the law would make it so you
don&#39;t have to disclose these corporate donors and others in this ??
period. And I just think that we want as much transparency and as much
disclosure as possible in these political campaigns so I move the
adoption of the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brunstetter what

discussion or debate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mister President. [SPEAKER

Speak to the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator has the floor. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mister President. I appreciate my colleagues
tolerance of my debate on their earlier bill and you might think I&#39;m
tired but as Reverend James Cleveland said, after hearing the discussion
today I don&#39;t feel no ways tired. One of the things I&#39;ve enjoyed
about my time here is hearing the bells over at Christ&#39;s church
chime the hour. But I&#39;ve heard some bells the last few days that
give me great pause. I&#39;ve heard the death nail for simple,
effective, safe, clean, fair and accessible elections. We talked a lot
about voter ID yesterday. And I thought about my 20 year old niece,
student at Carolina, rising junior. And when I was 16 I couldn&#39;t
wait to get my driver&#39;s license. Did it the first day. She&#39;s
waited. She still doesn&#39;t have her drivers license yet because young
people just don&#39;t do that as much anymore I understand. So when
she&#39;s gone, if you were asked to vote, she&#39; civically engaged,
she&#39;s voted for two years. What ID would she present? Senator Hise
actually gave me pause yesterday when he pulled out his ID from the
community college where he works. And it was a good point. It was a
little hard to tell exactly what it was. I looked at my ID, mine&#39;s a
little tough to read too. But if you care about enfranchisement of
voters then we shouldn&#39;t be throwing in obstacles saying can&#39;t
read the ID. We ought to be working to fix that. Let&#39;s get President
Rawl in here and President Ross. Let&#39;s get a uniform ID across all
of our institutions of higher education. Let&#39;s make them uniform so
that we can all read them. Heck we&#39;ve been doing that kind of thing
for our local governments all session. Like I&#39;d appoint Brock, Rucho
and Nesbitt to do it since they&#39;ve been spending a little time
worrying about the design of license plates, let&#39;s get you&#39;ll to
design the ID. Spent more time worrying about that than we have about
something that could help enfranchise our college voters. We&#39;ve
spent time, as Senator Kinnaird pointed out correctly, that this bill
only had a few pages about voter ID but spent a lot more time talking
about elections broadly. You&#39;ve attacked the time to vote in this
bill, early voting, same day registration. You&#39;ve attacked the early
registration of teenagers. All things that are going to limit the right
of North Carolinians, the ability of North Carolinians to vote. Senator
Brock commented on Florida. He said we didn&#39;t want what happened in
Florida in 2000 to occur here. Well we sure don&#39;t want happened in
2012 in Florida to occur here either. ?? long lines.

  <p>...the matter of choice in straight-ticket voting, that&#39;s gone, as
well, and that&#39;s going to radically change. Making it easier to
register and more convenient to vote encourages voting among groups such
as, African Americans, Hispanics, the young, the old and in areas that
are more likely to vote Democratic. Data after data after data shows us
that. This bill actually speaks very little to scrutiny about absentee
voting. After all, no ID is required to request an absentee ballot and
no one can tell who fills out the ballot and returns it when the
absentee ballot is counted. In fact, many studies have shown us that
absentee ballots are more likely to be ruled invalid than votes cast
early at same day or at same day registration. As Senator Stein pointed
out, the data show that absentee ballots are more often requested by
Republicans. Coincidence? Our friends, the Republic party, have argued
uniformity, but that uniformity comes with a price in this bill and that
is significant narrowing of our time, our ability, our places to vote.
Let&#39;s make it uniformed, but let&#39;s make it broad at the same
time. Then we get to the money. Senator Blue has offered you a series of
very effective good government amendments that would get the money out
of this. We voted, you all voted them down or tabled them very quickly.
Our election should not be to the highest bidder, corporate or personal.
We keep moving that $4000 limit to $5000 and then we&#39;re going to let
it have an inflation inflator built into it. It&#39;s going to be that
our elections soon are just going to be going to the highest bidder.
When you have an agenda similar to what the Republic party has pushed
through this session, those bidders are going to be standing in line
because they&#39;re very pleased with what you all have passed down
here. The corporate bidders and the highest bidders are going to be
lining up. In addition, when we keep throwing this kind of money into
the election process, you&#39;re going to narrow the list of people who
can run for office. They don&#39;t have access to that kind of cash to
run campaigns. So you&#39;re not going to see women, people of color,
young people run for office. They don&#39;t have access to the kind of
money it&#39;s going to take, and when we keep raising the price and the
money in this. At a time when our state&#39;s population is becoming
more diverse our electorate and our elected officials will become less
diverse as a result of this bill. You can dress this up however you
want, but House Bill 589 is plain and simple a brazen effort to limit
the free exercise of our right to vote. I urge you to vote no. Thank
you, Mr. President.

Senate, we&#39;ve had a good and thorough debate on this bill. Over two
days we&#39;ve had a sense of history. I think we&#39;ve reviewed the
bill in great detail. I think everyone in the room knows what we&#39;re
doing now. I want to make two or three observations. We&#39;ve heard
about Georgia. I don&#39;t want to be like Georgia. We&#39;ve heard
about South Carolina. I don&#39;t want to be like South Carolina. North
Carolina is a better state than them, in my opinion. This is the state
that I want to have and this the one that I want to be like. I heard a
lot of correlations and statistics yesterday [cuts off]

  <p>Regarding early voting in Georgia.  Well then today, when Senator
Goolsby published his letter, I was finally able to understand the
facts. The facts were, in 2006, they had no election to speak of.  In
2010, Obama had probably registered half of Georgia in 2008, and they
had a governor&#39;s election, and a senate election and so the voter
participation of the minority population went up. That&#39;s no
surprise.  And then 2012, when the President was running for a second
term, it went up again.  Goodness gracious.  Maybe that was all because
they did voter ID in 2006, but I would propose to you that common sense
doesn&#39;t says that&#39;s what happened.  And I guess, statistics may
say it, I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m no expert on that, but common sense
says that&#39;s not what happened.  It says what I just said is what
happened.  We sit in here and debate this bill almost as if you all have
got one set of voters, and we&#39;ve got another.  Now, that&#39;s kind
of how all the experts we&#39;ve hired tell us about the mail.  Well
it&#39;s kind of interesting when you do it by mail, you can mail to one
group of voter, and then mail to another group of voters.  And you can
get targeted information to a targeted group.  I&#39;ve got some bad
news for you all.  You aren&#39;t just doing this to our folks,
you&#39;re doing it to your folks. And they aren&#39;t going to like
lines on bit better than we are. They aren&#39;t going to like having
votes for 30 years and being turned away at the polls because they
didn&#39;t bring their driver&#39;s license with them, when they&#39;re
elderly.  They aren&#39;t going to like, your people aren&#39;t going to
like not teaching children civics in school and encouraging them to
vote.  And I&#39;m telling you, when what I speak is fixing to happen,
and you start having lines at these polls, and you take responsibility
for it, they aren&#39;t going to like you either.  They aren&#39;t going
to like anybody that did that to them.  I was reading last night, or the
night before, an article that pointed out, don&#39;t hold me to these
numbers, these will be close, that Seniors are having second thoughts
about the republican party.  That in the last election, I believe it
was, you all had a 20% margin among Seniors.  The latest shows that
it&#39;s now down to 6.  And after we finish telling them you tried to
tax Social Security, we&#39;ll get that other 6, and if they go stand in
the lines I think they&#39;re going to stand in, by the time they get in
there, we&#39;ll have 6.  Now, they&#39;re not going to put up with
this.  And if you doubt what I&#39;m saying, you need to look around.
Senator Blue mentioned what&#39;s going on in this world we live in
right now. It&#39;s frightening, what people will do for freedom. And
it&#39;s frightening what they will do when they feel like someone is
trying to take that away from them.  How would you like to be living in
one of those countries that have mobs in the streets, and I don&#39;t
know what they&#39;re shooting over there, I hope it&#39;s fire
crackers, but there&#39;s guns going off, there&#39;s everything else
going off, and they aren&#39;t going home until somebody&#39;s gone.
Now I&#39;m telling you, and that&#39;s not, they aren&#39;t over there
about food, they aren&#39;t over there about education. You can kind of
do all those things to people, they aren&#39;t entitled to those, but
you start treading on their freedom, and you don&#39;t think that they
have any freedom, and that their leaders don&#39;t care about them,
they&#39;ll take you down.  And, I know that there&#39;s been some
people that have been

pretty good memory. I cannot remember 800 people being arrested in this
town and taken to jail, and thousands getting on buses and coming down
here to protest what is being done. You need to take note: people think
they are not being heard, that they are not being listened to, that
their freedom is being trampled on. And now it is going to the ballot
box. I have said to you many times down here I did not know what the
plan was, and I thought I had it, but when I get to thinking about this
bill, I don’t know what to tell you all but this is not your answer. I
thought it was – I thought this was the answer – to keep people from
voting they wouldn’t be able to get recourse. The more I thought about
it, this is not the answer. This is going to make a matter, and more
resolute to go to the poles – that is what happened in Florida. You put
them in lines for four hours and see how many will vote for you. I am
telling you because they will be your lines, not mine. The best thing to
do right now is to stop what we are doing to the people of this state,
in unleashing this bill on them, and start over again and try to draw…
if somebody has a legitimate problem with our process, we’ll fix it.
Now, in fairness to Senator Tillman, I really am not going to go back to
one day voting. We are not going back 40 years, but you can fix the
system. I started out in my debate yesterday in telling you this system
is not broken, and I have not heard anyone tell me it is. Now, if you
declare everybody is a crook, then you can begin to get paranoid. Maybe
we need to strip search all of the members out in the hall before you
come in here because maybe you might have a gun. How about that? Or,
maybe we stop the cars out there in the driveway and search them all
because somebody might be on drugs.
Speaker: Senator Nasbith, let’s please stay on the bill.
Representative: Mr. President I am not going to argue with you. I am on
the bill. That is what you are doing with this bill: you are declaring a
bunch of crooks that are not there. You are calling the people of this
state to be crooks. I told you last night, no one is trying to break
into a polling place – it has never happened in the history of the
state. That is not where the crooks are. You do not need to do all these
things to these people. My point is that you can stop anything. The
question is how much are you going to put everyone through to stop it.
This system is not broken, you are fixing to break it.
Speaker: Senator Berger, for what purpose do you rise?
Representative: Mr. President, to speak on the bill.
Speaker: Would you like to yield to Senator Rucho first?
Representative: I would be more than happy to.
Speaker: Senator Rucho, you have the floor sir.
Representative: Thank you sir. Ladies and gentleman of the Senate, we
have heard a lot of debate today. We have heard, actually, the debate
was over three days. We had a very good debate in the rules committee
talking about explaining this bill, excepting some amendments from both
parties. We did the same thing debating house bill 589 and accepted some
very good amendments from both the majority and minority party in making
this a very good bill, and each of those votes, on the acceptance of the
minority party, were a bipartisan vote – making this a better and
stronger bill. I have listened to Senator Blue’s comments…

  <p>the story about dividing the land and then allowing the other people to
choose which one they wanted first. When House bill 589 passes and
becomes law, Sen. Blue, I will be delighted under that circumstance to
let you vote first, vote second, vote any way. Because guess what,
we&#39;re all gonna be equal. The only thing I ask of you, or anyone
else in the state, is that we play by the same rules, and we only vote
once. And that&#39;s all I&#39;ll ask.
Sen. Stein made a number of comments in his usual flair and inflamatory
statistics, some of them I question, but what he says and because he
says it does not make it true, ladies and gentlemen. When my son and I,
who, I have 2 sons, Sen. Stein, do you know what we do in our family? We
teach and talk about democracy. Our family does that. Our family goes
and votes from when my children growing up. I don&#39;t need a civics
class to do that, Sen. Stein, we teach that within our family. I think
it&#39;s a better place.
We&#39;ve talked about a number of issues, talked about straight ticket
voting, what we believe that will give access to the down ballot
candidates. We believe that what it does do, it allows every single
person to have a chance to select a candidate of their choice. They can
pick them or not pick them, that&#39;s their choice and that&#39;s not
taking care of them. Also Sen. Stein was screaming about ten minutes in
the voting booth. Nowhere in this bill does it say you have ten minutes,
twenty minutes, you have all the time you need, Sen. Stein, that&#39;s
the luxury of the system. That is the luxury of what we&#39;re trying to
do here. Especially when we&#39;re talking about the early voting. What
we&#39;re doing is yes, we&#39;re going to ten days, but the hours are
increasing, so Sen. Brock&#39;s family members can go there when they
work on the wrong shift, we talk about more potential hours available up
to the individual counties making the decision to accomodate the need of
their voters, and also a number of sites, additional sites. They&#39;re
not stuck with a few, they&#39;ve got some additional resources they can
move the exisiting machines, the existing equipment over to additional
sites that will make voting more available to every citizen within their
county.
The photo ID. 70% of the people of the people in North Carolina think
it&#39;s important. This society, you just can&#39;t live in this
society without having some sort of photo ID. And we can talk about
everything from an airplane to a bank building to a government building.
But what this photo ID does is it makes sure, as I talked to Sen. Blue
about, that everybody that goes to vote has 1 opportunity to vote, and
they know who it is that&#39;s voting. The value of the way we set this
up is that we&#39;re transitioning and phasing this in, so that the
voters will be knowledgable and educated to the point where they will
know that an ID will ultimately be necessary but it will not be
necessary until the 2016 election. We&#39;re giving them every
opportunity, not only to understand what the law is, but more
importantly to get the free identification if needed.
I will be very surprised as Sen. Stein talks about this 500,000 people.
That a number of other folks have done some studies on this, the fact is
the 500,000, as it was in Georgia, when Sen. Goolsby alluded to
yesterday, will never be a reality. I think there&#39;s a definite
concern as to the study done by the board of elections.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very good, fair, common sense bill, and
I would ask that each of you support this bill so that we can restore
the integrity and the honesty to the electoral system, and really take
some big steps forward in bringing confidence back to state government.
I urge you to support it.

  <p>That the provision of this bill that has garnered the most discussion
and the most debate, the voter identification provision, is something
that is supported by the vast majority of the people that sent us here.
It is important for us to listen to what the people want us to do. This
is something that they support across all demographic lines. I urge you
to vote for the bill to implement voter ID, but also to bring needed
updates to our election system and our election laws. So I ask that you
vote for the bill.
