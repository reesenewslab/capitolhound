[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moffitt is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Members of the house, this bill received quite
a bit of debate last Thursday.  Quite a bit of discussion regarding the
local impact that this bill will have.  We adopted an amendment offered
by speaker pro tem Stam, which took a good bill and made it better.
Essentially, what this bill does is allow for a framework to exist in
statute to provide for the orderly consolidation of multiple public
enterprises.  I would ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fisher is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You're recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Ladies and gentlemen, I just want to remind the
body of a few issues around this bill, and the reasons why I will be
voting no.  There is still some confusion about whether this is a local
bill or a statewide bill.  We had 60 plus resolutions coming from cities
all over the state of North Carolina opposing this legislation.  It is a
bill that will take a very well cared for, very well run asset away from
the city of Asheville.  The city has an outstanding track record in
terms of caring for the water system, and proof of that is the location
of two west coast breweries to Asheville.  They want clean, well cared
for water when they move their businesses to the mountains, and that's
what they get with a very well run Asheville water system.  Again, this
bill is not just about Asheville, it's about the entire state.  As my
colleague across the aisle said, it lays a framework, it puts a
framework in statute that could one day affect your city, your town.  I
will be voting no on this bill, and I ask for you to join me in opposing
house bill 488.  Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Mcgrady is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the bill.  This is
a bills to create a regional entity to manage a regional asset, that
being water, and a regional cost, that being sewer.  When I last spoke
on the floor, I sort of told members what the arguments that we're going
to be made here were.  They weren't made so much today, but it was
privatization, it was Henderson county, it was the overreaching and that
there was no compensation for the city of Asheville, and those were the
issues that were discussed.  I guess my disappointment still is that the
argument is being made that this is about Asheville, and it's not.  But
that's the argument that such a problem.  It's always about Asheville,
and it's never about Asheville's neighbors, and it's never about
Asheville being a good neighbor to its neighbor.  There's no remorse
about the fact that Henderson county's water has been surrendered to the
city of Asheville, and yet Henderson County has had no representation in
any water issues as they are discussed in the region.  This bill will
correct that problem.  It's a bill to address regional issues in a
regional way.  And that's why I urge your support of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion or debate?  If not, the question before the house is
the passage of house bill 488 as amended on its third roll call reading.
 All those in favor will vote aye.  All those opposed will vote no.  The
clerk will open the vote.  The clerk will close the vote.  The ayes are
72.  The no's are 39.  The bill has passed its third reading, and as
engrossed will be sent to the senate.  House bill 240.  The clerk will

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As you remember, last week on Wednesday we had a
robust debate about this bill. And then on Thursday our Representative

thing. The sheriff (??) association supported the bill before two years

technical corrections to the lien law that we passed last session.
Section 1 simply changes language from used by the owner to occupied, so
it's your primary residence. Section 2 has a conforming change simply
replacing furnish labor with furnished labor, materials, rental
equipment or professional designer or surveying services. Section 3 was
removed because it's no longer necessary because of the changes we've

and offer up an amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You're recognized to speak

Chair, the, Mr. Speaker. House Bill 333 is a bill that actually,
sections one and section two, were an exact mirror of Senate Bill 123
which we passed out of here last month 110 to nothing. And section three
is actually a section that changes, or closes a loop hole in the law
that where a sexual offender gets released from prison they have to
indicate the county that they are going to go register in. And if they
don't show up in that county there is a question of jurisdiction. What
this does is simply stip-, stipify that when they indicate which county
they are going to, that county immediately has jurisdiction from that
point on. So if they don't show up that county has the jurisdiction to
look for them. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So do you want to offer your amendment
now. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All right. Clerk will
read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Warren moves to amend the bill on
page one, lines five through 17. By removing those lines and renumbering
the remaining sections of the bill accordingly and. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Warren is recognized to explain his amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] All this does is remove sections one and two which have already
passed under Senate Bill 123. And it corrects language on, in section
three which is, was problematic for law enforcement. So I ask your
support on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate

of the amendment by Representative Warren. All those in favor will vote
