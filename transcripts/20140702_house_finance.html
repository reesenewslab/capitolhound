Few simple, very simple bills. Senator Heist, on Senate Bill 874, so are
you ready on Spruce Pine Deannexation? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you madam
chairman, members of the committee. This deannexation bill has the full
agreement of the property owners, and the town of Spruce Pine. They have
agreed that they should part ways and no longer be in the same. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Moffitt. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam
Chair, I move for a favorable report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the
committee, you’ve heard the motion. All in favor will say Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed, no. Senator Heist, who will
handle the bill for you on the house floor? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dobson. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The, thank you sir. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Madam Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Sir. Senate Bill 1144.
Representative Setzer, sir you’re recognized. Have the PCS before us for
the purpose of discussion. Representative Malone, are you here? Yes sir,
you wanna come up here. And we’ll have staff to explain the, the bill
for you if that’s okay. Staff, would you take on the PCS? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, ma’am. The PCS deletes the contents of the original bill,
and directs revenue laws to study the scope and application of the 1% 80
rate that applies to mill machinery and other similar types of equipment
purchased by manufacturers. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Davis,
you’re recognized sir. For motion. Motion being. Representative Ted
Davis, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I make a motion for a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Favorable report to the PCS and favorable to the
original bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, ma’am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is that
your intent? Yes, sir. Members of the committee, you have a motion for
favorable report to the PCS and favorable to the original bill. All in
favor will say Aye. Thank you. Senate Bill 846 Shallot Deannexation, I
believe staff will handle this bill. And Representative Brawley, sir,
you’re recognized for a motion. PCS. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Excuse me madam
chair, I move that the PCS be properly before the committee. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. All in favor will say aye. All opposed no. Staff
would you give us the highlights of the PCS please? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right the PCS deannexes some properties from the town. The town’s
position is that it does not oppose deannexation. And it also rolls into
the PCS Senate 731 at the bottom which updates the occupancy tax of
South Port. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes, sir you’re
recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I move for a favorable report
on PCS and favorable to the original bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further
discussion? All in favor will please say Aye. All opposed no.
Representative Collins moves that we have the minutes before us for the
purpose of approving those minutes from the last meeting, all in favor
will say aye. Okay, I believe that’s unanimous. We’ve got the coal ash.
Okay. Who’s handling that? Who’s handling coal ash? Senate Bill 729,
Representative Hager, sir, are you handling 729? Samuelson.
Representative Samuelson, ma’am, you’re recognized. Members of the
committee, the fiscal note is being passed out as we speak, so. The bill
and the summary. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you madam chairman, sorry about
that. If you all will look at the bill on page. Oh, okay. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] It’s coming. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ll breathe a minute then.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We’ll stand at ease until members have their copy of
the bill, please.</p>

<p id="05:00">
Is there anyone that does not have a copy of the bill yet?
Representative Luebke does not have a copy of the bill yet, and the back
row. Is there anyone that does not have a copy of the bill now?
Representative Samuelson, you have the floor, ma’am. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chairman. Members, if you’ll look on page 48, line 25,
this is the fee portion of the coal ash bill. This portion is exactly
the same as came over from the Senate; has not been changed. I’m going
to have staff go over the details of it, but the idea behind it is that
a lot of what we’re having to do to start monitoring these coal ash pits
or impoundments is going to require extra staff, and so this will be the
fee the fee that will then go to DENR so that they can then pay for that
extra staff. I’ve got some blank looks. Do you not see it on page 48?
Oh, ya’ll have got the newly… is that the newly-engrossed act? Tell me
what the right page number is. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Page 48, starting on
line 25. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samuelson, would you like
staff to do it so we can maybe move through it faster? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma’am, they may, but they just concurred that it was the same line
and page number that I have. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Hi. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Hi.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samuelson is referring to the right
section. It’s part 9, it’s on page 48, and the copy that was just passed
out to the members, it starts on line 25, and this creates a new
regulatory fee for combustion residual surface impoundments, and these
are the coal ash ponds that we have been referring to. This is very
similar to the reg. fee that the General Assembly adopts each year in
its budget; however, this is a new and additional reg. fee, and it is
imposed only on the North Carolina jurisdictional revenues of public
utilities with a coal ash pond. So this new reg. fee is .03 % of the
North Carolina jurisdictional revenues, and the purpose of this fee is
to pay for the cost of coal ash management, and it will be only used to
pay for the cost of coal ash management. This fee becomes effective July
1st 2014, and it will be monthly for the first year and then paid
quarterly after that. The fee also has a sunset, and the fee actually
expires April 1st 2030. And that is the finance portion of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee, do you have questions?
Representative Luebke. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. The question is for
Representative Samuelson, which is how did you come up with .03 as
opposed to .01 or.05? What was the logic of this number? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The logic of the number was determining the number of staff
people that might be hired. If staff would like to cover the specifics,
that would be great. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes
sir. This was calculated to provide 25 additional staff members to DENR
and 5 staff for the Coal Ash Commission, the CAM commission that is also
created in the bill. So that is how the fee was set. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee, are there further
questions in regard to the fee? I don’t see any hands. Are you all
satisfied? Representative Starnes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Well I’m
trying to figure out what we did in the budget. We appropriated some
money for some new positions to DENR in the budget, and were they tasked
with part of the coal ash cleanup or enforcement? [SPEAKER CHANGES] My
understanding, and staff may correct me if I’m wrong, is the positions
in the DENR budget are the DENR positions to help with certain things
that are still exclusively DENR functions, but these positions are for
things directly related to the things commanded in this bill, and to the
staff of the Coal Ash Commission. For instance, these people may be
helping to come up with the terms, but the DENR people still have to
issue the permit. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee, are there
further questions? Seeing no hands, waiting for a motion. Representative
Jones. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chairman, I move for a favorable report
of House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 729, unfavorable to the
original.</p>

Members of the committee, you’ve heard the motion. All in favor will say
aye, all opposed no. I believe that’s unanimous.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Think there was one no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 853. Senator Barrington.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair. Members of the committee, you have before you--do
they have the fiscal note yet, has it been distributed?--the fiscal note
and also the bill. The bill was passed through the JV committee here in
the House and I would like to yield to staff if they might describe or
explain the fiscal note.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chiles.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair. William Chiles with Fiscal Research. The fiscal
note shows a cost to this bill of about $50,000. $53,423 in the first
year. This is essentially for a one personnel judicial system to deal
with the expanded reporting requirements for the business court. They
don’t have the technology to capture all of these pieces of data at the
current time and they need another person to help gather this
information. There’s also a revenue of $13,400 from the expanded filing
fee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Madam Chair, I’ll be glad to take questions if there are any.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee. Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, and this is just for general information. It says that the
business court will handle complex business issues. What qualifies a
case for the business court?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for the question, Representative Starnes. That really is one
of the major focuses of this bill, the modernization of what is the
venue of the business court. You can see on page two of the bill there
are lists of the various venue options, beginning on line 35 and then
continuing on. In the old bill, or as the bill is currently written,
cases that “involved the internet” are potentially subject to the
business court. Back in the ‘80s, when this bill was currently drafted,
that would make sense because very few people even knew what the
internet was then and it probably would be very complex. Now, if I send
you an e-mail and we get into dispute over it, does that involve the
internet and would that give one of us the option for the business
court? What we found is there was a need to modernize those criteria and
they’re set forth and were fully vetted in JV in two different hearings.
In 1-9, describing what these complex business matters are and then in
B, on the next page, we also include tax law related subjects, cases
involving $5 million or more and then COLA taxes which are already part
of the business court bill. We made no change to that. Those are
involving video or telecommunication type disputes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Tell me what has been the workload of the business court before this
bill and what do you anticipate it to be after the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Other than the additional reporting requirement, I really do not
anticipate that this is going to increase their workload. What we were
trying to do was sharpen what would qualify and be more specific in what
would qualify. Hopefully more businesses will come here as a result of
this and they will choose North Carolina as the place for their
business, so there would be more businesses to actually use the business
court. As it’s drafted, if our business population stays the same, it’s
my opinion sir that this should streamline the process instead of
increasing the workload. There is the reporting requirement that will
take some additional time but the reason for that is so that we can
monitor and see if there would be necessary additions to the court, and
it also gives us complete</p>

not complete, but gives us better vision as to what the court does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, Representative Starnes? Representative Luebke?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair. My question is actually following up on what you
just said. How does this bill make North Carolina more attractive? What
is in this bill that makes North Carolina more attractive as a business
location?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I really appreciate that question. When I came down here two years ago
this was one of my goals. This is what I wanted to see happen. As part
of our revision in deregulation and taxation, and all the other things
that we’ve tried to do here to accomplish a warmer business climate, our
business court was needing to be modernized because of some of the
examples that I’ve already given. What this will do is send to the world
that what we are doing is providing a place where business disputes can
be efficiently rendered and so they can get on back to business. Being
an attorney, I know how important predictability is in human behavior
and in business, so the goal of this--because you’ll notice one of the
things in here is we’re going to be developing a consistent body of case
law--what we’re trying to do, we would like to be like Delaware with
their Chancery Court but we cannot do so constitutionally. We have
special courts here and what this will do is provide that certainty and
that vision and that opportunity for a business to be able to predict if
we do x then y is going to happen. I believe that’s what’s going to help
our economy and help businesses want to do business in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke, do you have a follow-up sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, and I guess we just saw the bill. I suppose if I looked at my
calendar last night and gone home I could have, and should have, studied
it but tell me what modernization means, if you would please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I gave one example: the internet. A case involving an internet action.
That needed to be modernized. What we’ve done in the statute too is make
specific references to our North Carolina statutes that involve business
transactions. We’ve worked very closely with stakeholders from the
Defense Bar that practices very prolifically in the business court to
the Justice Center. Bill Rowe was very concerned that consumers didn’t
get dragged into this through this modernization and so we’ve actually
gone in and cited to our specific statutory law in cases arising under
that and similar to that so that, again, businesses will know what they
can count on and whether they will be able to use this court or not to
settle their disputes and do so in an efficient manner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I might ask a question on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. You’re recognized sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, having talked to you I know you’re very smart in the legal
arena, much more so than myself, but when I read phrases like “without a
vote of the shareholder” the lights come on and questions pop up. I
recognize there are things that could operate more efficiently if you
didn’t have to go back to a vote, same thing around here, but are we
still protecting and ultimately responsible to the shareholder?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m so glad you asked that question. You’re actually talking now about a
different part of the bill, the holding company bill. I wish I could say
this was my idea but it’s not. It’s came to me but let me tell you
Representative Brawley, I am very skeptical of all the good ideas that
come across my desk. A lot of them turn out not to be and so I vetted it
with my business law background and I could not find anything wrong with
the bill. I started with the gold standard in Delaware. After I did
that, then I sent the bill over to my old law professor, Tom Hazen.
While I do think that they do a very good job of business law at UNC
Chapel Hill, he’s very protective of shareholder rights and so he came
back and he said that it’s great. So that the committee might understand
why it’s great and why we don’t have to worry about it, that part of the
bill is only affecting wholly owned subsidiaries and so there’s no
reason to put a business through the vote because they own the whole
darn thing. That’s how that works. Thank you for letting me answer that.</p>

<p id="20:00">
Members of the committee. Representative Tine, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. Am I understanding this correctly, that
this is at the same level of court hierarchy as the superior court? Is
that right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, it’s a special court. It’s one of our special courts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I could follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What is the difference in the filing fee between the superior court and
the business court?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ll need to defer to staff on that. I don’t know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The filing fee for a case in superior court, civil superior court, is
$180 and under this bill currently the filing fee in business court is
$1,000 and this bill increases it to $1,100. In business court you also
have to pay the superior court fees as well, so it would be $180 plus
the $1,100.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Tine. Yes sir, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What’s the purpose for, or the policy behind, the difference in those
two?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The reason for that is that in this particular, the business court in
North Carolina, in every case actually a written opinion is rendered and
so there’s more service to that, whereas in superior court there would
just be a ruling most of the time, and so it is a different procedure
and a different process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blust.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What is the rationale behind the provision that bypasses the Court of
Appeals and takes appeals directly to the Supreme Court?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for the question, Representative Blust. As I stated earlier,
our goal here is to provide and to create a body of predictable case law
that businesses can count on and, at this point, certainly our business
court is one of the greatest business treasures we have now, it just
needs modernizing and improving. One of the ways we can improve that is
now when a case is appealed it goes to our Court of Appeals and they do
not sit en banc all together, they sit in groups of three. One never
knows which judge they would get and also, as I said, it’s not the final
word in this state. It is just, I don’t want to say just because it’s
very important, but it’s not the Supreme Court. By having these cases go
straight to the Supreme Court then they will get the same justices each
time, will have the final say unless of course there’s an issue that
would lend itself to the US Supreme Court, which is not very often.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hall, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. Question for the bill sponsor. Could you
clarify if every case that’s going to be in business courts, does one of
the parties have to be in business in order for the case to be in
business court or do both the parties have to be a business?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I apologize. I was not expecting so many specific questions about the
bill today and I didn’t review that portion of the bill again, so if I
might defer to staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’re always welcome to the House Finance Committee. Trina?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hall, I believe the only instance would relate to tax
cases. Taxes cases that are coming out of OAH where the party would be
the taxpayer, which may be a business but may also be an individual, are
required to go to business court in this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So to clarify. Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up. Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So I’m clarifying with staff then?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You could be in business court and not be a business? Neither party
would have to be a business?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This is, again, to the sponsor or the staff. Would the parties have an
option to be in business court or superior court and if so how is that
determination made on the theory that I file a case in business court
and the defendant moves to have it removed to regular superior court. Is
that an option and how is that determination made? Who makes it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There are two parts to the bill and so it depends on what kind of case
you have. The first part, where it says designation of a complex case
beginning</p>
  

  <h3>25:00</h3>

<p id="25:00">
on line 26 of page 2, we have nicknamed those discretionary mandatory,
and if you see there it says any party may designate as a mandatory
business case any of the following. So if you have 2 parties to a case,
and one of th parties wants to go to business court, if it meets one of
these specific criteria, then it will go to business court if one of the
parties so requests, so moves for that. Then there's the second part,
which we have, as I said, nicknamed mandatory mandatory, which appears
on page 3 line 22, and those are cases where they shall be. And those
are the tax cases that staff talked about, cases of over $5 million in a
contract dispute and then finally, the poll attachment ones. And so
except for those 3 situations, it's up to one of the parties to be
placed in the court.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you have follow up, Rep. Hall?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma'am. And I sure appreciate the indulgence, and I guess one final
follow up, and the question is:  If the case is regular Superior court,
and I as a respondant party want to respond and then file a motion to
have it removed to business court, is that because I'm not the party
that originated the case, do I have that option to say I want it, and
then what happens with the fees associated with it since I'm already
responding to a Superior Court case that costs $180?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes you can, you can if you are the defendant or the one who's brought
into court, you can make the motion for change of venue to the business
court, and then the fee we've actually put in here, I'm not sure where
that appears, but the fee is shared pro rata amongst- because there
could be a number of different parties. And so if there were 13 parties,
they would each share pro rata unless the judge, in his or her
discretion decides that it should be allocated in another way.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And just one follow up-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair. So in that instance, if the case is determined
that it should have been in business court all the times, so that fee
should have been on the plaintiff who filed the case, you're saying- the
question is is that the way the fee is allocated in a way irrespective
of the fact that the court made the determination that it should have
been in business court all the time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I found on page 4, lines 46-50, &quot;Upon the designation of action as
a mandatory complex business case.&quot; So however it gets to the
business court, then it's payable by each party to the action on a pro
rata basis unless otherwise determined or ordered by the business court
judge based on a different allocation. So the presumption is, if you
have 2 parties it would be divided in half. If you had 10, it would be
1/10th. Unless the business court judge found there would be a reason to
allocate it in a different manner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Jordan?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair.
As one of the co-chairs of judiciary &quot;B&quot;, I just wanted to, if
it would alleviate any concerns, this bill has ben vetted in judiciary
&quot;B&quot; thoroughly twice actually. All the non finance portions of
it, and we've made various improvements and technical ammendments and so
forth. It's passed unanimousely in Judiciary &quot;B&quot;.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Tine?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair.
The follow up with that discussion, the &quot;mandatory mandatory&quot;
group, the 3 ones that you have there, why are those &quot;mandatory
mandatory&quot; and not treated the same way as the other ones.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well the easiest answer for number 3 is it's already mandatory. If you
have a poll attachment case now, it goes to business court. The number
1, it is my opinion  and others who have worked on this bill, that we
need a predictable case law in taxation, it's very complex, it's very
much in niche, and we need to be able to say &quot;this is where those
are going to be decided.&quot; Then the second one, which we actually
worked on in Judiciary &quot;B&quot; about the $5 million and the amount
in controversy, I certainly appreciate all the representatives that
helped, especially Rep.  Daughtry in this matter. What we're trying to
send there is part of that message to the world that if you've got a
controversy that's sizable in your business and a contract manner, and
it meets one of the other  criteria, the 1,2,3-  all of the criteria
before so</p>

not a lien case where there’s been a default in the loan or some simple
case. It would have to meet the criteria of the other part. In North
Carolina we consider that important and it will be heard in our business
court.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair. May I comment on the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just want to reassure the members of the committee that the business
court is one of the most successful special courts of its kind anywhere.
As the bill sponsor has explained, the meaning of the matters that they
consider are very technical in nature and our state, in the
administration of justice if you will, benefits from the judges being
able to bring this kind of focus and this kind of expertise to review
these cases. This is a good bill and, Madam Chair, would now be an
appropriate time to seek recognition for a motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe we already have a request for that, Representative Lewis.
Representative Collins sir.

I would be happy to defer to Representative Lewis for the motion. Go
ahead Representative Lewis.

Representative Lewis, you’re recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair, I move that Senate Bill 853 be given a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen of the committee you’ve heard the motion. All in
favor will say aye, all opposed no. I believe the motion carries.
Senator, is Representative Daughtry going to carry the bill on the floor
for you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, before you leave your seats, I’d like for us to take just a
minute and be respectful that we have some pages here that we haven’t
had the opportunity to recognize. Tristan Adams from Lincoln.
Representative Saine, would you stand if you’re in the room, in the
back. Thank you, yes. Jason Bauer from Iredell, and Harrison Bryant from
Alexander. Emily Calica from Montgomery, Emrys Roberts from Columbus and
Emily Gage from Polk. Students, we appreciate you being with us. You’ve
just witnessed House Finance and it gets a little testy sometimes. Glad
you’re here. Are there other business or concerns of the committee?
Representative Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair, I deeply apologize for taking the committee’s time. Just to
be clear, my motion was that the House Committee substitute that was
before us be given a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There was no substitute, Representative Lewis. I don’t believe so. We’re
going to let you stay where you are. Members of the committee, we stand
adjourned.</p>
