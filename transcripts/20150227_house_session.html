  [SPEAKER CHANGES] You’ve heard the motion, any discussion or debate? If
not, all those in favor will say “aye”.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Had some discussion, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Pardon? Representative Hall is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a question for why we are moving the bill and –
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I’d be glad to yield to the gentleman’s
inquiry. Representative Hall, thank you for the inquiry. The bill was,
as you know, originally scheduled for one day this week for quite a few
members who were out. We had anticipated earlier that Monday would also
be a time in which there would not be any recorded votes. However, it
appears that next week will be pretty full on Tuesday, Wednesday, and
Thursday with recorded votes and it was the Speaker’s desire to go ahead
and get this bill, which I believe passed out of appropriations
unanimously, to go ahead and get that bill dealt with prior to having to
deal with the remaining bills that we expect to be on next week’s
calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And if I may also observe, Representative Hall,
there’s an amendment to it that I’ll be glad to share with you, it’s at
the desk, to ask that it would change the title, that it eliminates
section 1, unless there’s a motion to suspend the rules that might cause
it to lie over – lay over. Okay, notices and announcements. All those in
favor say “aye”.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed say “no”. The ayes have it. Notices and
announcements? House Bill 103, previously set calendar pursuant to Rule
32, without objection and on advice of the clerk, that will also be
calendared for Monday night. Any objection? If not, so ordered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hall is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I missed the last statement regarding 102.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, 102—103 is the joint sessions state of the
Judiciary. We’re expecting a Senate version, but would like—the clerk
would like to have the House version at least on the calendar for Monday
night, so we have an option there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Richardson is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I would like to have a clarification on Monday night.
Speaker sent out an e-mail saying it will be a voting session. Is that
still the case for Monday night?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, yes, ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 14 and possibly House Joint Resolution
103. Any further notices and announcements? If not, Representative Lewis
is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I move that the House adjourn subject to
receipt of messages from the Senate, to reconvene Monday, March 2, at
seven o’clock PM.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis moves, seconded by Representative
Cunningham, that the House adjourn subject to the receipt of messages
from the Senate, to reconvene—I’m sorry. Strike that, seconded by Rep.
Richardson, okay, that the House adjourn subject to the receipt of
messages from the Senate, to reconvene Monday, March 2, at seven o’clock
PM. Those in favor say “aye”, those opposed say, “no”. The ayes have it,
the House stands adjourned.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I have to remember that you do always
call me Representative Cunningham, so from now on, if she’s not here, I
will answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Cunningham—I think that gives you the
chance to vote twice on every bill.
