I'd like to call the environment meeting to order. I got one. I'd like
to welcome everyone here today to our first order of business we'd like
to do. I'd like to welcome and thank our Sergent at Arms for the work
they've done: Marvin Lee, Carlton Adams, Barry Moore and Martha Parrish.
We have some pages with us today. If you'll stand and raise your hand
when we call your name: Nicole Defrettes, from Surry County,
Representative Stevens, Bandom Nixon, Chowan County, Representative
Steinburg, Tyler Easterly, from Madison County, Representative Presnell,
and James Ethridge, from Wake County, Representative Starnes is his
sponsor. We're going to be at ease for a few minutes.  We're waiting on
a bill to come from printing. Do all the members have a bill?  What we'd
like to do is let Jennifer McMinnes go through the bill for us.
Jennifer, you are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.  Members, the 6th Edition of the Senate Bill 76,
in Section 1-A of the Bill would authorize Deaner and the Mining and
Energy Commission to issue permits for oil and gas exploration.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me Mr. Chairman.  I'm having trouble hearing her and could she
she can start over. I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could you start over, and let's hold the raquet down in the back, and in
the front too.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Can you hear me Representative Samuelson?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, but can you start over?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. Section 1-A of the 6th Edition would authorize Deaner and the
Mining and Energy Commission to issue permits for oil and gas
exploration and development activities using hydrolic fracturing and
horizontal drilling effective March 1st, 2015. The 6th Edition, however,
would prohibit those permits from becoming effective until a subsequent
act of the General Assembly and the bill specifically provides that that
subsequent affirmative act would include repeal of Section 3-D of the
Clean Energy and Economic Security Act of 2012, which is Senate Bill
820, enacted last year. Section 3-D of Senate Bill 820 prohibited the
issuance of permits to wait for the Mining and Energy Commision to
develop a modern regulatory program.  So Section 1-B of this bill,
Senate Bill 76, the 6th Edition before you, would ammend Section 3-D of
last year's bill to provide that permits could be issued but could not
become effective until the General Assembly takes affirmative
legislative action to allow those permits to become effective. The next
sections of the bill are a number of studies.  Section 2-A of the bill
requires the Mining and Energy Commission with the assistance of Deaner
to study development of a coordinated permiting program for oil and gas
exploration and development so that a single comprehensive environmental
permit could be issued. That report would be due to the Environmental
Review Commission March 1st, 2014.  The next section of the bill,
Section 2-B, would require the Mining and Energy Commission, Deaner, and
the Departments of Revenue and Commerce to study an appropriate rate of
severance tax that should be imposed on oil and gas activities occuring
within the state. The entities are specifically directed to examine the
North Carolina oil and gas study that was prepaired by Deaner and
Department of Commerce in April 2012.  In addition they are required to
consider the information they may have already compiled pursuant to an
ongoing study that was part of Senate Bil 820, that required examination
of the funding required to address infrostructure impacts from oil and
gas activities, funding needed to cover</p>

State's needs. The six addition would instead allow [??] to fix an
amount that may be produced and it directs them to formulate rules
accordingly. Section 4B of the bill would amend the landman registry
that was enacted in 2012. As you may recall this provision governs
people who perform title or contract functions related to exploration,
disposition of oil and gas interests. They negotiate for acquisition or
divestiture of oil and gas rights and negotiate business agreements that
 provide for exploration or development of oil and gas. The bill before
you would amend the landman registry to provide violations are
punishable by a penalty not to exceed $5000 per violation and upon
conviction a person would be guilt of a class one misdemeanor. In
addition the bill authorizes the department to seek injunctive relief
and it also adds language that would provide that any agreement that
results from negotiations with a landman in violation of the statutory
prohibitions would be null and void as being against the public policy
of the state.
The next sections, sections 5A through 5C of the bill amend bonding
requirements that were enacted in 2011 and 2012. The first is the
drilling bond that an operator must provide upon registration to drill a
well. This language in senate bill 76 clarifies that that bond runs to
the state. The next change to the bonding requirements specify a process
to set the amount of the reclamation bond that was enacted in 2012 which
requires an operator to provide a service owner a bond to cover the cost
necessary to reclaim the property after they've completed the drilling
activities. The bill would direct the mining and energy commission to
adopt rules to establish criteria for the amount of the bond and also
task the mining and energy commission with sending the bond and give
service centers and operators a right of appeal concerning the amount of
the bond established by the mining and energy commission.
The next section of the bill, section six concerns revenue from offshore
energy production. It would require revenues or royalties paid to the
state from offshore exploration. That those revenues would be deposited
in a fund for emergency purposes including emergency preparation
response, emergency environmental protection or mitigation associated
with the release of liquid hydrocarbons in a fund until that fund
reaches $500 million dollars. At a point that the fund exceeds $500
million dollars those revenues would go to the general fund. The sixth
addition of senate bill76 clarifies that funds are to be expended for
emergency purposes only upon defining that other funds are not available
to address the emergency situation in a timely fashion, and also
requires the state to pursue cost recovery for funds expended.
The next section, section seven of the bill concern the regional
interstate offshore energy policy compact. It strongly encourages the
governor to develop a compact with the governors of South Carolina and
Virginia to develop a regional unified strategy for exploration of
offshore energy resources. The bill provides details on the subject of
compact negotiations and recommendations that should come forth from the
compact. The next section of the bill, section eight would make changes
to the energy policy act under current law. It would rename the energy
policy council as the energy jobs council. It would amend and
reconstitute the membership of the council and also change the members
form 16 to 13. It also makes changes to the purpose and duties of the
council and the sixth addition would move the council form the
department of commerce to deaner [SP]. The final provision of the bill,
section nine concerns a rule called the electrical requirements rule.
The bill would direct the medical care commission to adopt a rule to
replace the electrical requirements rule.</p>

Which currently provides that facilities that are licensed by DHHS must
provide emergency electricity to facilities with fuel that is stored on
site. The bill would require replacement of this rule to allow use of
bifuel generators that operate with both liquid fuel and natural gas
that is not stored on site. The final provision is the effective day.
Generally, the provisions become law except otherwise noted, and I'm
happy to answer any questions, mister Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Jennifer. Senator Newton is recognized to comment on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman. Members of the committee, thank you very much
for being here today. As I said yesterday, North Carolina needs the jobs
and America needs the energy. Notwithstanding what some people in the
media reported yesterday, let me repeat that. North Carolina needs the
jobs and America needs the energy. We have an tremendous opportunity
here in North Carolina. We have the possibility to create thousands of
new jobs, billions of dollars in revenue and income for our citizens and
for our state. And I think we have to ask ourselves a big question. Do
we want to sit around and twiddle our thumbs for fifteen or twenty
years, while many other states have been doing this for decades, safely,
spurring their economy, when we have, what, ten percent unemployment in
Lee county? In my district, twelve and thirteen percent unemployment?
Many other areas of the state suffering? Do we want to continue to sit
here and talk about it, and talk about it, and talk about it, or do we
want to move forward? This process was started in 2011, and if this bill
is enacted either in the Senate form or the House form, we will be
setting the stage to begin moving forward in 2015. Now, I think that's
plenty of time to get the rules right when we have many other states
that we can study and learn from. Some states have been doing this for
decades. We can learn from their mistakes and learn from their
successes. We have a great opportunity before us, and that's what this
bill is about. We legalized this process in 820, and this bill is about
setting the stage to make sure that North Carolina does it right, and we
get the jobs and the billions of dollars in investment and income sooner
rather than later. I am very happy to be here today. I've enjoyed
working with Representative Stone and Boles and Hager and others, the
administration, and we'll keep working on this and we'll get it right
for this state. I'm happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator. Representative Stone is recognized to comment on the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, thank you mister chair. Members of the committee, we've got a
lot of hard work in this bill. I'd like to thank Senator Newton as well,
for his part in helping us move this bill forward. We had a great vote
yesterday in commerce, and so I'll yield my time so we can answer some
questions today and move this bill forward. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Stone. Representative Hager is recognized for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. More of a, more of a statement than a
question but I appreciate it though. Yesterday I brought up a, an issue
that we had in, with the bill about as far as an energy jobs council,
and I've had numerous of the committee members come and ask me about
what has, what's the resolution of that. So I'll let, let folks know
we're talking with the Governor's staff today and if we have a
resolution on that then I'll let everyone know, if not we'll look at
moving the amendment forward on the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions for the committee. Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I, I had several but just specifically with respect to what
Representative Hager just said, we would need an amendment to change
that, right? You're saying you'd  run an amendment on the floor. Did I
understand you correctly?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would. I'd love to get the, I'd like to get the Governor's staff some
time to explain their position on it. I don't think we got a good
explanation yesterday in commerce. I'd love the Governor's staff to
explain why the, what's the logic of moving a jobs creating piece to a,
a regulatory department. So I think it dilutes both pieces when that
happens. It allows DENR to, to look at jobs issues instead of focusing
on regulatory issues.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McGrady is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Question for the bill sponsors and then two questions for staff. My
question is whether, this is with respect to fracking portion of the
bill, whether permits will be issued even if the rules aren't actually
in effect on March, March 15, March first of 2015.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Newton is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative McGrady, I</p>

<p id="20:00">
I thank you for the question. This has been a general subject of a lot
of confusion for folks. I'm not sure why. Obviously there's a difference
between the Senate version and the House version. I'm not quite as
comfortable about the House version in terms of what its effect would be
as I would be on the Senate version. I'd like to answer your question
this way. The original intent, and I think still the intent, is to have
the deadline stay the same. The deadline for producing the rules is
October 1, 2014. They've been working on this since we passed 820 and
that's their deadline. Nothing has changed by this legislation on that
point. That's when the rules are supposed to be ready. October 1, 2014.
Under the normal rule making process, there could be a challenge to
those rules and under normal circumstances there would be typically 10
letters and it would come to the legislature and the legislature could
either approve the rules or do nothing and the rules would become
approved. Or could vote to not approve the rules. I'm not sure exactly,
I'm dinging the House version, I'm not exactly sure how that would work,
but I don't, under either version, they were not going to be able to
move forward without the rules being in place. And that's my
understanding of both the House version and the Senate version is that
there would be no drilling, whether permit was issued under the House
plan or it was done under the Senate version, they would not be able to
move forward without the rules being in place. And that's what I want
and I think that's what everybody wants. We need the rules there so
everybody knows what they're supposed to do and in my view, there will
be adequate time, more than adequate time, to get that in place.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. I guess my comment or question then is if
it's possible that the rules wouldn't be in effect at the time we get to
the March 1st, 2015 date, I just wonder whether the bill ought not to
give DNR the authority to deny permits or defer permit decisions until
they actually take effect. And I'll leave that as sort of a rhetorical
issue to be discussed.
Two questions to staff, Mr. Chairman, is that OK?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Jennifer, if the General Assembly intends for DNR to
start issuing permits under the rules that have been adopted and not in
effect, and this is the question I was just getting to. I'm wondering
what is the permit holder actually have? In other words, will the permit
holder be able to claim some legal right to operate under the permit? My
point being the bill doesn't say what happens if the legislature changes
the rules for shale gas development after the permit has been issued,
but before the permit goes into effect?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Jennifer is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, Representative McGrady, that's a complicated
legal analysis but I would say that as far as what they have until the
General Assembly takes subsequent legislative action, affirmative
legislative action including repeal of last year's provision, they do
not have a permit that legally can become effective. As to what happens
if the rules change after the permit's issued, then that permit would be
in conflict with the governing law and it would need to be reissued. In
my estimation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up? Thank you. One last question, then. I
believe State law now allows 60 days to file a permit appeal with
whatever the office of administration or whatever, and the clock begins
as soon as DNR provides notice of a permit decision. I know that these
appeals are sometimes filed by the people seeking the permit and they're
sometimes filed by third parties, local governments or whatever. Under
the bill, when does the clock on an appeal start? When DNR issues the
permit or when the permit becomes effective?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, Representative McGrady, the bill does not speak
to that. It really doesn't reference Chapter 150B or a right of appeal
period. I think...</p>

<p id="25:00">
You make a good point that it might be sound to clarify when the right
of appeal begins.  I just can’t give you a definitive answer.  It may be
wise to clarify your point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Mr. Chairman, she made my point.  I don’t want to make this into the
full employment for lawyers. I’m no longer a lawyer.  But it seems to me
that there is an issue here where it’s not at all clear at what point
somebody can appeal – whether the applicant himself or somebody else.
It’s probably something that needs to be taken care of at some point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Senator Newton.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Representative McGrady, I want to rewind just
a little bit to your earlier question.  I’m speaking about the Senate
version, and this is not, again, not to ding the House version.  I’m
just not as…having thought through as much what their plan would do.  I
want to be very clear, though, for the media, for the members.
Under the Senate version, no permit could be issued until the rules were
in place.  There was not required to issue a permit, they were just
authorized to issue a permit beginning March 1, 2015.  So as far as your
appeal process question, there couldn’t be a permit until the rules were
in place. I would think that would be your timeline as far as it would
relate to that version.  OK.
I think it’s important that we…I think your question is important, and I
think we need clarity on these things.  Having been involved in the
drafting of the Senate version, I feel very confident about how that
would play out.  We’ll keep working on this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Representative Harrison.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and thank you, Senator Newton ?? for scaling
down what I consider some of the more significantly harmful impacts of
this legislation.  I appreciate your hard work, and I see the hand of
Assistant Secretary Gillespie in this, too, so I appreciate that.
I’m not even really sure where to start.  I share Representative
McGrady’s concerns about the permit language.  I’m confused about what
that means.  I’ve got an amendment that I think that ?? up but I’m just
going to comment on the bill to authorize the amendment, if that’s OK.
I’m not opposed to fracking if we can do it safely and protect the
public health.  If the state has the resources, I think it’s fine, I’m
not sure we have a model out there of a state that’s done it right,
which is what my concerns are and we do not have a history of extracted
industries in the state, so we’re ?? and Mining and Energy Commission is
working very hard and I appreciate that.  I was supportive of
Representative Gellispie’s ?? fracking because we do lack the regulatory
structure to properly protect I think North Carolinians from the
negative impacts of fracking.
I am concerned about the changes to the Mine and Energy Commission.  On
the ?? drilling piece I’m concerned that we are putting at risk some
coastal resources that are very responsible for significant revenues to
the coastal counties and to our state’s coffers.
There was a study out of the University of Massachusetts last year that
said 50 million dollars that was invested to fossil fuel industries
creates 5 millions jobs, but a million dollars invested in clean energy
technology produces 17 jobs.  I am concerned about the switch in the
Energy Policy Council to the Energy Job Council that removes one of the
fastest-growing areas of our state’s economy, which is clean energy
jobs.  I would also point out that the US has approximately 3 percent of
the world’s oil resources but 24 percent of the oil demand, so that’s an
unsustainable course.  We could drill all we want offshore but we’re
never going to get a level where we’re meeting our state and our
nation’s energy demands unless we focus more on clean energy technology.
I am concerned about this bill.  I’m going to try and ameliorate it a
bit with an amendment I’d like to send forth.  Please if I could be
recognized for that purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
You’re recognized to send forward the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
And while it’s being passed out, I’ll just explain it, if that’s OK, Mr.
Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
That’s fine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
So what my amendment does is actually put us back at Senate Bill 820,
which on the permit issuance issue, I understand the rationale between
having the Mining and Energy Commission develop the rules and then the
Legislature would act after that. I think that seems to make more sense
in setting up this process that’s in the current legislation as SB 76,
in Section 1A.</p>

<p id="30:00">
so my amendment is intended to take us back where we were on 8/20 and
not allow for the issuance of permits until these rules have been
developed by the EMC, the MEC, the Health Commission and approved by the
General Assembly.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Newton is recognized to comment on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I understand the amendment, I would just
simply say I think this is a step 180 degrees in the wrong direction
which would really do nothing to move the process forward in a
constructive way and I would hope that the Committee would oppose the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  As well, I think the dates are important, I think
we have to have deadlines and we have to move this process in the right
direction and I think that is what we are doing with Senate Bill 76 and
I would ask the Committee if you would oppose the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Hamilton.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  I've got a question.  Senator Newton, one thing
you said earlier in the process and I just want to make sure I'm
understanding it, is that the Senate version of this bill actually
delayed permit issuance or the authority to issue permits prior to the
approval from the Commission of Regulations, correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
No, that is not exactly what I said.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
In the process of going through the Senate, we added language at ???'s
request that permits could not be issued until the rules were in effect.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Until the rule were in effect.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
In effect.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
And being in effect is
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Well, the rules would have been in effect at a little bit different
timeline depending on how it played out.  If there were no objections to
the rules and it didn't go to the Legislature they would go into effect
however that timeline worked.  If there was 10 letters of objection that
came to the Legislature, they may go into affect as earlier as the
Legislature approving, taking action, early in the, we set the 2015,
March 1 timeline, specifically because of the long session, we would be
in session and we could have theoretically approved those rules very
early in the session, before March 1 and of course if we did nothing,
the rules would go in effect what is it, 90, I know they would go into
effect after we were out of session anyway so at some point that's how
it would have worked.  The permit couldn't have been issued though until
the rules were in effect.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Follow up Mr. Chairman.  Thank you.  Forgive my ignorance but how does
that compare to the Houser version we are considering now?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you for the question.  That is one of the things we wrestled with
in the House.  As ya'll remember, in Senate Bill 820, we promised we
would come back before the General Assembly in the House version and
have a vote. If you will notice, the bill says will have an affirmative
vote and we actually went back in and actually put Senate Bill 820
language in here to ensure everyone that when the rules are filed we
take a vote.  In the Senate version had we not taken a vote and went to
the end of session or 90 days, the rules would simply become law and we
thought we owed it to the General Assembly with the promises we made
bipartisan to uphold that.

Follow-up
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  So what you are saying is in the House version
that we are reviewing now the ?? will have the authority to issue
permits at any time but the General Assembly will still hold the right
to approve the final regulations. My concern with that is being a former
permittee, permitor, reviewing these kinds of permits, well  obviously
not tracking permits, but what will the staff be reviewing?  What will
they be basing their permit issuance on if there are not rules in place
in which to review, to compare, to issue a valid permit.  It seems to me
that we are putting staff in an awkward position to be issuing permits
when they have no rules for which to guide them.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
We don't necessarily know we won't have any rules.  We may have rules,
we very well may not.  But March 1 is the target date and that's the
whole point.  If we put a target date in there we are driving the Mining
Industry Commission and the rulemaking process to have a deadline so we
can get the process working.  If we don't have it prepared and rules
haven't been voted on then we will vote on them but that</p>

IF I could, also, the date march 1, 2015 i would like to backup a second
in regards to which verision I address. This date falls some five months
after the rules were supposed to be completed by the commission.
Remember 820 requires them to do it by octorber 1 2014 the reason for
having that date andtimeline is for ample time for rules to be there and
to be dealt with and to tell industry the timeline they have to work on
to get ready to move forward. IT takes years for the logistical work
they have infrastructure to build to accomodate this industry they have
truck routes etc. What I want is for them to be ready to go with all the
rules in place for 2015 2016 so the jobs get here asap and not by 2020.
We have secretary ?? here
State your name and position for the record
MR ?// I  am rep ?? ladies and gentlement of the committee I think a
word we dont hear is certainty. I think this bill brings certainty for
those of us who want enviro protection.And certainty to the people who
are going to spend millions of dollars relative to the hydraulic
extraction process. This is a larg e step forward in giving the
certainty everyone wants. So for that extent the frog position or the
local govt position the dates a permit can be issued we need to conintue
to create certainty in the minds of everyone involved including citizens
of NC.
A question for rep stone
What I heard you say is the process is set up go through a process... if
the rules aren not completed by a certain date the assembly would vote
on them.
THe rules come back Oct 1 2014 and go through the normal procedures
where it gets 10 letters and comes back to the general assembly.The
assemlby will take affirmative action on these rules
THe rule process is complex and takes a long time.I think thats one
thing you want to move ahead and dont want to be held up forever. IS the
rule making process being changed? because like the jordan rules took
many more months to be completed. My quesiton is, if the rules are not
in law by that date you have what will happen?
We have all plans that those rules will be in place but if they arent
they will go through the normal rule making process before it comes to
the assembly.
Mr ??
Thank you mr chair, I just want to speak briefly in reagrd to section 1a

grateful for the language in 3d. When we have regulatory.</p>

Here it comes out of body u have by way of statute the statute trickles
down by rules the most important aspect whether ?? there is rules and
statutes trickles down to the respective departments by way of policies
by allowing the permits to be issued but not be effective allow us as
well as the legislative bodies to see whether the ?? it has the statutes
as well as the rules all come together it how actually the department
makes the policies we get to see how the ?? process goes through we get
to see how the ?? issued we get to see how that all come together. I
think that is very important about this aspect the bill I think it is
also protective that the permits will not become effective until we take
substantial legislative action. I think it is very very very important
fro us t o see all three pillars of how this regulation come to effect
the statutes the policies as well the rules and I definitely would ask
in order with respect to representative Harrison to not supposed to ??
