[Speaker Change]
Gentleman’s recognized to debate the Bill.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you, thank you Mr. Speaker. I appreciate it. I was so gung ho to
get to this and quickly get through this. The only thing that we’re
doing here, and it’s just for Ash county although I think a bunch of you
might be interested in this at some point, is that your police officers
at your hospitals. If you have a hospital and you have private police at
your hospital. They, there is a gray area right now, where if law
enforcement, sheriff deputies, that sort of thing, bring an involuntary
commitment for example to your hospital and they leave them with your
hospital police, there’s a gray area that your hospital police cannot
detain those folks and if they decide to walk outside the hospital then
they can or else the hospital risk being sued. This came up in Ash
County. We had a couple of people leave the hospital. So we’re trying to
fix that and actually, for the final fix, I would like to be recognized
to send forth and amendment Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman’s recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk will
read.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Jordan moves to end the Bill on page one, line two by
rewriting that line to read.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman’s recognized to debate the amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. If you’re now with me on the dash board, this is
the final version and the way we found a couple of other places that
need to be fixed, the same issue, from the government committees. So
this has now been fixed.</p>

Committee substitute number two for House bill 480, a bill to be
entitled &quot;An Act to Provide Regulatory Certainty for North Carolina
by Requiring the Development of Minimum Design Criteria for Stormwater
Permits to Guide the Department of Environment and Natural Resources in
Permit Issuance and to Reform the Permitting Process to Allow a
Fast-track Permitting Process for Applications Certified by a Qualified

General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Pender arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You may debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm tremendously grateful for the opportunity to
present this bill before you all today. This is a regulatory reform bill
with the heart to reform some aspects of our environmental regulations.
And I'd like to say now that this bill upholds our protection to our
environment while at the same time to provide more regulatory certainty
as well as regulatory efficiency. For those who have to traverse our
regulatory agencies in order to receive a permit, this bill is specific
to state stormwater permitting. Again, I say state stormwater permitting
and I'd just have you to know that in the early 1990s, NC DENR,
administratively, established a minimum design criteria in a fast-track
process for sanitary sewer permitting for pump stations as well as
gravity sewer. It has been tremendously successful in regard to those
regards, and as well, ?? success, both from environmental standpoint as
well as a regulatory certainty and efficiency standpoint, and if it
worked for sanitary sewer, especially for pump stations, a million
dollars and plus, that it certainly could work for our state stormwater
facilities and our state stormwater best management practices. I ask for
your support of this bill and I'll look forward to its implementation to
allow our state to prosper.

into DWLR in [COUNTY] and representing Bryan[SP?]
thank him for his work there, and we're pretty much in agreement sure
that this bill will help our state address those that have DWLR
convictions and appropriately punish them, but also provide them a
mechanism to get their license back because unfortunately, what happens,
is folks tend not to do that. They get repeated DWLR convictions and it
makes it difficult for them to ever get their license back. There is a
carve out for those who have been convicted of a DWI or other moving
violations. On your desk is a list of frequently asked questions about
this bill, and a piece that was submitted by a assistant district
attorney out of Orange County that explains why this bill is needed. I
would be happy to answer any questions that you may have. I appreciate
those who have helped to draft this bill and my other primary sponsors.
Thank you.
[Speaker Changes] For what purpose does the Lady from Ayerdale[SP?]

[Speaker Changes] I would just speak on the bill.

[Speaker Changes] The gentleman may speak on the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker. In district 94 we have some
very curvy roads. Once you start through the curve you end up back where
you started, just higher up. Because of that problem we have issues with
driveway permits. What this bill does is, basically, there are processes
that the DOT looks at when they are issuing a driveway permit. But most
of those things are considered on the tail end, you have to get denied,
and then go through the appeals process, etc. to get your determination
on the driveway permit. What this bill does is put that process in the
front. So they work with the property owner up front for the needs on
the issuance of the driveway permit. I appreciate your support for the
bill.

[SPEAKER CHANGE] You may speak on the bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Members, this bill amends the current law that says that you are
prohibited from operating a motor vehicle unless it has one operable
break light. This bill moves to change the law to prohibit the operating
of a motor vehicle unless it has two operable break lights, one on each
side, on vehicles produced after 1970. Representative Stam has a
friendly amendment that I ask you to support, as well as the bill. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To offer an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman may send forth his amendment. The Clerk

[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Stam moves to amend the bill on page 2,
line 32, by rewriting the line to read Section 3, this act is effective
October 1, 2013.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The reason for the bill is that
a Court of Appeals case recently said the malfunction of a single break
light did not violate State law and did not constitute reasonable
grounds for a traffic stop. So this fixes, the bill fixes it back to
where we thought it should be, but for those who maybe really into the
Court of Appeals reasoning, they may need a couple of months to fix that
brake light, so it gives them until October 1st to get their lights
fixed.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Is there further discussion or further debate on the
amendment?

Thank you Mr. Speaker, I support the bill, but I just have to remind
folks that usually a person is not aware that they are violating this
unless there's somebody friendly enough to tell them. Because you can't
usually observe the rear of your vehicle and drive at the same time. So

Well I believe in your context you don't know that it has gone out,
you're driving along, you don't know it. That would be justification for

messages to the Senate, the bills to the Senate, by special messenger.
That causes us challenges though because when we send it by special
messenger, if someone records a vote after it’s been sent out, that
creates a lot more administrative challenges for the Clerk’s Office and
also other opportunities to make a mistake in the process, so the Chair
has determined that we are going to go to 15-second voting time.
However, the Chair has also determined if you don’t record within that
15-second voting time, you will not record for that vote. So if the
Chair sees people moving back to their desk in the time that we’re doing
this then I will hold it, but otherwise you will not record on that
vote. I will remind you if there are members, if you hear me reminding
you it is because somebody has not recorded. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.

[SPEAKER] All members record. The clerk will let the machine record the
vote. 80 having voted affirmative, 33 in the negative. The House
Committee Substitute, the House Bill 201 has passed the second reading
and will remain on the calendar.
Representative Torbett, the Chair anticipates probably an hour and a
half to two hours of debate. The Gentlemen can work out the matter about
their reading and potentially remove this objective to the third
reading. The Chair will entertain that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker will be more than happy to make
an attempt at that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] House Bill 458, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Committee Substitute for House Bill 458, Development
Entitlement Act to require notice and an opportunity for comment from
County Boards before permits for land application of waste within that
county are issued by the Environmental Management Commission to increase
the threshold for the Department of Transportation informal bid
procedures and to study state payments in lieu of taxes for public
lands. General sender North Carolina next.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Miguel Ralph, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The ladies recognize to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, this is the Counties
on the Bus County Legislation. The legislation contains several
provisions requested by the County Commissioner's Association as a
result of their goals.
Section 1 requires Deanor to notify the Board of County Commissioners to
receive comment before issuing a permit for the discharge of bio-solid
waste in that county. Presently there is no county oversight during the
process. It does not require that the county approve that process. And
Deanor has no objection to that provision.
Section 2 increases the informal bid cap for the local Department of
Transportation projects from $1.2 million to $2.5 million. The current
cap was set many years ago and raising it will allow the NCDOT District
Engineers an increased flexibility so that they can expedite these
smaller projects and use it for such as turn lanes and intersection
safety, guard rails, such as that. NCDOT has no objection to that
section.
And Section 3 creates a study commission to consider the financial
impact that some counties, especially our smaller rural counties
encounter when large tracks of state wildlife and game lands are removed
from their tax space. Federal Government has a reimbursement to counties
that offset some of these lands, especially for fire and law enforcement
protection.
I know we also have a lot of counties such as one of my counties, Jones
County, who had a lot of land taken away from their tax space because of
DOT projects for wetland litigation and things like that. So this is a
setting to discuss with wildlife some of these issues. And I know a lot
of times wildlife has no choice. A lot of this land is given to them. So
we've discussed this with Wildlife, they're okay with this. They want to
participate in this study. So this will just be a study to work with
them and try to relieve some of this impact on our counties taking this
land off their tax space. I appreciate your support.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
they flew first section codifies existing practice. initially commission
regarding a pass through our bulk increases from third-party water and
sewer services. the second thing he does on starting all lines twenty
three and I think is a rate of just mechanism to speed up repairs were
for instance, if you have cloudy water and minerals in your water, and
this is all looked over body to his commission. if you look on page two
oh one one through twenty one. it gives you the extent instances they
can use a standard secondary rate increase is limited to a few of the
last lines of the bill is limited to five, so the total annual service
revenue grew by the commission again, the commission have to prove all
this out.staff the commission is with this and I estimate for the bill

further discussion further by not a question of what else is the past.
it's about three cents two thousand seven ten is amended on its second

Condition of the childcare center to include the permanent locations of
the girls and boys clubs, which of course provide after school track out
and summer programs for children. I know from committee and other
discussions i have with members that some people have issue with the sex
offender registry and restrictions. I want you to know that this bill
doesn't change who is required to register, it just ads locations of
boys and girls clubs who the prohibitions, and its only 1000 feet, id
ask for your support
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Further discussion further debate. Representative
Brandon please state your purpose.
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Ask the bill sponsor a question
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Representative Jackson does the gentleman yield
(SPEAKER CHANGES)I yield
(SPEAKER CHANGES)The Gentleman yields
(SPEAKER CHANGES)As somebody looked at how many of these boys and girls
clubs that are around homeless shelters i have a serious problem with my
homeless shelters and these folks that are considered sexual offenders,
they actually don't have a place to stay because there is some type of
childcare thing out there, and people have been strategically moving
them and i don't want those , i mean has anybody looked to see if the
boys clkubs are around there. Because i would rather them be somewhere
then just absolutely wondering around and nobody knows where they are.
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Thank you representative Brandon, i have not had that
question put to me, i dont know that research has been done, i can tell
you this bill will not apply to anyone currently living in a location,
this would just apply to people moving to a location after the bill ??
(SPEAKER CHANGES)representative Dwayne Hall please state your purpose
(SPEAKER CHANGES)ask the sponsor a question
(SPEAKER CHANGES) Representative Jackson does the gentleman yield?
(SPEAKER CHANGES)I yield
(SPEAKER CHANGES)The gentleman yields
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Representative could you give me a list of other places
where registered people could not live or cannot live?
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Representative hall im not sure to answer this is just
to childcare centers we went to and looked at the definition yesterday,
it does apply to school age children.
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Can i speak to the bill mr speaker
(SPEAKER CHANGES)The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Registered sex offenders, its obviously the worst thing
on earth, we here that word we think of obviously pedophiles, but i have
done lots of criminal work and the people that are on this list, its not
always the first thing that goes to your head. One thing i hate on the
floors and stories, cause i don't think its the way we should legislate.
I say that and im  about to give you another anecdotal story. I
represented one person in an eviction proceeding, he was 45 years old
and he is on the register because when he was 18 years old, his 25 year
old girlfriend at the time accused him of rape. I mean i wasn't there
and obviously don't know what happened but he was facing more than a
decade in prison, and he was 18 and scared and he plead guilty to it.
This when i represented him, it was a quarter of a century after that, I
looked at his criminal record it was perfect, He had no driving record
he had nothing. He had a wife and 23 kids he had rented in the exact
same place for more than 10 years and he was being evicted because he
was on that list. This may be a good bill, i just want you to think
before you vote for it, because the list of places where a person can
live is so restricted right now, you cant live near a bus stop, you cant
live near a school. You cant live near a church a daycare center, there
is a long list of places where a student could or may be and its not
always the worst case senario your thinking of, there is loits of other
situations that put people on this list. And when you see all the
different circles, cities have circles, state law has places where you
cant live, some counties have that. There is almost no place that anyone
on this list can live anymore, so i hope you will think seriously when
voting for this bill.
(SPEAKER CHANGES)Further discussion further debate. If not the question
before the house is the passage of the house committee substitute to

If the commission finds out that indeed the - or the agency finds out
that indeed that information was correct they have to remove it form the
file, obviously if not it becomes a basis for a disciplinary action, you
can still grieve it at that point. Under section 7.5 this gives the OSP
director flexibility in requiring reports from his agencies. Section 7.6
and 7.7 that have been repealed are reporting issues. Section 8.1 is
significant, this gives the authority to the OSP and the agencies to try
and restructure and reorganize in the executive branch based on function
rather than strictly number of positions, and in order to do this in
section 8.2 there's something called a reorganization through reduction
program that's a voluntary program that employees can enter into if
they're asked to by their supervisors. It's kind of like a severance
thing, like IBM might offer some executives and early out package or
something like that, that's basically what we're talking about here.
If you'll notice that particular reorganization through reduction
program is designed to expire December 31, 2014. That's section 8.4
which probbaly on your version is at the top of page 15, it's at the
bottom of 14 on mine but I'm reading from something  had this morning
before I made the amendments. That was done for a specific purpose so
that this cannot become a golden parachute for governor's appointees.
They've got until December 31, 2014 to take advantage of this and do
their reorganization and after that this reduction - reorganization
through reduction program expires at that point. And then on page 15 in
our kinder gentler world in which we live we're making a name change.
Everything that is said state personnel up to this time will say human
resources after this point in time if this bill is passed. Mr. Speaker

result of the superintendents work group of things that they are asking
us to fix to help support public education and free them up to teach our
students and not be burdened with administrative pieces. It's a study of
exceptional children's services which we know is critical for the
success of these students. We want to comply with federal law and we
want to do the best thing for these kids, but we want to do it in the
simplest way possible. So we need to study that and make sure we have
the right balance of making good decisions for these kids but not taking
so much time to do it. So that's hat we're doing and I appreciate your

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Representative Martin, what
motivates one to do a study of this particular program?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for that question. This takes a lot of time
for teachers to go through the IEP process. I'm sure you have heard
that, but it is very important information to have an education plan for
each of these children. So we want to look at ways of improving that. If
we can use technology, have pull down menus, make sure we still have the
right information, but it's easier to work with.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Call out?? Mr. Speaker?

[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields. Ms. Martin is a former Special
Education teacher and director. I do know that our system, we do have
systems in place to do exactly what you just spoke of, electronic forms.
We do have a requirement, which is a federal requirement, and my concern
is we, we need to be real concerned about starting something that's a
federal mandate. Now I know we, we do have a outstanding, exceptional
Children's department, and the Department of Public Construction. And
I'm just concerned about trying to do something that's already in place,
in terms of service delivery. I, I do think our DPI does a great job,
and just, just was a little concerned about why we're starting something
that's in place and already mandated by the, by the federal government.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, and I appreciate your concern. This came as
a result of a request of the Superintendent, in terms of removing the
burdensome regulations. And if you recall, we ran a separate bill that
was removing the reporting requirements as the new power schools comes
online. But because, just the concern that you mentioned, this is not
something we feel like we can easily address, which is why we are
bringing the various stakeholders to the table and trying to meet it
that way, by taking a look at it.

in a very thorough, comprehensive manner, and certainly with respect to
the multitude of situations that we have to make sure we honor. And this
is for the betterment of making public education more effective and
efficient, and the federal aspects will certainly be well studied so

structured sentencing here in North Carolina that requires mandatory

individual that has 10 Percocet pills, 10 milligrams of Oxycodone, 650
milligrams of acetaminophen, weighing 4 grams total.  Mandatory 70

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, thank you members.  This is a bipartisan bill
that unanimously passed JB twice and what it does is basically what the
title says, it allows the district attorney to petition the court to
freeze the assets of an asset who has scammed the elderly for 5000
dollars or more so that they don’t ?? their assets or secrete their
assets and allows the district attorney to use rule 65 to get a
restraining order and to essentially  pull those assets until the
criminal matter is resolved, it sets out the procedure to od that we
worked with the district attorney.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the house, this bill
comes to you directly from rules. I wish that it were a resolution,
rather than a bill, so that you could have the whole bill read to you,
but since it isn't, I would like to tell you a little about the genesis
of this bill. Representative Ramsey, Representative Moffitt, and I saw
an opportunity to honor the late Mary Nesbitt, who served in this body
in the 70s, and she was succeeded by her son, Martin Nesbitt, who is now
a Senator, who by the way, had nothing to do with this legislation, and
subsequently, after his moving to the Senate, I moved into that seat
here. The Nesbitts were very active in the Ashville community. Mary
Nesbitt taught me English in elementary school. This was of course,
before she came to the house. Her husband Martin Sr., was my principal
at the elementary school that I attended, and they just have long time
ties to the Ashville community. And as an Ashville native, I thought,
and my colleagues, Representative Moffitt and Representative Ramsey
thought that it would be fitting to have a building that is centered
around education, since they were both educators, be named after Mary
Nesbitt. And so that's the genesis of this bill that you see before you
today. There is so much more about this family and Representative Mary
Nesbitt in particular that I could tell you about, but I'm not going to
take up your time. I would just direct you to read the bill on the
dashboard at your leisure, and I ask for your support. Thank you very
much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ramsey, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just want to commend this bill to the body. Want to make it clear,
Senator Nesbitt had absolutely nothing to do about this. Representative
Fisher asked me did Senator Nesbitt know anything about this bill, and I
said &quot;Of course not.&quot;, and she said that don't you think we
ought to contact Senator Nesbitt and let him know about it. So, I called
Senator Nesbitt up. I said, &quot;Senator, would you mind we named the
?? Campus, that's a wonderful new campus in Ashville after your
mama?&quot;, and he said &quot;Lord no.&quot;. So, I think that it's
very appropriate to honor her for her contributions to her state and
education in western North Carolina, and I commend this bill to the
body.

ladies and gentleman, the reason for that, that bill is already over at

to Expand the List of Crimes For Which an Investigative Grand Jury Can

Representative Murry, please state your purpose.
To debate the bill.
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
This bill just puts another tool in the toolbox for our Attorney General
and our prosecutors to fight white collar crime. This expands the number
of crimes that an investigative grand jury can be convened, and you can
see the list. And in subsection I-124, Representative Stam helped me put
this together and I believe he has an amendment that I will support. And
I will be available for any questions if you have any.
Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
To offer an amendment.
The gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment, the clerk will
read.
Representative Stam moves to amend the bill on page two, lines 10
through 14 by rewriting those lines to read.
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
Mr. Speaker, members of the House, you can't really tell what the
amendment does by looking at it. So I'll tell you what it does. The
purpose of the bill is to get a good law enforcement tool for white
collar crime, and after our meeting of the Judiciary Committee,
Representative Queen came to me and suggested that there might be a
couple in there that might be a little over broad. And what this
amendment does is delete two crimes, each of which are only punishable
by misdemeanors, not even felonies. One of, one of them is called,
&quot;Secret listening,&quot; and the other is misuse of confidential
information. But of all the crimes there these are very minor and we
just don't want this important tool to be abused or misused, so I would
urge the adoption of the amendment and the bill.
Further discussion, further debate on the amendment? If not the question
before the House is the passage of the amendment supported by
Representative Stam for the House Committee substitute of House Bill
908. All in favor vote aye, all opposed vote no, the clerk will open the

this; that was found to be not the case. I just wanted to- we had it
clarified in January that that was not the case, but just for some

fines, or anything was imposed that they would not be held accountable

Allow Governing Boards of Certain Counties and All Municipalities
Located Within Those Counties to Give Electronic Notice. The General
Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McGrady, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, colleagues, there are...this bill and another bill right
behind it that are basically the same bills. I’m not going to be
speaking to the second bill specifically, but to understand the first
bill, you have to understand something about the second bill. If you
don’t remember anything else about these bills, remember that these are
local bills. They only apply to a number of counties and cities that are
listed in the bills. They’re not of statewide application. The Senate
Bill obviously passed the Senate and is over here, meanwhile, I had a
House Bill.
My House Bill, which is what I want to speak to now, basically would
allow the counties and cities that are listed in the bill to give
electronic notice for any matter which they now are required to publish
notice in a newspaper. Now, the bill is not mandatory. Meaning, the
county or city would not need to go totally electronic. A city within
one of these counties could decide that they want to continue to publish
in the newspaper. My expectation, actually, from talking to a number of
local governments is that they’re probably going to be a mixture of
things. A city will decide to publish some range of notices
electronically and then some range of things by print or in both
measures. For example, tax delinquents, I suspect, are going to get as
much play as the city or county could give them. Another thing to know
about House Bill 504 is that it doesn’t go into effect right away.
There’s a total phase in here. For a whole year...from October of this
year on, if they want to use electronic notice, they’ve got to publish
the fact that they’re moving to electronic notice in the paper. Short
term it’s going to have more notices in the paper. Please note the
availability of mailing. Anybody that wants a notice can simply ask for
it. And the city or county is required to mail by U.S. mail or
electronically, if that’s what they want, any of the notices that
someone might request. You’re going to hear, I suspect as we debate
this, one of the reasons to be against this bill is that we need more
transparency. That the media, the newspapers, provide a check and
balance on local governments that may not be providing notice or might
be hiding things. I would say to that, that if the new media is doing
its job, I would hope that they would pick up many of these notices or
all of them that of any attention and would in fact be printing them as
things of special note in the newspaper. The only difference is that we
won’t be needing to pay for them. Papers are going out of business.
Another argument that’s made is that we need...</p>

<p id="160:00">
To continue to do what we're doing because papers depend on the revenues
coming from local governments to continue to print. Well come on, papers
need to depend upon local government to subsidize them to print notices
that given their circulation and how it has continued to fall to sustain
themselves? I would suggest to you that is not the role of government
here. So my pitch to you is this, these are local bills. In every case
on the house bill that is before you what I did is I went to the
delegation and I asked those legislators whether they wanted their
county on the bill or they wanted their city on the bill.
And if a legislator objected as some of you know, for whatever reason, I
didn't put that county or municipality on the bill. And in fact the
amendments that are coming up, that is continuing to happen here. I have
a long list of people that would still like to be on the bill and I had
two or three counties that decided no we don't want to be on the bill.
So for example, Representative Ramsey has an amendment to take off a
county, Representative Hastings has an amendment to take off a county,
Representative Lee has an amendment to add back a county. I'm quite
amenable to that, I'm not trying to impose electronic notice on any of
your counties.
This is all about a local bill. There's nothing mandatory about this.
And I really would ask that all of us give deference to our colleagues
here and to the county commissions and city councils and mayors that
they represent. I handed out a typed handout, I want to correct one
thing on it. I've got Mooresville in there and it's really Morrisville.
Representative Starnes and others were quick to pick that out, you can
see it in the bill itself it was just I didn't proof it really quickly.
And the little chart I gave you is going to change based on the
amendments that we have. Representative, Mr. Speaker, and I've talked to
the various folks that have amendments, if we could really take
Representative Hastings or Representative Ramsey's amendment we can
clean up 504 and then I understand they'll be a motion made to
substitute another bill foo the one that's before us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hastings please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well Mr. Speaker I'm not really prepared to offer my
amendment at this time but...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would like to see if Representative McGrady would
yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McGrady, I think it was a mistake what
you said when you mentioned that you came to the members of the
delegation because I have not really spoken to you about this except for
tonight just a few minutes ago. So  think it was a mistake what you
said, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What had happened with respect to Gaston county is I
had former senator Clarey [SP] initially come to me and say that Gaston
county didn't want to be on. I told her no, that I wouldn't put Gaston
county on unless the legislators that represented Gaston county told me
that everybody was fine with it. Representative Torbett initially told
me that, that Representtive Bumgardner told me that and I understood and
I frankly don't remember Representative Hastings how I understood that
you were on it. But again, it doesn't matter because you can take them
off and I'm fine with Gaston county going off the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McGrady we're going to temporarily
displace this bill in the interest of moving through some of the bills
that I think are not controversial. We will come back to this bill,
there are 12 lights on at this time. House bill 491, the clerk will
read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is on the new supplemental calendar ladies and
gentleman.</p>

[speaker changes]
thank you speaker, ladies and gentleman of the house house bill 491
school resource offices in elite county is real simple we are taking the
existing resource officers SROs from the school board and we are putting
them under the sheriff's department we had this earlier today in
education we had a favorable report and i need your support on the bill
[speaker changes]
further discussion further debate on this bill. ladies and gentleman
there are lights on the chair is not clear if they were on for the prior
bill the chair assumes that there is no further discussion or debate
representative mcmanus please state your purpose
[speaker changes]
to debate the bill
[speaker changes]
the lady is recognized to debate the bill
[speaker change]
this morning we had the superintendent and the board chair from Lea
county schools come speak to committee both spoke against this bill and
asked us please not to do it. they have an in house sro school resource
officer program their officers are licensed law officers that have all
the authority of any other law officer including they can pursue
offenders off the campus of the schools. our school system in chadum
county does have sheriff deputies, while i love my sheriff and most of
his deputies are really top notch we have had some problems with the
SROs being through the sheriffs department. these are such things as we
had a sheriff's deputy arrest a student, handcuff him, and arrest him
and put him in a squad car for not turning in his cross country shorts.
he charged him with theft. we've had inappropriate relations with
deputies and students. we  have had deputies bring tobacco products and
use on our campuses in front of students. and we had all of our SROs
leave school during a lock down of three schools
[speaker changes]
representative bowls please state your purpose
[speaker changes]
are we talking chadum county or moore county on this bill? Lea county
[speaker changes]
well i'm talking about things that have happened with the sheriffs
department in our school system. and lea county has a in house program
of law officers with which they are very satisfied of which they do not
want to transfer the authority because once you do that you have limited
authority over those officers. Which when they are an in house system
and you are hiring them yourselves you have much greater control over
the SROs in your schools and they won't be called away when the sheriff
needs extra men somewhere else, especially during a lock down situation.
so i would advise you to please please vote against this bill
[speaker changes]
representative Cleveland please state your purpose
[speaker changes]
thank you mister speaker. when this bill was heard in committee the
education folks from Lea county said that they were never, weren't aware
of it, were never consulted, etc., etc. and as i sat there i thought to
myself that the country commissioners had a resolution to do this. and
if they had a resolution to do this they had to publish that they were
going to bring up this resolution at one of their meetings. and for the
educators in that county to come forward and tell us that they were not
aware of what was going on and didn't have any ability or opportunity to
discuss it; i think it's at best disingenuous. the county commissioners
wanted this. we heard it in committee, it was passed. we support the
bill.
[speaker changes]

him proposing this first type of fuel for representative from stone and
represented Manus, because does sound like you're facing difficult
challenges between the commissioners in the Board of Education in their
community, but for me at least what I came up here. I tried it all, some
philosophy of how to handle local what amounts to a local bill where
there was agreement in the delegation,and where the bill came from an
agreed-upon local community request. I've never voted against anybody's
bill of this war where the delegations divide and where the local
governing boards are divided on what appears to be a purely local matter
as a whole different concern and raises a series of issues. I still
would be a deferential, but for even with the division, but for the fact
that we'redoing something in this bill. we have never done before. this
bill is taking money given to the school system in a specific school
designated fund for a specific purpose and ordering the school to
transfer it to another agency, and this case the sheriff 's department
for use in part for the schools, and I feel again for represents don't
be if I happen to agree that SROs are better test under Sheriff 's
departments, but that's a judgement call, not a policy matter. here were
ordering the money to the sheriffs and ill use it in part in the schools
and in part for themselves. this is to me also transfer of money to help
build the sheriff 's budget because they want additional money for
additional positions, and they get the half part-time positions. this
way, by using school money, which is scarce to begin with, and in so for
me the combination of a divided delegation, a divided set of community
leaders and a procedure that opens a wholly dangerous precedent is him:
don't know and hope that the community can resolve this, we ought not be
involved in making this decision. in doing this is is is on many
grounds, but certainly the synergistic combination of all those not a
good way to handle this problem and so I'm bit about no and hope that
the community would come together and resolve this, we sure are not be
allowed to transfer between agencies in the way that this is set up to
do
is interlocutory stage of purpose is figure out yield others. thank you
they don't.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
it is recognized the tomato
misbegotten yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
thank you they firms in a battle of PlayStation purpose
to ask works at glacier question presented Blanchard is a gem and you
certainly don't announce that you think it represent
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
this is truly a question that you're not supposed to ask you when you
don't know the answer but in schools like wake County, where they have
the school resource officers. how is that funded Fred Feldman and I
don't know specific counties that I can respond. for example, my county
we have SROs and SROs refunded a couple of ways than one. the share of
the vote part of their budget to create SROs, as part of their
commitment to schools school safety. the second is the school system
that will authorize sometimes it's a shared position chairs negligence
on part of the money school system they put in part by vote of the Board
of Education. but it's a voteof the board to say were going to use this
fund to assist in this way here. what is you were. I think in another
committee, but here in education, the superintendent of the school board
shares at their absolute poster that's that's what creates the problem.
the agency that controls the money, as opposed to the positions on the
sharing and so let us dictating over the wishes of the school board
which I don't think happens happens anywhere else where thinking
presented offered was that your purpose. speak auto mobile. John is
recognized to write about biking this figure, clearly, this sure is the
person that I'll be running the SROs recalls. he has trained deputies
who knows how to train people look at the children and then the three
lots of it. I'll have anything to do the short to get them to do
something else. it's a good idea for the shark that have this authority
and most sure if you do not provoke the discussion thread about it. if
not a question of what houses the passage of the house may substitute
out of four ninety one hundred second reading out a re vote. I all does

Representative Faircloth, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is a relatively simple bill. It rises out
of the need of cities and counties to work in conjunction with the
state, Department of transportation and with utility companies to
provide for newly developed technology for public safety purposes on the
state highway system.  Within a city for instance, a city can put some
sort of law enforcement technology on their city streets but they can’t
put it on the state highways through the city without the approval of
the DoT’s. This simply provides for agreements between those entities,
and also for, provides for agreement between utilities and
municipalities when the entities own easements are used.  It provides
for public safety both for law enforcement and other related such as
fire suppression and EMT. Appreciate your support.

state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, this is to
debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has recognized to
debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Colleagues, this is the patient
safety bill. When you go into a hospital you will hear overhead pages,
this will standardize pages across the state. Just to give you an idea,
and these are pages within the same system that two different sites
within the system, two different hospitals. A code pink at one hospital
is an infant abduction, a code intercept at the other hospital is an
infant abduction. Code 909 is a bomb threat, code 5 at the other
hospital is a bomb threat. Code 0 is hostage, code H is hostage in the
other hospital. I can go on and on. There is no standardization of
emergency codes in hospitals. And as a visitor or patient you've heard
these pages, you've probably wondered what they mean. With the movement
of physicians across hospitals, staff that move from one hospital to the
other. This is actually a patient safety, and I recommend this bill for
your approval. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jordan, please state
your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Inquiry to the bill's sponsor. [SPEAKER

CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER

something that the hospital association, some private group can work out
to standardized, why does that need to be a state law? To provide that
kind of consistency? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The hospital association is
involved in helping craft this. I think that they've attempted it in the
past, but have not been very successful. But I don't know exactly the
answer to that question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further

bill past education overwhelmingly earlier today, it's a bill that would
allow a pilot program in ?? county for charter schools. Which is
designed specifically to capture children that have either dropped out
of high school or didn't return to high school. It's sole function is
that. We believe it's a good program, it's worked successfully in
Florida. It allows for three schools, there's two right now that we
believe will come to fruition, in ?? county. It is supported by the
Charlotte-?? county board of education. And DPI after making their
changes seemed okay with it. I know that Representative Hamilton has a
technical correcting amendment that I'm sure she will put forward and I
am sure I will support.</p>

Inquiring.
The lady may state her inquiry. The house will come to order.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, do you have any sense about Thursday yet?
Representative Adams, I mistakenly thought I was gonna move off a
controversial local bill to a non controversial local bill, that didn’t
work too well. But for the most part, I’ve had my staff look at the
queue of bills coming out. And the potential two day total is less than
the amount of bills that we disposed of today. So depending upon whether
or not any of them are in significant controversy, I know that some of
them are, but for the most part I’m optimistic that this won’t be a
midnight crossover for Thursday.
