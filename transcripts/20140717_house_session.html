The prayer this morning is a tribute to Thomas Jefferson and was
delivered in Washington DC on March 4, in 1801. It has been titled, “A
Prayer for the Nation.” Will you pray with me. Almighty God, Who has
given us this good land for our heritage; We humbly beseech Thee that we
may always prove ourselves a people mindful of Thy favor and glad to do
Thy will. Bless our land with honorable ministry, sound learning, and
pure manners. Save us from violence, discord, and confusion, from pride
and arrogance, and from every evil way. Defend our liberties, and
fashion into one united people the multitude brought hither out of many
kindreds and tongues. Endow with Thy spirit of wisdom those to whom in
Thy Name we entrust the authority of government, that there may be
justice and peace at home, and that through obedience to Thy law, we may
show forth Thy praise among the nations of the earth. In time of
prosperity fill our hearts with thankfulness, and in the day of trouble,
suffer not our trust in Thee to fail; all of which we ask through Jesus
Christ our Lord, Amen.

A question of privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for a point of personal
privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, today's
date, being July 17th, marks the 50th anniversary of a group of
paratroopers who embarked upon Camp McCall, North Carolina, July 17th,
1944. There were seven officers, and 165 enlisted men who became
paratroopers for the very first time. This unit, the distinguishing
character about this unit is that they were an all black unit. The first
black paratroopers for the United States of America. And they were
appropriately called the 5-5-5, the 555th unit. They later became known
as The Triple Nickels. The Triple Nickels have been famous throughout
the United States, as they served in World War II, in Korea, in Vietnam,
Afghanistan, Iraq, and they still exist; they're no longer an all black
unit, but they still exist with pride. And I happened to know several
survivors of the 5-5-5 back in World War II, and it's, it gives me
pleasure to recognize them on the floor today. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
