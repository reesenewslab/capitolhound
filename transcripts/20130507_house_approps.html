<p id="05:00">
I’m going to go through a few of the slides in case you have not seen
them yet, on… that the Governor and the Secretary used in the
announcement of this initiative and proposal, and it’s entitled
‘Accelerating Infrastructure Investments for Economic Growth through a
Strategic Mobility Formula’, and to set the stage, we have been using
our existing trust fund revenues and existing formula since 1989, and
when the Governor gave us the charge of developing a 25 to 30 year total
and synchronized infrastructure plan that would not just deliver
transportation but better coordinate transportation with the elements
that are important in infrastructure and economic development, and that
that he cited for us directly was water, power and communications and
transportation, in working with economic developers, how do we better
synchronize those efforts? Because we can’t be everything everywhere, so
how do we strategically make sure that all of those elements are working
together across the state and not at cross-purposes? One of the problems
that we identified, and I’m sure you’re already aware by 2030 we
anticipate 50% population growth in North Carolina. In the short-term in
the ten years from today, we anticipate that we’ll have 1.3 million
increase in population over that next ten years. Simultaneously, our
three main revenue sources are motor fuels, DMV fees and highway use
taxes. Of those three, the most significant one’s 60% comes from motor
fuels, which we anticipate will continue to decline on average at 2% per
year over the next ten years, so that will equal about a 1.7 billion
dollar total reduction in revenues over the next ten years during the
same time period we will see a 1.3 million population increase, which
leads us to what the Secretary calls and is illustrated here the
“infrastructure gap” that will not allow us to pursue better integration
with business and all the elements of infrastructure and development as
we’d like. So as we’re developing our 25-year plan, we want to make sure
we have the right framework to deliver that plan, and one of the
challenges we see now is with declining resources. We’ll be able to do
less than we can today unless we change our current system and revenue
sources. So part of the problem, as I said, is the revenue sources are
limiting as we move forward. One of them, highway use, at the 3% sales
on motor vehicles will slightly grow; however, that’s the one that has
been hit the hardest with the recession. In the first two years of the
recession, we saw 20% decrease in those revenues. So the challenge for
us is how do we do that. Being the tenth-highest motor fuels tax state
in the nation today, we can’t just increase the rates. We have to look
out and say “What do we need to do in the future in transportation?” and
relying just on those three we believe is not the right answer. However,
our citizens know that before they’ll agree to any change in rates and
sources, we have to show that we’re as efficient as we possibly can be,
and we want to address the efficiency part first, so this slideshow’s
part of that. Closing that gap will be from new and different revenues,
but the other part will be from what I’m going to go over today and
introduce you to, and that’s what we’re calling the ‘strategic mobility
formula’. And so in simple, the proposal is that we will move our
maintenance and operations accounts to the highway fund now. Now there’s
a blend of maintenance and operations across both funds, and in the
trust fund, that will be our capital program to deliver all our capital
needs across the state irregardless of mode of transportation, and the
proposal is that of those resources in the trust fund, we will allocate
them 40% to a statewide level of competition for projects that meet
criteria across the state. 40% of those revenues will go to each of the
seven regions across the state, so you’ll get a regional distribution,
and then 20% will go to each of the 14 divisions that we have that have
been in existence since 1989. In our analysis that got</p>

<p id="10:00">
that got us to this point. We looked at that kind of structure, and we
said okay, how do we believe our projects will fare and what kind of
projects will be selected, and we looked at the projects that are
currently in the draft, 10 year program and resource plan, or the
transportation improvement plan, and then we looked at what the
potential would be using this proposal. And summary, and we did this
using something called the &quot;Transportation and Economic Development
and Infrastructure System,&quot; which is called TREDIS, which is a
software package that we use to evaluate programs and projects. And
running TREDIS through all of these projects in this analysis, we come
up with, in the current plan we were delivering about 175 projects, and
TREDIS estimates that will produce 174,000 both short term, which is
primarily the construction and supporting industry related jobs, and
long term jobs, 174,000 total, and then TREDIS also predicts, as we run
it through all the candidate projects that we would anticipate could be
selected just on the quantitative scores, not the inputs from the locals
that you'll hear about later. We anticipate that using those funds in
the trust fund, that would deliver about 260 projects over 10 years, for
a total of about 240,000 short term and long term jobs. And so with the
Governor's focus for us for how do we improve our synchronization with
all of these infrastructure elements across the state, and how are we
better partners in economic development and jobs creation, we believe
that this proposal will do that, and in summary I believe that it's
primarily the cause if its focus on improving travel time across the
state, whether that's travel time in an existing urban congested
corridor, or travel time from a small mill town that now is looking for
its economic opportunities outside of that mill village in areas where
jobs are growing and they are struggling to maintain those jobs. And so
with that, Rep. Brawley, I would turn it back over to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, General.
At this time, Mr. Chairman, I would appreciate it if you would recognize
Rep. Torbett for an amendment. If we could have the lights back on

Representative: ..a remedy to some of the concern we heard to monies
allocated at the local level. Essentially, what it does, it takes the
division of funds from 40-20 to 40-30-30, which, of course, adds an
addition 10% at the local level, and removes 10% at the regional level.
That pretty much explains it Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
Speaker: Representative Brawley?
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chair. There were several members that
raised concerns and wanted to offer amendments: Representative Wilkens,
Shepherd, and others. There was concern that not enough money being
under control at the division level, that the more rural areas may be
somewhat shorted in the funds. The way allocations are done in projects:
the statewide projects are going to be driven completely by data;
regional projects, which are two paired districts, were 70% data, 30%
local; a district project is 50% data, 50% local decision. Projects that
are approved at a higher level can be funded at a lower. A state project
can be funded by regional and district money; a regional project could
be funded from regional and district money as well. So putting more
money in control of local folks does not impact the ability of worthy
regional projects from drawing support in being funded, but it does
allow the local units to have more protection from concerns of the money
being all sucked up in a few projects. Now along with this, already in
the bill there is a cap that no single project can take more than 10% of
the available money. So we were hopeful that this would address some of
the concerns members may have. That districts that did not have a
Charlotte or a Raleigh in it may be short changed on road money. I would
recommend the approval Mr. Chairman.
Speaker: Representative Wilkens?
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chair. I do support this. it is a good
starting point to try to address concerns that it think rural folks
ought to have. I am about as country as it gets. Mr. Chair, I thank
Representative Brawley and Tourbit in particular for the way they worked
with me as they said they would. This does not allay every fear that I
have on the impact on rural areas, and we will see that going forward.
Thank you Mr. Chair.
Speaker: Further questions or comments on the amendment? Seeing none,
all those in favor of the amendment say aye [aye], all opposed, no
[silence]. The aye’s have it and the amendment is adopted. At this time,
Representative Brawley, before we would take some additional amendments,
I would like to open it up if there are any questions with regard to
General [xx]’s presentation on behalf of the members? Representative
Cleveland?
Representative: Thank you Mr. Chairman. The general mention does this
tretis system that they are using, I have not heard of this system prior
to this strategic investing coming forth. Is it something we have been
using in the past and we just never talked about it, or are we building
something new here?
Representative: No, sir, it is commercially available. It originally
came out of Harvard University, then a spin off company made it better,
based out of Cambridge, MA. We have been using it to prioritize our
loops and the strategic mobility fund projects, like [xx] river bridge
in the past, and we have been using it internally, but now we are
proposing to use it to evaluate our programs to make sure that we are
getting the economic impact out of our programs that we think. So we
have been using it internally, but this is the first time we have
proposed to use it to show it as part of the benefits in programs and
projects.
Representative: Mr. Chairman, follow up? So what you are telling me is
that the department is comfortable that this program</p>

It is viable and will be something that's gonna produce what you say its
suppose to produce. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir at this point,I think at
this point my only reservation right now, its calibrated with national
level data. And one of the things we wanna do, and so its predictions
are based on national level trends. What we wanna do is calibrate it for
North Carolina and one option is we can start collecting data on
projects as we award them and then see how they evolve through time.
Which would be a very long and time consuming process. The other options
we are looking at is to go back 10 or 15 years ago and then every 5
years see what happened through that time and sort of calibrate it from
historical data. And thats the direction that we're moving. To make sure
we calibrate it before we use on a very robust method. For North
Carolina. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brisson.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr Chair. General, would you mind just touching and giving a
short update on how different the money is with this proposal in rural
areas and what it will be with the new proposal. The way its funded now
and the way its actually funded in the future. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir
I don't know, do they have any handouts. Where there any left over? Are
there any hand outs? I didn't see what was in your packed so I dont know
if you have any. Well I can tell you basically the way we had allocated
funds in the past is to the regions and then to the divisions within
those regions. This basically is the same amount of money plus about 700
and 50 millions dollars more every 5 years. Because of the fact that
we're moving the power bill allocation from. Part coming from high way
fund and part coming from trustfund over to the high way. Is that
they'll be another 750 that w cannot spend on road way improvements we
will be spending on roadway improvements. However we didn't have a
statewide pot. The only statewide pot that we had previously was the
mobility fund which is only 58 million a year. And then lukes but that
wasn't a statewide allocation that was only to the 10 Luke eligible
cities. So by accumulating all of that money, I think across all the
regions from their historical allocation they'll be on average about 100
million dollar's less direct but with that statewide allocation you'll
more than offset that by about 2 more billion dollars roughly. That
everyone can be eligible for on that statewide competition. And I see
all the regions having the capability o competing because everyone of
them has projects that I believe would score well in a statewide
competition. And then each of the divisions will have a equal amount of
ability to do so.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr Chairman [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow
up [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you mr chairman so in that pot could that pot
be transferred maybe back. Or is it there for specifically that you sent
it and it would be used in the rule. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This is basically
each allocation is to. Like the statewide is for all divisions to
compete for and all projects to compete for. Then the region is only the
projects coming out of those pair of divisions compete for those
regional dollars and that division level only projects within that
division. And so theres no transfer capability other than we still have
an incentive for if you wanna bring other funds. Like local i mean
purely local like municipal funds or if you have a toll project that
everyone in the region wants and you agree to that. Theres an incentive
provision that allows you to get half of that money back to the projects
in your division for doing that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Vowler
I believe you wanted to comment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr
chairman. If you look on page 31 of the bill near the back. When it gets
to the actual formulas being used the DOT has to report back to the join
transportation oversight committee no later than August 15, again no
later than October 1st ..</p>

And finally section point, 7.1 provides the effective date July 1st and
provides that this bill would not become effective unless the General
Assembly appropriates funds in the operations, the current operations
act to implement the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Questions from committee
members and I had, I already had a few names down. Representative
Baskerville. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. Question for either
the bill’s sponsor or General Tragon/g if that’s okay. I represent a
district that has more than one MPO in it. It’s a rural district but we
are included in an MPO with larger municipalities like Raleigh My
question to the bill’s sponsor or General Tragon/g is are the funds that
are appropriated to the MPOs, are all of those funds competed for
equally by all areas that are inside the MPO? Are there dedicated funds
only for that MPO? And then if other areas that are a part of that MPO
but in a different highway division, are they not entitled to try to
compete for those funds? Is that making any sense? [SPEAKER CHANGES] A
very technical question and I will try not to give you too long and
complicated answer. First there’s only one special category of funds
that go directly to MPOs and those are Federal funds and they’re called
STPDA or direct attributable funds. So they’re a very, very small
portion of what we’re talking about. This is all state and Federal
transportation funds, but very small percentage funds go directly to the
MPOs. There is no direct funds going to RPOs. So that’s not part of
Federal law nor state law. If a project is in an MPO or an RPO boundary,
irregardless of which division that’s the projects that they will rank
and put their points on projects in their boundary. So it’s irregardless
of, if there’s two divisions that split an MPO or RPO, and MPOs and RPOs
do not overlap. So there’s no duplication here. There’s no conflict.
They will rank those projects and purpose those projects within their
boundaries only. And there’s no conflict with the funding. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Mr. Chair. Thank you. So. All
right. The capital area MPO receives about $13 million in STP funding
and TA funding? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. STPDA. That’s direct attributable
dollars from the Federal government. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you have one
[CROSSTALK] follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] One more follow up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Right. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Would my county of Vance county be
able to compete for that $13 million? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No because the
Federal government says it goes directly to that MPO. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Insko. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. And I, I
have, I think I’m gonna to follow up on the same line of questions
that’s been going. It has to do with the money that, that is competed
for. And I’m, I’m, I’m assuming that what happens is that there are
various projects that come within each region and they compete against
each other. The regions don’t compete against each other. The, the
competition is within each region. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct.
And just as a note to Representative Baskerville this bill will no
impact with that Federal MPO money. It, it can’t any impacts. So the
issue that you’re addressing while real is totally beyond the scope of
our bill to effect. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And a follow up Representative
Dollar? [SPEAKER CHANGES] One follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And the, the
decision will be made at the local level or at the state level? Will the
decision be made by the MPOs or on, on the competition? How? When, when
the projects come in, they get ranked, they compete against each other</p>

<p id="35:00">
Who does that ranking? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I thank the representative for
a question. On the regional projects, seventy percent of the scoring for
the project will be based on data-driven criteria. Thirty percent will
be on the weighting by the MPOs and the local government bodies. On the
district projects, fifty percent of the ratings will be purely on data,
and fifty percent on the deliberations of the political bodies. And
those will be within the regions and within the districts respectively.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Queen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. My concern is I represent the mountain region of our state,
and we have certain demographics that sometimes get overlooked in ??. We
are relatively, have a relatively low population, but our highway
projects are through the mountains. And they're very expensive. And
we've had some federal Appalachian funds that have been allocated to our
region, both due to the fact that our region is often considered poor
and needing funds and the highways projects are expensive in this area.
And I worry about those federal funds being put in a statewide basket
and then allocated on criteria that, again, sort of neutralize the
intent of having those federal funds in Appalachia. So, how do you
anticipate dealing with our dilemma of getting our projects funded out
west? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brock. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well,
there are two parts to the answer. Number one, the Appalachian highway
funds are not touched by this so that all of those federal dollars are
remaining exactly where they are, and the projects are not impacted. One
of the other changes is statewide prioritization of unpaved roads versus
county-by-county prioritization. The west has more unpaved roads as a
percentage than do other areas of the state, which will allow DOT to
pave more roads in the mountains. Currently, there are a lot more dirt
roads in the mountains than there are in the rest of the state. And you

[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're going to be in much better shape on Corridor K.
You know, your problem is with the federal government up there on
environmental issues and what have you. Any further questions at this
time? I want to get back to the amendments. Representative Floyd?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, maybe if we can do it at another time or at
this particular point of time. I know we keep talking about MPOs. And
there's many municipalities that have some concerns about how it's
operate. And it may have effect, you know, some of this information
that's in this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for the comment.
Representative Bumgardner. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
That's one of the questions I had about this issue with the MPOs and the
fact that we're voting on a bill that, it says here, &quot;The
department shall report by August 15th.&quot; This is May. We're voting
on a bill, and we don't yet know how the information that makes the
determination is going to be determined. We don't know where it's going
to come from. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman's correct. It has not been completed. It will be
reviewed by the general assembly. I think the difficulty with delaying
the bill until we have it is I don't intend being in session in August.
And I'm certainly hopeful the rest of us are all back home in the
district too. Now, transportation oversight will view it. This does not
go into effect until, with its full force, until 2015. So, parts of it
will start in 2013, and the funding will need to go forward. This is a
framework. This is not complete document. But the additional formulas,
the implementation language will all come back before</p>

One second please.  One point of note, also is this applies to the
division category, and all divisions are based on equal share, so this
creates another formula to say that a portion of the equal shares would
therefore be distributed to the RPOs.  Those amount to be $1.4 million
in divisions 1 and 4, $1.9 million in 2 and 3, $3.4 in 5 and 6, $2.7 in
7 and 9, $3.1 million in 8 and 10, and $1.8 million in 11 and 12, and
$1.4 million in division 13 and 14.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Chairman, I'd like to ask that this amendment be
defeated for a couple of reasons.  It would make more sense if we had
not changed the allocation at the division level, but we've increase the
money that the divisions have.  While it's 10% of the total, it's a 50%
increase of the money that's directly under the control of the division,
and that's more than $16 million, so we've already more addressed this
issue.  Part of the justification being it's not spot safety.  What I
would just ask is that this be defeated.  This issue's been addressed by
Representative Torbett's amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Adams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chair.  I was just going to ask if the
sponsor, or someone could identify those numbers by county, I'm just
wondering if my county's in one of those numbers somewhere.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I think you're a donor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I thought so.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I think that's what you wanted to know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Absolutely, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Further questions?  Further questions or comments on
the amendment?  Seeing none, all those in favor of the amendment say
aye.  All those opposed say no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The no's have it, and the amendment is not agreed to.
The next amendment is Amendment Number 3, ARW-28, Version 2, and before
I recognize Representative Bumgardner to present his amendment, I will
remind the committee, I think there are a couple of other people who
wanted to send some amendments up here, we will vote on this bill at
9:45, so we will have a vote on this bill at 9:45.  Representative
Bumgardner, you're recognized to explain your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  This amendment is a simple,
friendly little amendment that keeps my district from becoming a part
of, what I hate to see happen, and that is a North Carolina kind of
turning into a toll road state.  And I would like to avoid that if I
possible can, and I would love to have a recorded vote on this
amendment, Mr. Chairman, a I ask you to support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mrs. Cameron could address the fiscal impact.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To give a brief understanding of what this amendment
does, this amendment essentially says the Garden Parkway can be built,
it can be tolled, but the only state funds allowable is through the
division dollars, the division needs category.  DOT estimates this
project will cost the state $541 million, this is outside of toll
revenues, based on the 40-30-30 split, in a 5 year period, the division
will have access to $181 million.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Brawley is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Bumgardner and I have had a lot of
discussions about the Garden Parkway, also known as the Gaston East-West
Connector.  This is a very controversial road in Gaston County.  It's
divided the county.  There are people on both sides, I understand the
Representative Bumgardner  wants to kill this project and I'm
sympathetic to it.  My difficulty with this is this is not about tolls,
this is about legislating the outcome of a road that has not yet been
decided by the local people.  It</p>

Is politics deciding roads, not data deciding roads, and it defeats the
very purpose of this bill. I ask you to defeat this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, Just to representative
Hastings over here, just a point of interest. I'm not trying to leave
your committee or get out of votes but we do have rules at 9:30 so I
just wanted to get an excuse to go to rules committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If a member needs to leave for a purpose then they'll
be able to leave for their purposes. Representative Jeter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I could just make a brief comment on the amendment.
One of the things I think that's so brilliant about this concept is it
does away with statutory set asides, more commonly referred to as
earmarks. Earmarks can work both ways. They can mandate a project or
they can mandate the elimination of a project. To me we've got to go
away from that process. This amendment puts us right back to what I
think we're trying to avoid and I don't think it's something that we
should pass.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Other members wishing - Representative Bumgardner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. This amendment is not a
mandate, it simply says - it's a suggestion on how things could be done,
that's all it is. And I ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further comments? Representative Harrison.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair, I've been watching this debate
about this project for years. I think that this is a good amendment and
I'd urge members to support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further - Representative Pittman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I personally believe we need
to move away from toll roads altogether. This is a good opportunity to
start doing that so I'm going to support this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further comments? Representative Brawley.
Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thanks. I'm opposed to this amendment. I voted with
representative Bumgardener a couple of days ago when he was taking the
high road with the tie-in [??] amendment in finance, but here he's doing
the exact opposite. Again I agree with representative Brawley, we don't
need mandates from the legislature to DOT to mess up the data driven
decisions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Avila. Further comments? All in favor
of the amendment say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed say no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The aye's clearly have it, the aye's have it and the
amendment is not a - excuse me, the no's have it and the amendment is
not agreed to. Sorry. Just seeing if you're on your toes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Amendment number four, representative Bungardener.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I ask for a division on that vote please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think that in the interest of time and the clarity
of the vote I don't think that we need to do that at this time.
Representative McGrady is recognized to send forward amendment number
4MAH12 version 1.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. My amendment I hope I view it
as just a transparency amendment. We're now going to a really data
driven process and if that's so then I think its important that folks be
able to figure out what that data is, how the scoring is done, the
calculations and modelling processes that are involved. And so that's
what my amendment does. I just want to give a shot out to representative
Glazier and I were working on the same amendment and so he allowed me to
ruin [??] it. But this bill has nothing to do with formulas or anything
else, it's just to make sure that the process is transparent.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would the gentleman yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] IO yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would it be of the gentleman's intent that discussions
on the models interim [??] things in the process of discussion would be
revealed, or is it the intent of the amendment that when a project is
rating the rating score and process behind that be revealed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All of the process leading up to whatever the final
result is, I understand there will be drafts and all of that. I'm
looking to see what the final result is, the final data, the final
scoring is, not the whole process that goes forward.

my concern is not a lack of transparency in the bill but a fact of too
much premature disclosure of some of the things that we are working
through, of the problems that have not been solved.  I mean in all
candor I think that the idea that we wear coats is good in the General
Assembly and ties because if I didn't have coat you would see how my
belly done lopped over my belt.  There is full disclosure of the
important information but some processes, people need to be able to
speak freely without everything they say being broadcast to the entire
world so would I would ask is that the committee not support the
amendment, that we go forward with coming back to the General Assembly
which will publish before enactment of the proposed rules once they have
been developed and if we want to talk about putting the information on
the projects with scoring sheets which are public, that's a different
issue.  That's not what this bill does so I would ask that you defeat
the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ramsey.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, I am not sure if this is a question for the bill sponsor
or the ?? of the amendment.  Would there be a legal basis for someone
litigating the scoring of these projects, arguing we didn't follow
statute because what we are getting into, since we have a data driven
process, are we creating another basis for litigation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can I recognize staff to respond to that, Mr. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Perry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  If the department didn't follow statutory
processes that have been enacted as currently the case, they could be
challenged, of course.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brawley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have had some conversations with environmental groups that have
challenged roads, not on environmental paperwork saying the roads
shouldn't be built for environmental reasons but simply because it
wasn't done in complete accordance with the law.  Currently there are
two roads in my general area that are being delayed because the
paperwork on the environmental assessment of the Monroe bypass was
challenged in court and found to be deficient.  If we set up an excess
of reporting requirements of all the information, yes, road projects
will be challenged based on the paperwork not being done correctly and
roads delayed which otherwise would have been built simply because we
didn't properly follow all of the notice requirements so I am actually
seeing roads delayed for no other reason than the paperwork was done
wrong.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I guess, I need clarification on when these
formulas are used and the reporting is asked for. Section 6.1, the
formulas there, I am assuming are the ones we developed and are going to
be used across the board for any project, is that correct?  Okay,
initially when I read the amendment I was under the assumption that they
were asking about disclosure after the fact so people could see how it
was done and why that particular project was ruled  over another and not
that you would disclose that sort of information before you would even
begin the process.  Is that what we are talking about?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me recognize staff to respond to that question, Ms. Cameron.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  I am ?? Fiscal Research. DOT has a prioritization
office which is leading this effort and they have a work group formed
with NPO's, RPO's, representatives of the counties and the cities and
their deadline is to formulate these scores for highways plus the
non-highway modes and report this to the Board of Transportation in July
of this year to report to the Legislature in August.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stevens.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair and I think I am following up on what
Representative Avila said.  Would it be a more palatable amendment to
the sponsor if really what we are looking for is data scores and
calculations that were used to determine which project would be approved
and it would only come out afterwards but not necessarily the modeling
process in advance</p>

Only a disclosure afterwards of the calculations scores that were done.
I don't know the word, modelling process needs to be there and if it's
made clear that it's only after the project has already been granted.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I will recognize General Trogdon right back here to
respond.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Jim Trogdon, DOT. It may be helpful if I explain what
we currently do and then everyone can understand that. What we're
proposing to go out to all of our NPO's, RPO's, through our work group
to first gather the factors that need to be used for the state wide
level of competition, then regional and then each division. Then once we
get agreement on those factors and weights then we'll go and actually
apply those to all the projects, and we have 2000 projects in our
project list today. We'll apply those factors to those projects and do
all the measures based on those factors. Send those back out to all of
the NPO's and RPO's first to verify our date and the measures that we
get, then we'll run all the analysis, then send that back out for them
to rank them. Both of their votes on the factors and the ranking will be
public because each of the NPO's has a public agenda and those will be
public meetings, and they'll post those as well with their agenda items.
Then once we get the rankings back we'll come back again, now this will
be after January but we'll come back again with all the rankings and all
the data. And then we post all of that on our website and well, and then
we produce our ten year program.
So there's probably I would say at least three or four major
opportunities for public engagement through this process awareness, and
then we make sure we maintain all of this on our website at anytime for
any public level information. Whether it's an individual. Whether it's
an interest group, it makes no difference. So we have an extensive plan
and that's exactly what we've been executing and it's been successful
and so we don't propose changing that because we believe that kind of
engagement and openness is necessary to achieve significant broad-base
support across out state. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bumgardener.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, thank you Mr. Chairman. It seems to me like
the point of this entire bill is openness and transparency and so more
information is better and this amendment seems too be in trying to help
more information become available sooner and I support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Faircloth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, if I may ask a question of the
amendment sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McGrady, it seems very difficult to sit
here and vote for something that would not make things available to the
public. I'm reading your amendment to say that after a decision has been
made the process and the data and everything, as the general was just
saying, used to make that decision would then be public. Is that the
intent of your memo?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're correct in your understanding. I'm just trying
to get to not all the work papers and anything that led up to but when
we get up to the point when decisions are being made upon some set of
data then I wan to make sure it's transparent. Now General Trogdon's
comments would suggest that the department is already fully compliant
with my amendment, and if so then I again don't see what the issue is
with the amendment. I don't know if I've been responsive to your
questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The amendment's sponsor has pulled the amendment at
this time. We have one final amendment.</p>

<p id="70:00">
[Speaker Changes] And Representative Baskerville, you’re going to have
to explain this one very quickly. Amendment number 5, AMH 13, version 1.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Chair. Highway divisions are allocated a
certain amount of money from the federal government. If you are a small
area and you are part of a highway division that also includes big
MPO’s. Only those big MPO’s are going to be able to compete for a
certain amount of that money that comes into your highway division. For
example, I am in division 5, henderson, north Carolina. That includes
Durham, Carboro, Chapel Hill, and Raleigh. Thirteen million dollars that
comes down to division five has to go to Raleigh. Three million dollars
has to go to Durham Carboro, so that leaves four million dollars out of
the 21 million dollars left for that highway division for all other
areas in division 5. If we move the federal surface transportation
program funds and the federal transportation alternative funds into the
exempt status from the transportation funding formula. All the areas in
the is highway divisions will be able to compete for the funds.
Otherwise, the little guys that are in these big MPO’s are not going to
be able to compete, they are going to be left behind. And so that is the
purpose of this amendment. I know a lot of you are similarly situated,
and i ask for your support.
[Speaker Changes] Miss Cameron is recognized from the state.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Chair. From the fiscal perspective,
number 8 totals about 61 million a year, number 9 totals about 5 million
a year. And therefore if you look at the handout that gives you the 40,
30, 30 distribution this will reduce the statewide category by 26.4
million dollars in the regional and division categories by 19.8 million
dollars each year.
[Speaker Changes] Further questions, comments on the amendment?
Representative Brawley, briefly.
[Speaker Changes] Yes, I think this is another one where a lot of places
are just turning into donors. This is addressing the same issue that was
addressed by the change in the percentage and I would ask for the defeat
of the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] All those in favor say aye. All those opposed say no.
[Speaker Changes] No.
[Speaker Changes] The no’s clearly have it and the amendment is not
agreed to. We are back on the bill and I failed to recognized
Representative Michaux earlier. If you can make it brief Representative,
we will try to get you in before the vote.
[Speaker Changes] I appreciate that Mr. Chairmen. But I’m confused a
little but because I understood Representative Brawley or someone to say
that what we’re going is passing a bill thats going to set up some
regulations that have to come back and vote on later on to put into
effect. Did i hear that right?
[Speaker Changes] Representative Brawley.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Michaux, I said that the DOT will bring
back the implementing regulations and and if we don’t approve of them,
we certainly have the adoption of changing them in statute. But I think
if they come back with the regulations and we’re okay with them, they
would not be voted on, they would just be approved by the joint
transportation oversight. I think that is more accurately reflecting the
process. But what I did want to make clear was this is not a case of we
pass this bill and at that point its completely hands off and we don’t
know whats going to happen until it does. DOT will have to come back and
consult and get permission, at least from a subset of the house before
moving forward.
[Speaker Changes] So, I’ll be quick Mr. Chairmen.
[Speaker Changes] Brief follow up.
[Speaker Changes] Yeah, so I guess my problem is, does anything go into
effect once they work out these plans and these problems, I guess thats
my question.
[Speaker Changes] Do you have a brief response for that?
[Speaker Changes] Not until 2015.
[Speaker Changes] Alright. Representative Iler is recognized for a
motion.
[Speaker Changes] Mr. Chairmen, I move that the committee substitute for
house bill 817 as amended and rolled into a new committee substitute be
given a favorable report unfavorable to the original.
[Speaker Changes] You have heard the motion, further discussion, further
debate? All those in favor...</p>

<p id="75:00">
of the motion please signify by saying aye. All opposed signify by
saying no. The ayes clearly have it. The motion is agreed to and, before
we adjourn the committee, we will likely have a meeting this Thursday of
the full Appropriations Committee at 8:30. We're trying to work through
those bills that might need to make crossover, so just have that for
planning purposes. Thank you. We're adjourned.</p>
