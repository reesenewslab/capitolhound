Thank you mr. President and members of the senate, good morning. Just to
let you know the joint unemployment insurance commission has been paying
particular attention to the D.E.S and I'll give you great report from
where we were with a 2.7 billion dollar deficit. As of just recently we
have reduced it to a billion or less. We're on our way to meeting our
mark of november of 16' where we will have paid the debt of and still
tok care of all the unemployed that we need to, in regard to that. So
that's some great news in putting our financial house in order and back
to solvency. 1069 is a continuation of the efforts to improve the
efficiency of mr. farlow has done a very goo job over there, in
administering the devision of employment security. There were a couple
of issues that we to pay particular attention to and one of them was to
make sure that the u.i claim information confidentiality  was
maintained. You'll see that in the bill. Were also necessary for us to
identify, to minimize what was fraud within the system using the social
security number and the photo i.d. and being sure that the people who
were, indeed, asking for the benefits are the same ones that received
it. There was a clarification that the d.e.s had the authority to
garnish and attach credit card receipts to receive money from businesses
that did not pay there unemployment insurance fees as we tried to make
sure that it was run properly and there was also a portion that we added
yesterday in an amendment that was explained during the j comity
yesterday that stablished a system for the in depended commission which
is designed to give another layer of review for the claimants to have a
rotating, the three members off and on, with confirmation from the
general assembly.</p>

?? is recognized,
Speaker Changes:one of our greatest assets in North Carolina is ?? what
this bill does is modernizes the business quote making it even better
quotes by adding clarity and predictability so that our business is what
to expect we modeled much of the legislation for passage after the ??
which is the goals stands of the business predictable law of north
Carolina.predictability is credibly important for all people in all
business.The second part of the business is also modeled after
legislation Delaware and other strong business states has adopted .??
flexibility and how they organize themselves in more of the detail in
that in just few minutes.With his holding company bill ?? north Carolina
business will not be able to move to Delaware to exercise
flexibility.Corporation just forming hill hear can choose Carolina for
this flexibility ?? both pats of the bill are good the economy and good
for jobs.One of the best parts in this process is been that the bill
contains suggestion from a wide variety stakeholders and i ll just name
the few,Chris smith of the association of the defensive ?? the advocates
of justice bill roe of the justice senator ?? of the administrative
office of the courts ??  who regularly blogs on this topic of business
quotes and he's know in north Carolina expert,Professor Tom hays en and
John curl ??law professors and many other individual practitioners

stuff.The bill ?? and clarifies the jurisdiction of ports and you say
why do we need that.We really gotta  need modernization of this bill
since the need  ?? and frankly when it was first created it was ground
breaking.But right now RB says the cases involving in the internet were
complex business cases so that means if  send senator ?? and email and
we can get controversy about that is not to create a complex business
case.we also have structured here so much that the bill goes straight
into the North Carolina supreme court and the reason for that is we are
striving to establish a defended body of law that will compare with
Delaware .Delaware has 250 years of defended body of law business is
what to do ?? i will meet after that and how may know the discussion of
the bill so i wont go into further detail this point and lat at their
questions and i 'll be happy to take them.</p>

<p id="30:00">
Drafting strategy that was used for the amendment, instead it applies
the bill to Union County, the first three sections, and then as it
respects to Nash and Gaston, and I'm trying to get that pulled up now.
And then as it applies to Nash and Gaston, it repeals all of 115C-431,
which includes broader provisions than just the filing any legal action,
and then applies it to Gaston and Nash and expires it in 1617. This is
an involving issue. I still am trying to discover all of what the
implications are of this specific drafting convention versus what the
County Commissioners requested, which was to be in the same position as
Union County. Now, note in Union County it was an agreement in the
county of where they have provisions for the funding of the schools in
the bill that prevents them from filing any lawsuits. In the case of
Nash and Gaston, I don't know the story in Gaston, but in Nash the
budget is not passed, the board just filed for mediation, they look like
they have an agreement, a three year agreement in the works. This is
preempting any legal rights or leverage that the school boards have and
it has a broader implication than what is the case for Union County, and
we need more time to look at the implication of this, and it's not
agreed upon by a whole delegation, and we're stepping in the middle of a
dispute between the, and not even really a dispute, the leveraging
that's happening between the School Board and the County Commissioners,
which is the wisdom in the provisions of 115C. And so for that reason,
I'm asking that we change, we amend the bill to make it apply to Gaston
and Nash in the same manner that it applies to Union. That's all this
amendment does. It does not give them any more rights to file a lawsuit,
it just makes sure that we aren't doing some nefarious things that we
don't know all of what they are right now by repealing that statute
versus doing what the County Commissioners asked and what the statute on
its face does. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate
on Amendment 3. Senator Newton, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. To speak to the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You
have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President, colleagues.
As you might expect, there's a whole lot more going on in Nash County
Rocky Mount School System than we really can get into here on the floor.
I want to assure you that the County Commissioners passed a resolution
asking me to move legislation to have the effect that the amendment that
I offered yesterday and that we voted for would do, and that is to
basically give a period of time to block any litigation so that they can
work out these differences. It's a unique system. Many of the members of
the School Board are not from Nash County, they're from Edgecombe
County. As you can imagine, that creates an interesting dynamic when
they disagree about these things, so I would ask you to defeat the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members,
before I recognize anyone I want to add a clarification to the rule of
14A, the discussion I had before. I think I spoke with Senator Blue
about this. With reference to the rule itself, I think the appropriate
interpretation would be that on an amendment the senator offering the
amendment has the opportunity to explain the amendment. Once the
amendment's been explained, the senator can then speak one time on the
amendment, and I just wanted to make that clear before I start, because
I see Senator Bryant has asked to be recognized, so at this point, I'll
recognize Senator Bryant. For what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To ask Senator Newton a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Newton do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Mr. President. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Newton, would you tell us
what does the language in your amendment do for Nash and Edgecombe
Counties beyond what the language, the notwithstanding language does. In
the, for Union County. What additional limitations are you putting on
the School Board</p>

Would, if any, bend that language. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant, my
amendment did not affect Edgecombe County, first of all. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Pardon me, I mean Nash and Gaston. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
understand. I want the members to be clear about that because this
unique situation here in Rocky Mount Nash School System is that some of
the students that reside in the city of Rocky Mount are Edgecombe County
residents, and it's a unique funding situation there which is part of
the reason, as I alluded to before, why we brought this forward in the
first place. A number of the school board members, I'm not sure, I think
it may be a majority of the school board members are not even Nash
County residents, and so the potential litigation may be between a
school board of Edgecombe County residents versus the Nash County County
Commission, and so obviously the incentives financially to work together
are not quite the same as if everybody's from the same county. So the
intent of my amendment, to answer your question, was to simply block the
potential of litigation for a period of time as well as disputes about
purchasing school property or anything that may be forthcoming over the
next several years. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Mr. President. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Newton, do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will yield
for one more question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Would you clarify what additional areas does the, do you
cover in your amendment by repealing the statute that is different from
what would be covered by the language not withstanding the statute
preventing them from suing. What additional things are you limiting them
about in your amendment beyond the filing, actually filing a lawsuit?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The location of new schools. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Harrington, for what purpose do
you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Gaston County.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak for the amendment? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir,
speak to the amendment. The Gaston County Commissioners requested that I
add this amendment, yesterday and I would respectfully request that you
vote against the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or
debate on Amendment 3? Hearing none, the question before the Senate is
the passage of Amendment 3 to the Senate Committee Substitute to House
Bill 292. All in favor of the amendment will vote aye, all opposed will
vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. The clerk will
record the vote. Senator Davis, aye. 15 having voted in the affirmative
and 30 in the negative, Amendment 3 fails and the bill is back before
you. Is there further discussion or debate on House Bill 292? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant, for what
purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] You have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the Senate,
Mr. President, I just want to be clear about my major concerns about
this bill. While it appears that the situation in Union County is unique
to Union County, and they've worked out a solution in their local bill
which is appropriate for them and which I think we all support. what is
dangerous is the piling on of other counties onto this bill without any
process for a local bill on their specific county to be heard to and
responded to by the folks in that county, for research to be done about
what the implications are in those counties and for us to, the local
delegations and the local communities to know about it before this is
done. Instead of saving money by keeping people from bringing these
lawsuits, we are increasing the likelihood of litigation where we are
trampling on, potentially, people's constitutional rights to a sound
public education, intervening in these local disputes that we don't know
all the ins and outs of when the delegations are in dispute. I think
we're setting up a bad precedent, number one, and number two, setting up
more problems than we would solve by using the process in 115C, which is
not perfect and may need some adjustments in and of its own, but it does
work, to balance the rights of the citizens in local communities to a
sound public education to the County Commissioner's role to fund that
along with what the state obligations are. All the complicated process,
but that statute has worked so far to attend to that balance, and here
we are, in a heavy handed way, intervening to disrupt that balance, and
really setting up more expensive options that school boards and
communities will have to go through to get the funding issues resolved.
So</p>

That reason I would normally support the Union County arrangement. I
think that they've done a good thing there, but for those reasons I
cannot support this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or
debate? Hearing none, the question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman.
Senator Curtis, what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President, I'd like to speak in favor of this bill. It seems that the
people. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you. The School Board and County Commissioners in Gaston County are
starting down the road that Union County went down, and we would like to
give them a chance to get their differences resolved in a much cheaper
way than Union County did. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further
discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question before the Senate is
the passage of the third reading of the Senate Committee Substitute to
House Bill 292. All in favor will vote aye, all opposed will vote no.
Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. The clerk will record the
vote. 30 having voted in the affirmative and 15 in the negative, House
Bill 292 is passed its third reading. The amendments will be engrossed
and the bill will be sent to the House on the issue of concurrence on
the Senate Committee Substitute. Members, I believe the only bill that's
left on the calendar is House Bill 698, are we ready to go on that one?
Senator Bryant you had an amendment. Are we ready? House Bill 698, the
clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] House Bill 698, Background Checks for
Firefighters. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members we heard this bill yesterday.
Senator Meredith, do you have anything? Senator Bryant. I'm sorry,
Senator Meredith, you were ??. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would just ask for
the support and I think Senator Meredith had an objection to third
reading, has an amendment. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, this is an amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Send
forward your amendment, the clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Bryant moves to amend the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bryant has the
floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. This amendment just
simply extends the effective date till January 1, 2015. We're talking
about license checks for upwards of 50,000 people, and we need time to
make sure there's a organized plan to make this happen in an efficient,
effective way and there may also be an agency transition happening at
the same time. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate
on Amendment 2. Senator Meredith, you have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. To speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I did get with Senator Bryant and
the departments that this affects. I'm fine with that and I would ask
for everyone's support. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion
or debate on Amendment 2? Hearing none, the question before the Senate
is the passage of Amendment 2 to House Bill 698. All in favor will vote
aye, all opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the
voting. The clerk will record the vote. 45 having voted in the
affirmative and none in the negative. Amendment 2 passes and House Bill
698 is back before you on third reading. Further discussion or debate?
Hearing none, the question before the Senate is the passage on third
reading of Senate Committee Substitute as Amended to House Bill 698. All
in favor will vote aye, all opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be
allowed for the voting. The clerk will record the vote. Senator Graham,
aye. 45 having voted in the affirmative and none in the negative, House
Bill 698 has passed its third reading. The amendments will be engrossed
and the bill will be sent to the House on the issue of concurrence in
the Senate Committee Substitute. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Davis, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] On House Bill 1069 I voted aye and I would like to be recorded
as voting no. [SPEAKER CHANGES] House Bill 1069. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just one moment, let's get the vote total
on 1069. House Bill 1069, the vote is 40 in favor, 4 in the negative. It
passes. Senator Bryant, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
To make the same request as Senator Davis. To be recorded as voting no
on 1069. [SPEAKER CHANGES] By my math that would make it 39 to 5. Still
passes. Senator Newton, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
To make a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. President, I'd like to request that House Bill 292 be sent
to the house by special messenger. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection.</p>

<p id="45:00">
Members, today's our last day this week and we want to thank our pages
for visiting with us and helping us as we've done our work this week.
Pages, serving as a page in North Carolina Senate is a long tradition
here and many pages have found that it is one of the initial steps to
actually sitting in one of these seats. Of course it may also be the
beginning step to deciding you never want to sit in one of these seats.
So we do appreciate your service this week, and wish you all well in
your furthering of your education. Thank you very much. Notices and
announcements. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Brock. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Make an announcement. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Members of the Senate,
this Saturday is Flag Day, which is also, even though this Fall and
September is the 200th anniversary of The Star Spangled Banner, which
was written by Francis Scott Key. The Smithsonian is trying to set a
record of the largest national anthem, so at 4:00 this Saturday, Senator
Apodaca, sing the national anthem including all four stanzas. So, hope
everybody have a good weekend. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I've heard him sing,
so. Further notices or announcements. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca. ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, we have
sent to everyone directions to Pinehurst for the funeral of Senator
Blake, so if you'll check your inbox, ?? was kind enough to provide us
some alternate routes to get down there due to the golf tournament. So
please be safe. Have a good weekend. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
McKissick, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] A moment of
personal privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Unfortunately I cannot attend Senator Harris Blake's funeral
service today, but I do want to say that I thought he was a very
honorable, distinguished member who really served this body in a very
noble way. Somebody who you could reach out to, regardless of the fact
you might have been a part of a different party and work with on bills
during the course of his tenure here. I deeply admire him and respect
him. I regret I cannot attend his funeral service, but I would certainly
love to be able to do so and I'm sure many members will be able to do
so, but since I'm unable to, I wanted to certainly acknowledge the
contributions he's made to this chamber and the friendship which he
provided to me. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Are there further notices and
announcements? Is there further business to come before the Senate? If
not, the Chair recognizes Senator Pate for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. I move that the Senate do now adjourn, subject
to messages from the House and the Governor, the introduction, referral
and rereferral of bills and resolutions, the receipt and the rereferral
of committee reports and the ratification of bills, to reconvene on
Monday, June 16, 2014 at 7:00 PM. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Pate, would
you mind if that be in memory of Senator Harris Blake. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
That was my silent suggestion, sir, and certainly for just a moment
Senator Blake sat in this seat over here at this desk for two years
prior, 2011, 2012, and he was indeed a great man, a true gentleman as
Senator McKissick said. Easygoing, but he was dedicated to his people in
his district and to this State Senate. Thank you, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, the motion is that the Senate do adjourn in
memory of Senator Harris Blake subject to the stipulations stated by
Senator Pate, to reconvene on Monday July, I'm sorry, June 16, 2014 at
7:00PM, seconded by Senator Hartsell. All in favor say aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed no. The ayes have it. The
Senate stands adjourned.</p>
