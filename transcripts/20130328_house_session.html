In chapter 10 my dad was about this preacher I don’t wanna freak
everybody up but I’m not about to start Sermon but in the 10th Chapter
of the Gospel of Luke is the story about the good Samaritan and while
this fellow was walking from Jericho, from Jerusalem to Jericho he fell
down and got beat up by bunch of folks and this is where how addiction a
lot of time starts, somebody will have an injury and get a legitimate
treatment for pain and then they have just to trouble getting off that
and it cascades into an addiction that they just can’t treat. So, what
this legislation does is help folks that might be at risk for overdose
to make sure that they have appropriate treatment. So, I will appreciate
your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ___[00:45] please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and members of the house as I was discussing this
after session members yesterday I was one of the few to vote no some
said, “Why didn’t you say anything?” And my concern with the bill what
it really the Samaritan portion that was Sub-Section C on page 1 line 29
about the person who is experiencing the drug related overdose.
Although, I don’t understand why the Samaritan wouldn’t get rid of
whatever drugs they had on them when they are driving to the hospital or
whatever he would certainly wouldn’t someone to not help another person
in trouble for fear to being caught for some sort of crime but the
person who is experiencing the drug related overdose, if you look up on
line 16 drug related overdose is defined in many ways but it also says
extreme physical illness and it might scenario say you had a wild party,
someone is at a wild party maybe the police come and someone will say,
“Hey, I have been using drugs and I have got a little bit on me, all you
have to do is all my stomach hurts or sit on the floor or lay on the
floor and cower and whatever and you have got a drug related or you have
got some sort of extreme illness then you have created for yourself an
immunity for many prosecution.” So, I think that Sub-Section 3 dealing
with the person who is having the problem is somewhat over broad and it
was uninvitingly creating a broad immunity that people in the drug use
community will understand and learn how to gain the system. So, I have
concern someday we might have to rethink the war on drugs and our drug
law but I don’t think we should do it uninvitingly through this bill.

<p id="40:00">
The name Duffys law in memory and in honor of a young man from Alamans
County named
Christopher Duffy Collins. Christopher was a young man full of life,
wit, and love and was stricken
with a disease that attacked his kidneys. He was put on the organ donor
waiting list like thirty five
hundred other North Carolinians every year. Toward the end of his life
he was doing nine hours of
dialysis every evening and unfortunately a suitable donor could not be
located in time. At age 28,
in 2005, Duffy passed away. His parents Bruce and Mary Joe Collins
despite this devastating
tragedy, picked themselves up, determined that some good would come from
this tragedy that
they faced. They were determined to do what they could to raise
awareness about the
importance of organ donating here in North Carolina. They established a
foundation. Ladies
and gentlemen I have distributed to you a copy of the donation,
foundation rather that they have
set up to assist other families going through the same hardship that
they have and the hopes
of being able to locate and find donors so that other families would
have not have to face the grief
and sorry that the Collins have had to do, and they have also over the
last seven years obtained
proclamations from the governors office, the name April, organ donor
month here in North Carolina. What this bill will do friends is just
simply make that an annual recurrence. It will write into law that every
April in North Carolina will be Organ Donor Awareness month.
There are few things that you and I can do daily on a regular basis,
give the gift of life. A few weeks ago we had the blood mobile here on
the grounds and many of us donated blood giving an organ as part of the
organ donation program is a way that you and I can
give the gift of life to others. It does not matter what the age, you
can be an organ donor at any time in your life and probably the best
known means of doing that is through the North Carolina department of
motor vehicles when you go to get your license they have a
check off box there. I've signed it and they'll put a little red heart
on your license and it indicates to first responders and to medical
professionals that you are a willing organ donor. One donor can give the
gift of life to up to eight other human beings. One donor can share
enough tissue to help fifty other human beings. It really is the gift of
life. So we as we come into this Easter celebration I hope you'll join
me in voting in favor of this bill SP11 to establish an annual organ
donor month awareness program here in North Carolina. I commend
the Collins for their hard work these past seven years despite their
grief. Getting up and going forward in life and doing something that
will most definitely save lives in the future. I commend our medical
community that has delivered to us the modern miracle of organ donation
and successful organ transplantation and friends I commend this bill to
your consideration. Thank You.

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Burr, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you Mr.Speaker. Members, House Bill 247 seeks to address an issue
with something that’s known as the ‘Most Favored Nation’s Clause’. That
may sound like something that would be debated at the United Nations but
it is an issue that our state and many others have had to deal with in
terms of our insurance market. And what the most favored nation clause
is, MFN it’s often referred to, it is a contract clause that hospitals
sign with certain insurance companies. And this MFN clause really
prohibits competition. And it does so in a way that I believe over a
dozen other states have already prohibited the use of the MFN clause and
a number of states, obviously including ours is looking at prohibiting
that. And the way that it prohibits competition is it is a clause that
the insurance companies will use to put in their contracts by insurance
companies to really hold a ???. It is my belief and I believe the belief
of many of you all that we need to return North Carolina’s health
insurance market to a competitive state and certainly in the last 15
years we have gone from having over 30 insurance companies offering
insurance and we’re now down to 7. This will give an opportunity for
others to be able to compete against our dominate insurance company here
in this state and certainly allow for competition again. And I can tell
you that insurance executives in other states in the past have testified
in the past that the MFN clause is not used to keep down that particular
insurance company’s cost but really to help drive up the cost of their
competitors  And that is and should not be the reason to use this clause
and this certainly can work to help make sure that all of our
constituents have as low premiums as possible and again create that
competition which is very critical. This bill is very similar, nearly
identical to a bill that made its way through the Senate two years ago.
It made it to a judiciary committee in the House last year but stopped
at the time when Blue Cross, Blue Shield, which is the company that
tends to use the MFN clause in North Carolina pledged to no longer use
the Most Favored Nation’s clause anymore. But there’s been some
disagreement about whether or not that is the case and if they are still
using those. I can tell you that I spoke to an association, a group of
CFOs from hospitals a few weeks ago and they disagree with the statement
that they are no longer used and one individual even mentioned that in a
recent negotiation with Blue Cross, Blue Shield that the MFN…</p>

because the clause was still in there, even though they pledged two
years ago to no longer use it in the State of North Carolina. So this
just simply makes sure that we're doing just that, and prohibiting this
clause from being abused in the state so that we can open up our health
insurance market and make it competitive once again for our constituents
to have low premiums. Thank you Mr. Speaker. [speaker changes]
Further discussion, further debate. Representative Horn, please state
your purpose [speaker changes]
I'd like to ask he bill sponsor a question [speaker changes]
Representative Burns, does the gentleman yield [speaker changes]
Gladly [speaker changes]
It's my understanding that this issue is under litigation in some other
state and, but that North Carolina's participating in that litigation.
Is that correct? [speaker changes]
The State of North Carolina I do not believe is participating in that
litigation. And there was actually an amendment added by Representative
Stam yesterday to make sure that this legislation in no way affects
that. That is not the state's litigation. That is litigation, I believe,
brought by other companies, individuals, but not directly by the State.
[speaker changes]
To speak on the bill. [speaker changes]
Ladies and Gentleman, the gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[speaker changes]
It's always been my experience that nothing is ever as simple as it
first appears, And although it does sound to me like this is a very
reasonable, responsible bill, I am concerned about the fact that there
is litigation of any kind going on. And for the State of North Carolina
to insert itself even though we say, &quot;well we're not inserting
ourselves&quot;, but that kind of reminds me of when a judge tells a
jury &quot;don't pay any attention to the testimony you just
heard&quot;. Well you just heard the testimony, and you do tend to pay
attention to it. And I'm only concerned that the State of North Carolina
inserts, may be inserting itself into ongoing litigation, and if that's
a concern shared by others, I'm wondering if maybe we should wait until
this litigation is over, and then proceed appropriately. Thank you very
much. [speaker changes]

To speak on the bill [speaker changes]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill [speaker changes]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members of the House. This bill amends the
Respiratory Care Practice Act by developing a two-tier licensing
procedure. The reason for that is that the amount of information that
must be obtained and learned by the students has grown with the new
technologies that are available. The people that are providing this
training have seen the need to increase this training and also provide a
two-level of licensure.  The first level is what's offered in our
community college system.  Now it's a 2 year</p>
