The House will come back to order. Members, please take your seats.
Visitors, please retire from the chamber. We will wait a couple more
minutes to allow members to enter the chamber. Ladies and gentlemen of
the House, it is going to be a long session today, and the Chair would
expect as it gets up into the 90 degrees later today that it’s going to
be hot in here. In the interest of Representative Brawley, rule 12d is
suspended, and in the interest of Representative Jackson, rule 12b is
suspended. Is there objection? So ordered. The Sergeant-At-Arms will
close the doors. The prayer will be offered by Representative Sarah
Stevens. Members and visitors in the gallery, please stand and please
remain standing for the Pledge of Allegiance. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Better?
This is a prayer from Carol Love of Calvary Baptist Church in Mt Airy.
Let us pray. Our gracious and loving heavenly Father, thank you for the
freedom we have in coming to you with our thanksgivings and petitions.
As we begin our legislative session this day, we ask that you would
remind us of your many blessings, especially the ones we so often fail
to notice. Thank you for our wonderful state with majestic mountains,
rolling hills and breathtaking landscapes. Thank you for our rural
communities, large cities, suburban areas and still productive family
farms. Thank you for your protection over us in both times of plenty and
times of want. We thank you, dear Father, for the many evidences of your
blessings on all of North Carolina. Now we pray that you would remind us
of our need to seek your guidance and approval as we discuss matters of
importance today. Thank you for being personally interested in our
everyday lives as well as in our legislative proceedings. Guide us as we
seek to make wise choices for all the citizens of North Carolina. Keep
us focused on the task at hand, and help us not to be swayed by greed or
power or special interests. Instead may we seek to know your wisdom, may
we evaluate options without bias, and may we be sensitive to your
leadership. Thank you Father that you are able to direct our steps and
to lead us in our decisions. Lead us in governing our great state in a
way that pleases you and seeks to benefit all of our citizens. May we
set aside personal agendas and truly seek to serve the people of North
Carolina to our best abilities. Bless s this day with your presence. May
we be willingly used by you to govern with love, lead with purity of
heart, and enact wise legislation for all of our constituents. Once
again we thank you for the freedom to seek your guidance in these
matters. May we ever be focused on what’s best for all citizens. Bless
us, guide us and use us as the strong, honest and caring leaders of
North Carolina. We ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ, your
son. Amen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I pledge allegiance to the flag of the

[SPEAKER CHANGES]Without objection, calendar for today.  So ordered.
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, the Chair would like to extend the
courtesies of the floor.  The House will come to order.  The Chair would
like to extend the courtesies of the floor to a former member,
Representative Lane Brown, represented Stanley county.  Lane, welcome.
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, the House will come to order.  I
doubt we'll have that much energy around 9 o'clock tonight when we get
finished, you all may want to conserve it.  The Chair is happy to extend
a thank you and a welcome to the nurses of the day, we have 2 nurses of
the day.  One nurse, Melissa Asage, PhD, RNBC from Hillsboro, another,
Brittany Demiglio, RN, BSN, also from Hillsboro.  Welcome and thank you
for serving us.  Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to begin the
calendar.  We are going to dispose of some bills before we, the House
will come to order.  The House will come to order.  The Chair thanks the
members for their indulgence.  We are going to begin the calendar today,
there are some reminders.  One reminder, all amendments for the budget
bill must be in the possession of the clerk no later than 2 PM, there
will be no exceptions.  We will take up the debate on amendments before
we take up substantive debate on the bill.  We will allow the Chairs to
provide an update, but the Chair would like to, in order to manage the
flow, I think it's more appropriate for us to take up the amendments,
determine what the bill looks like before we start debating the bill, as
some amendments the Chair expects will be adopted.  We will allow full
debate unless there's concurrence among the members to do otherwise,
we'll allow full debate on all amendments as they come forward, and full
debate on the bill.  If we go up to 9 o'clock, or a little after 9
o'clock, the Chair with full concurrence from the minority leadership
will consult as whether or not you would prefer we come back in the
morning at 9 AM, or 10 AM, or we simply take a break and come back after
midnight and vote on the 3rd reading, and then send everyone home.
We'll let that play out over the day, just determining, just depending
on how long it's going to take, and how many amendments we get.  The
main reason I wanted the House to come to order though, was so I can
make sure everybody</p>

The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to vote green for this motion, to
concur with this Senate amendment. The amendment that Senator Brown
added to this bill is germane to this bill. The bill that we voted on in
the past was strictly regarding the aspects of our future roadmap for
our inlets. This adds the Oregon Inlet Task Force to this bill. The task
force is really looking at exploring options between the state and the
federal government for our path forward with Oregon Inlet, and I just

Moore, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, after some consultation with Representative Hall
on this matter, I move the bill be removed from the calendar, referred
to the Committee on Finance. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection so
ordered. Senate Bill 494. The Clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] House
committee Substitute for Senate Bill 494, a bill to be entitled ‘An Act
to Authorize Community Service as a Discretionary Condition of
Post-Release Supervision and to Amend the Requirements for Voting by the
Post-Release Supervision and Parole Commission on Matters Coming Before
the Commission’. General Assembly of North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? Representative Moore,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, this is a bill
that makes changes and modifications to the community service
post-release and supervision statutes. One of the main changes, it
allows for a more expeditious manner. There are a number of additional
requests for parole and probation reviews that are coming through the
Parole Commission now as a result of the Justice Reinvestment Act. This
was requested by the Parole Commission. I know of no opposition and
would urge the body’s support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion,
further debate? If not, the question… Representative Stevens, please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative Moore
would yield for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, does
the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
House will come to order. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sorry, I was just looking at
it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
These people are just getting out of prison as I understand – parolees,
and they’ve not met their restitution and those kinds of things. Will we
be looking for the 250 dollar community service fee from them, and if so
I guess how do we realistically expect to get it? [SPEAKER CHANGES] What
this bill does is it simply… as far as those fees, it doesn’t change
existing law as I understand on that issue. What it does is it really
deals with how to more expeditiously do it. As far as the community
service fee, and I’m trying to pull the bill up itself – I apologize, I
was distracted a moment ago. Give me just a second. What this does, it
does on the discretionary</p>

the discretionary conditions of probation does allow that the Commission
will not impose a condition of community service if it determines that
the supervisee has the financial resources to satisfy the order.  And
then it also spells out about setting the terms and conditions under
Section 2 in the event of a tie vote by the Commission, the Chair votes
the additional, votes to tie the additional vote, that's just technical.
But this is designed, it appears that what happened Representative
Stevens, there had been some cases that they weren't sure how to handle
them and this does it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, can I ask a question
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ask a question of the
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, does the gentleman yield? The
gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Did this bill ever go through a J Committee?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It came through, this one did not go through a J
Committee.  What happened was this came over as a Senate bill, was
vetted through, and there were, that the changes we made Representative
Daughtry were very, very minor and we actually reached out to the
Department of Justice.  I don't remember if you were in Rules when we
took it up and they came in and spoke.  So I know of absolutely no
opposition. It passed the Senate unanimously and so we were trying to be
expeditious with it.

question before the House is the passage of the House Committee
substitute to Senate Bill 494 on its second reading.  All in favor vote
aye.  All opposed vote no. The Clerk will open the vote. All members

chairs who have worked on this and labored in the room for so many hours
the last several weeks, Chairman Linda Johnson from Caberras county,

has caught the winds of reform and is moving us forward.  let me give
you just a few details of our budget.  in this first year, the houses
budget will spend 12 million dollars less than what the senate proposed
and roughly 188 million less than the senate proposal.  It is over all
growth of about 1.9 percent over the current spending.  in the second
year, we spend about 1 percent more than the senate, 2 percent more than
the government, we're sailing down the middle of those proposals.  now
just like our sonic colleges, we are continuing to work with the
challenges of Medicaid and entitlement program, we are able to fully
fund our obligations in medicaid with this budget.  the house has passed
as you know his stork tax reform.  this budget fully accounts for the
stork tax reform that this chamber has passed in the last week.  We are
also going back and we are rebuilding our funds. we are placing 200
million dollars in our salary excuse me our savings reserve account
against future issues that we have to deal with.  we are placing 200
million dollars in our repairs and renovations fund to begin the process
of rebuilding some of our instate government structure that has had a
lag over the last several years. Our budget continues to reap the
benefits of the justice reinvestment act that this general assembly
passed two years ago.  this budget as i said before it funds our state
health plan it sounds medicaid it keeps beds in facilities for those
most at need and most at risk open it provides an additional 9 million
dollars to address the group home issue that has vexed us. it has
provided 5 thousand slots for individuals in need of pre kay services.
in the area of transportation it loses in forward concert with the
strategic transportation plan that this chamber has passed. in the areas
of education it ives forwards with innovation choice in education school
safety preserving class size,  we are also looking at the areas of
commerce and working to reform commerce and how we do business to
maximize our job development efforts in this state. we fully funded j
dig and other critical programs in that regard. we are looking aft er
the needs of our environment and looking after the needs of the whole
state government in a variety of ways.  this year we provide 5 full
bonus days for state employees and we provide a hundred and 60 million
dollar reserve in the second year that will be going toward compensation
and salary increases in the second year of our budget.  ladies and
gentleman of the house, we are fulfilling our obligations as we live
within our means.  our plan is a common sense approach.  to provide
those services that our citizens need in the areas of education, health
care public safety and job development.  i am on behalf of the committee

a reduction in funds that would otherwise be available to school
systems, but rather than us going into various line items and saying
we're going to make a decision for every school district across the
state as to what they value most and what they think is less important,
is that we're going to simply say to them this are the dollars we have
available, here's our allocations we're going to give you.  Now, if you
and the Board of Education within you district decide that there is a
more appropriate way of allocating the money, you'll have permission to
shift that money to meet what you believe your priorities are.  The only
2 restrictions really being, under the House budget, that you can't
transfer money into the central office to pay more central office staff,
and you can't transfer money in a way that would cause you to violate
the requirements of  federal grants that entitle you to receive those
funds.  As a result, we didn't go in and make the extensive adjustments
to a number of items in the budget as did the Senate.  With regards to
textbooks, we maintained the funding as it has been for the last year.
We have some concerns that that money needs to increase at some point,
given the time that has elapsed since the economic downturn and great
recession began.  However if you consult your budget special provisions,
you'll see that in the section that allocates money from the lottery,
there are items in both years of the biennium that allocates substantial
sums, I think about $26 million in the first year of the biennium, and
just over $17 million in the second year for digital learning.  And it
is our expectation and intention that we are going to increasingly be
moving away from hard copy text, and more into on-line and digital
resources, and therefore though we are not increasing the money in
general fund budget otherwise for textbooks, there is this substantial
set aside from the lottery for digital learning which we hope will help
to offset or balance out the needs for instructional materials that
would have historically been provided through a formal textbook.  In
addition you'll see in your budget with reference to supplies which are
a perennial concern which we hear comments about.  Essentially, we are
maintaining that funding at the same level although overall we had a
little less money, about 1% less to spend on K-12, we're maintaining the
money in this budget for supplies.  It is done through a combination of
money in the general fund portion of the budget, and some additional
appropriations also in the lottery category, that you can see in the
first year of the biennium, a little over $4.1 million is put into
classroom materials and supplies, and about $1.6 million in the second
year of the biennium.
Another thing we would like to comment on, that is following through of
the house position that was adopted earlier this session.  You'll recall
that Representative Arp presented a bill that would have us determine,
in a somewhat different fashion, how we handle school bus replacements.
And we have essentially adopted the policies and position of
Representative Arp's bill, and that allows us, we think, to make fully
adequate provisions for replacements.  It provides us with extra funds
in case a bus that is not scheduled for replacement should actually
require it.  But overall it saves us something over $1 million in the
first year of the biennium, and I think somewhere on the order of $4.5
million in the second year of the biennium.
With reference to the community college system, I would comment on 2
things.  One is that we have shifted a small amount of the funding of
the community college system, I think</p>

<p id="045:00">
…around $9 million to a performance-funding model. The community college
system has itself developed performance standards which do include a
high degree of standards that are based on student outcomes. Numbers of
graduates, number of persons successfully completing licensing exams
following the taking of a course at the community college leading to
that license, and other measures of that sort. So, we think that that is
a positive step forward.
The other thing that I will mention to you that has sort of a desire to
enhance performance both at the university level and at the community
college is something that we have called, “NC GAP,” GAP being an acronym
for Guaranteed Admission Program.
There’s a provision in both the university section of the budget and in
the community college section of the budget that essentially is premised
on the idea that we have a large number of students who enroll in the
university who four to six years later have not completed a degree or
anything that might be said to be of recognizable value to them.
For that reason we recognize that the taxpayers, in paying for students
who are at the university, are paying substantially more than if that
same student were at the community college system.
So, the concept is to have the community college system and the
universities work together in developing this Guaranteed Admission
Program, in which the university would identify some of those students
that might be thought to be least likely of being successful at the
university, and saying to those students instead, “Look, if you go back
and go to a community college and successfully complete an associate’s
degree, then we’ll guarantee you admission at that point so that you can
complete the equivalent of your third and fourth years of college and
get a university diploma.”
We feel like there is a double-win here for us, at least, maybe triple.
But from a double standpoint we’re saving money by paying less for them
while they’re at the community college, secondly if they complete the
two-year program at the community college but never go on to the
university, at least they will have an associate’s degree to show for
it.
But thirdly if they do successfully complete the degree at the community
college, we hope that the incentive of the guaranteed admission at the
university will mean that more of these students who currently are not
completing college will in fact get what they need at the community
college level at a lower cost to the taxpayer but then benefit
themselves not only with the associate’s degree but with a successful
experience at UNC.
The final things that I’ll mention regarding the university’s budget,
there are three items. Historically the university has had a concern
that in sending out acceptances to students in the spring for the
following fall semester we typically are working on the budget, as we
are right now, that covers that fall semester period.
So, when they are telling students who have been accepted what sort of
financial aid they may be entitled to there has been a continuing
uncertainty as to how much money the General Assembly would actually
provide to fund scholarships of various types so that they could know
how to divide it.
In order to try and compensate for that uncertainty, the decision was
made in previous Session to try to go to what we refer to as a
“Forward-Funding Model,” in which we would set money aside for
scholarships before the budget year in which we are currently operating
that would be used for this coming fall.
By having that money available in effect a year early the university
would know that they have, at a minimum, those dollars available to
them. Thus far there is a reserve that contains, I think, just under $60
million based…</p>

<p id="050:00">
on funds put aside for that purpose in a current year budget or
previously. We would like to continue moving towards full forward
funding and this budget provides a small amount for that purpose.
Recognizing that with the financial funds available this year, that we
would rather not make other cuts in order to increase that ford funding
reserve more at this point. But our intention is to continue that.
A second thing that I will mention is that our budget adds back $4.5
million for North Carolina need based scholarships. This is money that
was non-recurring money in last year’s budget. It’s used for students
who are attending private colleges and universities. It seems to us that
this is a wise investment for each of these students that attends a
private college or university if the tax payers can assist them with
$4500, that is far less than what it would cost us if that same student
were to enroll in the university and almost the same thing that it would
cost if they enrolled in the community college. We think it is something
that we should continue and our budget proposes to make that same
appropriation recurring rather than non-recurring. That’s why you see
the $4.5 million in here.
The final thing I will mention is that UNC, as is the case with the
community college office, has gotten the same message that many of us
have over the last few years, is that our citizens are concerned about
the actual student performances. How many people are graduating, how
many people are being successful in their education experience and so
the board of governors and various committees under its jurisdiction
have developed a strategic plan and they’ve set certain goals to try to
move students and campuses towards these heightened accomplishments
achievements greater success. In our budget, not exactly, but in large
measure, we have duplicated the recommendations of the governor in
setting aside specific dollar amounts for specific of the strategic
goals of the university. Largely, we think, agreeable to the university,
but there may be some small differences on particular items. What we
have attempted to do is to identify those particular performance
measures that we think most relate to our desire to see enhanced
performance for students in campuses and to put a small amount of our
money where our mouths frequently are and where we think our goals
should be. I recommend the budget to the members of the House.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I, like my colleague, want to simply outline a portion of the education
portion of this bill. I start, though, by saying that my support for the
bill in large part relates to the work that we’ve done on the education
portion and specifically while the House, Senate and Governor have
largely made the same cuts in terms of their overall percentages, what
we’ve done is actually very different. I think we have improved on the
budget put forward by the Governor and the Senate. Specifically, we’ve
made a decision to protect much more so than the Governor or the Senate,
the funding for K-12. We’ve done that in a number of different ways in
terms of putting money back for textbooks, putting money back for
supplies. Slashing the cuts made to the teaching assistance allotment.
While these budgets, they’re bottom line numbers are not that different,
at least within the education portion of the bill, there is significant
differences. I wanted to point out two or three things and then my...</p>

Other colleagues, Co-chair, Representative Horn will finish up.  This
bill totally funds the School Safety Bill that we have already passed.
We put $10 million for support of school resource officers, and another
$2 million for support and installation in maintaining panic alarms in
the public schools.  I want to bring to your attention the tuition
increases that are incorporated in the budget with respect to community
colleges.  The increase in tuition is $2.50 per credit hour.  That will
mean that the current tuition will rise from $69 per credit hour to
$71.50 for residents, and $261 to $263.50 for non-residents.   We
similarly have tuition increases with respect to the UNC system, but
those increases only occur in the 2nd year of the biennium, and that
amounts to 12.3% for a small group of universities, mostly the large
universities, and as we learned in the discussion that occurred
yesterday in the appropriations committee, that specifically it's based
on some tuition surveys that have been done, and generally 6% for all
others.  I've gotten a number of questions from people that recognize
that in the other budgets, the need based scholarship for private
college students had been cut, and I'll tell you in this budget we have
put back in the $4.5 million that is in this current year's budget.  I
would recommend the adoption of the budget to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Ladies and Gentlemen, the Chair would like to extend
the courtesies of the gallery to someone we should all be proud of.
Doctor Mark Edwards is the National Superintendent of the Year, and the
Superintendent of  the Mooresville Graded School District.  He is back
in the gallery and Mark, welcome, and thank you for all that you're
doing.  Representative Horn, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentlemen is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm
going to try and be brief, which I will be.  And I'm also going to try
and interest you.  Now, most of you are already aware of what we are
putting forth in our budget, but it's the biggest part of the budget,
it's a part that's going to affect everyone in this chamber, all the
teachers, thousands of buildings.  It's a process that's always in
process.  What we did do, what this House did, is we restored teaching
assistance, we restored $95.5 million out of the Governor's cut and
$117.7 million of the Senate's cut for teaching assistance.  I'm sure
you've heard more about teaching assistance, and how important they are
in K-3.  Thank you Mr. Speaker.  We reinstated the teaching fellows
program, and we kept NCCAT, the North Carolina Center for the
Advancement of Teaching, and we're looking forward to NCCAT playing a
prominent role in moving this state to a new way of delivering education
in North Carolina as we move into the digital environment in our
education system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Horn, if the gentleman will suspend for
just a moment.  Ladies and gentlemen of the gallery, I've been advised
by the Sergeant at Arms that there may be some protestors entering the
chamber.  I have ordered that the doors to the gallery be locked for the
purposes of additional people coming in, after the folks that are at the
door, Sergeant at Arms, you may allow them to enter.  But for some
period of time, anyone who wishes to leave the galleries are welcome to
do so, but for your safety we will not allow any more admittance until
after the legislative police have advised us that all is clear.
Representative Horn, the gentleman may continue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.  Mr. Edwards, we're grateful for the example
you have set, and we're looking forward to the entire state of North
Carolina entering the digital world in our education system.</p>

We have also funded some initiatives. It is a responsible thing for this
Legislature to do, to fund programs we expect to come through. In
particular, opportunity scholarships, opportunity for the poorest among
us to have a chance for parents to choose a school that fits them,
rather than a one size fits all. We are funding education innovation
grants, matching funds to implement the innovation in our education
process. Bring in the public sector and parents and families to further
our educational goals in this state. In community colleges we have a
very difficult decision to make, in moving the enrollment funding for
community colleges from a three-year average to a two-year average. And
we have, as well, implemented this program that Representative Blackwell
talked about, which is truly an innovative program, of NC GAP, the
Guaranteed Admissions Program. This is really a revolutionary process
for North Carolina. It's going to raise the graduation rates, it's going
to give kids that normally fall at the bottom end of the academic ladder
and don't complete college, they're going to be able to work toward a
certificate and/or an AA degree, and even if they don't complete
college, they have something in hand. And in the process, it's going to
save this state millions of dollars. It's been a tough year, it
continues to be a tough year. I think we've done a terrific job, and I

[SPEAKER CHANGES] This section is Health and Human Services. To give you
some idea of the impact of Medicaid on HHS budget, and the total budget,
our section of the budget is reduced by 2.92 percent the first year, and
4.70 percent the second year. When you add in the woodwork effect and
the growth of Medicaid, our budget is higher by 8.77 percent the first
year and 12.5 percent the second year. This part of the budget has
additional funds that are provided as required by the DOJ settlement
agreement. Funds for non-profits: the secretary is directed to create a
competitive process to award these funds for the purposes provided by
non-profits by the second year of the biennium. The supplemental
short-term assistance for group homes establishes short-term assistance
for group homes for recipients who became ineligible for Medicaid
personal care service funds. Funds are capped at a maximum of $8
million. We provide flexibility to the Secretary to move money and
positions within the Department in an attempt to strengthen internal
audit capacity. Under the Division of Child Development, pre-K slots, it
provides lottery funds of $24,800,000 to fund 5,000 pre-K slots. This
will bring the total slots to 30,000. It changes the income eligibility
for pre-K from 75 percent of the median income, to 130 percent of the
federal poverty level. It amends the matching requirements for local
partnerships. The partnerships are require to provide a 14 percent match
in the first year, and a 15 percent match in the second year. Child care
subsidy from federal block grants to $295 million, the same amount as
the current fiscal year.  Under Division of Social Services, federal
funds for county child welfare services replacement provides
non-recurring funding to partially replace the loss of $14.6 million in
federal funds. NC Reach, child welfare post-secondary education,
provides funds to support ten percent growth each year in the number of
former foster care youth and children adopted after age 12, who attend
college within the North Carolina university and community college
system. The use of foster care budget for guardianship assistance
program allows the Division of Social Services to design a guardianship
assistance program to provide financial support of children who are in
foster care who are deemed to be in permanent placement, permanent
family placement, and are eligible for legal guardianship. Under the
Division of Aging and Adult Services, Project CARE replaces an expiring
federal grant to maintain current Project CARE activities. Project CARE
provides respite and other support services to families caring for a

growth as well as changes in the increases in programs that might take
place for the first year playing in that number is four hundred and

portion of this dish payment, there has been cooperation reluctant
cooperation, I might add, of all the providers and players in our
Medicaid system in order to make the budget work with here. one of the
first parts of that is our hospital provider assessment which the state
retain each amount from their hospital of assessment will increase from
forty three million two ninety five million from the point of the
providers. there is now a shared savings payment plan and this will have
three components. the first is that ten percent of all the payments will
be written with held for the included provider categories and secondly,
that is withheld payments will begin to be returned to the providers to
achieve to be determined performance goals. and thirdly, there's every

was wrong and maybe a few minutes of actually hearing what was right. So
I just think this, this August body as we're often called owes them a
deep debt of gratitude, get my tongue out of my teeth here. And a very,
very warm round of applause.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman’s recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. It was an honor and privilege to work on
transportation this year. And like many things before we start our work
off we got together and decided where did we wanna go, what was the
path, and how were we gonna get there. So we looked at 4 basic things
ladies and gentleman. We looked at how to make government and
transportation more efficient, more effective, and hope we reduce the
size and scope. Number 2 we looked at pushing more out of transportation
out to the private sector in hopes of developing jobs and, and
additional commerce. And number 3 we looked at how can we provide more
pavement on the roads of North Carolina, in a effort to bring it back to
the, to the good roads state. And on the 4th one we looked at in doing
these transportation needs, and addressing the needs across the state.
What could we do to also improve on commerce, and job development? So we
also looked at what is currently known as the GTP, and looking at
perhaps, or actually providing a state, look at change it out to an
agricultural inland port. And also looking at how do we improve rail
access to that, that would both accompany or translate to rail
improvements to both the Wilmington port as well as the Moorhead port.
In hopes of growing our number one economic engine agriculture even more
so, through more commerce. And with that I'll ask Co-Chairman Shepherd
to start going over some of the numbers.
[Speaker Change]
What I'd like to do first.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Shepherd is recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker Change]
Yes sir, thank you Mr. Chair. What I'd like to do first is start with
revenue forecast. Projected revenues is down relative to the fiscal year
budget by .02% for FY 14, 1.7% for FY 15. And most of you know this is
due to decreasing fuel motor consumption which was down 2.8% and 4.0%
respectively. And also a drop in the anticipated motor fuel tax rate,
which was down to 37.4% in FY 14 and 36.5 in FY 15. And relative to the
FY 13 budget the highway fund revenues are also down 2.8% in the FY 14,
and 5.1% in FY 15. Highway trust fund revenues are up 4.8% in FY 14, and
4.7% in FY 15. By both versions, both version restructure the highway
trust fund. Secretary of Road Construction power bill allocations to
support HBH-17. The house budge appropriates slightly less to the
highway fund due to reduced program unencumbered cash balances. And the
removal of electric/hybrid vehicle.</p>

all understand
Senate budget would provide the empty the funds to resurface an
additional one thousand two hundred miles of riding. that's a lot about
one thousand two hundred miles in the Senate, but your house budget
would provide the funds to resurface at eight thousand five hundred and
thirteen miles of road, which is equivalent to approximately eleven
percent of all state</p>

Maintain roads. You can see why we were trying to focus to get the
biggest bang for our buck. Another thing you may be interested in, is
that your house budget also provides funding to offset ferry toll
increases that would otherwise have taken effect July 1 2013. So the
house budget pretty much leaves ferries exactly the way they are next
year and the next year as they are today. Another thing we also talked
about doing is outsourcing. We increased outsourcing targets to 65% in
FYI 14 and 70% in FYI 15. We talked about the global transport and we
talked about maintaining the ferries. We also require DOT during the bid
process to use an item known as life cycle cost analysis, so that you
can compute the entire life of the road so the taxpayer gets the biggest
bang for their buck. We've also authorized DOT to engage private council
to assist with any necessary litigation. We also authorized DOT and the
Office of State Budget Management to entertain offers from third parties
to purchase the stock owned by the State in North Carolina Railroad
company; and that's some of the high points, and that now concludes the
report on transportation. Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ??, is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I represent the west and myself on this, we were
chairs of NAR and it was a pleasure working with him. I will present
this myself and he will answer all the questions on the amendments. The
continuation budget for NAR was 345.9 million and the proposed house
appropriated 358.1 million to the NAR budget. The department of
agriculture is 114.3 million this year which is an increase of 5.4
million. We provided marketing funds for our number one industry in
North Carolina, which is agriculture, and that will be marketing funds
for existing resources and also to expand into the international and
domestic markets and to provide the wine in ?? council. We provided 2.5
million and 2.5 million in golden leaf money to modernize the farming
equipment at our research stations which was definitely needed. We also
provided money for the department of agriculture to continue focusing on
the Bio-energy sector and to provide a new department in that Bio-energy
sector. In the department of labor, their budget is 16.7 million and we
increased that by 3.1 million with 500,000 to that continuation budget.
In the department of Environment and National Resources, their budget is
129.5 million and we increased that 20.3 million which is a 18.6%
increase, but most of that increase is because we added some departments
to their section. We added the Clean Water Trust Fund and also we
transferred the Energy Department over there from Commerce. In the Clean
Water Trust Fund, we also put the National Heritage Trust Fund purpose
in there, and we eliminated the National Heritage Trust Fund. We took
the deed stamp money from National Heritage Trust Fund and that will be
deposited in the Clean Water Trust Fund, so they will be getting
approximately 12 to 13 million dollars per year for Clean water, and
they will also be buying land with the National Heritage purpose in
there also. What we did differently from what the senate did is we made
sure that the deed stamp money continues to go into the Clean Water
Trust Fund and into the part of instead of going into the general fund.
Also i did the the Energy department will go from Commerce to ??</p>

We put money, 3.5 million into the non commercial leaking underground
storage fund and this will assist homeowners in cleanup of those leaking
heating oil storage tanks so that they can sell their homes
This has been a huge problem in the state of North Carolina for low
income people and this will help them immensely. We restored the 6
million dollars in the operating fund of the division of parks and recs
so that they may have that extra 6 million dollars that only in the
house budget. And we made sure that the 75 percent of the ?? Money goes
back to ?? Instead of to the general fund. We also appropriated money to
the clean water state revolving fund and also to the drinking water
state revolving fund and that will be on a recurring bases. The wildlife
resources commission, we gave them 14.48 million in the first year and
over 16 million in the 2nd year which restores a lot of the money that
was taken away from them by the senate budget. In the department of
commerce we made sure they have money to increase funding for ?? And
also they will take care of the base realignment and closure and we
provided a million dollars for that, this will be the year for ?? Make
sure that we keep our bases and we provided a million dollars for the
industrial commission and that will provide funds to establish  a
workmen's compensation compliance program and  that was recommended by
our governor. We also provided money to develop a branding and
advertising strategy for the department of commerce so that they can
promote North Carolina and we did on the state aid, we did take nine non
profits and deleted funding for those and that was about 17.7 million
dollars that we did not fund this year but we did fund non profits at
43.2 million most of that going to the ?? Center, we funded the ??
Center this year at 16.6 million in the first year and 20 million in the
second year. We funded the bio technology center at 17.2 million in each
of the ?? And half of that is non reoccurring. High point market
authority we did fund, ?? In the classroom we did fund, the support
center we did fund, research triangle institute we funded that because
they had some matching federal grants and the grassroots science museums
we funded that at a 15 percent reduction but we made sure that those
rural grassroots science museums got a bigger percentage of the money
then they normally do because we realize that they are the ones who are
struggling to keep open  they don’t have the corporate support that the
larger ones do. So this takes care of the NER budget we did the best we
could with the money we had, thank you very much. [SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Hurley please state your purpose [SPEAKER CHANGE] Debate
the bill please [SPEAKER CHANGE] the ?? Recognizes to debate the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I am going to start with justice and public safety
appropriations Background the continuation budget for the four JPS
agencies for year 2013 14 is 2.37 billion the proposed house budget
appropriates 2.35 billion which is a reduction of  17.8 million or 0.75
percent . In 2014 15 this reduction is increased to 3.28 percent or 51.6
million. This budget eliminates 119 vacant positions and 812 filled
positions and we have asked that any vacant positions within 50 mile
radius of these areas from these people who are losing their positions
that they be given first choice this budget starts on page i1 and goes
to page i13 and in the bill it goes from 213  to 254 if you want to look
at that and public safety the proposed budget appropriates 1.7 billion
to the department of public safety in 2013 14 which is a decrease of
17.7 million or 1.03 percent from the continuation budget significant
actions include 3.7 million for inflationary increases for fuel for the
state highway patrol</p>

With the gas prices as they are we needed to fund this. $25 million to
upgrade the [VIPER?] system to allow initial first responders onto the
network. And you've heard that they've got the equipment, they just were
not able to go onto the thing because of the system not being able to
get them on there, not enough room. So we now will have this. $24.2
million in savings from the closure of five prisons, two juvenile
detention facilities and one youth development center. $30,- $39.8
million in the second year. $5.8 million the first year, and $12.1
million in the second year to fund additional probation and parole
positions needed to meet the requirements of the Justice Reinvestment
Act. And also, $3.7 million to expand electronic monitoring for
probationers because the Justice Reinvestment. [John?] Representative
Faircloth will have the rest of the budget.
Representative Faircloth is recognized to debate the bill.
Thank you Mr. Speaker. To continue on JPS budget, in the Department of
Justice we appropriated $76.7 million for the department. That's a
decrease of $1 million, 1.28% from a continuation budget. $1 1/2 million
was appropriated to fund 19 additional toxicology positions in the state
crime lab. This is one of the number one needs we have in the criminal
justice system today. We're so far behind with tests, the courts are
being held up, justice is being held up. So we believe this is a big
step with these 19 positions. We did maintain court reporters and
directed AOC to study the reporting process in the court system. There's
now new technology available and improving every day, so we did tell
them to take a look at that, but we did maintain the reporters. $1
million in additional funding for the support of both the training and
standard commissions. Those are the commissions in the criminal justice
that set standards for hiring and for training our law enforcement
correctional and other justice personnel. Both the sheriffs section of
that and the criminal justice section were funded. 192,000 to the SBI to
fund three investigative positions for combating prescription drug
diversion and fraud, a growing, growing crime in our state and across
the nation and we think that will help them certainly. In the Office of
Indigent [dispense?] Services $116 million, that's an increase of $1.7
million or 1.44% from the continuation budget. $4.1 million was in
non-recurring funding for the first year for the private assigned
counsel fund. That's when indigents require legal services and they are
hired by the court system to protect those. We also recalibrated to
allow the punishments for certain misdimeanors. Reduce some misdemeanors
from one level down to another where we found it was not, would not be
unsafe for the public, but would also take away the required jail
sentence for those misdemeanors and would therefore mean they were not
entitled to have legal services which would reduce the cost to the
general public for those services. We don't think there's anything there
that would endanger the public. These are minor misdemeanors, we think
it's a good move. We, for the administrative office of the courts, we
funded $457.7 million, a reduction of 1.7% from the continuation budget.
727,000 of that was to restore 16 of the magistrate positions that were
eliminated in fiscal year 2011-12. And we also asked the OC
administration to take a $3 million reduction. I would certainly want to
point out that the criminal justice system, all across the system, the
last time we were together in 2011-12 and continuing on, these folks
that work within this system are very dedicated, they're very capable,
they do a wonderful job for us. They have bent over backwards to help us
meet our budgetary requirements and we owe a token of thanks to all of
them. More than a token, we owe them a basketful of thanks. We believe
this is an effective budget. We're working toward public safety,
effective crime prevention and detection, professional, timely and fair
trial services, and secure</p>

Ladies and gentlemen, this is an amendment really clarifies and expands
a portion in the lottery that allows, will allow, more bidders, more
competitors bidders, and end up saving the state quite a bit of money. I
was a small businessman. There were so many state contracts I couldn't
bid on because I couldn't meet the requirement for a cash bond of a
certain size; I couldn't meet this, I couldn't meet that. It just simply
raises the cap so that small bidders can become more involved and, I

[Speaker changes.]...The Clerk will lock machine and record the vote. 41
having voted in the affirmative, 74 in the negative. The amendment
fails. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, just again in order to
expedite the process of hearing the amendments, the Chair is going to
assume if you do not have a light on and the cue is zero that the Chair
need not ask for further discussion, further debate. I will put the
question...at the point and time I put the question, no debate will be
allowed...unless...well, in this particular case until third reading. So
please, if you do intend to debate, please put your light on. If the
light is at zero, the Chair will put the question. Representative

amendment. Representative Fisher is arecognized to send forth AME-38.
The Clerk will read.

on page 112, line 43, line 44 and line 46.

[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, this
is a technical change...does not really do anything substantive to the
amendment from yesterday except to ...base whatever changes in childcare
subsidy allotment on the American Community Survey which happens every
five years instead of the ????? census happens every ten years. We
wanted to have data from the five year community survey to avoid big
variations and change in the childcare subsidy allotments that happen
over a ten year period. The five year gives us a better handle on how
much change there will be and it will be helpful in making plans...for
the counties to  make plans on how to prepare for the size allotment
they will have. So I commend the amendment to you and ask for your
support. Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] Representative McGrady, please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] To speak on the amendment.
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman is recognized to speak on the
amendment.
[Speaker changes.] I rise to just confirm...I view this as a technical
amendment after the amendment we offered yesterday in committee
regarding the child subsidy formula.  We were requested by the
department to consider this five year look at the populations and seems
like a very reasonable thing to do so I would recommend the amendment to
you.

with that but I think that...I think that is the great majority of
people...but it is a way to tell..to predict...the number ahead of the
big variations in change in population that will happen over a ten year
period of time.  It's mostly a way to avoid those big swings but all of
the numbers are captured in the ten year census as well. This just makes
for ...more often to have an idea of how many people we're serving.

this is a highly intrusive survey. And it is mandatory, and when I
called the census bureau to inquire about it, I couldn't get an answer
on where in the statutes the U.S. code that this survey is actually
authorized. It's under a blanket, the census can do basically anything

I yield.

[Speaker Change]
Thank you. Representative Fisher I'm a little confused. But I think what
you've proposed is that we would continue to base the change on the
census every 5 years, but that we would make an adjustment between
those, in the middle of the 10 years with this survey. And that would be
in order to help smooth out these huge swings that make it very
difficult for planning. And that the numbers then would be changed twice
every 10 years, rather than just once.

That is correct Representative Vensco. Thank you for that explanation.

But I would ask, I'm gonna have to vote no if we vote on this amendment
now. It'd be nice to get more information for us to look at it a little
bit more. I would ask that Representative Fisher displace this
amendment.

[Speaker Change]
The gentleman’s recognized to debate the amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and members of the House. This is a version of an
amendment I have tried in past budgets to get adopted. It addresses one
of the common practices that is not what I believe to be good budgeting.
And that has been the funding of positions in the budget often many of
which are not even intended to every be filled. This allows something
called lapse salaries to accrue and allows often time a big pot of money
that can be then used to be moved around, to fund things that are not
budgeted. Sometimes were talking about millions upon millions of
dollars. These are not small amounts now, it's not as big a problem as
it has been because in the last few years we've had somewhat tight
budgets and there's not as many unfilled positions. But I, I would argue
that if we don't do this, and I was told yesterday by staff when I was
getting this together, that in this current budget year there are
agencies that have done this. Department of Corrections to the amount of
102 million, and this would, this would stop the funding of</p>

<p id="125:00">
Some things that are needed. I'm not doubting that, so I had them change
the amendment so that it only applies in the second year of this
biennial budget that we're considering here so that we have a full year
to address this subject for the next year of the biennium. It troubles
me that our budget, if we continue to use this technique, our budget
really isn't our budget, because a budget is supposed to be how spending
is controlled. It's supposed to be a plan, it's supposed to be a
management tool. It's supposed to help inform the public. And if you
look at the numbers in the budget, and you've got money budgeted for one
thing, for example salaries, and you know that it's not going to
salaries, during the year it's going to be moved around, then you're not
really budgeting. It just seems to me that if there are things that need
to be funded out of lapsed salaries we're not getting full control on
our budget, and we're not doing our work if we don't figure out ahead of
time where the money is supposed to go, which positions are not needed,
which positions are not going to be filled, what kind of contingencies,
what kind of areas of spending may need a little bit more of that money
that's going to be shifted around. If you have to have some money to
shift around create something called a contingency fund and put some
flexible money in it. But it just seems to me that this is a very bad
way of doing budgeting, it's gone on for years. I think it's time that
we as a general assembly come to grips with it and I hope the Governors
office will look at this too and we'll address this. I think this is
reasonable in that it does give us a full year. It would not take effect
until July 1st 2014. I urge its adoption. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dollar please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to
debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I appreciate the gentleman's
amendment, however it's sort of the difference between theory and actual
practice in state government. I've actually managed these funds in state
government going back to the eighties, and the amendment is simply not
practical. For example in department of correction you've got to have
some leeway with your lapse salary. You just flat out can't run that
department unless you have a little bit of flexibility in there to be
able to handle things that come up at prisons. And if you don't know all
the contingencies that you don't have for a prison then you need to find
out. But they're not the only ones. Over in HHS we have institutions
that we have to work with all the time that managers have all sorts of
problems with. This general assembly over the years has enacted things
to try to tighten up on lapsed salaries. There have been some times when
we swept up all the lapsed salaries. I remember when we did that a few
years ago to help fund a raise. There's more work that we can be doing
in this area, that point is well taken. But I also have a concern about
the first two lines, 5 and 6, that have to do with salary reserve. Those
are the ongoing and the limitations by my reading of this language
really wouldn't allow you to use salary reserves because there are
purposes you have to use those funds for that are more than straight
wages, social security retirement, and hospitalization payments. So
while the amendment is very well intended and we certainly need to do
additional work in this area I would ask you for the practicality of
running state government that you defeat the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Speaker [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blust please state
your purpose [SPEAKER CHANGES] If representative Dollar will yield for a
question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar does the gentleman
yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar we have quite a bit of
experience over with the department of corrections. Many of these others
want the past practices how much in each year has been used from lapsed
salaries and moved around, doesn't that give any indication that we
could use to more tightly budget that would make it unnecessary to use
this almost facade of positions that we don't intend to fill. It seems
to me we would have a way of looking at on average what has been the use
of this over those years. Last year</p>

Be more up-to-date than previous years, but experience would seem to be
able to allow us to project in a much better way than we've done in past
budgets. You simply cannot budget - I was going to say every paperclip,
but that's essentially what you're talking about.  But you can't budget
every roll of aluminum foil, every roll of toilet paper, every
additional bag of solvent that you need for something out here. You
know, at DOT.  There are all kinds of things - it's just a myriad of
things. And when you  get into the details of what the budget reports
are, the detailed stuff that we don't see, but that is actually done in
the process, I do think that Mr. Pupard???, the new State Budget
Director, is going to be working on a number of these issues. He wants
to try to get at some of these things. But this amendment at this time,
I would just simply have to argue, we don't need it at this time. Let us
continue to work on this, and let's not hamstring our operations.
[Speaker changes]
Representative Michaux, please state your purpose [Speaker changes]
To speak on the amendment[ speaker changes]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [Speaker changes]
I find myself in an unusual position again.  I'm gonna have to join
Representative Dollar in opposing this amendment, simply because of past
experiences.  What you have to understand is that number one is that we
fund, unlike many other states, we fund our salaries at 100%.  In other
words, we fund the pay for all of the positions that we set up in there.
And those positions, many times are not filled for various reasons.
When you cut'em off with a lapsed salary situation. And we do another
thing - we always tell some of these agencies, sometimes to go ahead
with a program, and do it within the means that you have. Sometimes, for
those important programs, the means that you have are those lapsed
salaries.  Until we can be more definitive in how we structure our whole
salary aspect, we just ought not be messing with lapsed salaries at this
juncture. I would hope that you would vote against the amendment.
[Speaker changes]
Representative Glazier please state your purpose [Speaker changes]
To briefly debate the amendment [Speaker changes]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment [Speaker changes]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I, too, join and I think Representative Dollar
very cogently explained the problem. But I want to give a tangible
example. In the times both under our - when the Democrats  were in
control the last two years and now the first three that the Republicans
have been in control, have been as Representative Dollar stated, tough
times.  That's meant that one of the things that's been done, K-12, for
example, to give flexibility, to give them the cuts. This undoes the
flex capacity, because as an example, systems can move salaried
positions if they need additional transportation money, or they need
supply money, or they need textbook money. All of that is flexible. This
would undo the flex provisions that are in the budget for that reason.
And because of what Representative Dollar said, I think this really
would be bad policy right now , even though I think it's well intended,
and hope that everybody would vote against the amendment. [Speaker
changes]
Representative Hager, please state your purpose [Speaker changes]
Mr. Speaker, to see if Representative Dollar will yield for a question.
[Speaker changes]
Representative Dollar, does the gentleman yield? [Speaker changes]
I yield [Speaker changes]
The gentleman yields [Speaker changes]
Thank you, Representative Dollar.  The way you describe these funds, in
business we would almost describe it as contingency fund. Would that be
correct? [Speaker changes]
Well, that could be correct. When you have, say you're authorized for 10
positions or 10 prison guards for example, you're always rotating people
getting hired and people leaving. In the time in which any of those
positions are unfilled, the amount of salary for that period of time
drops into a funds called your lapsed salaries funds. There are
restrictions on how you can use those funds, but that is what, for
example, a prison dips into to deal with a myriad of contingencies that
most of us can't imagine, not working in those systems. [Speaker
Changes]
Mr. Speaker [Speaker changes]
Does the gentleman yield? [Speaker changes]
The gentleman yields [Speaker changes]
Thank you Representative Dollar. Would you happen to know, just on
average, is there an average number of what we're looking at? Is it 1%,
5%, 10%, just in general?  [Speaker changes]
I apologize, I don't have the current numbers on lapsed funds [Speaker
changes]
Mr. Speaker [Speaker changes]
Does the gentleman yield? [Speaker changes]
I yield [Speaker changes]
Does, and if it happens as Representative Glazier put out there and as
Representative Michaux put out there, does it make it difficult for
instance, if you've got lapsed salaries and you move them over to
transportation. Does it make it difficult to track those dollars? Can
you really look at what you</p>

Put out there versus what you spent, or how do you track your accuracy
of your budget?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] They still have to keep track of every dollar they
spent and what it is spent for, and one of the things that the
governments budget office is looking at, they're trying to upgrade their
systems. They're trying to get in a position where they can capture that
information from all across state government in ways that you can make
it more actually useful to us, but every dollar does have to be tracked

[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and Gentleman I support
the amendment and it goes back for a long time. When people back in our
districts ask us questions I remember back in 2010 we had 2400 jobs in
prison guards or related to the prisons that were not funded or funded
but were not hired. And then our prison guards ask why won't we have
help? And you look at the large sums of jobs out there, we've got to
find a way to provide better transparency and accountability. Just in
2012 Governor Perdue said that she would support a bill that
Representative Gillespie and myself were working on if we give three
positions more to [??] at a half million dollars.
There was 113 positions already in [??] that hadn't had a job in two
years. Sooner or later we have got to find a way to have a real budget,
a budget that people at home have. They don't have 113 people in your
local business that you fund every year that you use the money for
something else. It's just transparency and accountability and it makes
better government. So I ask you to support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Avila please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask a question of Representative Dollar please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Representative Dollar I want to
follow up a little bit on what Representative Hager said. When you said
the money is spent during the year and it's kept track of and if it was
lapsed salary that was used for transportation they'd know that. When
they go to prepare next years budget is that lapse salaried money shown
to be needed for transportation or do you start the next budget with
those same lapsed salary numbers?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] well it depends on which fund code and how much the
mounts of money that you are talking about. The complexity of that
frankly boggles the mind when you actually get into getting into all of
these spreadsheets. It would stack up on a floor this high. The efforts
- and there have been efforts in the general assembly over the last
several years to try to capture areas where we know a lot of lapsed
salary had been moved into to fund a purpose. To go back and say, okay,
lets fund those purposes because that is - particularly if you've got a
recurring mater and you got a feel for how much its gonna be, that's
obviously the better way to do that and they're trying to do that. But
if you put a hard tap on all of that you're not going to be able to
operate the every complex facilities, you just won't be able to manage
them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] representative Blust please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak a second time on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill a
second time, amendment a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members of the house, I do have
some sort of problem here as a member, not just on this issue but many
and that I'm trying to be consistent over time and it sometimes boggles
my mind to hear the differences you freshmen wouldn't know that haven't
been here, but the differences in what's said now in the majority versus
being in the  minority. And I guess I have a problem in that I always
meant what I said and I always thought a good idea was a good idea.
Governor - then candidate Perdue when she was running for office called
this whole concept truth in budgeting. And it just seems somewhat - I'm
looking for the right word, I don't want to say deceptive but for
example, in the Department of Correction if we need fewer personnel and
greater inmate medical treatment why are we showing as many personnel as
they have in the budget and then not using the money for that, then
shifting that money and using it for inmate medical? And I'm using that
example because I'm...</p>

cut seven hundred and thirty eight positions in the first year and
that's net and another net reduction of an additional eight hundred and
fourteen positions in the second year, and that's over several thousands

Speaker. It seems to me that we ought to do all that we can to ensure
early childhood learning. As the old adage goes, a stitch in time saves
nine. This would save us a lot of problems on the upper end of a child's
educational careers. And I urge your support of the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Collins please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] To see if Representative Avila would yield for a
question.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Avila, does the lady yield?
[Speaker Changes] I do.
[Speaker Changes] The lady yields.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Avila I just wanted to make sure I
understand, does this amendment add any new slots that we can fund for
pre-K or does it just raise the financial level that we're gonna include
so that we'll have to cut out some of the lower income people to add
these people in?
[Speaker Changes] I think I understand the question that your asking,
and that's simply that what we'll do is just increase the number of
children who are needing slots. We're limited in funding and we're
trying to fund as many as possible. It's why we've added the additional
slots.
[Speaker Changes] The question before the house is the passage of the

Substitute for Senate bill 402. All in favor vote aye, all opposed vote
no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock the machine and
record the vote: 49 having voted in the affirmative, 65 in the negative.
The amendment fails. Ladies and gentleman of the House, members in the
gallery, please silence all cellular phones and personal electronic
devices. Representative Jeter, after consideration of Representative
Dobson's amendment, the gentleman will be recognized to send forth
AMH-37. Representative Dobson is recognized to send forth AMK-32. The
clerk will read.
[Speaker Changes] Amendment AMK-32, Representative Dobson moves to amend
the bill on page 58 line 23 by rewriting that line to read.
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
The members will clear the line.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Basically what this amendment
does is add clarifying language to say that, &quot;We will not prohibit
those deemed eligible by the ELEA to take AP courses.&quot; What the
language as it currently could be interpreted to mean, is that there may
be some that are not eligible for the AP courses. And basically adding
this line clarifies that. And that's what I'd like to accomplish with
this amendment. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I urge your support.
[Speaker Changes] The question before the House is the adoption of the
amendment sent forth by Representative Dobson to the House Committee
Substitute for Senate bill 402. All in favor vote aye, all opposed vote
no. The Clerk will open the vote. The Clerk will lock the machine and

on page 270 lines 29 and 30 by adding between those lines.
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is an amendment to the
bill that would provide approximately $250,000 in funding for some
bike-ped programs that is part of a regional system in our area that is
ongoing and is getting ready to be completed. This funding would allow
the completion of the project moving forward. And I would ask for its
support.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Torbett please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] Speak against the amendment, please.
[Speaker Changes] Before the gentleman is recognized to debate the
amendment, Representative Mobley has advised me that she would prefer
for that amendment to occur after consideration of another amendment. So
Representative Dobson you will be recognized after this amendment to
debate ALE-32. The gentleman is recognized to debate ALL-62.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Both chairmen of
transportation want you to vote no on this, but we deeply respect the
member bringing it forward and understand he consistently looks after
his district. And just want to tell people about –– this has been very

Dollars available. So try to clear up some confusion, probably why the
amendment appeared on the floor today anyway. In the current budget,
there are no dollars appropriated, but they have it listed in their
account an unencumbered 748,633. Now granted there is three or four
projects statewide. The ones that have been acted on are still available
and buyable projects. The ones that are in the mix, so to speak. So
basically, all this says, is that there is more than two years funding
still in the process. So I would respect if members would vote not for

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I thank you Mr. Speaker. This is an amazing program that has taken off
in our state that we should be very proud of. Since 2011, since the
beginning of the program, with the launching of the Lake Norman, bike
pedestrian program, seven more regional planning studies have begun, and
these are all requested at local governments. These bike plans,
pedestrian plans, are a regional concept. There are six to eight
counties involved with each plan, so if there are seven in there, do the
math. Seven times eight, of how many counties are impacted. The biggest
impact of this program is to our rural counties. Its connecting cross
borders with surrounding counties. It is a huge tourism draw. The money
they are asking was 379,477 was in the governor's budget. The senate put
in 250, and the house took it all out. Now, I understand, there is some
probably confusion if you haven’t been involved with this, but the
expanding of this program is an ongoing thing. Having money in the
planning process, a continuum of money coming in, is a way for us to
work with the Federal government to generate  federal dollars coming
down to support this program , and we would hate to see it get stalled.
We are just asking for us to support what the Senate has put forward.
Its only 250,000 dollars, but it generates an amazing benefit in
connectivity, and tourism with our counties and to let you know that
once a planner has been identified to develop this bike plan among seven
or eight counties, they then bring their report back to the NCDOT, but
before it gets there, it has to have all of the local governments of
those seven to eight counties approving that plan. Its a huge process of
pulling, within a region, people together. I ask you to please support
this amendment, its not a lot of money, but it does make a huge impact
statewide.

I will, if its not about a newspaper.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Its not about a newspaper, its just to clarify what I thought I heard, I
am not sure my good ear was attuned to you at this time. Did I
understand you said there are about seven more of these projects in the
planning stages?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There are, this came from the division, there are seven more planning
projects that are in the planning process, and it takes money for those
planning programs to get gear up for the planners to go from county to
county and working within those seven to eight counties.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Additional question Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the Lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So could we envision, the small amount of money, which I agree it is,
and I respect you for bringing it up, but the small amount of money from
this fund, which is like a large amount of money, obviously the 51
million plus. Do you anticipate these and other projects will being
coming forward in the future to take a small amount of money from this
fund also?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I would hope it would not have to come out of this fund in the
future, that it would just become a line item budget that we continue to
fund as the program grows, and we start seeing the benefit of this
program.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, this is just an amendment to try to continue to
address some different concerns that have we been trying to work out
some of the members. What this amendment would do is it still leaves in
place a consolidation of District six, which is six A and six B right
now. The prosecuture on the district court districts, and it will also
this amendment will leave nineteen B as it currently is with Randolph
and Montgomery county. What it will do is leave as well Anson and
Richmond in their individual prosecutoral district and Stanley County
will become the twenty A prosecutoral district and it also will after a
request of Representative Moore in looking at the need of judges in
increases the seat of District Court Judge in District twenty seven B. I
can tell you for those of you wondering the caseload that this is
information we have from the administrative offices of the court as to
the need, for example six A and six B, they currently authorize six
judges and the unrounded judges needed is four point two three. So we're
simply reducing them to what they are needed and are trying to take the
funds available and increase the need where it is actually needed to
cover other areas as well and I would ask for member support.  I believe
Representative Brody's issues have been addressed, as well as
Representative Hurley's and some others so we're just simply trying to
keep this moving forward, but I'll work with members as needs be. So I
would ask for your support. Thank you Mr. Speaker.

Representative Burr, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Burr. My question is, is anybody from the
District Court judges or the Superior Court judges or the District
Attorneys been consulted about this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well AOC has put together the sheets and such that we've worked on so
this is simply continuing to make those changes as needed, so I mean
there've been some discussions there. Everything as we worked to change
the districts around were based on the formulas that we have from
administrative offices of the court. So were trying to make changes that
that fit with the caseload there as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Another question please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Specifically, have the district attorneys in this district
asked for this, or the Superior Court judges or the District Court
judges  or the lawyers?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's what we've been working on as we've worked to change the
districts obviously that the DA for Anson, Richman, Stanley currently
wanted to keep his district.  We worked to do that. My Montgomery
County, the county that I represent Montgomery county, a lot of the
citizens in the County would like to come into a district with Stanley
and Montgomery. The judges in Randolph County requested to keep
Montgomery.  Some of them have family that live there and they won't
still be able to vote for them so we tried to make changes for their
needs. We're simply trying to make changes that my concern is trying to
work with my community, Stanley county, a lot of folks that want to get
out of the current twentieth judicial district and move into another.
We've look at other options.  I have worked in the past four years,
trying to look at Union County, which is the district we used to be
with. They're a single member County, they don't want to have another
county with them, and we've looked at Cabarrus. They're one of the
county, we're kind of like the redheaded stepchild, we've tried to find
a way to address our issues but keep this budget neutral and this is
what this bill will do, this part of the bill will do is keep this
budget neutral, put resources where they're actually needed.

Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Rep. Burr, would you review for me please what you said about 6a and 6b?

Yes ma'am, it says that the need for district court based on the
workload formula, the data they have through June 30th of 2012, that
there is a need of- that you currently have 6 judges authorized and
there is a need for 4.23, that is an unrounded number.

says that you should currently- I think that in terms of that, you
shouldn't see any changes within that. It should be roughly what it is

probably are underfunded, but so is everybody else when it comes to

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir.
The information with regard to the judges, I spoke with a couple of our
judges from 6a and 6b on yesterday, and I was assured that the numbers
are skewed a bit because the rural areas tend to do differently in their
deliberations of cases in the various districts. They have a lot less
resources, they have a lot more area to cover, and I don't think this
study or the numbers presented are favorable when it comes to laying out
the staff that is available to them. So I certainly will not be voting
for this amendment. And secondly, yes, the numbers are remaining the
same. But it's difficult for me to understand how for the prosecutorial
district as well as a district court judges, how you're going to
separate them from the Superior Court judges? It's different, it's
difficult for me to understand that and I will not be voting in favor of
this.

Rep. Michaux, please state your purpose.

I'd like to ask Rep. Burr a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Burr, in looking at this, 6a and 6b- no, back up, when we started
out, there were 2 superior court judges, 6a and 6a. One in 6a and one in
6b. And you maintain that, correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So what you did then, you came back in 6a and 6b for district court, you
made 6a and 6B one district and cut 2 district court judges.
May I speak on the amendment Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There's a lot of inconsistency there, I'm just wondering how you have
combined 2 districts and you cut the number of judges in there that you
do. That's number one. Number two is it just seems inconsistent that you
got district 6, you got 6A and 6B, for superior court judges. One in 6a
and 1 in 6b. Then you have district 6, which is a blast of the District
Court judges, where in 6a before you had 3 in 6a and 3 in 6b, now when
you combine it, you have only 4 district cout judges left. The only
caveat I put in that is that I would remind you that those</p>

Baskerville please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Question for
the amendment sponsor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Burr yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Which committee did this,
did this amendment come through a committee and get voted up or down in
a committee? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Came through the appropriations committee
and the finance committee which I believe all members of this chamber or
most serve on with the exception of the Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields? [SPEAKER CHANGES] So
was there a substantive bill presented that addresses this consolidation
of prosecutorial in judicial districts in either or either of those
committees. Or was it an amendment? [SPEAKER CHANGES] And I will add as
well it did come through a third. It came through the subcommittee on
justice and public safety of the appropriations committee. It came
through three separate committees and has been out there through that
process. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Brief follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So how many
new judges are you adding to your district? [SPEAKER CHANGES] One.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is that? Follow up Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is that, is that a superior court or
a district court judge. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It is a district court judge.
And actually based on the need that is under, under what is actually
needed based on the numbers that I have for my area. So it still doesn’t
fund my area. We will go from one to two. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Lastly. What
was that number? I mean you mentioned four point two three for the other
districts. What was that number for yours? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Right. And
the way this is here it’s still, and we’re trying to get the updated
numbers cuz this includes the Montgomery and the Stanley county district
together as a new 20A. And that is three point two three. Montgomery
County has a population for 23,000. Stanley County has a population of
around 62,000. So we’re about two-thirds. So, so we’re still below with
what we need. They don’t run court as often in Montgomery County as we
do in Stanley County. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

DAs, I mean one of the judges has been there about 16 years. One judge

consolidated with this district is the third largest county in the state
of North Carolina geographically. I want to work across the aisle. I’m a
team player. But I feel like this is just a slap in the East. And to our
area, I mean, it’s just, it’s just unreal. And I would hope the chairman
of the committee will continue to work with us and try to get a
solution. Because again working together works. But you know the red

6a by itself only has 53,000 people, and then it has 3 judges, a DEA and
a superior court judge. That is the lowest, or I guess the highest ratio
of judges to population anywhere in the state. The population simply
doesn't support that. This amendment is not a matter of trying to pick
on one region or another, it simply is taking a look at the case loads
and the work loads, and the allocation of the limited resources and
judges across the state. Frankly the district should've never been split
in the first place. With the combined district it'll have 120,000
people, and 4 judges. That puts it well within what ?? or ?? as I
understand it deems an appropriate work load. If you didn't reduce these
judges, they would have 2 judges in excess, what does that mean? There's
fewer judges around the other parts of the state that the other members
of this house represent. Members, this is simply a good amendment and
it's gonna fix this, then again there should've never been a divided
district in the first place. ?? Representative Wray and others are in
the position of just having to see this being voted this way, but it
should've never been done. If you look at, I would submit probably the
reason the district was divided in the first place was for politics,
this is trying to pull that back out in a ?? judicial economy. Members,
I urge you to support the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Baskerville, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak a second
time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the
amendment a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm
not addressing any motives or anything, I'm just, I'm talking about
experience. You know, it's population is important to look at when
determining how judges are gonna be allocated, but I also think it's
important to look at the number of filings the judges have to deal with,
that get filed in the court house. The number of cases that they have to
deal with. I think that these rural areas, they have just as many
filings, just as many cases, you'd be surprised. With a smaller
population, as do some of these counties with a larger population. And,
if this was such an important issue, why did we not file a bill to
address this, have that bill be heard and then commiteed. I mean, I've
looked, this has not been filed as a substitute bill. It's been an
amendment to the budget. Now if the policy is important, and it's
important that we have judges where they ought to be, why not file a
bill, let it be heard in committee, just that bill alone and not try to
slip it as an amendment into a 20 billion dollar budget? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Question before the house is to pass the amendment sent forth
by representative Burr to the house committee substitute for senate bill
402. All in favor vote aye, all opposed vote no. The clerk will open the
vote. The clerk will let the machine record the vote. 69 have been voted
affirmative, 43 in the negative. The amendment passes. Representative
Fisher, the chair understands that the lady wishes to withdraw 8ME-38
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representatives, Goodman and Mobley, the chair understands as
the result of the passage of the Burr amendment, that your amendments in
their current form are out of order. But because your amendment came to
the clerks desk before 2 pm, if you wish to consult with staff and see
if there is some amendment that it can be put back in order, the chair
will accept it. Otherwise the amendments 8LL-32 from representative
Mobley amendment 8LL-63 from representative Goodman, the chair, at this
time rules them out of order. Representative Richardson, after
consideration of representative Faircloth's amendment, your 8LM-41 will
be considered. Representative Faircloth is recognized to send forth
AMD-30. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Amendment AMD-30.
Representative Faircloth moves to amend the bill on page 219, line 39 by
inserting immediately after that line, a new section to read. [SPEAKER

division. There was also an operating reduction of $191,458. We had had
a request from the management there to consider rather than designating
those three positions as being required to be deleted, that we simply
put the two sums of money together, require the same money be deleted,
but give them the management the freedom to organize their division as
they saw fit. So it doesn't change the dollars at all, it simply
accommodates management request and I ask you to support the amendment.

the bill on page 268 lines 45-50 by rewriting the lines to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blust is recognized to debate the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, this also
is an issue that's been around for a while, that some of us have had
concerns about for a long time. And it concerns the, well, what's known
as discretionary transportation funds. This too has caused some problems
in the past that hopefully we're behind, or we're finished with, but you
never know. I would simply explain it this way. This amendment is going
to have those funds allocated for these type rural and small projects,
handled exclusively through the executive branch, through the governor's
office, with approval from the secretary of state- secretary of
transportation. That's where these decisions properly belong, not before
the legislature. It's a separation of powers issue when members of the
legislative branch can appropriate the funds and direct the expenditure
of the funds also. This is one, this provision also comports well with
the 817, the House bill 817 that passed. That was the Governor and
Secretary of State's big transportation law rewrite, in that it was said
very clearly there that we were going to take politics out of the
expenditure of the transportation money, and use more objective
criteria. So I urge your adoption of this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Torbett, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speaking on the amendment, Mr.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen of the
House, it's not that I totally disagree with the amendment and the
actions of my colleague, Representative Blust, but just let me tell you
what I think. I like the governor. Most days. I like the president Pro
Tempore of the Senate. Most days. I like the Speaker of the House.
Sometimes. But I personally don't think that any one individual ought to
have the sole power of discretionary funds. I think personally that puts
too much of the, I'll say in a nice way, responsibility, let's say, onto
one individual.</p>

Currently these funds are distributed among those three members that I
mentioned. I think it's a very diverse way of applying those
appropriations. I think it's a fair and equitable way. Everyone pretty
much has a say, and everyone the same amount to use as discretionary.
I'd appreciate you voting the amendment down. Representative Sheppard,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, Mr. Speaker. I
would also like... [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to
debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. I would also like
to ask the chairman to vote against this because I think with the
process we have so that with HBH17 and it has been thoroughly vetted
that this gives everybody an opportunity to do the right thing.
And none of this can be done without security of transportation. I know
there's input on this, so I'd ask you to vote against this. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Greer Martin, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you Mr. Speaker. I remember way back in the distant past when I chaired
the transportation appropriation sub-committee. We worked in a
bi-partisan fashion to try to reduce these funds. Moving in the
direction that this amendment would take us all the way. We weren't
completely successful in that, but I will remind the members that that
budget passed out of the transportation appropriation sub-committee with
bi-partisan unanimous support. So I'd urge your support for this
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, please state your purpose. To
debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to
debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, members of the
House, I urge you to vote against this amendment. These funds are often
used in a lot of ways for economic development projects around the
state. They are a way that transportation can work hand in hand with
local economic development partnering agencies, with commerce, with
other areas of state government. And they help allow that money to be
allocated more efficiently at times. Sometimes, going through the normal
DOT process, it's more cumbersome, more bureaucratic, it takes a while
to make things happen. And when you have, for example large companies
that are looking to locate in this state, and they're looking at North
Carolina verses South Carolina, or somewhere else, they need decisions
made quickly.
And that's where the majority of these funds are used at times, to help
in that respect. So if you vote for this amendment you're taking another
tool out of the tool box. It's often used for recruit industry and bring
jobs, particularly if you're from a rural county in the state. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Jackson please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Just speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Speaker. I'm going to ask people, colleagues, to vote against this
amendment as well. I wanted to point out that I have enjoyed the use of.
I've been able to get these types of funds in my district under both
speaker Hackney and speaker Tylis. Most recently we used the funds to
complete a turn lane for a boys and girls club that was being built.
They were three-quarters through the construction when DOT came to 'em
and said you're going to have to add a turn lane for safety. And the
project would have been kinda at a stand still if not were able to get
these types of funds. I think it's a good source for you when you need
something your local community and you don't have two years it would
take to go through DOT. I'd ask you to oppose this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Wilkins please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman is
recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Speaker. If I may, I would like to follow the track that Representative
Moore took. These funds are frequently used for economic development
projects. And the way I read the amendment, we're just going to stick
another layer of bureaucracy in here and sometimes on economic
development projects you really do need to move rapidly. Your county,
economic development people don't need to have to go through the
governors office in addition to the department of transportation. I urge
you to defeat the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Blyse, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak a second time on the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Well this amendment does not
create another layer of bureaucracy. The way this language reads now
still requires approval of the secretary of transportation. All this
does is drop requested by the speaker requested by the president of
protim. And puts requested by the Governor in it right now we have a
situation where there's a pot of money that's divided up 4 million a
piece. The speaker, the president of protim, and the governor. And this
is peculiarly, the spending of money, once it's appropriated as an
executive function, I had handed out a very similar amendment two years
ago and speaker Tylis said he was fine with it.</p>

on the amendment of that time at the request of some of our members who
made the case that hate on got things in the pipeline and we finally get

more years, but adopted, so make up your mind help hydrogen about on
your or not I can I can live with. with any result. I just been here in
earlier years when we had made a big deal of this, because it was very
odd that it allows some people more influence in others, and someone
said we all ought to have access and I don't believe everybody has equal
access. it won't affect economic recruitment because the governor is the
chief economic recruiter in the state. he's the one that helps direct
the jaded money and some of another money so I don't think you'll find
Governor McCrory is so opposing members to go and watch some of this
discretionary money. I just think it's it's better government is good
government is more transparent government. if the amendment is passed,

[SPEAKER CHANGES].
I remember a number of years ago, when the problems originally arose
that probably inspired representative that he may be minute so that at
that time, and it inspired him in this way that action needed to be
taken because at the time those funds were just there were, you never
saw my mentor, like in a black box laying hidden away, layer upon layer
upon layer and that's not the case any coming changes were made and
these funds are publicly accounted for now and as representative more
mentioned as the two chairs of our appropriations transportation
subcommittee also pointed out that I rise in support of their position.
these funds are very very small slice of the transportation budget that
a while was to more rapidly and namely respond to needs out in your
communities and most of it does end up going to projects where you need
some additional funding in order to get access to an industrial site. we
trumpeting jobs. a lot of times, but most of the time,the funds have to
be matched with the Romans was exact requirement for this, but in most
cases, funds are being matched by local cities and towns for these
projects. these are good public  projects. it's out in the lie not the
way it used to be, and I would just urge her defeat of the amendment or
vinegar with nature, purpose, they got a minute. Jim is recognizing

some momentum was written as the Reagan in the second famous figure

Exist. Let's say I for example needed a, a, a red light or a turning
lane or something in my district. It's not that I can just go to the
Speaker, go to the President, go to the Governor and ask for the money,
and he writes me a check and you get your, whatever you're asking for.
It's not like that at all. You have to apply for it, you have to give it
background information, you have to give it the, the, the why's, and how
comes, and then it's vetted, and then it goes in front of the
transportation board, whenever they meet. And they have to vote it up,
and they have to vote it down, it has to be signed off by the Secretary,
and then you may start getting some action on it. But even at the time
that, that takes that's lightning speed compared to just trying to get a
basic project run under the normal circumstance. So there is
accountability, there's responsibility, it's a very effective and
efficient way of taking care of immediate and emergency needs you might
need in way of transportation. I'd appreciate you voting the amendment

Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman of the house clearly in

education. Education is not cheap, we know that. Families are
struggling, a lot of families have been laid off work, students are
working to try to pay for, to pay their tuition and it is very, very
difficult. This amendment would create a 6% increase and would make that
increase for non-resident students the same across the university
system. In, in this. Thank you Mr. Speaker. In the budget we see that
there's a 12.3% for some specific schools UNC, North Carolina A&amp;T,
North Carolina State, UNC Chapel Hill, and so forth in the 6% for the
campuses. I, I just want to make a plea for these students who, even
though they come from other states, they stay and they make a
contribution, a significant contribution to our state, I'm one example.
I've been here since 1964 when I came from New Jersey, I've heard New
Jersey mentioned a lot on this floor, it's a good state. But I came from
New Jersey out of high school and I'm still here. And I don't need to
tell you about the work I've done, and the contributions and the taxes
that I've paid. So out of state students do make a contribution. But I

to help you understand importance of diversity in our university
systems, in any classroom; that is an asset.  For North Carolina
students to be sitting in classrooms with other students is a good
thing, and its a productive thing.  not just for North Carolina
students, but for the out of state students as well.  And then finally i
want to say about this, just because you may come from a state like New
Jersey or other states, whether its Virginia or South Carolina, to come
to our great university system.  you don't have any more money just
because you are an out of state student, as a matter of fact you have
less money, and so we are going to have a situation if we don't adjust
this.  where out of state students are just not going to come, they are
not going to be able to afford it.  i think that that would be a
terrible thing to happen, not only to those students but to our
university system as a whole.  i hope that you would support this
amendment, and let's bring some equity to this process, and consider the
fact that these universities have increased tuition, continuously, for
not only these students but for all students. and we do want them to
stay in school, we do want them to come to North Carolina, and to
receive a college education, and i would commend it to you, and hope you

[speaker changes]
the agenda right now is to debate the amendment
[speaker changes]
I would urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, this amendment was
brought up in the appropriations committee yesterday. to put the
amendment in context, this relates to tuition increases that would occur
in the second year of the two year budget.  the governor has recommended
these tuition increases in his budget, but he put them beginning next
year.  our view was that we ought to push them back a year, to allow the
board of governors to look at them themselves, but our understanding was
that they are based on surveys of comparable universities and what the
tuition's involved are. and i would tell the members that this relates
to non resident tuition's, so we are in a little bit of a different
place than we would be if we were talking about raising tuition on
residents who were paying for their subsidized education.  that is not
the case here, this is a case of trying to pay what the market will
bear, with respect to non resident tuition's, so i would urge you to
oppose this amendment.

thank you mister speaker, i rise in support of the amendment.  you know
i really think that diversity really adds to the academic atmosphere of
our prize winning universities, especially our flagship universities.
we have been known throughout the country and throughout the world. for
the number of bright students we have attracted from around the United
States, and the world. and our total university system, all 16 campuses,
can boast of diversity from throughout the world.  and so i wouldn't
want us to do anything that would detract from that, i recognize, and i
applaud the stake holders, the investors, especially the educational
committee, that has deferred this for a year.  but deferring it for a
year still creates a handicap on those that would desire to come to our
universities...

You are more greatly subsidizing with North Carolina tax dollars people
that are coming in from out of state that are receiving a tremendous
value. North Carolina, even with the changes that are in the budget,
will still remain one of the absolute best values for any out of state
student coming in. So we don't believe that it will have any effect at
all in terms of the talent pool that comes to this state and we need to
have some fairness because remember there a been tuition increases over
the last several years for in-state students, so we should be
considering what their position has been and how their tuition has

issue and I would request you defeat the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Adams,  please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Lady is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker I’ve gotta tell you, first of all I think this
money goes to the general fund. But we talk about that we’re not raising
tuition for in-state students but that's also what we're going to have
to do because out of state students are going to be priced out they’re
not going to be able to come.
The other point I want to make is that in this listing in this part of
the budget number 59 North Carolina A&amp;C it is one of the state's
historically black colleges and universities does a tremendous job are
students come are in financial straits. If you know anything about
students to attend HBCUs I've done a lot of work with the Legislative
Black Caucus Foundation we’re raising money for students right now to
try to decrease some of that debt and we find that students enrolled in
these institutions, and North Carolina A&amp;C is part of this group,
have more debt ratio than students at other schools. So I just don't
think that when we say we're not impacting in state students, we have
raised their tuition and when out of state students don't come because
they can't afford to come, then we're going to have to look for another
way to finance these schools and I suspect that we're going to be
raising that tuition relatively soon. This is a good amendment it’s a
fair, we talked about fair, this is a fair amendment and I would
appreciate your support.

Thank you mr Speaker I want to point out the disadvantage of increasing
rates for graduate students. Graduate students at our research
institutions are assisting on grant research, and IH grant research is
one of the major sources of income for innovative projects in North
Carolina and all of our research institutions. If you increase tuition
for out of state graduate students many of them will not be able to
afford to come if we lose our graduate students we very well may be
losing are grants and so I hope you vote for the amendment.

looked at the comparables for quality institutions, peer comparisons and
find that we have continued and will continue with this change to
operate in the bottom quartile for tuition. As well we're very proud of
the diversity and quality of education in all of our schools across
North Carolina. We are continuing to encourage scholarships and need
based quality students so that we keep those graduation rates up and and
we get the kids that are coming here serious about school, serious about
graduation, and serious about their life. We ask you to defeat the

Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. This amendment pertains to the North

slots. The pilot and the study are in both the House and Senate budgets.
I think they're both a really good idea. And while we're studying it, I
just think there are a few more elements that we should look at. And
this would simply add that in addition to attendance records and the
numbers of parents using different programs and those things, that we
also look at parent satisfaction levels, teacher retention, and the
provider satisfaction levels. Since we're studying anyway, this would be
a very minor thing to add to it and I think it would give us a lot more

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, this
amendment will provide 250,000 each year in non-recurring money to the
Land Loss Prevention Project. That is one of the commerce state aid
items in the commerce budget. The money will be coming from the utility
account in the JDIG program. The Senate and the Governor took a 5
million dollar reduction, utility reduction, in their budget. The House
took no reduction, so there's 50 million dollars in funding for JDIG
this year and 63 million in funding for JDIG next year. This would take
250,000 dollars out of those two accounts over the next two years. I
would just like to talk to you a little bit about what the Land Loss
Prevention Project is.</p>

something we’ve been funding for a couple of decades. It assists
low-income...thank you. It assists low-income farmers and helps them
stay on their land. These are African-American and white farmers. It’s
comprehensive legal services, technical support and North Carolina
financially distressed farmers with limited resources who are seeking to
preserve their farms and stay in their homes. They do a lot foreclosure
prevention and keeping families on their farms who are suffering from
financial stresses. There was some information going around that they
were going to use this money to sue the federal government. I just want
to disabuse you of this notion. That’s is not what they do at all with
this money. They negotiate on behalf of the farmer, they assist in
foreclosures and loan modifications, but they do not use this money to
sue the federal government. I just wanted to make that clear. If we do
cut their funding, there are a lot of farmers on the staff that are
going to have to end their cases and transfer them to hopefully there’s
a pro bono lawyer out there, but you can’t count on that. This is a

Perhaps this anecdote will shed a little bit of light on it. About ten
years ago, I represented a homeless women, and the reason she was
homeless was because her landlord unplugged the electricity that went
from his trailer to her trailer, effectively evicting her. Discovered
she didn’t have running water, in other words, it was a complete mess.
She was homeless, our church put her up for a night and then I took her
case, pro bono. We got treble damages against her landlord for the years
he had charged her a hundred dollars a month for nothing. Attorneys fees
put in there, we got a judgement against her landlord. Then we
discovered that the landlord didn’t own the property. His wife owned it
and she’d gone up the road to New Jersey twenty years earlier, but we
got her to deed the land back to the landlord so we could execute on the
judgement. So here we are, we start the execution, we had to do it about
ten times. We had to get the property surveyed. I had to enlist a
surveyor to do a survey so we’d know what to do. Well, guess what
happened. He finally got a defense and his defense was, well, he was
represented by the Land Lost Prevention Project. Guess what. My client
had lost her home and she was African-American. She was fighting the
Land Loss Prevention Project. It had a happy ending, but that’s time for
another day.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I appreciate Representative Stam. I still didn’t get the point of the
story, but in all seriousness, what the Land Lost Prevention Project
does is it addresses things that have happened to folks who have lost
their property through no fault of their own. They’ve lost it because
they had inherited property and the way it was done many, many, many
years ago, even before I was born, there were problems there and people
took some other folks property. And Land Lost goes back in and helps
those people recapture those properties. This is their property,
basically, that was lost because, and this was black farmers who lost
their property some folks took it away from them because of certain
things like farming, all of these things, building were old. This has
been very successful. In spite of the anecdote that was told by
Representative Stam, this is a very serious problem and it helps to
rectify some problems that have happened to a group of people in the
past that really should not happened, that should have been able to
maintain the property and they were just not able to do it.</p>

Speaker:  The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman of the
house, I would direct your attention, if you would like to I5 of the
money report, item 34, you will note closes western youth institution
and under the dollar amount involved you will see that it is 323
employees that are being eliminated. Burke County, where this is
located, is a tier 1 county. Our unemployment just barely fell under 10%
for the first time in a long time. Even before the great recession
began, I guess before the end of 2008 –s 2009, Burke County was already
suffering from a high rate of unemployment due to the loss of furniture
and textile jobs. My concern here is that the department or division of
adult corrections has not done the sort of job that we owe to the people
of this state when it is going to impact, in a major way, the economy of
an area that extends beyond Burke County and into Caldwell and
Rutherford, Calb and McDowell certainly, and that there ought to be more
of a planning process, more of a transition, when something of this
magnitude is going to happen. If you will look at your money report, on
pages I4-5, you can see that there are a number of other facilities that
are being closed, but with the exception of Wayne, which is 150, which
is less than half what is planned for western youth, the others are 80
and 44 and 50 substantially less. What my amendment would do, is to
allow this facility to stay open for two more years, but for the first
year, provide for a 10% reduction in the staffing of the prison; the
second year, would be an additional 15%, taking it up to 25. If we did
simply that and stop that would be about 80 positions, with the
exception of Wayne’s 150, is equal to</p>

greater than the other provisions individually that are listed for
foreclosures as well now in terms of financing this think it's also
worthwhile to note that information from staff and I checked on this I
think as recently as this morning is that there are over 1600 thats 1600
vacancies in the adult corrections division involving unspent funds as
long as those positions remain vacant of $81 million what my amendment
ask is that we use 5,000,00 and 5.4 million in the first year the
biennium and $10 million almost 10 1/2 million in the second year of the
biennium to eliminate the vacant positions of the 1600 positions in the
$81 million dollors in order to help transition this facility to where
it needs to be an additional financial aid in paying for this is the
item that you will see on line 13 that involves probation and parole
positions now you all understand recall that we passed justice
reinvestment and that  moving us away from the formal system that we had
of what I think was called into intense probation or intensive probation
or something to that effect which survellence officers and intensive
probation officers were used were now moving into a different kind of
probation the result of this is that we rightly project it would have
the need for additional probation officers in order to handle these
people and to watch them more closely than we have done in the past but
the thing to remember is that without another dime being appropriated
203 of those former positions are being transitioned under this budget
is I understand it into the new probation provisions that under the
budget there is a proposal that would add 75 positions in addition to
the 203 in the first year of the biennium hundred and 75 more in the
second year of the proposal I  would limit the additional probation
officers above the 203 to 50 instead of 75 for the first year and a 100
instead of 175 in the second year given the newness of justice
reinvestment given  the transition of the other probation officers into
this function given the movie to the substantial numbers we don't
actually know that will be able to hire the kind of people we need for
these positions in those numbers so my suggestion and the amendment
would in effect say we delay a few of those probation positions see how
that develops and by doing that we free up  the money to continue this
facility for two years during the second year is reduced to 75% of what
it's been now the balance of the bill is a taskforce that basically says
if state government in acts legislation that is going to eliminate
across state agencies in the tier 1 or tier 2 County over 100 positions
somebody in state government spend the time and do the planning to try
to help those employees and their families find new positions and this
task force would be set up it would require the additional funding it
would be comprised of representatives from commerce from personnel and
I'm sorry of my state budget and management and from the employment
security commission to assist these people and trying to find additional
jobs as a result we can come back in the iterium and if we have a need
for more probation officers we can reconsider it over the course of the
biennium we can do the planning for closing this larger facility and a
tier 1 County</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As the co-chair of the ?? of Public Safety we took in a lot of
consideration and this was a tough budget. These decisions as far as
closures of these facilities were not easy both on the staff and
legislators as well. We took recommendations from the staff and they
determine that the facilities that were proposed to be closed which
Representative Blackwells, he's not the only one as you all have seen in
the money report, there are several in the state. But this particular
facility is an obsolete facility I don't know if any of y9ou all have
been there. It's very not conducive for the juveniles. And
Representative Blackwell was correct in that the justice reinvestment
has initiated a lot of these. When I came here 5 years ago, we had 20 or
roughly 2500 and 2800 juveniles in detention. Today we have less than
300, about 350. So the ?? has to be that we just don't need it and the
ones that we have particular closing here are the ones that are
obsolete. And he had mentioned as far as the probation officers...yes
that is a critical part of the justice reinvestment. It mentions that
the 75 the first year and then the 175 the 2nd year. We will propose a
list to hire 75 the first year and 100 the second year which would bring
the total of what the budget is for 175 not 225. So, with that, I, it
will really be a strain on the present budget that we have. We had a
great discussion on this yesterday. I urge you to oppose the amendment.
We have had to make some tough decisions. We're not happy with a lot of
decisions, but, with the excess bid capacity, we have newer facilities
that are that we're able to give vocational education and educational
better opportunities for the juveniles and this is just part of the
justice reinvestment that we voted on and it is working. And this
facility is obsolete. I urge you to oppose this amendment, thank you Mr.

ran about what we call walk around money, lap ?? money. Well
Representative Blackwell's debate he talked about how much walking
around how much lap ?? money there were out there in this particular
area. We had the opportunity to save several hundred jobs in Bark
County, some of which some out of my district and Rutherford County
also. Now, given the fact that we know that money's out there for
emergencies as Representative Dollar had said earlier, my question to
you is why wouldn't we use it to give these folks a little bit more life
so they can go find a job, give them some time to transition.

debate in the German has aborted baby amendment speaker. I just wanted
to briefly rise in support of Representative Hager and represented black
wool, and also Mister Speaker, our colleague,Senator Daniel and Senate
in support of this amendment
for all purposes, the gentleman from Burke represented Blackwell rise to
speak briefly a second time. Emily has reported to make a nanosecond
when they start by saying that it greatly times meas well, rep• refer
you to disagree with me. it's interesting that we hear descriptions on
the floor today that this prison is obsolete the department didn't think
that a few months back when I tried to talk to them about whether there
were issues that your when I talk with them last about what the plans
for the future. the building was they didn't indicate that we had the
kind of surplus bed capacity that we did
the prison has been operating successfully without any injuries or
danger or problems. I think represented battles has overstated tenant an
important way the issue regarding to the lack of Sokol went sales. the
problem is not that they have to do is describe our rivers and bold.
there is a sure shine is outside the ward and pushes a button to open
the individual. therefore, so that the prisoner can come out of the sale
and use the restroom with these prisoners, one of the problems with the
wet cells is that they stuff things in the mileage and otherwise affect
the plumbing in ways that it causes problems. the department has had no
problem using this facility like never before. our acknowledged that
there were any issues about safety. all I'm asking is that the house
give us two years, considering the size of the impact on our area to use
some of the surplus funds to transition will give the eighty jobs over
two years in a bid in the two years we may be faced with a closure, but
in the meantime, there can be opportunity to plan</p>

Speaker changes: Does the German yield to an additional question?
Speaker changes: Yes, I do.
Speaker changes: He yields.[ The German state is required??.]
Speaker changes: And I guess our concern also is that there is no fire
suppression in the building.
Speaker changes: May I respond?
Speaker changes: If the German has got to answer the question.
Speaker changes: It’s my understanding that that’s been true for the
years since it’s been there and that the department was not concerned
about it.
Speaker changes: Until now when they were trying to justify the closing.
Speaker changes: Thank you Mr. Beck.
Speaker changes: Okay.
Speaker changes: For what purpose does the gentleman from Rutherford
represent xxx??
Speaker changes: Speaking to me for the second time?
Speaker changes: The German[ has afforded in ]??making the amendment a
second time.
Speaker changes: A second
Speaker changes: You may speak.
Speaker changes: I have made no, no secret that I tax credits, I hate
giving folks things that they didn’t earn and most of you all said Mr.
xxx you need to promise these people, we need  to let this go out  for a
year, two years,  whatever the number of years .[xxxx] We at least have
made promises to these folks; we need to give them transition time as
Representative Blackwell was saying, we need to give hundreds of folks
in a depressed area time to go find another job. I don’t think
Representative Blackwell was saying let’s keep this facility open
forever.
Speaker changes: That was as good as putting words into Representative
Blackwell’s mouth.
Speaker changes: I don’t think that’s what I am saying. I don’t think I
am saying what he is saying. The fund is there, the money is there,
let’s give folks some time to do some transition. Let’s give them time
to go find a job elsewhere. Let’s give time for the economy to work.
Lets get these folks back to work.So please don’t ‘yes’ on it.
Speaker changes: The question before the house is the adoption of the
amendment nineteen offered by Representative Blackwell.
Speaker changes: So those who favor the adoption of the amendment will
signify by a voting aye, the clerk will open the vote.
[Pause]
The clerk has locked the machine and I have counted the vote; 39 voting
in the affirmative and 67 in the negative. The amendment is not adopted.
Speaker Changes: Members, the next amendment we are going to going to
take up is amendment ALE 40 offered by Representative Tine  and  time
and the amendment following that would be amendment AMK 31 to be
presented by Representative Whitmire. The gentleman from Washington??
Representative Tine is recognized to explain the amendment after the
court leaves.
Speaker changes: Amendment ALE 40 Representative Tine move the bill ,
it’s page 45, find 46 through 55 rewriting the lines to read.
Representative xx has reported xxx
Speaker changes: Thank you Mr. Speaker. This amendment has its deals
with the small schools, system formula under the current House project
that was represented here today ; there is a new formula that would
greatly affect some counties of the 27 counties that this funding is
provided for Hyde for example which I can speak for because it’s in my
district, would receive a million dollar cut in two years. They have a $
10 million budget per year resulting in about 22 losses of personnel
because they are taken xx??  anymore. They have two schools one of them
in the mainland and one up on the Island. So the only place to go for
personnel and about a hundred folks in the school systems. So if there
is 20 percent reduction in staff . What this amendment would do is
postpone the implementation of the new formula by one year. The cost of
that would be absorbed by dividing amongst all those counties that are
currently there in the evenly distributed cost . It would  allow us the
time to ALEs the plan,ALEs the plan  rather, and since two weeks out
from  their budget would be going forward. It would also give us time in
between now and the short session to decide how we are going to fund all
our schools in North Carolina as opposed to proceed fixes according to
the current formula , how are we going to invest in world communities so
that we have the best jobs , the best skills..</p>

those considerations. I urge your support of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose the gentleman from Chowan, Representative Steinburg,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendments, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The member has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, I rise in support of this particular amendment and
all of you in the House who are representing rural areas should pay
close attention to not just what I’m saying, but what is going to be
said here on the floor regarding this particular issue. I have probably
as many or more counties, rural counties in my district than anyone. I
have six.
Under the proposed legislation, not the amendment, but what’s in the
budget now, the way they’re going to fund small schools, we have...I
have four schools out of my six that will actually benefit. Maybe
getting a little bit more moe money. One school, it would be neutral.
And one school would be an absolute disaster. We’re talking about the
smallest school district, I believe, or second smallest school district
in the state. We are talking about the smallest and poorest county in
the state, losing about  $1.5 million over the next couple of years.
Now, to me, that is unconscionable. I spoke with the superintendent and
it was a very emotional conversation. He seemed to be on the verge of
tears because, as he put it to me, his school district will have to go
into bankruptcy. There’s no way they can survive with these kinds of
cuts. Now, we don’t want to do that. We don’t want to put any school
district into bankruptcy.
There’s something very interesting that happened in my district as a
result of this situation. I also got calls from folks in the other
districts who were going to be benefactors of the bill the way it is
going to be presented in this budget. As rural people often do, they
said, I want to help, how can we help? Can you take the money that we
are getting, the extra money that we’re going to be getting and can you
give it to the county that is in need, which happens to be Tyrrell
country. That’s something about rural people that I haven’t always been
in rural areas, but I can tell you there’s something amazing that takes
place there whenever people are down and out, even people that hate your
guts, they will come up and they will help you and help you get over the
hump. After they help you get over the hump, they’ll go back to hating
you again, but when the crisis is there, everybody pulls together. This
is...we cannot allow a public school system to fail. This isn’t about
politics. This is about kids. This is about parents. This is about
families. There is something radically wrong with a budget that would do
this to any school system. This isn’t just Tyrrell that’s going to be
impacted. There are counties in other districts that are going to be
impacted as well. Some folks, the appropriations folks from education, I
believe are going to rise and talk about what may be a solution that
will address this problem, if not to the long term, at least in the
short term. We rural legislators know, Republicans and Democrats alike,
that it is more important now than ever...</p>

that we stand up for rural North Carolina.  We have no choice.  If the
urban legislators chose to band together Republicans and Democrats,
there's nothing we can do to stop them.  Fortunately, there are urban
legislators who recognize that they cannot abandon their rural brothers
and sisters.  So, I urge you, I beg you, on behalf of the good people of
Tyrrell county and on behalf of rural North Carolina, to embrace this
amendment, do so enthusiastically, know you're doing the right thing,
and then during the short session, we can come back and make a long term
fix for small schools.  This we must do.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Horn, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker, the co-chairs of the House
Education Subcommittee on appropriations do support this amendment.
This is a tough, tough issue.  We've known for a long time that the
small school formula allotment system was screwy at best.  It was a
mess, and it continues to be changed, so we did reach back on the shelf,
find a study that was done, I think in 2010, that made some suggestions
on how we can begin to simplify the allotments system.  The problem with
any change is it's painful.  We all talk about change, but it's painful.
 So we tried to come up with, well no we didn't try to come up with an
imperfect system, we came up with an imperfect system.  But we know
we've got to move in this direction.  We have overcomplicated way too
much of what we do in this state, especially when it comes to how we
give out money.  Stand on your left foot, turn around 3 times and put
your finger in the air, it's ridiculous.  So, we are pleased that the
small counties are able to work together and come up with a reasonable,
sensible solution that doesn't impact our budget numbers so that we can
continue forward.  I think that it was a great idea, people come
together, solve problems.  I'd like to see a whole lot more of that
around this place.  So we urge you to support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Brandon, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I would like to be recorded as voting no on the last
amendment please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman will be recorded as having voted no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Whitmire,  please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker, sorry for the delay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Does the gentleman wish to debate the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes, sir, I'd like to speak on the.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I want to encourage people to vote for the Tyne
amendment on this, and I also want to let you know that there will be a
subsequent amendment that essentially improves upon these numbers.
Here's the issue, while anytime you deal with money and you keep the pot
pretty much the same, there's winners and there's losers.  What's in the
current budget right now, which when we had Education Subcommittee
appropriations, you need a unanimous vote, minus one small, little maybe
no, we were able to mitigate the drastic effects of the winners, some of
which were winning over $300,000 of a boondoggle gain, and some over the
course of 2 years were going to lose close to $1 million, like Tyrrell
County.  Well, it got changed, and it was very honorable as to how it
was changed, but we went right back to having drastic winners and
drastic losers.  And with that, Representative Tyne's amendment,
mitigates that drastic impact, and whether my amendment in a few minutes
passes or fails, Representative Tyne's amendment improves upon and
basically dampens some of the shock effect that school systems and
counties need a little bit of time not just to prepare for, but not have
a drastic swing.  So with that, I encourage</p>

To support the amendment and also give me your ear when mine comes up.
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The question before the House is the
passage of the amendment set forth by Representative Tine to the House
subcommittee substitute to Senate bill 402. All in favor vote aye. All
opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will now
machine record the vote. 104 having voted in the affirmative, four in
the negative, the amendment passes. Representative Tine, the chair
understands that your amendment we need to assess the effect of the Tine
Amendment on the, on your amendment. There may need be to be some
modifications in order for your amendment to be in order. So we’re going
to move past your amendment for a moment. We will come back to it if I
can be assured. I just heard from one of the members that that may be
the case. Therefore Representative Peirce you’re amendment of ALA-68
will be the next that we consider. And after that Representative
Blackwell after the consideration of the Pierce amendment your amendment
ALL-66 will be next in consideration. Representative Pierce is
recognized to send forth ALL-68. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Amendment ALL-68 Representative Pierce moves to amend the bill on page
222 line 15 by inserting immediately after that line a new bill section
to read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Speaker and members of the body. This would move to keep Robinson
community, correction Senator, open and, if you look on that page there
was some budget reserves 11.9 that was non-recurring funds. And that
center in Carolina is a very important part of our community. I hear
Senator Blackwell as he talked about his facility. But when we look at
this facility it plays a great part in the Robinson County area. We want
to do all that we can. But that’s the job that would help us to keep
this facility open. At least give us another year I think is what
everybody’s talking about. We hear a lot of that to date a transition
period. And I would ask that you would consider as the body consider
that. It has a great financial impact in Robinson County, the employees
there. And one thing about it Mr. Speaker and to all those here. This
facility provides opportunity for selected inmates for employment in the
community which enables payments of restoration, [SOUND] child support,
state and federal taxes, federal tax breaks for employers that hire.
Those with unfavorable backgrounds, I like that word better than felons,
and unfavorable backgrounds. And the inmates pay per diem into the
transportation department and to the public safety fund. So this, this
facility gives these gentlemen an opportunity to work in the community
that work for the community for a lot of municipalities. So they, they
don’t sit around all day long. They’re out doin’ things in the community
and doing a great job. If we did find the funds with staffs help so we
ask you give us the opportunity to at least transition for another year.
I commend this resolution to you. Thank you Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Dollar please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Speaker I have two purposes. The first would be, to be
recorded as voting aye on the Tine Amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman may be recorded as aye on the Tine amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. And to speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you Mr. Speaker. I, I just want to make an overall comment. And cuz I
know there may be additional amendments of this nature coming forward in
varying phases. I think everyone appreciates the challenges that a lot
of communities are having out there. The state itself is having
challenges. And what we have is we have a number of facilities that have
relatively low capacity compared to the newer facilities that we have.
They are not efficient. In many cases in, in, well in some cases anyway.
In some case those facilities are in poor condition or they are
functionally obsolete. They may not be, they may be clean and meet
standards but their functionally obsolete and need to be replaced. In
other cases they’re just, they’re just flat small. In some cases
they’re, they’ve got other troubles. You know the whole reason or for
doing the Justice Reinvestment Act was, and I also want to remind this
too and maybe this sound a little bit like a shot but if it does, that’s
okay. You know there were a num</p>

Folks in this Chamber, three of four years ago that voted to change the
citizen grid, although a number of us had opposed that, they voted to do
that. The effect of that was to frankly lower the number of cells that
you were going to need in the future. Well, it's worked out that way.
That and other factors in society - these cells are simply not needed.
And the department has made professional judgments about this. And as
Representative Daughtry said, it's affected a unit in his county. So, we
need to hold firm. We need to reflect on our past votes in this chamber.
We need to realize that these cells are not needed.  And i would request
that you vote no on the amendment. [Speaker changes]
Representative Blust, please state your purpose [Speaker changes]

Representative Charles Graham, please state your purpose [Speaker

Thank you Mr. Speaker, to speak on the amendment [Speaker changes]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment [Speaker changes]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen. I won't be redundant and be
repetitive here, but I do need to advocate for something that I strongly
believe in in my District. I got a sense of where this is going, but I
still need to say what I need to say. This county is a Tier 1 county. We
have a facility that's served this community for many years. We have a
prison population there, minimum security. Those gentlemen have worked
in this county, work release. They've served in a number of capacities
with our municipalities, with the county government. We have gentlemen
who are on work release, and who are going to - as a result of some of
the things going on in our county and the work opportunities they have -
leave that facility and go into some type of meaningful employment,
hopefully turn their lives around, get back into the community. I just
don't know and don't understand what this came about. If the people who
made this decision understood the economic impact that closing this
facility would have in this area of North Carolina.
Now, I think it's great that we're - we don't need beds. And I think
it's good that justice reinvestment is working and doing what it needs
to be doing, but this amendment basically allows the workers to have an
opportunity to transition into meaningful employment somewhere else,
although it's going to be an inconvenience for them to probably travel
30-40 minutes or 30-40 miles down the road to another job. Thank God
they can do that. But this amendment basically says, let's study this
and let's come back at some time in the future and let's look at the
impact that it's having on the economy in Robinson County. It is a Tier
1  county. This unit's serving its purpose. And i think this is just a
rushed judgment. I don't know that this facility has been on the
chopping blocks in the past, but if this is just an attempt here to say
&quot;let's do this, and let's save some money and shift the funding
somewhere else&quot;, I think  that's wrong. The reason I say that is
Robinson County taxpayers will need to pick up the cost of what is the
difference in terms of the savings that this county has been able to see
with these  individuals out in the community working - working for the
government, working for the multi-purpose center, working for the
municipalities. That's a tax savings to our county. It's meaningful. It
means something. We're talking well over a million dollars that the
taxpayers in this county's going to need to pick up in the future. And
by the way...</p>

The county governments have already stamped their budget for this coming
year. The municipalities have already established their budget for this
year. They did not figure that they're going to need to appropriate
funding for these inmates that's working in those municipalities. Those
inmates who are working in the county. This is a tax increase on Robeson
County. It's a savings to our county government by using putting those
inmates to work doing jobs that's going to build job skills in the
future and now we've got to turn around and go back and say to the
county oh by the way this is what you've got to do now. You're going to
need to come up with over a million dollars in revenue to offset the
loss of these who's going to be God knows where they're going. And this
amendment will allow the county to put a plan in place, moving forward
into the future to accept what's going to happen. And I think it's a
fair amendment. I don't think it's asking for anything unreasonable. We
can still balance the budget. Everything will end up fine I think. I
don't see there's a undue burden placed on the JPS budget at this point.
And this amendment's fair. It's reasonable and I ask you and there are
many of you in rural counties and I just heard the situation with the
youth center. But this is not a high rise. This property is not
outdated. It's serving it's function. It's useful, it's meaningful for a
lot of ways and ladies and gentlemen I ask you to support this
amendment. Thank you. Thank you Mrs. Speaker.

Representative Waddell please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen I'm the lucky recipient of representing three
counties that are  Tier One counties. It's a shame when we sit in this
chamber and we don't understand how rural counties work. I just listened
to Representative Blackwell and Representative Hager talk awhile ago
about rural counties and the economic engine that drives rural counties
and when you start thinking about a prison being an important part of an
important piece of a rural county as an economic driver and that pulled
out from under you it makes you wonder. I did like the idea that
Representative Blackwell had to allow to put in place to put in code
these votes to have a transition time to know something about what's
going on. We often sit up here and make decisions about things on the
spur of the moment not really realizing while we're in this chamber that
it's gonna affect a lot of people and it does affect a lot of people. I
have three prisons. One in Bladen County, one in Columbus County, one in
Robeson County and they support a lot of folks just like Representative
Graham mentioned a while ago. The two towns that have access to those
prisoners to be able to use some of those prisoners to defray some of
the cost inside of that town. I was the mayor of a small town and we
have used prisoners before. It's a really good way to be able to utilize
an asset when you only have to pay a dollar a day for those labors.
Folks I cannot say enough. I know probably the amendment's not gonna
pass but I do want us to understand this. Understand this. That rural
counties need help and folks, we need to understand how rural counties
operate. I still encourage your adoption of this amendment.

...having problems that only with our side but the minority side, as
well. So I hope that makes it clear to you that what we have done in
Justice and Public Safety is not done except by way of good public
policy, which is following what the directors of prison told us to do
and they want to close these prisons. We don't need the beds. The crime
rate in North Carolina is down and I thank the Lord for that. And right
now we do not need the beds. Why would we want to keep a facility open
and spend all the taxpayers money when we do not need it? I feel the
pain of those people who have a institution in their county that's going
to be closed, but it was not done in spite, it was done in a very
careful and deliberate way to close those prisons that we thought were

this State over the years. This amendment's not about keeping that
facility open indefinitely. This amendment's about giving this county,
this county government, those municipalities an opportunity, an
opportunity to keep what we have in play until we can come back and I
think the amendment says some time in May 2014. And let's look at this
situation and ?? this situation.

can look forward to doing this some day. You have to make hard
decisions. Robertson Correctional Center is within the radius of 50
miles to 7 other correctional institutions. Of those, there are around
2,400 positions. Of those, there's like 69 positions that are open right
now and we have asked that anyone who is let go, loses their job for
anything that we might do that they get first choice. And so 69 from 80,
there may be some who are retiring or whatever. But it is very important

community members have been working on this ?? you may have seen some of
them in the halls, this legislature work on this and we are requesting a

combination of an increase and the drop out age of 16 to 18 and some
additional programs educational funding from various sources including
private sector and a general attention from the community can in fact
make a difference in drop out this is not a school only program this is

Representative Turner's amendment next. After that, Representative
Mobley, your amendment ALA or ALL 62 will be taken up. Representative
Turner's recognized to send forth ALG 35. The Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ? amendment ALG dash 35 Representative Turner moves to

following the new section to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister Speaker. Members, this is a very
important amendment and I appreciate your support. We're taking a very
small slice of the budget and putting it in with the arts council
allowing them to continue their efforts in supporting economic
development across the state and preserving our arts in the museum of
history and other areas that they're responsible for. I appreciate your
support and thank you so much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Cleveland, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mister Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, I
would hope you would vote against this amendment. We've had to increase
funding to the department of revenue to give them a couple of positions
so that they could start working on the back logs that they have over
there and taking one hundred and eighty thousand dollars from them at
this point to support the arts council is a...I do not believe is a wise
move. I've done everything I can to alleviate the reductions that were
in the arts counsel and I would hope you would support the committee's
position that was voted out and vote against this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Saine, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister Speaker and thank you Representative
Turner. I certainly feel the pain as all of us do but I do understand
the value of our local arts councils and while the amendment is not
restore the funding they do need, it does help in some small way and we
cannot discount the economic engines that arts councils serve in our
communities. You may not think of that when you think of arts councils
but it adds a lot of cultural diversity, a lot of cultural education in
our communities and I do urge that you support the amendment. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Carney, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
House if you look at the budget for the cultural resources, we've taken
a big hit, a big cut there. A part of when we fund cultural resources we
are also sourcing our grants program and these are the Grass Roots
grants. Every county, every county in this state gets a cut of those
Grass Roots grants. We have funded tremendous amounts of money to our
symphony, which is an amazing entity for our state. We have funded our
art museum, which is a big asset to this state but we sort of taken a
chunk away from cultural resources. A small amount of money that will
leverage a large amount of dollars going forward across this state. I
urge your support on this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Adams, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mister Speaker. Just to speak briefly on
the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Lady is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would hope that you would support the amendment. As
it's been said, the arts are an economic boost for our communities. For
every community, every city, every town. Every county in North Carolina
benefits  and you've got to think about while this...these funds are
requested for the administration, it takes the people to administer the
programs and as it's been said they've been cut extensively and they're
going to need that assistance and support. So I would ask for your
support for the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Torbett, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister Speaker.  If those of y’all were here
last year you may remember we addressed this also last year with both
the arts councils and the historic places and Representative Cleveland
in his wisdom, he works hard. I was in his committee last year as some
of the rest of us were, and he works hard and does a fantastic job and
sometimes you come down to the end of the road and that's all you can
do. All we're asking is just for a minor shift. I trust you would
support it because this isn't something that goes to some studio in some
big uptown something you'll never hear from. This is what goes to our
guys in the communities. In Gaston County in went to support a facility
there in Gastonia...</p>

That's helped revitalize the downtown area. I trust that each of y'all
would support it. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask a question of one of
the subcommittee chairs, I guess Representative Cleveland. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Cleveland, does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Cleveland, in my chiodhood I was a government
funded artist. I thought it was great. But revenue, I would hope that
every dollar that we give to revenue would return a lot of money to us
because that's the only purpose of having a department of revenue. Has
anybody cost, gotten a fiscal memorandum or anything on this amendment
to tell us how much less revenue we would bring in, if we didn't
appropriate that money to the department of revenue? Because it's
revenue. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm not aware of any fiscal note on the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative John Bell, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask Representative Cleveland a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Cleveland, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Cleveland, it is to my knowledge in
this subcommittee, we did everything we could to fund a grassroots part
of the arts council that was a major emphasis and then once that was
funded, the approach was, was to for the administration and this
amendment would just solely address the administration needs, not the
grassroots needs that provides the program. Is that correct? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] That's true. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Horn, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak
briefly on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I couldn't pass up a chance to quote Winston
Churchill. And amazingly, you may be a little amazed about this. Now I'm
not, nor was Winston Churchill particularly soft-hearted guy. Well maybe
I am and probably he was too, but during the height of World War II,
Churchill appropriated money for the arts, and he said what the heck are
you doing? We're fighting on every front. And he said that's what we're
fighting for. I urge you to support the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cleveland, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized
to debate the amendment a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, this amendment does not go to the
grassroots arts, period. It does not. The money does not go there. When
this budget came to my committee, there was somewhere around a million
dollar or a little over cut in the grassroots art program. I managed to
get that reduction down to about 280 thousand dollars in that area, for
both years. I had other areas that I had a look at. I kept the reduction
to the grassroots art program to the minimum that I could, with the
money we had to work with. This reduction, or this increase, is in the
administration. I gave the department of cultural resources the ability
to spread half of their reduction in the administration across their
entire department. I did not feel that this is necessary to give them
money back in the administration of the program. They have the ability
to negate any problems in the program at this point, and I would hope
you would oppose this amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Baumgartner, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on
the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate
the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, thank you Mr. Speaker.
Churchill did spend money on art during the war, and as soon as the war
was over, he was voted out of office. [LAUGHTER]  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Horn, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd
like to ask the gentleman for a question about. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Baumgartner, does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Could you please tell me what election he
lost in that he was voted out of office? Because theirs is a
parliamentary system and the prime minister is actually head of the
party. He didn't lose any election. He was re-elected. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

I’m just not quite sure if that was a question or not Representative
Bumgardner. I think it may have been one of the first rhetorical
questions asked since I’ve been Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Maybe I should say, “He wasn’t voted out, he was tossed under the bus
and summarily dismissed.”
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, point of Parliamentary inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative William Brawley may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could we please run from this issue as quickly as we can?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Chair takes the point very well. Representative Stam please state
your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak a second time on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For lack of a fiscal memorandum on its effect, I asked the guy who would
write the fiscal memorandum. Representative Cleveland is correct, if you
pass this amendment what won’t happen is dealing with backlog of about
200 in personal income disputed audits that have been open an average of
228 days. In other words, a core government function is not going to
happen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Torbett, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak a second time on the amendment, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, I used to work a little bit in the summertime when
I was a little bitty, if I ever was a little bitty up at my
grandparents’ farm and we used to clean out stalls. And in reference to
Representative Stam’s statement, I could have never piled it that high.
But what we’re attempting to do very simply is, the question was put
whether you get return on investment. I would wager, if we can do that
on the floor of the House a box of Krispy Kreme doughnuts with
Representative Stam…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
…that return on investment would be higher…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cleveland, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think we should stay on the amendment. We’re getting carried away with
various and sundry other things.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman will keep his point on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Vote green.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brody, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I want everybody to consider this. Representative Stam did give you
statistics and it showed that these cases have been there for a long
time. Now adding one auditor is not going to solve the problem. There’s
a problem in the Department of Revenue if these cases go on for that
long, so I don’t think they’re going to miss one auditor. I think they
need to spend time on the amendment…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, we’re still on the bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman will suspend.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has suspended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Pages, it is just past five o’clock, which signifies the end of your
work day. If for some strange reason you’d like to stick around, you’d
be more than welcome to. But otherwise you’re dismissed for the
remainder of the day. Thank you for your work today. Representative
Dollar, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. The House will come
to order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I appreciate what the author of the amendment is attempting to do. OK?
We appreciate that. However, I would turn your attention to the actual
words of the amendment itself. What does the amendment do?
And if you will look on line nine of the amendment it says, “Each year
of the fiscal biennium to restore funding for administration of the
North Carolina Arts Council.” Well, a logical question is, “How much
funding do they have in the budget at this point in time?” It is $1
million. It is $1 million to administer…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A million three.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A million three, to administer a little over $6 million in grants.
You’ve got around 26 people to administer $6 million in grants and you
ought to think about that.
This money is purely administrative money. If you restore it, it simply
means there are one or two more people working at the Arts Council. It
doesn’t mean that one nickel more goes to anybody’s festival or art show
or anything else anywhere in this state.
This is purely a matter of how many people does it take to administer $6
million worth of grants. The subcommittee determined that 26 was more
than enough. I ask you to vote, “No,” on the amendment.</p>

Ladies and gentlemen of the house, we have done a remarkable job of
going through the amendments today. We have... the chair's in possession
of four amendments. There's a fifth one pending the status of the fiscal
note for the Turner amendment. The chair would propose... we're moving
pretty quickly, the chair expects we may be able to get out of here
before seven or seven thirty. If that is the case, the chair has polled
several people who think if we get out that early, they'd prefer just to
come back in the morning rather than at midnight. So unless I can be
convinced otherwise, that will be the decision of the chair. What I
though we would do is perhaps provide everyone with a five or ten minute
break before we dispose of the last four amendments then move  to the
debate on the bill. We will be in recess until 5:25.
