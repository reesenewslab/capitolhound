[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not the
question before the House is the motion to concur in the Senate
Committee Substitute for House Bill 209. All in favor vote aye, all
opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote. All members please record
Representative Hardister. The clerk will out machine record the vote.
One hundred and three having voted affirmative, none in the negative,
the House has concurred in the Senate Committee Substitute for House
Bill 209, the bill being rolled and sent to the Governor.
Representative Hanes, does the gentleman wish to record?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Mr. Speaker. Record, yes, please. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman record vote is on. House Bill 626 the clerk
will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Committee Substitute for House Bill 626 a bill
to be entitled an act to promptly notify local law enforcement agencies
of certain information about vehicles that have been towed at the
direction of a person other than the owner or operator of the vehicle.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moffitt, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for a motion and to debate
the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I move that the House do concur with House
Bill 626 as it has returned to us from the Senate. All the changes that
occurred on the Senate side were actually directed by the House, and I
know that’s kind of a rare occurrence. But the House was fully involved
with this bill from the beginning to the end. And essentially what we
did, if you remember this bill wasn’t perfect when it left the House,
but we needed to get it over to the Senate before crossover deadline.
And we had a stakeholder’s meeting with the tow operators, DOT, DMV, law
enforcement, as well as the National Emergency Number Association. We
have a consensus bill, and essentially what it does is in a non-law
enforcement directed tow, or a non-posted tow, the tow operator must
contact the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction for the
area. Notify them of a description of the vehicle, the place from which
the vehicle was towed, the place where the vehicle will be stored, and
the contact information for the person from whom the vehicle owner may
retrieve the vehicle.
They’ll make that information known to the local law enforcement
agencies, so when the owner shows up and discovers their car is missing,
they typically call 9-1-1, That 9-1-1 operator will give them the local
number that they need to call, and they’ll have that information
available to you, to them. So I’d appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the bill sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moffitt, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moffitt, let me first say I appreciate
all of your work on this, and I apologize for not being able to catch
you before this session and ask you a quick question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And that is, if you were towing from a… If the tower’s
towing from a… A vehicle’s been sitting on a private lot, will they need
to wait? Will they need to contact law enforcement and wait for law
enforcement to get back in touch with them, or is the requirement thus
they can go ahead and tow the vehicle, but they have to call in the
information?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In a private lot towing, if the private lot is posted
or not posted? If the private lot is posted, they don’t need to make any
call whatsoever. If it is a private lot that is unposted, then they’ll
need to notify law enforcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a quick follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does that follow up have to happen before they move
the vehicle, or that can be as process of moving the vehicle or as soon
as they move the vehicle, get that information into the appropriate law
enforcement?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We provided for about a 30 minute leeway there, for
them to notify law enforcement that they are making the tow.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not the
question before the House is the motion to concur in the Senate
Committee Substitute for House Bill 626. All in favor vote aye, all
opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will out
machine record the vote. One hundred and four having voted in the
affirmative, none in the negative, the House has concurred in the Senate

to the Governor. House Bill 628, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Committee Substitute for House Bill 628 a bill
to be entitled an act to require net savings in association with major
facilities construction and renovation projects, and protect use of
North Carolina products in major facilities’ construction and
renovations ?? under a sustainable energy efficient buildings program.

Roger West does, and just ask you to vote green. But when it got over to
the Senate, they did put two amendments on it. The first one is to
require state construction projects using an energy efficient or green
building design, that it meet a net savings requirement in the first ten
years of the life of the project. The second amendment was to require
projects to not disadvantage all local North Carolina products including
wood and steel and concrete. Is this exactly what I wanted? No, but it's
a good step. It starts the process. All interested parties, NewCore with
steel, concrete, timber, even the architects have no opposition, and I
ask you to support this bill in concurrence. Thank you.

Thank you very much Mr. Speaker. I just wanted to let the members know

The lady is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wanted to thank the sponsor of the bill and the other groups that got
together to work on it. I did have trouble with this bill when it went
through the first time and I'm happy to support it this time. I think
they did a great job of trying to find a way to make everybody as happy
as possible. Thanks. I urge your support.

having voted in the affirmative, none in the negative. The House has
concurred on the Senate Committee Substitute to House Bill 628. The bill
will be enrolled and sent to the Governor. House Bill 785. The clerk
will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Committee Substitute for House Bill 785, the bill ?? &quot;An act
to create a statewide pilot program to enable cost-sharing for
transportation improvements and to authorize the department of
transportation to create a statewide pilot program for contracted
services cost-savings.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Iler, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a motion and to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for a motion and to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. The bill left here as a simple transportation
improvements bill, cost-sharing bill, but it was to allow the DOT to
enter into contracts on major projects involving multiple driveways,
multiple turn lanes and signals, and that sort of thing with major
developments and multiple developers, so they would enter into contracts
so that the cost would be shared among the developers, not just the
first developer in would have to bear the entire cost. The Senate
Transportation Committee, Senator Gunn, on the Senate Transportation
Committee, added Section 2, which is a good idea from another bill
somewhere, that will allow DOT to save up to 10% of their costs in
different areas of DOT, up to 10%. And it's what they call the finders
keepers. They use that money and not just automatically, if they save
money for the state, not just automatically have to give it up. So, it's
a very good addition. I had no problems with it, and I hope you all will
not have any problems with it. It just adds to the bill, it counts as
two different things the cost-sharing with developers as well as the 10%
savings in DOT. I urge your support of the, I urge your concurrence. And
I did mean to make a motion to concur also.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

what a simple word can do in changing policy and when we say that simple
word to stop and think, is that the policy that we won't to take all or

working on for almost a year now there is an instance back in 2010 that
made us start looking at this and i will just read you some of the root
cause analysis done about a death that happened because of the
underground utility process we had. It says it was termed that through
causes this accident, was a failure of the company to employ the
properly and locate the underground lines that we have an individual
that put his backhoe attachment into a 7200 volt line because our
process on underground utilities was a bad process. So we took up about
this time last year, we put together an industry group that looked and
documented the process and i gave them several charges. One charge was
were going to have a training process that will be documented, we would
have the equipment testing and calibration test that would be
documented, We would have a common marking system in North Carolina, and
everybody that did this kind of work whether utility or excavator, would
be included in the a11 system. We would have root cause analysis
process, and we would have an enforcement piece, that is what you have

utilities, whether it’s a cable utility, fiber optic, however utility,
gas utility, surveyors, farmers, landscapers, municipalities, counties,

a bill that will protect our workers whether you’re a worker for Duke

worker for REMC or whether you’re a surveyor. It will protect them from
the possibility of getting into a line that they don’t know is there.

Representative Brody, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I ask the bill sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager, a few years back when I was pretty much building
pretty stead and we had a call in some of these locates, the general
rule was that they would guarantee that that line was somewhere within a
foot and a half of either side of the marking itself. Have they kind of
narrowed that down a little more?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brody, we’ve done a couple of thing. One is we require a
common marking system which will help your situation and I’ll explain
that in a minute. That was not prevalent in North Carolina. You could be
in one part of the  state and they would have a marking system for power
or water or sewer and you could be in another utility, for instance in
Dominion Power, and they would mark a different way. In doing that and
able to do a calibration of the equipment, we’re able to go to a 24 inch
area that you cannot dig in now and be more certain now with this bill
than we ever have been before. So we actually went down from 3 feet to
24 inches.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, this bill is not very long in length. You can read
it very quickly, but the impact that this bill will have if passed to
the economy of north eastern North Carolina and in fact to the state of
North Carolina will be immense. Basically what this bill does is to
provide a platform for us to utilize the largest port on the east coast.
The port of Norfolk. Our finger counties are uniquely positioned to be
part of this foreign trade zone to be able to utilize this port which is
currently getting many requests for more traffic, but they just don’t
have the warehousing facilities, they don’t have the assembly
facilities, so they would like to reach into North Carolina and use
these finger counties, which would be great for them and for all of us.
This bill passed unanimously through commerce and job development and
also the other day through finance. I know of no objections to this bill
in either the House or the Senate so I would ask you to please, let’s
support this unanimously if we can. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is a distinct pleasure for me to introduce to
the body a concept called “crowdfunding.” It’s a way to take the power
of our small businesses and take the power of the Internet to help these
small businesses grow, and expand, and capitalize in our state.
Startup companies and small businesses play a critical role in creating
jobs in our state and the NC Jobs Act that we’re debating today will
enable a new way of financing these startup businesses with a new Invest
NC Exemption to the Securities Law.
This bill has been worked out with the North Carolina Bar Association’s
Securities Division as well as the Securities Division at the North
Carolina Secretary of State. We’ve been working on this for several
months.
What this enables is intrastate offerings by in-state businesses to
raise money from in-state individuals in $2,000 increments in offerings
not to exceed $1 million. In certain instances a business that wants to
raise $2 million if they subject themselves to audits can raise money in
that capacity as well. This is a game-changer for our small businesses
in this state.
This models Federal legislation that was sponsored by Congressman
McHenry and signed by President Obama around a year ago and the
Securities and Exchange Division has been implementing regulations over
that past year.
The proponents of this legislation would like to see states move faster
than the Securities and Exchange Division at the Federal level. This
exemption actually expires in 2017. By then the Federal regulations will
be in place and this will be a reality across the country.
But Kansas has already passed a similar legislation, Georgia has already
passed similar legislation and I want North Carolina to be the third
state to enable our small businesses to grow, expand and be able to
raise capital in this capacity. I’ll be glad to answer any questions.
I just sent all the members a Letter of Support of this legislation from
the North Carolina Technology Association because they see that if we
have a robust startup community in our state it will produce jobs, it
will produce innovation, and it will produce economic benefits for our
state for many years to come. We need to get on the front-end of this
and I would appreciate your support and be glad to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brody, please state your purpose.

<p id="050:00">
Guys, there is opportunity out in the construction industry but it's
very small, and the reason why is because it's a lack of funds. Two
reasons why were having problems, one is, there are lenders that do have
money, but they're still reluctant to lend the real estate for the
obvious reasons. The second is that there are lenders out there, in
particular banks, that are willing to lend money, but federal regulation
says that they may have too much real estate on their portfolios as it
is. So even if it's a good deal for them, they're not allowed to do it.
So I do urge you to support this amendment; it's very good for
construction industry, and of the people in construction that I've
spoken to,they're all in favor of it. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Robert Brawley, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is

Gentleman, I'd like to speak in favor of the bill for two reasons. One,
we do need a more creative way to raise funds and work together in North
Carolina. This gives a way to do it legally, and I know there is some
being done, now, illegally, so this gives them a chance to be legal. So
I urge your support for the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion,

everybody just to please support it, Senate Bill 168. This is the work
that reflects quite a few members of this chamber in some bills that we
passed unanimously. The Representatives Langdon, Johnson, Glazier,
Martin, and myself worked with multiple superintendents and educators
from around the state to do some ed. reform and regulatory reform, to
ultimately get rid of some obsolete or archaic reporting, and with many
of the new tools that we have at the state level, to basically enable
our educators at the local level to be more effective and efficient, and
to spend their time more effectively in the classroom. And with that,
Mr. Speaker, I will also mention that I'll be glad to yield to
Representative Murry who has some additional input. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Murry, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To

recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Speaker. I've been working on teacher paperwork reduction since I was in
my freshman year, and my mom's a schoolteacher, and this amendment comes
from the fruit of some of that labor that wasn't able to get included in
this bill. It moved faster than I could catch up to it. I worked this
out with Senator Tucker who's the primary sponsor of the Senate bill.
And in this amendment, we have a requirement that we have a strategy for
improving student performance. So this includes a number 8, and that
strategy too include a plan to identify and eliminate unnecessary and
redundant reporting requirements for teachers, and to streamline the
school's reporting system. Additionally, each school has a school
improvement team, and the school improvement team, it adds language that

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bell, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bell, ask you if you know why the
fiscal, I looked at the fiscal memo on this and it indicates that the
staff is unable to determine any impact on the counties. Do you know why
we would be doing this? I mean in other words, has there been any
negative impact that industry has reported to you about our having this
in place? And I ask you that because it seems to me that we are
extending here another tax loophole. We're taking this out of the tax
base. So I just wondered why would we be doing that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If it's OK with the member, I'd like to yield to
someone that's a little more on the expertise on the financial side of
this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That would be fine with me.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Luebke, we looked at this for a long, long time
before we made a decision and I believe you'll find on your desk a map.
And if you look at that map you're going to...yes, sir. That's it.
You're going to find that we are the only State in the nation in the way
that we do. There's about five counties now that are imposing the tax
and in the bill you will also see that the effective date has been moved
out to July 2014, which compensates for any budget issues that have been
brought to our attention. And the County Commissioners Association has
agreed to this provision.</p>

Thank you.
I appreciate the- It's kind of a low-tech copy and so it's actually not
possible to see what's what on here, but I appreciate the effort to give
us a handout.
Members, I remember this issue that's come up again and again in finance
over the years, and we're just chipping away at the tax base here on ???
computer software. We've done it time and time again, and it's hard to
find a reason, I don't know of any business I've heard of in Durham
county that has said we're not going to stay in Durham county because
we're having to pay tax on this, so it's just hard for me to see why we
should keep doing this. We all pledged, I thought we all pledged to stop
extending loopholes. Rep. Howard, you and I know that actually I
appreciate your point that we're the only state that does it, we also
know that some of us are proud that we're the only state not to have the
lottery, and voters continue to oppose it. So that's not persuasive to
me. I can't support this, and also Rep. Bell, I just would like to check
with Durham county, because I'm sure we're affected in some way because
we're such a high tech county. So I'm just going to object to third and
it won't matter much, but I'd like to find out from the county. Thank
you.

Rep. Robert Brawley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd encourage you to support this bill. What we're doing is clearing up
the interpretation of what kind of software can be taxed. And all the
counties of North Carolina I believe, at least I haven't heard
different, tax commercial software which can be bought and sold
anywhere. What this bill applies to in 5 counties, and Iredell county
happens to be one of them, is collecting a tax from the corporations on
self-customized software. I've got a large corporation in the county,
they have customized software for their particular kind of business on
top of the commercial software they bought just to have a program. Then
they customized so that it would accommodate their kind of business, and
it's worth millions of dollars, and they're being taxed on it. It has no
market value, nobody else is gonna want to use it, they won't sell it,
but yet they're being charged a tax on it. It affects 5 counties, and
this just clears, the way I look at it, this just clears up the

would be property taxed. This is custom software that has no market
value, and we're taxing it in some cases. I urge you to support the

Thank you Mr. Speaker.
You know, each one of you that we've been getting a lot of data centers
in North Carolina. I do, I have Facebook, I have state backup data
center, I know a lot of you folks have some in your counties. This would
directly have a positive effect on those folks. They get a piece of
software, they have to customize it to what they do, nobody else can use
it for what they do, and then they get taxed because they made it easier
to do to work with what they do. This is akin to any of us buying a new
car or new truck, then going out there and painting our initials on the
side, and all of a sudden it gets taxed more. That's about what we're
talking about. So please support the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I was sitting here thoroughly enjoying the debate and
realizing having written custom software for a number of years, that it
made more sense to me than it probably made to a lot of people, so I
want to take a quick analogy if I can. Let's assume for a moment that
this body were a business.  They brought us a computer, that's property
tax, it would be taxed. They brought us Excel, and Word, and a lot of
things from Microsoft, and that's property and it would be taxed. And
then they hired somebody to do the dashboard, so that we can see our
bills. It's not a product for resale, it's unique, it's something that
we do for what we do here. That's paid labor. So it's taxed as income to
the other people, but in 5 counties in North Carolina are the only
places in America where they say you have to pay property tax on that
application that you wrote to help your computer do something a little
different. That's what we're talking about. It's not really a product,
it's not really property, it's just the intellectually fruits of
somebody customizing it to allow us to do something specific. The only
thing we would be exempting on our setup here would be the dashboard
software. Everything else would still be taxed. I support the bill.</p>

Further discussion, further debate. If not, the question before the
House is the passage of the House Committee substitute to Senate Bill
490 on its second reading. All in favor, vote Aye. All opposed, vote No.
The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will let the machine record the
vote. 95 having voted in the affirmative, 8 in the negative; the House
Committee substitute to Senate Bill 490 has passed its second reading
and will remain on the calendar. Ladies and Gentlemen, we displaced

Representative Adams, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to be recorded No on 243.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady be recorded as having vote No on 243.
Representative Iler, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the 709.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually, Mr. Speaker, I’d like to yield to
Representative Jordan for an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jordan is recognized to send forth an
amendment. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jordan moves to amend the bill on page
1 line 26 by re-writing that line to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I do support Senate Bill 709
but I was having some questions about it because I do a few traffic
tickets up in the mountains. And then I got an email from my friend,
Representative Jackson who spelled out exactly what I needed to help
clarify exactly what the problem was. The problem is, if we move some
speed limits to 75, we have 80 miles per hour in a number of our
statutes, a number of our penalties and it could create some
contradictory situations. For example, under this bill if you got an 81
on a 75 which is 6 miles over, and we’re convicted for that, your
license will be revoked for 30 days, you get 4 insurance point. But
under the same bill, if you were convicted for an 80 on a 70 which is 10
miles over, and we’re convicted, there’s no license revocation; you’d
only get 2 point. So there’s some problems here and my amendment, if the
body agrees to it, is to change everywhere we have 80 mentioned, move it
up 5 as well to 85. So that that would help fix this anomaly. And that’s
what the amendment does. That’s literally all it does. I’ll be glad to
answer questions but really, it’s a policy decision for you about this
anomaly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Iler, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I’ve had about half of my friends that
thought it was a good idea to leave the 80 on and about a half wanted to
extend it to 85 so that it wouldn’t be as many tickets and my attorney
friends are trying to explain that it might be a jobless bill for them.
However, I do see the problem and I do support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Pierce, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To change a vote, I’m sorry
it’s ??. 243, No please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman be recorded as voting No on 243.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Although I remain adamantly opposed to the
bill, I do support the amendment. The amendment in a sense is exactly
why I am opposing the bill. But as a legal matter, it makes perfect
sense and it does fix if this bill is gonna pass, the legal issue and so
I would recommend that the amendment be supported and we’ll speak to the
bill later.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Mobley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Change my vote on 243 to No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady be recorded as having voted No on 243.
Representative Jackson, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the amendment sponsor, a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jordan, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Jordan. I appreciate you
addressed some of the things in my email. However, if I read this
amendment correctly, this would apply no matter what DoT does with
raising some speed limits from 70 to 75. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay and Mr. Speaker, follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And so, if the DoT was to never raise the speed limit
to 75, we would still be changing a policy where currently an 81 on a
70, we take your license but under your amendment that would change.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We've heard a lot of discussion about the improvements
and upgrades in our technology of our automobiles and our roads. There's
one factor however which we unfortunately cannot say that has been
upgraded and improved over the years and that's human beings. We're
still driving with the same kind of reflexes and the same kind of
distractions and the same kinds of not paying attention to what we're
doing and to give you an idea at 75 miles an hour to begin to brake to
get stopped is 302 feet plus. I travel I95 a lot hopefully that is not
going to be a road that they will upgrade the speed on because what I've
seen on that road over the years is horrific. Not just in what happens
when 2 vehicles meet each other but the delays and the interference in
people's lives because of the miles long of the traffic blocks that
happen. 5 miles is not worth the inconvenience and the cost of life. If
we're in that big a hurry people, we have come too far. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Ladies and gentlemen upon motion of Representative
Murry chair's happy to extend the courtesies of the gallery to crowd

[SPEAKER CHANGES]To debate the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My sister is an engineer. We've got 4 engineers in
this body. This bill does not require the DOT to post 75 miles per hour
speed limits on any particular segment on any freeway. This bill simply
allows the engineering professionals at the DOT to consider an increase
after conducting an engineering traffic study on a case by case basis.
If we're trying to take the politics out of road building let's take the
politics out of setting the speed limit and let our engineers determine
whether a road is safe enough to drive 75 miles per hour. My sister
tells me in her engineering studies the safe speed of a road is the
speed at which 75% of drivers drive on that road and if that speed is
unsafe then you change the road conditions to make it visually
unappealing to drive that speed. Our freeways are wide open. They are
safe roads. I think we should let the engineers at DOT do their job and
I'd ask that you support this bill.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker members of the house. Let me
just first say that for those who have talked about the engineering and
those who have talked about getting the politics out of roads and all
that sort of stuff. Let me just say this I would be fine if what this
bill did was to set up a study about how we determine speed limits, how
we determine how we utilize these lanes. For example I was up in
Michigan last year and they have an interesting thing they do on their
interstates. If you are a truck and you're out on the interstate you
stay over in the right hand lane you can only drive on the right hand
lane. And the cars can drive in the left hand lane and you can drive 10
miles an hour faster just on the regular interstates up there. I would
be perfectly fine to say okay let's</p>

have the General Assembly authorize a study of how all the various and
sundry states set their speed limits and set their driving conditions,
and come back to this General Assembly with some sort of package of
recommendations for changes or no changes. That would be fine. But what
we're doing here is we're making one specific change from the 70 to the
75. And I realize that a number of people here have been to the Richard
Petty driving experience, a number of you have turned a lane down at the
Charlotte Motor Speedway and that's wonderful. And you know how to drive
fast, and some of you have cars that drive very fast and you prove it on
Mondays and Thursdays. But what I'm concerned about is a lot of other
individuals out there, and I'll just give you one example: I knew a
young man. Two Aprils ago, we were down at Camp Body, down east, and
there were about 1200 boy scouts there, and this young man had just been
elected to be the chief, to be the head of all these boy scouts, a
statewide organization. And I had the occasion on that Saturday
afternoon to stand under a tree and talk to his dad. And his dad was
very proud of him, his dad talked about his plan for the future, the
young man was a rising senior, planning on going to college, extremely
talented, his parents were very proud of him, he had the world to look
forward to. And then a few short weeks later I pick up the newspaper and
he was killed in an automobile accident involving high speed one
Saturday morning while he was trying to get to work. And I think about
his life and I think about his dad talking to me about all the plans he
had which will not be there. My concern is this: There are people who
can drive, bump it up another 5 miles, we know that it's going up to 85
if we do this. But there are a lot of other people out there, far too
many unfortunately for us, who are not capable of handling those
traditional speeds. And I have great trepidation about us passing this
legislation and I would urge you to vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Starnes, state your purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, when I was at home this past weekend
I went over to my parents' house and my mother rarely comments on
anything that's going on down here in Raleigh. She hasn't asked about
tax reform, the budget, any of these other issues. But she'd heard about
this bill about allowing you to drive 75 on the highways. And she said
&quot;Have you folks completely lost your mind?&quot; Now I think that's
probably a pretty good barometer what the people are thinking out there.
I think a lot of just the regular citizens are thinking &quot;Have you
lost your mind?&quot; The highways are not safe places to be on anyway.
My daughter just got her driver's license this week at the age of 16,
and yet it scares me that we're going to give an inexperienced driver
the opportunity to go 75 miles on any highway. Yes, engineers can design
highways but this bill didn't come at the request of the DOT, because
engineers had done a study and said &quot;Oh, I think we can authorize
certain segments of the highways to be 75,&quot; this bill came as a
result of a politician who wanted to go faster on the highway. Now the
people at the DOT can read the tea leaves, and when the General assembly
passes a bill that says we're going to authorize you to do this, you can
rest assured they will feel authorized to do that. Whether they know
what's going on, they understand the will of the General Assembly. But
folks, you just- I've been on the interstate, I've been 70, I've been
75, people will whiz by you, but that doesn't make it any safer. We can
raise the speed limit 5 miles per hour, but we're talking about the
carnage on the highways going up exponentially. When there's a wreck on
the highways going at these rates of speed, it's disastrous. We're so
concerned about making sure that a motorcycle rider has a helmet on, we
wouldn't take away that right because we're concerned about the public
safety, we're gonna need helmets, body armor, and everything else to go
down the highway at</p>

<p id="085:00">
...75 miles an hour when you have a wreck, because you're not going to
be safe. I was speaking to my seatmate here who's been retired from the
insurance business. He says you can pass this bill and it's going to
affect the automobile insurance rate of every bright driver in the State
of North Carolina because they've got to start factoring in these higher
speeds to your rates. So whether you go that fast or not, your
automobile insurance is going to go up because they're going to have to
recalculate the damages and the risk of driving higher.
I don't think that's what the folks of this State want. I'd ?? my mother
if we pass this, I think we've lost our mind. Vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Warren, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The floor is yours.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't have a personal story to tell, although my
daughter did just get her license and I'm more concerned about not her
going 75 miles an hour but people around her in various conditions of
health unbeknownst to themselves, subject to passing out or losing
control of their car. I'd like her be in the thick of that.
I usually ask myself when I get bills I haven't seen before, what's the
purpose of this bill? Where did it come from? And several people have
touched on some of the aspects that I've looked at considering this.
Representative Avila, that you know, she made the point that you could
just leave five minutes earlier, you'll save as much time or more than
you'd make by trying to go 5 miles an hour faster. I think that after 70
miles an hour you're not really driving a car, you're aiming it.
I don't share my colleague, Representative Murry's confidence in DOT. I
think they do a great job but these are the people that gave us a
roundabout down here in Hillsboro and promptly within 12 months we had
84 accidents. So I don't think they're any more of a brain trust than we
are here in the General Assembly.
I think we've all heard the old adage at eight you skate, at nine you're
mine. It's always attributed to a Highway Patrol attitude towards you
going over the speed limit a little bit, but there's a wink and a nod if
the speed limits 70, you feel pretty safe going 75. If it's 75, do you
feel safe going 83? Would you feel safer if the amendment had passed
because you know you got a little more latitude. It's almost like ad hoc
pardon to go at any rate of speed.
I think there are too many variables on the highway besides your
individual capability to control a car at 75 miles an hour that we have
to consider. Imagine it was 25 years from now and the medicinal
marijuana bill passed and you're out there on a highway of people and
there are different levels of control.
So I just seriously think that there's too many variables to take into
consideration of the other drivers on the highway to raise that speed
limit up 5 miles an hour. Again, going back to what is the purpose of
the bill, what does it accomplish, I see no valid reason for doing this
whatsoever. I encourage you to vote no for the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bumgardner, for what purpose do you
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I urge you to support this bill. We're
giving people the freedom to make decisions for themselves. The DOT has
rooms full of attorneys and engineers to decide whether certain highways
are safe or not. We're not going to make the speed limit 75 on Jones
Street or Lane. It's going to be certain interstate highways that are
engineered for that speed. They're engineered for more than that speed.
And they know it and you can ask them. I know this because I have built
roads and we all know people that have been, had to go through horrible
tragedies and to use that to speak against this bill is a bit of an
emotional play.
This bill is about whether we're going to allow the DOT to make a
decision about the speed on certain sections of highways. Not every road
of the State. Certain interstates. And I think that that's what we
should allow them to do. I urge your support. Thank you.

June or July might have 45 days could you pin down is that 4th of July
in 2013 or 14?
[Speaker Change] The chair would just like to point out that every day
that we are here I think at this point, is a day too long, we are
working very hard and just on a serious note that the two main things
that we are continuing to work on is the discussions with the Senate
regarding tax reform.  We have made progress we are hopeful we will be
able to have a result in the very near future and we will begin
conferencing the budget just so that you all know that because of the
time it is probably worth mentioning we probably will take up a
continuing resolution next week. And the reason for that is to provide
some certainty going into the week because of our obligation to pass the
budget or have a continuing resolution by June. I've conferred with the
Senate and we've agreed that we will take up a continuing resolution
early next week. But the goal really is to try and get the bill or get
the budget conferenced out next week, no later than the following week
and I'm optimistic that we can do that. Representative Floyd, please
state your purpose.
[Speaker Change] Mr. Speaker, inquiry with the chair
[Speaker Change] The gentleman may state his inquiry
[Speaker Change] I'm sitting back here sort of nervous I don't know
whether  you are going to do it or Representative Moore is gonna do it,
For us to give us the calendar for next week cause I'm nervous.
[Speaker Change] The gentleman is well founded in his concern. The, in
all seriousness, next week could be a difficult week, We may need to
have session for the purposes of clearing the calendar because there are
a number of bills going between the two chambers but I would request
that the members please not make any plans we may need to move the
session around so we can accommodate conferencing that we hope will
begin in earnest probably the first part of next week Tuesday. And I
think though it could make for a long week and it could possibly be a
week that involves a Friday session. Representative Michaux, please
state your purpose.
[Speaker Change] Just a point of personal privilege, I think Mr. Speaker
because it involves you, so Somebody
[Speaker Change]  The gentleman is recognized for a point of personal
privilege.
[Speaker Change] It was just said that you were growing your beard until
you thought we were gonna you know it would be short, most folks think
you gonna be playing Santa Claus.
[Speaker Change] Representative Michaux, I'm willing to but hopefully
not going down the duck dynasty route. Representative Tim Moore, please
state your purpose.
[Speaker Change]  For a motion.
[Speaker Change] The gentleman is recognized for a motion.
[Speaker Change] Mr. Speaker, move that the house be now adjourned and
reconvene on Monday June 24th at 7:00pm. Subject to receipt of messages
from the Senate, committee reports, conference reports, re-referral
bills and resolutions, appointment of conferees and modifications to the
calendar.
[Speaker Change] Representative Moore's move is seconded by
Representative Langdon that the house is now adjourned subject to
receipt of messages from the Senate, receipt of committee reports,
conference reports, re-referral bills and resolutions, appointment of
conferees and modifications to the calendar. To reconvene on Monday June
