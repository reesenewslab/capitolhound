Association on the business organization committee for this law section.
it has been well vetted by that great and I've worked very hard and I
express my appreciation. I also support the bill because it promotes
efficiency and for better economy in giving our businesses scattered
souls to be able to do their business. other several provisions in the
snow. I would like to highlight a few and I'll be happy to take
questions. for example, the current law in North Carolina now vital and
what if one of the targets of arms would probably opt chalkboard. I
teach this money have much outboard with me that since I don't know. do
my best to explain it. a short form merger is currently below it, North
Carolina. if you have a parent organization and its
subsidiaryorganization in that Corporation others ninety percent of the
subsidiary organization is going to be a merger of that that subsidiary
at the end of the parent is not need now under current law andhave a
vote of the shareholders because ninety percent are already in favor of
of that merger will what is still one of the things this bill does is
said that if a parent organization has two subsidiary I is for sanity, I
do not have to get this shareholder approval. they are because again I
have all the votes they need. it would be inefficient and it can
actually be accomplished now under North Carolina law requires a straw
man organization, which again is not not an efficient way to cut conduct
business on the thing. another provision of this law is actually an
expansion of our two thousand one North Carolina business Corporation
amendment that allowed for attendance at shareholder meetings of
electronic. there are other means ever met communication, which is a
good thing and allow shareholders to participate get to the actual side
of the deleting what this does among several things is actually impose

requirement already in North Carolina law that there be a physical
location for the meeting.  It just allows another option.  Then another
provision, which I think is particularly important in today's down
economy, has to do with a safe harbor that is not in our law now that I
do believe is a good idea.  Whenever there is a substantial sale of all
the assets, or a sale of substantially all the assets, the shareholders
need to approve.  The challenge is, at what point is substantially all
of the assets sold.  And this causes some consternation for our
business, and in a down economy there have been.  I'm getting up here.
Sorry.  I get excited about this geeky staff.  This is my last one, and
then I'll take questions.  I know, I know.  Last one.  What this will
allow is that an organization, a corporation will now know that as long
as it retains both 25% of all of its assets, and has 25% of its income
from continuing operations, it has met that standard and does not have
to go through the shareholder approval process, which is expensive.  I
request your support.

[SPEAKER] Senator Rucho, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Would Senator Apodaca yield for question?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Reluctantly. During presentation ceremony, yes sir,
Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Apodaca, under the circumstances in you having
been a recipient of the August Award I think its unfair that we allow
that presentation to go forward without Senator Woodward being here to
defend himself. [laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Rucho, thank you very much. I did contact him
and he was given a five minute explanation why he didn’t disagree but I
hung up. So [laughter] [applause]
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Bill 426, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senate Bill 426 Change Deadline and Auditee Response.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Davis of Macon County is recognized to explain
the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, Mr. President. Especially at this time, I’m
thankful for a very short bill. And I would like to say is all this bill
does is gives an auditee response time from thirty days to the
discretion of the auditor. Senator MacKissick has an amendment that I
would consider a friendly amendment that he will be offering. And I
would encourage you to vote for that amendment as well. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator McKissick for what purpose do you rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To set forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Do the members have copies, Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] They do, Your Honor.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] You can send forward your amendment. The clerk will
read.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator McKissick moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator McKissick is recognized to explain the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] It simply allows a person who is subject to audit the
opportunity ten days to respond rather than the thirty days provided for
now.  It’s pretty straightforward. And Senator Davis and I worked on
this together. I want to commend him for sending forth a very thoughtful
bill. And I ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing
none, the request before the Senate is the passage of amendment one. All
in favor will vote aye. Opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be
allowed for the voting. The clerk will record the vote. Forty-six having
voted an affirmative and zero in the negative. Amendment one is adopted.
The bill as amended is back before the body. Is there any further
discussion or debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Nesbitt, for what purpose do your rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Just to speak briefly on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Nesbitt has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] And I just want to point out what we’re doing here. The
bill started out as whenever the auditor said, and I think it’s improved
to put a date certain in there so that there are some rules of the game.
But what you’re talking about here is the ability of an agency to
respond to an audit that probably took six months.
And most of the audits that have come out in the last year or two have
been critical, some harshly critical, some almost personally critical.
And if you got it on Friday you've got to have it by the Monday week. It
may be a six month audit.
And I don’t know what was wrong with the law to start with that says
thirty days after the draft audit is given. I know of nothing around
here that can’t wait thirty days for the agency to give its reply so
that if something’s misstated when the audit comes out, their side of
the story is in there.
Now, it will be your agencies that are getting it this time. And I’m not
in here defending Bureaucracy  but I think fair play dictates it. These
people aren't the enemy. They run agencies.  And they need to be able to
have time to respond and have their say. I pitched that out and I’ll say
it when the next bill comes through if it does the same thing.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Is there any further discussion or debate. Hearing
none, the question before the Senate is the passage of Senate Bill 426
as amended on a second reading. All in favor will vote aye. Opposed will
vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. The clerk will
record the vote. [Bryant, hi]
Forty-one having voted in the affirmative and five in the negative.
Senate Bill 426 as amended passes its second reading. Without objection
it will be read a third time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] North Carolina General Assembly enact.

Senate Bill 639, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 639, Board of Agriculture Modification.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jackson is recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. This bill basically, it's
been assumed, and we know what assume means. Most of us do. For a long
time that the Commission of Agriculture had complete authority over all
the crops grown and regulated in this State. We've been working under
that assumption and this bill basically just codifies that and puts it
into law that the Commissioner of Agriculture and the Board of
Agriculture does have the right to rule and regulate all crops that are
grown in this State. And I would appreciate your support. It passed the
Ag committee with no questions and no opposition. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator
Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Senator Jackson will yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Jackson, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there a problem with other people? It says that the
Agriculture will have the sole authority to prohibit certain types of
plants. Is there a problem of other entities or agencies trying to
regulate it? Currently, I'm not sure what this is solving.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, not to my knowledge. We're just trying to codify
that the commissioner does have the authority to do that, being he is
the Agriculture Commissioner. Or whomever happens to be the Agriculture
Commissioner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Kinnaird, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Kinnaird has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry I wasn't there to discuss this bill in Ag.
There seems to be a new regime which says that all committee meetings
start on time and so if you're a little late, you miss out on a bill.
But I do have concerns over this preemption bill. I think that what we
are ignoring here is that there's chemical farming and then there is
organic farming. And there are also people who do not like genetically
modified seeds and plants. They also are very concerned over plants that
are pesticide resistant. There are a lot of people who actually have
great questions about this and had I been there on time to the meeting I
would have expressed that. And expressed a lot of the opinions of people
whom I represent. So I definitely am voting against the bill because in
addition to that, I don't think preemption is a good actual public
policy and so I am definitely intending to vote against the bill. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Walters, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Walters has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think as we look at agriculture being the $77
billion crop in North Carolina, we have to let our Commissioner of
Agriculture have the ability to take care of our commercial crops. And I
don't think this bill has anything to do with organic farming. It will
allow it to move forward in the capacity it's doing today. So I'd ask
for you to support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion or debate?</p>
