starting with public bills. The second reading of House Bill 5, the
clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] House Bill 5, temporary funding group
homes and SCUs. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Page is recognized to explain
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Ladies and
gentlemen of the Senate, I’d like to take just a couple moments to
explain this bill. And before we describe what the bill does, I think
it’s important to remember how we got to this point. Long before
Republicans took leadership of the General Assembly, our state’s
Medicaid personal care services program, which provides assistance with
eating, bathing, and other activities, was out of compliance with
federal law. For years, it was easier for an adult care home resident to
receive these PCS services compared with an in-home recipient. A
situation which violates Medicaid law and also it created an
institutional bias that potentially ran afoul of the Americans with
Disabilities Act. Last April, the Obama administration threatened to cut
off all funding for personal care services unless the General Assembly
assured that equally situated patients in adult care homes, group homes,
and community homes received comparable services in the most integrated
setting appropriate to their needs. This General Assembly answered the
call for change, and we did it despite a tremendous budgetary shortfall
in Medicaid. Last year, we appropriated 39</p>

[Speaker changes.]...9.7 million dollars in temporary funds to insure
that individuals at the greatest risk of being deemed ineligible for
personal care services can remain in their current homes during the
transition. Initially, these funds were intended for adult care homes
only.  This bill, including the changes we made in the PCS,does the
following: it insures that group homes and special care unit residents
who are assessed after January first, can access the temporary 39
million dollar fund; it allows the mentally and developmentally
disabled, living in group homes, to tap into the funding stream; and it
enables individuals living in Alzheimer's special care units to also use
the transition fund after their appeals have been concluded through a
monthly supplement of $268 per month for each resident who qualifies
under the new PCS criteria. But let me be clear, this temporary funding
will stop on June 30th. The Obama Justice Department has made it clear
that long-term funding streams that favor individuals and institutions
rather than community-based settings could potentially violate the
Americans with Disability Act.  And, Mister President, at this time I
would like to send forward an amendment.
[Speaker changes.] Senator, do members have copies of the amendment?
[Speaker changes.] Yes, they do.
[Speaker changes.] You can send forward your amendment, Senator. Your
recognized to explain it as well. Clerk...sorry, Clerk'll read.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Pate moves to amend the bill.
[Speaker changes.] Your recognized, Senator. Explain the amendment.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you. This is purely a technical amendment. It
strikes the date of December 31st, 2012 and substitutes in its place
January 1, 2013. I recommend the adoption of the amendment.
[Speaker changes.] There any further discussion or debate? Hearing none,
the question before the Senate is the passage of Amendment One. All in
favor will vote aye. Opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed
for the voting and the Clerk will record the vote. 43 having voted in
the affirmative and 0 in the negative, Amendment One is adopted and the
bill as amended is back before us.  Is there any further discussion or
debate?
[Speaker changes.] Mister President?
[Speaker changes.] Senator ...
[Speaker changes.] I recommend adoption of the bill.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Senator. Any further discussion or debate?
[Speaker changes.] Mister President?
[Speaker changes.] Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker changes.] To speak on the bill.
[Speaker changes.] You have the floor to speak on the bill, Senator.
[Speaker changes.] I wanna first say that I am pleased to see that we're
addressing this very desperate need that our developmentally disabled in
group homes need.  We need to come up with stopgap funding to make
certain that they are provided for, certainly their viability was put
into question.  One thing which I would like to raise with Senator Pate,
if he's available for one quick question.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Pate, do you yield for a question?
[Speaker changes.] Yes, I do.
[Speaker changes.] Senator yields. Senator McKissick, you can ask your
question.
[Speaker changes.] Do you know, Senator Pate...and if you don't
certainly we can try to find out the information...many of those persons
that would've received these benefits that were eligible, filed appeals
and, of course, those appeals are in the process of being addressed and
handled through the appropriate administrative processes. Do we know
what extent to which this particular funding will now...how that will
effect that appeal process?  I assume those appeals will probably
now...be...there will be no need for them whatsoever...that this will
be...this funding addresses that gap, which they were contesting through
the appeals process...but do you...can you share any information with us
on that?
[Speaker changes.] I know that this...the amendment just now...limits it
to those who have had assessments since first of January, 2013, but,
Mister President, I'd like to get staff if I may to give assistance to
answer that question?
[Speaker changes.] Yes, Senator, go ahead.
[Speaker changes.] Staff advises that this has no impact on the appeals.
This money would be available after the appeals have been exhausted.
[Speaker changes.] Well...thank you.
[Speaker changes.] Any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the
question for the Senate....</p>

thank you, Mister President to speak to fill some reinforcement of Bill,
thank you. this has come to fruition. as a result of a of a New Year's
tradition and brass sound, North Carolina my district sponsored by Clay
Logan and other like-minded individuals and the basically what it is, as
they take a alive, well fed, happy opossum, and they put this opossum in
a plexi glass by him must write of the battle in Times Square on New
Year's Eve in it reaches the ground. very gently at the stroke of
midnight. there are typically three to four thousand people in
attendance. there is no alcohol allowed at this event and many children
of the good wholesome event is an economic development tool that is used
in an accounting and this set of this blows became necessary because
Peter decided to sue the sponsors of grass down and prohibited them from
having this event. this essentially gives the wildlife resources
commission the authority to issue them a permit for this event and other
like minded events that may occur in North Carolina. I would urge you to
vote for the bill. thank you,

Mister President. Senator  was revised to ask a question cylinder,David
G over question I've had to sell Eurocentric narrative for your

want to ask you about a serious question as it does say exhibition of
modern reading this last week about the Bears earned ingenuity
reservations center is in situations are really pretty in humane and I'm
just wondering since the start essay exhibition and the Crescent says,
handling, treatment, but I'm wondering if this would anything like those
roadside zoos at seven Charlie walking around and around on a cement
floor on my way out. my understanding is that that is under the purview
of the of another continent. this would not affect that sending him for
giving you trouble, just ask them.it only got a letter from the talk
show host backwater and I would I would just give you a think for a
moment you if you could ask an opossum would you rather be gently
lowered in a plexi glass box will be neutered him to switch him us him
him is a sad comment on the belt was even before that, I think that it
is almost as good as the judge, she said, when he made his decision
about the past and give me freedom or give me death, and he released him
from death on the highway. my fellow discussion</p>
