[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just here on Friday I would like to read the 4th, July prayer from the
US Senate in 1969. We thank You, O God, that the freedom we celebrate in
coming days is not an attainment, but an obtainment, that it is Your
precious gift to humanity as part of our createdness. We thank you for
the daring of our forefathers in reclaiming their &quot;ancient
rights.&quot; We thank you, too, for the heroes' valor, the patriots'
devotion, the prophets' vision, and for all the blood and sweat and toil
by which our freedom was purchased. As we commemorate our national
independence accept again the declaration of our everlasting dependence
upon me. In all our joy and thanksgiving enable us to remain a nation
&quot;under God,&quot; and give us grace and goodness to minister to
humankind in his name. Amen.
I pledge Allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to
the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible,
with Liberty and Justice for all. Without objection rule 12H is

motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and prior doing that, I
think, if the chair would let me make one more, more of a personal
privilege, I wanted to point out if I may, that former Representative
Aaron Fussell, passed away this morning. Mr. Fussell represented Wake
county from 1979 to 1994. He was a member of the House of
Representatives and today when we adjourn we'll be adjourning in his, in
his memory. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, I wonder if instead
of moving to ten o'clock tomorrow if you could move for eleven o'clock
tomorrow? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That'll be fine. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Alright,
Representative Moore is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Mr.
Speaker, move the subject to ratification of bills, messages from the
Senate, committee reports, conference reports, re-referral bills and
resolutions, appointment of conferees, introductions to bills and
resolutions and modifications to encounter and ask you now adjourn to

messages from the Senate, committee reports, conference reports,
re-referral bills and resolution, appointment of conferees and
modifications to the calendar to reconvene on Tuesday July the eighth
and eleven o'clock, in memory of former Representative Aaron Fussell and
whose honor I put yard signs in my yard, for Aaron Fussell many years
ago. Those in favor will say aye, opposed say no. The aye's have it. The
