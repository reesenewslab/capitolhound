[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning Mr. Chair and committee members. I'm just going to very
quickly go over a handout that should be in your notebooks in front of
you. It's the health and human services team assignment. This session we
are- we're formulated a little  different in that the health and human
services team is now made up of the members of the fiscal research
division, research division and the bill draft</p>

?? we’re trying to operate as one seamless team.  As you heard before
that we introduced Susan Jacobs, Donny Charleston and myself are the
members from fiscal research.  We also have a research assistant who
will be working with us for the session.  She’s not here today.  ??
Thomas from the legislative tracking division is Joyce Jones, Brian
Blacklitch and Lisa Wilkes and the research attorney is Jennifer Hillman
and later on in another presentation you’ll hear about ?? specific roles
but we just want you to have this team assignment.  It’s pretty self
explanatory as far as it shows all of the divisions in the department.
It’s a very large department as you can see.  On the division of central
management and support, Susan, Donny, Joyce and Lisa will handle all of
the issues related to that and that division includes the office of the
secretary and it also includes their division of information resources
management, their IT area.  The division of medical assistance is
primarily responsible for the Medicaid program and all things Medicaid
related and Susan and myself will handle that for fiscal.  Ryan is the
bill drafting attorney assigned to it and Jennifer Hillman the research
attorney.  The division of Mental Health Disabilities and Substance
Abuse under that area is also the Medicaid portion of Mental Health ??
1915bc waivers primarily.  I am the primary lead on that with Susan and
also working on from fiscal and Joyce, Ryan and Jennifer will also staff
that.  The division of state operated facilities, that is division with
all of the psych hospitals in the state, psychiatric facilities and
other facilities, I also handle that along with Donny.  Joyce is the
drafting attorney.  The division of health services regulation is Donny
also and myself.  The division of public health because we are a little
short staffed in fiscal Susan and I will be trying to handle that
together this session or at least until we can get another staffer on
board and Joyce will be the bill drafting attorney.  For Social Services
it will be Donny Susan and Lisa.  The division of aging and adult
services, I will handle that, along with Susan and Joyce.  Vocational
rehabilitation I will also handle with Donny and Lisa.  The services for
the blind and deaf, and also the division of services for the deaf and
hard of hearing I will also handle with Donny and Lisa and finally the
division of child development and early education will be Donny 's area.
Susan will back him up on it and Lisa Wilkes is the drafting attorney
and Mister Chair that concludes my presentation
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you are there any questions from members about
the team assignments?  Being none thank you very much Denise. Next the
appropriations process will be covered by Donny Charleston from our
staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]    Thank you Mister Chair and good morning members and
members of the audience.  The document I’ll be referring to is the
document you have in your packets entitled appropriations subcommittee
process and role of central staff.  Today my presentation will be a
basic review for new members, what you may have already heard in
orientation and for others this will be a review of the process you’ve
undergone during your tenure here. The first item listed on the document
is a continuation expansion budget.  It refers to the two basic
components of the budget.  The continuation budget is a recommended
level of funding needed to carry on government operations at its current
level.  The continuation budget typically contains inflationary
increases for certain operating costs, annual 	?? for programs that may
have been funded for only a partial year, for example, pilot programs
and may include operating funds for newly completed facilities. That is
the typical information, including the continuation budget.  We don't as
yet know what information will be given by the Governor’s office to
departments regarding what to include in the continuation budget.  So
we’ll have to wait and see what that budget will contain.  The second
component of the budget expansion budget and it includes any budget
expenditures.  Expenditure items beside and apart from the inflationary
costs in the continuation budget.  For example new programs, program
expansion, moving items from one time to recurring funding.  For
example, pilot programs.  The actual documents that work with in terms
of and inform the appropriation process</p>

are the Governor's recommended continuation budget.  With it contains
the base budget and any increases allowed in a continuation budget and
the Governor’s  recommended budget adjustments, which that document
summarizes the reductions and expansion items that the Governor
recommends.
Now, as regarding the overall schedule, typically the process takes
about six weeks, which includes the joint meetings and deliberation
before chambers split to develop their respective budgets. For 2013,
this Senate is slated to develope their budget first as the 2012, the
House was the first chamber to develop their budget. As part of the
budget process, committees will receive a budget target, which is
essentially a dollar figure which is the total appropriations for the
entire department, as determined by the full Appropriations chairs. The
overall goal of the subcommittee is to produce a package which will
contain the subcommittee report and any special provisions to be
presented to the full Appropriations. Essentially, it is a recommended
budget for DHHS, taken into consideration the Governor’s and the General
Assembly priorities. Throughout this process, fiscal staff, as well as
bill drafting and research take on a variety of roles.
In analyzing the budget, fiscal research will look at the historical
departmental spending and obtain detailed spending on programs from the
department. This information will be used to assist the committee in
deliberating about reductions, expansions, meter changes and any other
options that the General Assembly wishes to take into consideration.
Fiscal also handle requests by members to agencies for information to
inform committee deliberations. We take these requests from you as
members and we submit them to the department, basically confidentially,
so we don’t refer to your requests using your information. Basically
send it to the department as a request from a member, and we provide the
information back to you when we receive it from the department. Earlier
I mentioned special provisions. These are essentially individual
sections in the budget that direct policy action or specify how monies
are to be used, bill drafting takes the lead on crafting those special
provisions for the budget. Fiscal staff also coordinates the activities
of these proceedings by taking direction from the subcommittee chairs
regarding the agendas, scheduling and report preparations. Additionally,
fiscal will prepare fiscal notes, which are formal detail estimates of a
bill’s impact on the department of health and human services.
Earlier I also mentioned bill drafting and research. Joyce Jones, Lisa
Wilkes, and Ryan Blackledge, will form the team along with fiscal
research to health and human services team as it deliberate throughout
the process.
The research division in addition to bill drafting, is another central
subcommittee process that will provide assistance as needed in analyzing
legislation for constitutional problems. Analyzing the legislative
impact on existing statutes and looking at the impact on regulations and
procedures, policies and pointing out any ambiguities in potential
legislation.
Today we have representatives from the department of health and human
services, they’re usually permanent fixtures at these meetings, and they
serve as expert resource for member questions and will make
presentations on different budget issues. The office of state budget and
management will also participate in these proceedings and their roles to
assist members and their staff with information on departmental budgets.
That would essentially be a global overview of the appropriations
process, and Mr. Chair, that concludes my remarks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are there any questions from members for Mr. Charleston. Senator
McKissick?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure. This is just an inquiry so I know how we might be proceeding as a
committee. Were there any items that were identified for continuation
review going into this budget cycle where there’ll be reports coming
back relating to its finishers that might have been made over the last
budget cycle that were going to be reviewed by the subcommittee moving
into this cycle, and if so, what was identified for continuation review
and when will we be reviewing it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’re in the process of working with the committee chairs in compiling
information and my assumption is that the committee chairs will
disseminate that information to the remaining committee members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further questions from members? Hearing none, Mr. Charleston thank
you for your presentation. Next on the agenda is the Appropriations
calendar by Susan Jacobs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, members of the committee, good morning. I’m having issues
with the microphone. You should have a calendar in your notebook, and I
will pick up where Donny left off talking about your appropriations
process.</p>

<p id="20:00">
and every year the full chairs of appropriations come to an agreement
for on a schedule for the upcoming session and that's what this calendar
represents. So you will see in February that joint subcommittee
meetings, of course, begin this week. Last week you were in this room
hearing budget briefings from other colleagues in fiscal research on the
fifth and sixth for the overall budget. This week you start your joint
committee meetings. Today's meeting, of course, is an organizational
meeting. Secretary Wos is scheduled to be here tomorrow to talk about
her priorities for the agency for the upcoming biennium. The state
auditor will be here on Thursday morning to talk about the Medicaid
state audit that was released a couple of weeks ago. The following week
will include non-profit reports that are required in the last session's
budget bill. The week of February 18th will be dedicated to hearing
those reports. If you turn to March, you will see that the joint work
continues through March. You also have on your calendar, for your
reference, several bill drafting and bill filing deadlines for your
information. Corey and bill drafting sent this information out, I think
last week, and it should correspond with what we have in the calendar
here. We anticipate, or have been told, by a budget development team
that hopefully we will have the Governor's recommended budget by the
week of March the 18th and at that point, of course, we will include in
your schedule some time for you to hear a presentation on the Governor's
recommended budget. Beginning the week of April, I meant the month of
April, joint subcommittees continue to meet until April 15th when the
Senate plans to begin on working on its budget. That Senate budget
process will last through the end of April with the Senate anticipating
the third reading of its budget on May the 9th. The House will work on a
response to that budget during the week of May 13th and May 20th with
anticipating passing a House budget on third reading on May 30th. The
final page, of course, is June with a conference report anticipated
being passed on June 13th. And, Mr. Chair, if there are no questions on
the calendar I will move into the next presentation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There are any questions from members for Ms. Jacobs? Before we go
forward, please, Representative Earle came in after the committee
members introduced themselves. Would you like to introduce yourself to
members, please, ma'am?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I apologize for being late. Beverly Earle, Mecklenburg
County, District 101.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You should have, outside of your notebook actually, was a hard copy of
this presentation that I'll be doing this morning and it is basically a
very high level overview for the budget for the Department of Health and
Human Services. Tomorrow, as I stated earlier, you will have the
secretary's office in here. She will go into greater detail into some of
this information when she has her staff. You will also receive more
detailed information as we go through our briefings on each agency
throughout the joint process. I think the first agency we will actually
get into more details on will be the week after the non-profits, the
following week Denis Thomas will begin with the division of mental
health. So as we look at our agencies and evaluate core missions and
functions we like to begin by looking at what's actually in state law
and how those duties are defined. On slide two you see that the
authority for HHS is down in GS-143b 127.1. The last time this was
changed appears to be in 1997. Interestingly enough, I would point out
from this authority that there is a lot of focus on, if you look
throughout these bullets, on, the first bullet of course references
public health and mental health but there is a heavy for preventive
measure, if you look at the least couple of bullets. So when we look at
our, when we look at agencies that we're covering and we look at the
functions they are currently performing we like to go back and look at
what the General Assembly had in mind for that agency when the agency
was established. So you spend a lot of time, members and staff as well,
looking at Medicaid and Medicaid expenditures, which, as you know, pays
for health services. But, as I said earlier, the authority does
reference prevention as a really high priority for this agency. You have
the Office of the Secretary's work chart in your book and there are
about 24 divisions and offices in the Division of Health and Human
Services. A little over 18,000 positions</p>

<p id="25:00">
16,000 actual employees. So, we'll start by looking at the budget as a
whole for
general funding appropriations. So, 12-13, the Health and Human Services
Budget,
out of the 20.2 billions that was appropriated, and that's what your
money report, your conference report actually shows when you start
deliberating and voting on your budget in here, we'll talk about the
funds that come in from tax proceeds. So, the total budget is about 52
billion dollars from all sources. But the amount that's in your
committee report and  in your budget is about 20.2 billion. Education,
of course, has the lion's share of that 20 billion dollars, at 54.86
percent. Health and Human Services, as far as the size of its budget, is
second, at 4.7 billion dollars, or 23%. The total of these two agencies,
of these two subcommittees alone add up to about 78% of total funds of
the 20 billion dollars. Now the reason this is important is because, at
some point when you have both House and Senate targets, and begin
putting your budgets together, in years where there have been a
shortfall, and the full chairs and sub-chairs have to identify cost
savings, if it is a significant shortfall, then of course the agencies
with the higher percentage of general fund dollars receive the higher
reduction targets. So, if you look at the 23% on the print from the
previous slide and look at it more by function you see that Medicaid of
the 20.2 billion dollars is about 3.1 billion, or 15%, the second
largest would be mental health at 696 million, or 4%. All the other
H.H.S. agencies, at 887 million dollars. Of course if you look at the
education component,the 55% that I talked about a minute ago, public
schools are 37% or 7.5 billion dollars, and higher education which
includes universities and community colleges, 3.6 billion or
approximately 18%. So I apologize for all the acronyms on this page,
it's hard to put the full titles of these agencies on the slide, and so
I'll talk briefly about this,  you'll see on the next slide I actually
have the names of these agencies. So we've started out at the
subcommittee level and talked about the percentage of subcommittees'
funds as it applies to the total state budget. And then we talked about
program area Mental Health and how that applies to the total state
budget. And then when you look within the subcommittee at the divisions
within the Department of Health and Human Services, and how much money
they have as a percentage of their total 4.7 billion dollar
appropriation, you see that DMA, of course, has roughly 66% of the total
funds, followed by mental health at 15%. I think this slide is probably
more helpful for you, in looking at where the majority of funds actually
are within Health and Human Services. And, again, this becomes important
when you start your deliberations and begin putting your package
together for a budget. So if you rank these divisions, in order of
magnitude, beginning with the smallest and moving to the largest, you
then see that Medicaid of course is at 66%, 15% mental health. So a 1%
reduction, I don't know what you're target would be if there is a
target. In the past, if you had a 2% reduction, you could...a 2%
reduction would be almost 90 million dollars. So you could easily see
that in magnitude...you could almost eliminate all the first five
agencies before you actually reached your target.
Now I say that because, when you then see a money report and options
from your Chairs or you start deliberating jointly on options that you'd
be willing to consider, when you have large targets, just like the full
Chairs when they assign targets to subcommittees, you see big reductions
in the divisions that have a lot of state money. So, as we do our
highlights for you, and talk
about legislative highlights and talk about where changes have been
made, it's important to keep that in perspective. When you see smaller
changes in some agencies, it's typically because they have a smaller
state funded appropriation. This is a busy chart, and it is an attempt
at highlighting
for you, for the budget, what has happened in the past two years. So
this first chart is fiscal year 11-12, as Donny told you just a few
minutes ago
you begin with the Governor's continuation budget, which we refer to
sometimes as the base budget, it does have some inflationary increases
and adjustments, the past couple of years it has not included the rebase
amount for Medicaid. So for legislative changes, you see that compared
to the Governor's continuation
budget for 11-12, the net changes were 433 million dollars; now, the net
change is an important distinction here because...</p>

<p id="30:00">
this is a chart that’s in the front of you money report that talks about
a summary of changes across all agencies.  There’s a lot of activity
going on within these budgets that you don’t see in this chart or that
you would not necessarily see in the front of that document.  So just as
we will go through the details of what has actually happened in these
agencies as we do our briefings for you.  Some that actually need to be
pointed out in this chart would be, the first one is the one in child
development where the Pre-K funds were transferred from DPI into the
Department of Health and Human Services.   So while it makes it look
like there’s a positive change to that agency, in fact there were
several reductions in that agency is a positive change simply because of
that transfer.  There are of course several things that were going on
Medicaid and we’ll talk more in depth about that when I cover the
Medicaid budget for you.  In 10-11 there was an f-map or that’s the
amount of money, or the rate that the federal government matches our
Medicaid funds.  There is a short fall, there was a contingency plan to
take care of that in the technical corrections bill so that impacts that
budget but is not represented by these figures.  Moving to 12-13.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   Susan excuse me for interrupting you, some members
and people in the group may not understand Medicaid rebates.   Would you
mind going back to that and briefly explain it please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes sir Mister Chairman and members of the committee
when I refer to Medicaid rebates it refers to the amount of money you
would need for the Medicaid program.  Medicaid is an entitlement
program, which means that states don’t have to participate in Medicaid
but if you do participate in Medicaid and all states currently do, there
are certain guidelines the state has to follow.  You have a lot of
flexibility about the kinds of services and things that you provide and
the rate that you pay for those services but once a person is determined
to be eligible for Medicaid they are then entitled to receive Medicaid
services.  So the rebates refers to the amount of money necessary to
fund the Medicaid program in the upcoming?? or the next fiscal year, so
how much money does it take to fund that program.  Once you have that
rebates number and it’s the same as the ADM number or the daily
membership number you have to use in DPI for public schools.  So
basically since you have public schools the number of children grow,
other things change and you have to apply and appropriate additional
funds for that.  The same thing holds true for Medicaid the rebates
refers to the amount of money you would have to fund the growth in the
Medicaid program.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  So moving to 12-13, you have the Governor’s
continuation budget again, you will see that for 12-13 it was only a
million dollars more for the second year the biennium than it was in the
first year in 11-12 so not much of an increase in the Governor’s
recommended continuation budget for that year.  Net changes were two
hundred and forty four million dollars and you see the revised
appropriation of 4.96 percent. I will tell you that if you break it out
and look at it by the magnitude of reductions that year they were over
800 million dollars.  The offsetting positive items that year would have
been over five hundred million dollars and that’s why you have a net
reduction of two hundred forty four million dollars, which is why I
caution you, looking at these summary charts that we actually publish
and try to figure out the level of activity, you have to look deeper
than that into actual subcommittee report to see the level of activity.
This I will point out on this chart will be of course; this is the
second year of a Medicaid shortfall early on that session the General
Assembly had to pass legislation to appropriate funds to help with that
Medicaid shortfall.  Two pieces of legislation were passed that year to
help with that shortfall.  There was also a technical adjustment.  If
you look at the division of Public health, where I had the two asterisks
you see a positive number there where almost 7 million dollars, there
were reductions in that agency that year.  There’s a positive number
here because of the program because environment health was actually
transferred.   So we talked earlier about on the four billion dollars
and how it how it relates to your twenty billion dollars general fund
budget. The total budget for Department of Health and Human Services is
over  eighteen billion dollars so the deliberations that you have the
conversations that happen about changes to the budget is focused on
approximately twenty seven percent of their total budget, State fund
appropriation  only makes up less than a third of the Department of
Health and Human Services budget.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  This last chart that I’ll cover with you deals with
historical expenditures and up until this point, we've been talking
about budget.  Budgeted amounts and how the budget compares to the
Governor’s recommended budget.  We</p>

I will say that when we are looking at historical expenditures here
because number one the state appropriation for the department is not
even half of what the total budget is. And two, because of this
significant change that had been occurring with reseat in this agency.
In order to look at a real historical trend you need to look at total
funds. So, that top numbers they have the 16 billion beginning in 2008
is actually the total expenditures for that year. You see that the blue
shading will represent 12.2 billion dollars and that is the amount
reseats for the department, the 4.6 billion dollars as the general fund
appropriation. So, if you look across the years from 2008 to 2012 you
see that it looks like the general fund appropriation has remain
relatively flat that’s because primarily begin in 2008, 2009 the ARRA
money starting to coming stimulus money of the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act begin paying for a higher percentage for medicate than
they have previously, the Federal Government have paid previously. So,
in other words if you are looking at the general fund appropriation and
comparing that to how much you have actually had to put into that agency
that’s a good number. If you are looking and trying to figure out
whether the cost saving measures have been effective we are looking at
any individual program as to if they have been successful and
controlling cost and I don’t recommend you that you would need to look
at total funds rather than just general fund appropriation. So, in the
presentations that we will do for you would include both, we will talk
about general fund appropriation because that’s why you will have to
make decisions on whether it will make changes if there are any and off
course total funds when we are looking at activities and trying to
determine if a program has been successful and controlling cost in the
any individual agency. So, Mr. Chairman that concludes my presentation
on the overview of the program, we look off course how this same
information in greater detail for all of our divisions in upcoming
weeks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Susan, are there any members who have questions? Senator
Robinson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you Susan for your comprehensive
report, just a question, you explained on page 11 that are all of those
in the upper tier ARRA funds or is it other Federal money that we draw
down and when does ARRA expire?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman and Senator Robinson, the top number is actually total
funds from all sources including ARRA, including that number would be
the medicate Federal funds, other Federal grants or any kind of any
other reseat fees or anything else that will be included in that top
line, if you are going to see the reseats only where the ARRA money
shows up is in that blue chart. So, in 2008, 2009 the ARRA funds were
approximately I think 800 million dollars. In 2010, they were 1.4
billion dollars and this is just health and human services and then in
2011 the amounts of funds were close to a billion dollars for ARRA.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, follow up please. Is there an expiration what is the expiration for
ARRA funding? Was that permissive?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman and Senator Robinson, the last year the ARRA funds actually
expired. The 2011 was the last year. So, the most recent budget in 2012
you did not have any budget ARRA money there could have been some care
for funds for agencies did not spend all, they can ___[03:48] into the
next year but I think that all the budgeted funds, all the funds we have
received have been budgeted.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further questions from members of the committee? Representative
Farmer-Butterfield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman I got an easy one for Susan and looking at your
chart on page 7 you use a lot of acronyms, is it fair to say that the
acronyms can be defined and looking at page 7? On your chart on page 6,
I think it will be 7.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman and Representative Farmer-Butterfield absolutely so that’s
why I said you probably won’t like that chart. On the slide 6 which is
why it’s the same information on slide 7, the response of those
individual acronyms on the previous page, I think this is a better chart
if you wanna look at individual divisions and what they are actually
called I’m trying to relate in the actual services. So, yes this is a
better chart.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There are a lot of acronyms associated with health and human services
and we will be conducting pop-quizzes as we go along to see how
proficient you are.

Increases or decreases, and any unresolved items that we as a
sub-committee, joint sub-committee are unable to reach. And we will
consult with other sub-committee as necessary, for instance our program
evaluation and other committees as we go along, other sub-committees who
may have some like interests with our sub-committees. we will receive
guidance form the appropriations chairs on the house and the senate on
spending targets when they are resolved, sub-committee deliberations in
voting. As you know we're members of the senate and others are members
of the house and when we come to a vote that will be worked out, we're
not going to vote together we will vote separately and all that remains
to come out of the deliberations between the four chairs. And special
provisions, that will - we'll get guidance on that from the chairs.
Now having heard all of this, is anyone on either the house or senate
sub-committee who wishes to withdraw from this sub-committee? Well
you're not going to be able to, you're here, you're sentenced for the
next several months to be on this committee and it's very important work
that we do here because let's face it, we are looking out after some of
our most vulnerable citizens in this state and we must do it with care,
efficiency and compassion. Now Susan are you supposed to get back up
here and give us something else now? You're finished? Are there any
closing remarks form any of the chairs? You're still holding your
silence, something tells me this is not right. Members of the committee
are there any  closing remarks? Oh, I'm sorry, senator Robinson forgive
me please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, thank you Mr. Chair and thank you for leading
this committee. We appreciate our experience in this area and I wanted
to commend the staff when she went through the teams, everybody has a
whole lot to do. and that takes competency, that takes efficiency, that
takes long hours and I'm not sure they get commended for all they do. I
know they're small and they've been cut and that kind of thing but we
can see the dedication, they do a fantastic job so I just want to extend
my personal thanks to them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for that and in keeping with that I think
it's very important that we be cognizant of the time, the limited time
that the staff has to give any of us. They do a great amount of work in
a very short time meeting short deadlines and we have to recognize them
and for their endeavors. Is there anyone from the department who has
anything to add to today's meeting? Mr. Slate? Mr. Owen? Any? I
understand the secretary will be joining us tomorrow and we look forward
to hearing from her and some who have not had a chance to meet her to
actually see her and have an exchange with her and members of your
staff. Is there anything else to come before this sub-committee today?
If not thank you very much for your attendance, we are adjourned.</p>
