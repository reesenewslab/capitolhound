[Speaker Changes] Good evening. If you feel inclined, please pray with
me. Almighty God, my maker and redeemer, I ask for your guidance for
this body of leaders. And for your eternal patience when we make
decisions that are not representative of your plan for all of us. I
understand that in order to make decisions that will bode well for the
majority, we sometimes forget that the minority is part of your eternal
plan. Please grant us the good sense to realize that we are given the
right of free choice in our decisions. But are not guaranteed that our
decisions are always the best choice for all. I hope that all we do
tonight will be reflective of that mission and am confident that with
your guidance we will succeed. I understand, as you do, that what we do
in this life will echo for eternity. I remember that Jesus said, what
you do for the least of these, you also do for me. Amen.

The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much Mr. speaker members this is a bill that was
unanimously recommended by the bar association family law Council. By
the board of  governors unanimously to us and unanimously passed
judiciary C committee. And I know of no opposition to the bill. But
briefly what the bill does. In the North Carolina rules of civil
procedure requires that if you have multiple claims in action you don't
get to win to lose on 1 and appeal it. And win or loose on another one
and appeal it. Of cost and efficiency, an time sake you got to do it all
on time. And that works really well generally, but in the family law
contacts. When you have an alimony decision. Follow months and months
later  by a custody distribution. Follow months latter by an equitable
distribution decision. To do that actually delays and really impact
families negatively. Impact the law negatively in the  case. So this is
one exception in visual appeal to pathos very distinct vision on that
would allow individual appeals in to those  families law decision. That
would allow families to get decision a little bit quicker. This is
endorse by the  judges association. I know of no opposition to the bill.
Thank you Mr. speaker

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Speaker and members of the House. This amendment is
generated, it was generated out of a discussion that Representative
Starnes and I had on the floor on Thursday. Members may remember in
which I had raised the question of whether why a consumer advocate
should be one of the persons or categories that could be considered for
membership on the utilities commission. There were, as members know, a
number of others, seven in fact, that were previously listed from work
in the committee as I understand it. I'm not on either commerce or rules
to know that for sure but that's what I've been told. I would urge you
to vote for this amendment because each of us has in our districts
consumers. If you can count children, there's eighty thousand, about
eighty thousand consumers in your district. And all this amendment does
is say that someone whose commitment is to fight to keep rates as low as
possible. Those of you who are a little older remember it used to be
called the Light Bill, now we think of it more as the Power Bill, and a
consumer advocate would be on there looking for every which way to keep
rates down. The consumer advocate would take advantage of the insights
of the public staff, but is not a replacement for the public staff
because the consumer advocate if selected for the utilities commission
is a voting member of the commission and would fight hard for all of our
consumers in all of our districts. So it's hard for me to see why this
isn't a unanimous vote in favor of the consumer advocate. Members, I
urge your support. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Speaker. To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Speaker. A lot of you may or may not know how the
utilities commission works. But contained within the utilities
commission is eighty five to ninety, and Representative Luebke alluded
to it, public staff. And their job is to look out for the public. So at
present you have seventy people on the commission and you have eighty
five to ninety people looking out for the public. Well I would say to
you that the public is looked after by the public staff and that's their
main job by responsibility. So I think it's there. I think what we have
in the bill itself is the, is the, is the consistency of the expertise
on there that we've put in the bill to make this bill not a political
pointee anymore for this commission. So I say eighty five to ninety
people looking at, at the public staff are looking after the public is a
lot of folks. And let's keep this bill as it is and I'd ask that you
vote against this amendment.

Inquiry for Representative Luebke.

Representative Luebke, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke could you please expand upon and perhaps enlighten
us on what a demonstrated competency in consumer advocacy might look
like.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, it would be a person who would want to be on the commission because
she or he knows a lot about the whole issue of rate making and the
different dimensions of rate making but looks at it from the standpoint
of keeping the rates lowest, as low as possible. There are a lot of
different people on the utilities commission, but they don't always look
at it from the perspective of keeping rates low. And they're honorable
people and they think hard about what they're doing but there is a
difference in perspective as to whether you</p>

welcome you and thank you for your service.
Ladies and Gentlemen of the house, for your planning purposes this week.
Tomorrow session will be at 2, as well as on Wednesday. And we are now
working with the various committee members to see if we can have a no
vote session on Thursday. I can’t make any promises. We may at least try
to have it earlier if there is a need for a vote on Thursday. But now
we’re trying to work around that.
And Ladies and Gentlemen of the House, upon motion of Representative
Cotham from Mecklenburg County, the chair is happy to extend a courtesy
of the galleries to the Mechlenburg County elections chair. Carol
Williams. Carol, if you’re in the gallery, please stand and let us
welcome you.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just, as a proud father I can’t help brag a
little bit. I just wanted to help share praise report with the other
colleagues here. My son, Lt. Samuel Pittman, veteran of two tours in
Kuwait and Iraq during which the first time he was over there he was on
trucks that three different occasions they ran over a total of three
IEDs that didn’t go off. And had very near misses and that sort of
thing. This past weekend at drill he was appointed executive officer of
the 1452nd transportation company of the North Carolina National Guard.
I’m just kind of proud of him. Thank you.
