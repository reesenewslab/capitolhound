Speaker: Senator Apodaka, for what purpose do you rise?
Representative: The resolution we just handled, I believe, needs to go
by special messenger to the house, either way.
Speaker: thank you Senator. Senators we are going to move into public
bills, second reading. Senate bill 208, the clerk will read
Clerk: Senate bill 208, affective operation of 1915 GMC waiver
Speaker: Senator Tucker, is recognized to explain the bill.
Representative: Thank you Mr. President. Members of the senate, senate
bill 208 started out to be a relatively simple bill. Senator Hartsville
had worked many years here trying to get the PBH [xx] renovations model
started to enter into managed care, which most states have gone to for
their mental health, developmental disability, and substance abuse
needs. As we move through this process, it ended up being a committee
hearing of about 30 people, that I finally got in a room, and sat down
and we hammered out in agreement. Everyone did not get what they wanted,
but in summary, the bill gives new definition to the MCO, which is local
management entity and managed care organization. Also, in the bill, it
requires certain actions by the secretary of health and human services.
The secretary is to certify each LEMCO. The secretary, if she is unable
to provide the LEMCO as certified, meaning that it is solvent and in
compliance with the requirements as certified in this bill, that she
move to have that local LEMCO absorbed into another LEMCO that is
successful, in compliance. Also, it does not state, but was implied in
all the meetings, that all LEMCO’s should adhere to the PBH Carolinas
model, to do what it can tot become one standard entity within the
state, with multiple locations. Currently, the have 11. The secretary
has to certify every six months that the LEMCO’s are in compliance
because, as Senator Nesbitt has reminded on several occasions, the state
is on the hook for this money and we need to move forward and stand
against any risk of insolvency against those folks. It also requires
that the LEMCO give timely provided payments, and that the young LEMCO
exchanges billing payment and transaction information with the proper
entities. So, it gives the secretary of health and human services all
the latitude she needs to maintain</p>

Saying responsibly the ?? set, or set out forth for her. Mr. President,
at this time I have an amendment to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator, do the members have copies of the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes, Sir. They do.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Then you can send forward your amendment. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Tucker moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Ladies and Gentlemen, or Senate's, there are a couple of corrections
that were made. One was notes that were taken during that committee
meeting that were included in the bill. We are moving to amend the bill
on page three, lines four and five and to rewrite that and state,
necessary services to medicaid recipients. Also, on line four, page
three, lines fourteen and sixteen, by rewriting the lines to read,
uninterrupted provision of medically necessary services to medicaid
recipients. Everybody has a copy and I appreciate your support on this.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Is there any discussion or debate? Hearing the none, the question for
the Senate is the passage of amendment one. All in favor will vote, aye,
opposed will vote, no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. The
clerk will record the vote. Blue, aye. 49 having voted in the
affirmative and zero in the negative amendment one is adopted. Now, the
bill as amended is back before the body. Is there any further discussion
or debate? Senator Barringer, floor purpose of your ?? ?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To speak on the bill, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator, you have the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I'm very proud and pleased to be apart of this bill. I think its part of
our obligation as the representatives of the people of North Carolina to
safeguard the monies, the funds for the people who are mentally ill. For
those who are vulnerable, and can not speak for themselves; the foster
children, the elderly, the veterans who have traumatic brain injuries,
and so many others who have these kinds of problems. I want to thank
Senator Tucker for his patience with me in this learning process. Going
through this bill he's been a very good mentor. I appreciate the
stakeholders in their respectful discussion of the bill, and I would
appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator Nesbitt, floor
purpose for your ayes.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. President, to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator you have the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. President and members of the Senate. I'm not sure where
exactly to start on here. I'll start at the end. I know that everyone
involved on this bill has good intentions. I think that everybody that's
dealt with mental health for the last 15 years has had good intentions.
We have about every time the system starts to get going and starts to
work, somebody in Raleigh discovers another good idea and destroys it.
This bill should be short titled, the state consolidation of mental
health. If you read this bill it says, from on high the department will
have these ?? and all these forms that everybody's got to turn in.
You've got to turn them in on time and they've got to be right, and they
got to be perfect, and if you don't . . . Or, if the secretary doesn't
think you did, or doesn't want to think that you did they don't certify
you, and within 30 days you will be transferred to another LME. The
words out around the state that they don't think there needs to be this
many LME's. There were 20 some, 25, I guess. I don't know how many we're
down to now, it's about 11, because of people taking over other people.
A lot of it is encouraged by the department, and why they want to have a
state run system, I don't know. They tried it. We were down here one
year, we had just fired up the LME's, and we were trying to get them
going, and get them stabilized. Low and behold, we went home in August
and before we got back in May the secretary had taken all medicaid away
from all the LME's and given it to a company called Valueoptions to
operate. Valueoptions operated it for a year and a program that was
suppose to cost 300 Thousand cost a Billion dollars.</p>

And I had to spend the next thee years, instead of building mental
health, getting that thing back under control. Because it was syphoning
all the money out of mental health into this boondocks. And what we had
were 62$ an hour babysitters for everybody involved in the mental health
system. It was breaking us. The secretary dreamed up a definition called
&quot;community supports&quot; and it was a blended rate. That meant a
Ph.D. got paid the same amount as a high school graduate providing
services, 62$ an hour. Well guess who was providing all the services -it
wasn't the PhD's. We were under instructions from Senator Bassnight at
the time, and others, to fix that, now we didn't create it, remember the
secretary did this. Demcy Benton at the time was kind of an interim
secretary of human resources, so he didn't have a dog in the fight. So
he put his shoulder to the wheel, we put our shoulder to the wheel, and
we fixed it. We did away with that definition, put new definitions in,
scaled that thing back, and thats the reason that we started the appeals
process at OAH because we had like 10,000 appeals a year for two or
three years as we took people off of this service, that nobody needed
and weren't getting any benefit out of, and moved them to services that
they needed. And as part of that appeals process we said we'll have
mediation. And mediation was so we could move them into the service they
needed and get them out of the service they didn't need. Now thats the
history of the state running this system. And its a sorry history. We
moved the LME system in moving medicaid back into the communities. And
that was started when we were democrats, and the waver program was
started when we were democrats, that were in control of this system, so
we're not in disagreement over that. But the concept was, get everything
back to the local level where they're closest to the people, where they
can manage these providers, and where you wont have a runaway system.
Under value options by the way, they were so overwhelmed, they simply
dropped all the fail safes to catch even fraud and abuse, and approved
everything, at the direction of the secretary. And by the way, when the
secretary left the summer after we discovered the boon doggle, they
tried to interview her and she wouldn't submit to an interview. We're
left with a problem. Now, here we are with the bill, thats saying you
can be good for five years, but you fail to get one certification from
the secretary, in thirty days you're gonna be under somebody else.
There's a rumor up our way that they want to put Western Highlands under
Smokey. Well Smokey's already got about 20 counties or something like
that. If you do all of this, we will have almost 30 counties under and
LME. That is not local control and supervision. And I'm gonna tell you
something. This would be a great bill if it were aimed at DHHS. They are
the failure in this whole bill. And if you bring me a bill that says
they gotta behave and do it right tomorrow or they're fired, I'll
co-sponsor it with you. Because thats what keeps happening. And those
people over at DMA and Mental Health want to put these people out of
business and run this thing themselves. Its gonna be like trying to run
your local health departments with no health departments. Its just
everybody will write to Raleigh or call Raleigh or whatever to get their
services.  Now what they did, Western Highlands was the first LME that
was supposed to go to the waiver system. What they did was took a good
idea...</p>

<p id="25:00">
Which was we're gonna get you a waiver to where you can design your own
local system.  And this department over here said it's not really to
design your own system, you must be exactly like Piedmont Behavioral
Health.  And I'm telling you, there's nothing magic about Piedmont
Behavioral Health except they had this waiver to begin with.  But they
weren't an exceptional ??, they didn't provide services better than
everybody else.  They were able to avoid that boondoggle with community
supports because they had control of Medicaid and said no to people, but
so would the other ?? had they had the power. It was ?? that mucked that
up.  When you are dealing with the mental health system it requires more
and closer attention than anything you'll do in state government.  You
have prices services, you have individual needs of these people, you
have providers that have their own agenda and are trying to make money
and somebody's got to keep control of that.  It needs to be done at the
local level.  Now for those of you who don't believe anything I said,
you think it ought to be a state wide system, I'm telling you, your
local ?? is going away.  They're going to be down to two or three in
about a year or two and your people don't want that.  If you go talk to
your advocates for the people that need the help, if you go talk to your
?? folks, they're trying to do the best they can. What they did with
western ??, I started to tell you this a while ago, they took that idea,
okay you can form your own ??, you're the first one under the waiver.
Oh, by the way you can't really do that because you've got to look just
like Piedmont. Oh, and the system we ran last year, as a state, we're
only going to give you 85% of the money we spend and we expect you to
come in on budget although Medicaid is an entitlement program. You can't
just take it away from people.  Our ?? even asked several, can we cut
provider rates? No.  The only place you can get it from is to take it
out of the hides of the people receiving service and I'm telling you,
you can't do that in a day.  You've got to get a hold of the system and
look at who needs what and begin to gradually work down.  And my
question to the state is, if they want to run this thing, why couldn't
they run it for 85% of what they ran it for?  Well then they come in six
months later and say you're just a failure.  You only operated it at 10%
less than we did.  You're just out of balance, you're a failure, fire
your director, and by the way, we're probably going to merge you with
somebody else.  Took one of the best ?? in the state and broke their
back.  My people are still fighting and they're trying to sustain
themselves.  You just passed a bill the other day on trying to hire a
new ?? director.  We're finding out people won't come there now because
the last one got fired, and they can look at this stuff and tell what's
going on. So we're going to have to offer severance benefits and this
kind of thing to get anybody to even look at it.  And my strong
recommendation to you is for self preservation that you vote against
this bill.  This does no good.  If they want to require reports, that's
fine, but where did we lose the idea that the state, the HHS, has some
responsibility for making its system run properly?  This doesn't make
the system run properly.  This says if we don't like what you're doing
you aren't going to have a system.  We'll run it.  We'll run it through
two or three ?? that will do our bidding.  That's where we're  headed
and it looks like there's no turning back, but I intend to vote no and I
urge you to do the same.</p>

[SPEAKER] Really know what to say to you. Senator Nesbitt and I have had
a number of conversations about this. No one will challenge his effort
over the years to be for mental health and be an advocate for that.  I
understand and I think you heard in his comments he’s got a burr under
his saddle about Western Hollands. But this bill does exactly what we
want it to do. It holds the DHHS Secretary accountable to have the
reports and make sure that all of these MCOs which are 11 are left.
Whether some will be absorbed or not, I would venture to say you’re
probably correct about that Senator Nesbitt. We have ECBH that’s
operating well serving 19 counties in the eastern part of the area.
I really don’t know so much about local control or the county
commissioners and board can have representation. The real problem is for
people calling 1-800-GOOD LUCK RALEIGH for mental health services. It’s
been that way in the past. You talk about Secretary Odem I think was her
name. There’s been Canslor. There’s the new secretary now. There’s been
a debacle. You’re correct. But it wasn’t all value options fault. Value
options signed a contract in April and is supposed to take on 76,000
cases for providers to pay claims. By September it was about 270,000.
People were scrambling. It became unraveled and it cost the state a
billion dollars.
Now, I’m not going to talk about who was running things then. I’m just
going to talk about moving forward. I don’t see the doom and gloom. We
have accountability in place to be able to hold these people
accountable. Because ultimately Senator Nesbitt, you are correct. The
state’s responsible. The Department will be responsible. You know we
can’t fire those people over in DHHS. The State Personnel Act won’t
allow that unless they’re incompetent. The people that have been in
place a number of years have now retired and moved on so they’re new
players.
Yes, it is a fresh look at this and yes, the boat has left the dock. And
actually it got out to sea and it got burned. There’s no turning back
here. Either the MCOs make this work, ladies and gentlemen of the
Senate, or we’ll go to a privately handled mental health development on
disability and substance abuse provider.
We want the state to maintain it for as long as we had, as long as we
can and to move forward in this process.  So what I’m just saying,
ladies and gentlemen, we have worked very hard on this bill to bring all
parties together. Senator Nesbitt does have some good points but it s a
new day. I would appreciate your support on this bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Any further discussion or debate? Senator Barringer,
for what purpose do you rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGE} To speak on the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Senator Barringer has the floor to speak a second
time.]
[SPEAKER CHANGE] I would like to share and clarify that this bill’s
intention is not to trip up the local folks who are trying hard to
deliver mental health services. The bill really provides three
standards. One is that these organizations have to remain solvent.
Number two, these organizations have to pay the providers that are
spending special services and time on the mentally ill so that they can
continue to provide those services. And finally, that these
organizations must comply with Federal law, less we as a state be
penalized by the feds for their misdoings. I certainly support the local
organizations. I hope that they are able to comply with these three very
simple basic business requirements. But my job here is to protect those
that cannot speak for themselves, the vulnerable. And I think those
three standards are not too much to ask of the folks that are delivering
those services. I do appreciate your support. Thank you, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER] And further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question
for the Senate is the passage of the Committee Substitute Senate Bill
208 as admitted on its second reading. All in favor vote aye. Opposers
vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. The clerk will

316 the clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate bill 316 pre-trial
release, rebuttal, resumption. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick is
recognized to explain the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  This is a pretty
straightforward bill it came to Durham delegation from Mayor Bill Bell
our Mayor over in Durham. As unanimous support of city council,  the
unanimous support of our county commissioners, and Durham crime cabinet.
It's pretty straightforward what it basically says if there is a person
who was charged with a crime involving a gun related offense such as
illegal use, possession or discharge of a firearm if that person is on
pre-trial release or if that person has been convicted of a similar type
crime within five years it gives the magistrate, the district court
judge, the superior court judge the opportunity to increase that
person's bond. What we have seen is kind of a revolving door with many
people involving gun related offenses who are coming back and getting
out on relatively minimal bonds in many instances. I request your
support for the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any discussion or
debate.  Hearing none. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Apodaca for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Send forth an excuse. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator you can send forth your
excuse. Is there any further discussion or debate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Senator McKissick would answer a question
please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick, could
explain in a little more detail what this bill actually does? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Sure, what it essentially does at this point in time,
magistrates are in some instances allowing people out on relatively low
bonds, it does not take into consideration say of setting those bonds
where that person is being charged with a firearms type related offense,
illegal use or possession of a firearm, doesn't take into account
whether they might have been at that present time charged with an
offense that has not yet gone to trial, so in that instance they call
that pre-trial release so if somebody is out at the point in time on
bond for whatever the charge might be, it might be a gun related offense
or if they have been convicted within that five year period of a similar
type charge it gives the opportunity for the magistrate, the district
court judge, the superior court judge to take those factors into
consideration and setting perhaps a higher bond because of that person's
unique history, we've gotten, I'm aware of no opposition to the bill
whatsoever. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ??? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Goolsby for what purpose
do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] See if the bill sponsor would be willing
to answer a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick I know that
we set bonds in criminal cases to assure that someone will show up, to
make sure that if there is a person who might do harm to the community,
themselves or destroy evidence that we're able to set a cash bond
otherwise under our state law, you're supposed to be given an unsecured
bond. Is there any other case that you are aware of other than this new
law that you have put forward to us that in any way restricts and sets
up new ground rules for people put on bonds? [SPEAKER CHANGES] There are
similar type provisions underneath law today in creating the same type
of rebuttable presumptions, I know when the J2 committee, we were able
to go through several of those which were identified by Harold Pell, I
don't have all that information together before me today but certainly
be willing to share it with you after today's session. There is
precedence for it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President, I just
object to third reading. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion or
debate. Hearing none the question for the Senate is the passage of the
committee substitute Senate bill 316 on it's second reading, all in
favor will vote &quot;aye&quot; all opposed will vote &quot;no.&quot;
Five seconds will be allowed for the voting. The Clerk will record the
vote. Tucker &quot;aye&quot;, Barefoot &quot;aye&quot;, 48 having voted
in the affirmative and zero in the negative committee substitute senate
bill 316 passes it's second reading and with objection of Senator
Goolsby will be placed on the calendar. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We have a concurrence bill up next Senate
bill 33. The clerk will read.</p>

It makes the effective date July the first as opposed to upon enactment.
