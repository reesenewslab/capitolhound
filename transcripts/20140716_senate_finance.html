That mike is on now.  Okay, would everyone take a seat so that we can
have the finance committee come to order.
First part, let's introduce our pages:
Michela Alred, did I pronounce that right? Mikela, sorry, thank you.  We
appreciate you here.
Sophie Headings, thank you for being here.
Jordan Raglin, thank you Jordan.
Ruth Parsons, appreciate you being here.
Candice Brown, thank you Candice.
Michalya Smith, did I pronounce that properly?  Thank you.
Autumn Fulton, over there.  Thank you for being here.
And Aaron Ray.
All right, we appreciate very much our pages.  I hope that this time at
the general assembly is rewarding.  The good news is we get the best and
the brightest of North Carolinians here and we thank you for helping us
move the general assembly forward.
Sergeant-at-arms who've been very instrumental in helping us organize,
get the room set up and make sure we can have timely meetings:  Ernie
Cheryl, Ken Kirby, Steve McKay and Ed Kessler.  Thank you folks.  We
appreciate it.
All right, members of the committee, we do have a lot of work ahead of
us, so let's get started with the house bill 1245 Pleasant Garden
Annexation.  Representative, you're going to take care of that?  Senator
Wade.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good afternoon everyone.  This is merely, Pleasant Garden has a
gentleman there that had a farm when he was a young man.  His father's
since passed away and he's trying to put his farm back together and buy
up the property and a small part of it needs to be re-annexed into the
city of Pleasant Garden.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.  Senator Wade, we do have Senator Tillman giving a favorable
report on house bill 1245.  Any other questions or comments members of
the committee?  Seeing none, all in favor please say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed nay, aye's have it.  Thank you Senator Wade and I'll trust that
you'll manage that on the floor for us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.  Thank you Mr. Chairman.  ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you ma'am, we appreciate that very much.  All right, Senator
Rabin, senate bill 101; special license plates.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir.  ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.  Yes, sir.  Senator Rabin makes a motion to replace house bill 101
with a PCS for discussion.  All in favor please say aye...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All opposed nay.  Aye's have it.  Senator Rabin, would you please
enlighten us on house bill 101?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  One of my favorite subjects has to do with
license plate and thank goodness this is a bill that is going to make
special plates in North Carolina uniform.  Easy for everyone, fair for
everyone, and it's going to clear up a lot of the muddy water that we
have had over the years in just how we go about doing this,
accomplishing this.  What it does is, we're trying to make a transparent
process for the addition of and consideration of new license plates and
specialty plates.  And, we looked at several states... we looked at
Virginia, we looked at Florida, we looked at Georgia and see how they
did that.  We modeled a program after that.  We've worked with the
Department of Motor Vehicles and other agencies to see just where the
snags are and what we can do to improve, and we think we've done that.
Thing that you're interested in - there are no new fees.  The general
assembly, the members, have the same discretion that they have now.
But, what we're doing is, we're simply using a process that didn't work
too well.  It was a back-end process and folks wanting a special plate
and organizations really didn't know how to do it.  They came to the
legislators, the legislators didn't know how to do it, and so now we're
putting something in place that everyone goes to DMV, they're given
online, they can be shown, walk through the steps, the people at DMV, in
an effort to be more friendly to customers, can help them with the
process.  They have the hoops that they jump through, and by the time it
gets to the general assembly it's all done and we just have an up or
down vote and everyone gets their plate as they want.  They sent their
qualifications and what have you are the same and reasonable.  The fees
are still $10.  It's just a front-end proposition rather than a back...</p>

[Speaker changes.] ... in proposition, people will be required to get a
legislator to sponsor them. They will just simply go to DMV, if they
have a special plate they want for three hundred... people are required,
they sign up...they're obligated.  Then their representative or senator
runs the bill.  They get their plate.  DMV sends them their plate and
it's done.  If it's a special background plate, then they're five
hundred. Just like now.
[Speaker changes.] So no new tricks, it's just an easy...
[Speaker changes.] an easy way to solve a complex problem.
[Speaker changes.] Alright, I've got Senator Tillman for a question.
[Speaker changes.] More than a question, Senator Rabin, this is good
work. We've had a convoluted process for some time now and John
Carvey???? is not responsible for it. He couldn't explain it. Remember,
you tried...sitting right up there...for several years?
[Speaker changes.] Indeed.
[Speaker changes.] So I think that we've got a simplified system, makes
you go ahead and get the registrations and so forth...if you want them
paid for in advance before you get the plate...and I think that's a
change...and I like what you're tryin' to do...standardize the
background and the plates. And the process.
[Speaker changes.] We'll hold that for a moment.  Senator Cook? Could
you get up to your microphone, sir?
[Speaker changes.] I'll try.  I's just lookin' for the cost of this.  I
haven't seen any numbers in here. I didn't read it thoroughly tho'.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Chairman?
[Speaker changes.] Yes sir. The cost is the same.  It's currently $10
per plate.
[Speaker changes.] That's to DMV?
[Speaker changes.] You have your normal plate fee plus $10 for special
plates. Now the organization can add to that but that goes to the
organization.  That does not go to DMV or the state.
[Speaker changes.] Follow up??  Yes sir.
[Speaker changes.] I'm just tryin' to understand from the state's point
of view, does this cost us more money to produce these various...and is
it a significant amount?
[Speaker changes.] Actually, no.  There's a fiscal note with this that
shows basically nothing that came with it.  And revenue laws, Senator
Cook, is going to be looking at...really, these are the hard costs.
We're going to be looking at the soft costs in the next session...or in
the interim, revenue laws is going to look at that...just to see
...because we want to know too.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Rabin, could we have staff to help us.  If
Brian would give us some assistance.
[Speaker changes.] We do. But Brice's ????????????
[Speaker changes.] Brice Paul???? of Physical Research.  Senator Cook,
to your question?  The fees are maintained at the current standard ten
dollar fee and that fee would then be credited to the Special
Registration Plate Account, from which the cost of production and
administration would be deducted.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Cook?
[Speaker changes.] Thank you...but we don't know what those costs are.
[Speaker changes.] Well, I think the point is that they're going to be
the same as they've always been and there's going to be a study to
determine if indeed there's some additional hard and soft costs on
producing these plates.  And the study will report back to the General
Assembly to handle that cost.  Am I correct, Senator Rabin?
[Speaker changes.] You're correct.
[Speaker changes.] Let me..okay...Senator Hise.
[Speaker changes.] Just to make sure and clarify anytime these license
plate bills come up.  This has no impact on currently issued
plates...full colored plates...specifically those around the Blue Ridge
Parkway or the Smoky Mountains?
[Speaker changes.] Believe me, Senator Hise, as long as I live, I will
never tread on that again. (Laughter.)
[Speaker changes.] Other questions members of the committee?  Senator
Tucker?
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chairman. I heard the
background...I know at times, you, Mister Chairman, have alluded to the
fact that all these different colored plates cause confusion for highway
patrol and other law enforcement officials.  How does this resolve that
issue?
[Speaker changes.] Senator Rabin, you wanna' answer that one?
[Speaker changes.] Smoky the Bear would be answering it.  No, sir, I
don't.  I would love to sidestep that one if I may. (Laughing.)
[Speaker changes.]It really does nothing to solve that problem. That was
a vote last year that many of us lost. We're not going to tangle with
that one again. So, it does nothing to resolve that issue of confusion.
Follow up?
[Speaker changes.] So Senator. Yes sir, follow up.  So what you're
sayin' is Senator Hise and the mountain folks won.
[Speaker changes.] Yes sir, that is accurate. For the
moment...(Chuckles.) Senator McKissick?
[Speaker changes.] Yes Senator.  I just wanna' get some clarification
cause I see the categories here which have been established for tags and
I guess we got forty-seven of them and there's been all this controversy
of ...</p>

the choose life plate that was authorized and, of course, there was a
counter ? one that provided a different perspective. In the future, how
will this process be followed through so that if somebody wants a plate
that articulates a different perspective, other than choose life, and I
want to know the extent to which it will change that process so that it
will be less subject to political considerations when votes along those
lines are taken? If we have an applicant who wants that and they’ve got
the required signatures does that mean that they get that plate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator McKissick. May I answer that? If I stumble, I’ll ask
staff to help.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, Senator Rabin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, under the process that we are outlining, everyone
will be treated the same. Everyone will be treated with transparency.
They will go to the DMV, if they jump through the hoops and meet the
qualifications, which they have to meet today, and are approved then
that will come to the general assembly for an up or down vote, as long
as they have a representative or senator that wishes to sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Quick follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If an applicant goes through that process it would still be subject to
the vote of the general assembly, as to whether they issue the tag or
not?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My answer to that is yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. That is correct, senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would simply ask to perhaps give some consideration to making certain
that, when these tags come up, if they get a DoT sign-off, and it’s
appropriate free speech, that perhaps we don’t have all of this coming
back up before the general assembly for votes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator McKissick. Senator Tillman, you have a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir. I would like to address Senator McKissick on that point.
Senator, do you want somebody other than the general assembly doing our
work for us? You think it’s a political process and you’re saying that
since you can’t get your plate--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m asking him a question. Senator, you’re saying this is a political
process?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What I’m saying is that--
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me. Everything is through the Chair. What is your question to the
Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My question is to Senator McKissick. Let me take that back. I’ll just
make a comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A comment would be great.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If we want to elect different people, Senator McKissick, maybe we can do
that and get your license plate but, right now, it’s our job to approve
these plates in this committee and in the general assembly, and I don’t
think we need DoT deciding whether the plate’s appropriate or not. I
think that’s our job and I think that’s the way we need to do this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Any other questions? Before we go on to accept the motion, I
would like to say that since Senator Apodaca is not here maybe Senator
Rabin would love to make a motion that we move license plates away from
Finance and move it to Rules for future consideration.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would do that only in the presence of Senator Apodaca.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Only in his presence. Okay. Ladies and gentlemen of the committee, we
have a motion from Senator Tillman for a favorable report for House Bill
101 PCS and that is the motion before us. All in favor please say aye,
the opposing say nay. Ayes have it. Senator Rabin, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Moving forward. House Bill 1033, Special Assessment/Dam Repair. Senator
McLaurin. This is not a PCS so you have the bill before you, Senator
McLaurin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. This is a
very simple dam bill. There’s no opposition to this dam bill and, in
short, I’ll just say it’s a very good dam bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that’s a quite nice explanation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As it states very clearly, it authorizes the county to impose a special
assessment for repairs of a dam. This is requested by the Board of
County Commissioners unanimously. No opposition. I would welcome any
questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McLaurin, Senator Hise has made a motion for a favorable report
for House Bill 1033 Special Assessment/Dam Repair. Any additional
questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tucker, question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McLaurin, is this a dam tax?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, can I answer that question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’re welcome to try.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir. This is not a--this is a dam assessment.

The motion, do you have a motion before you for favorable report? On
house bill 1033. All in favor please say aye. Opposed nay. Aye’s have
it, thank you Senator McLaurin and you’ll take care of that on the
floor, am I correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Alright, let’s go on to house bill 1224 JMAC development fund
modifications, that is a PCS Senator Rabin makes a motion that we accept
PCS for house bill 1224 for consideration. All in favor please say aye.
Opposed nay. Aye’s have it. Senator Gunn, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair and good to see everyone. I think this is a damn
good bill too Senator McLaurin, just for the record. It’s great to be up
here and I’m glad I have the privilege to do two things that we have
talked about since we’ve been down here and two things that are very
near and dear to all of us. And that is, how we improve education in our
public schools, and how do we do economic development to better create
jobs and improve our economy. And in front of you today in house bill
1224 we’re going to make great moves and very productive moves to do
both of those.
What I’m going to do first is just quickly summarize, and really it’s
from your summary to be quite honest with you, but part one of this PCS
is going to create a new local sales option and use tax at a rate of a
half percent, to be used by the counties for school construction,
retirement of ??, classroom teacher salaries and supplements, TA
salaries, and ?? potential support of community colleges this would be
at their discretion. It would be limited to a subtle sales and tax use
rate of two and a half percent. Just for the record, all counties now
have the ability to tax at two and a half percent. Not all of them have
taken advantage of this. What it will do in a nutshell is offer
flexibility that I think is needed on the local level to make some of
these decisions that could be important for their investment in their
schools on a local level, and it will level the playing field also so
that all counties are playing under the same rules with the same cap of
two and a half percent on their tax.
Part two, three, and four are going to do, are all economic development
engines and I think they’re very needed and I’ll be glad to go into
detail in a few minutes. Part two of the PCS will expand the eligibility
criteria for the JMAC fund. Part three will create a job catalyst fund
that will be administered solely by the department of commerce and
secretary. And part four would provide just until the end of fifteen for
this ?? an additional 14 million in JDIGG that is just a one time 14
million increase. Now to save you the misery of having me trying to
explain section one, and being that it’s above my pay scale, I’m going
to turn to our competent staff to go over section one and I will return
and give you the summary of sections two, three, and four. And with
that, I believe I will be calling on
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, Ms. Griffin, would you please kindly explain section one of
that bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure, and you have a summary and if you look on the second to last page
it just gives you a snapshot of the universe as it is right now, and it
might be helpful to see the various authorities that counties have to
levy a local options sales tax right now and what the rates are in the
various counties. So you’ll see that on the summary, at the top it says
background. Right now all counties, as you know, currently levy a two
percent local sales tax that can be used for general purposes. And then,
all counties also have the ability to levy a quarter cent under Article
46 that may also be used for general purposes. And then the other piece
of this puzzle is the Article 43, which is a local sales and use tax for
public transportation and the rate varies among the counties. There are
six counties, Mecklenburg, Durham</p>
  

  <h3>20:00</h3>
  <h3><audio src="audio/chunks/20140716_senate_finance.20.00.mp3" preload="none" controls></audio></h3>
  <h4><a href="https://requester.mturk.com/bulk/workers/A2SIK6OPLLY79J">Worker</a> | <a href="https://requester.mturk.com/mturk/manageHIT?HITId=3D17ECOUODUDI67OEF3CIBLEC7E31L&amp;viewableEditPane=manageHIT_downloadResults">HIT</a></h4>

<p id="20:00">
that can levy a transportation tax at half a cent, and the remaining 94
counties can only levy a quarter cent. So the first thing that this bill
does is bring those 94 counties up to the half cent under the Public
Transportation article, so that they're sort of all on the same playing
field. And then, the next thing it does is allow counties to choose to
use that half cent toward public transportation, or there's new
authorization to put that half cent toward public education. And the
purposes are spelled out on page 2 of the ??, lines 17 through 27. It
can be for school construction or to retire indebtedness for school
construction, for the salaries of classroom teachers or classroom
teacher assistants, or to supplement classroom teachers' salaries. It
can also be used for community colleges, and that authority is fairly
broad, that could be construction, maintenance, personnel. So the
restrictions or limitations on the use of the local sales and use tax
for either transportation or education is that counties would be able to
levy one or the other, but not both, and the rate at which it can be
levied would either be a quarter cent or a half cent, and it would
depend on what the total local rate is in the county at the time they're
holding the referendum. For example, if a county is currently levying 2%
local sales tax, then the referendum would have to be at a half cent.
Whether for transportation or education, it would be a half cent. If
you're at a county that's already at 2 and a quarter, because you're
levying the Article 46 quarter cent, then you could only levy a quarter
cent for the transportation or education. And then also, just to mention
there is, with regard to, so overall the bill provides that in no case
can a county levy a local sales and use tax in excess of 2 and a half
percent, so it sort of creates an overall cap. However, it grandfathers-
we have two counties currently that are in excess of that cap, and that
would be Durham and Orange, because they levy both the Transit Tax, the
half cent Transit Tax, as well as the quarter cent. So this makes a
provision for them. However, if Durham or Orange were to at any time
repeal one of those taxes, they would then fall back under the 2 and a
half percent cap that everyone else is subject to. The other thing that
this does in Sections 1.2 and 1.3, this relates to giving the Board of
County Commissioners the authority to direct how the funds coming from
the tax on education would be directed. In other words, under current
law, the Board of Education submits its budget to the county, and then
the county approves that and appropriates the funds. But right now,
counties are limited to allocating funds at sort of a high broad
category level, one of which of those categories is Instructional
Services, but that includes more than just teacher salaries, it would
include textbooks and things like that. So the purpose of this language
is to allow the Board of County Commissioners to specifically allocate
the proceeds coming from the education tax for this specific purpose as
identified in the bill, which would be the classroom teacher salaries or
teacher assistant salaries. So that's what Sections 1.2 and 1.3 do. And
Mr. Chair, I think that generally covers the overall mechanics of Part
1, but I'd be happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sen. Gunn, would you come up and then we'll see if the
committee members have any questions regarding Section 1 of House Bill
124. Representative of the committee. No questions on Section 1. Excuse
me, Sen. McKissick, how are you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Doing fine, sir. And I guess this is for Trina, I
guess you want to make sure, Trina. So for Durham and Orange, we already
have that half cent authority, that does not change the way that could
be used, well for the other 96 counties, I guess, that are out there,
you're saying that they will now have an either or option as to
transportation or education, or some mix of the two, I would assume, or
just one or the other? Is that right, Trina?</p>

<p id="25:00">
[0:00:00.0]
Senator McKenzie, it is one or the other and you are correct for
adjournment Orange since they are already over and above the cap it
doesn’t effect what they are currently levying but for other counties
they would opt for the education or the transportation and I guess one I
did forget to mention one thing which is the article 46 quarter cent,
the bill provides that no county may hold a referendum to levy that tax
on or after August 1st of this year except for two counties that have it
on the November ballot whose rate is currently less than 2.5% because
that would be consistent with them being under the cap. So, there is
sense that on the article 46 quarter cent tax only for those counties
who haven’t levied it. The 27 counties that have it and levy it may
continue to levy it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Quick follow up Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, what I’m understanding is that kind of response to a question which
is in back in my mind, this is simply gonna be levied excuse me they can
ask to whether you will go either with the transportation or using it
for public schools to be less slowly with a County Commissioner except
for the counties in which a referendum is already schedule to occur,
Trina…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The decision would be the board of County Commissioners would decide
whether to hold a referendum on the question of the public
transportation tax or the tax for education?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Senator Daniel.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I was just wondering if staff could email this
spreadsheet to the committee members that…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that one the website…Would you please send it Daniel?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just the PDF so we could share with their counties just…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The spreadsheet…
[Background Conversations]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Or the fiscal note, yes and actually that fiscal note has been updated
it is on the website now, okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That assumes that can convert a website into a PDF and…
[Chuckles]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, alright, I have got Senator Blue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yell if the County Commissioner Association taking a position on this…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We will allow them to speak on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, that was just interested in it Mr. Chairman because I know that
there are discussions going on in my county on doing as Orange and
Durham have done with respect to the transportation tax basically to
expand different options for transportation and I will be interested on
this at some point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you we will allow that. As a matter of fact what we will do is ask
sergeant alarms to put a list up there for people who would like to
speak on this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, Senator McLaurin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, just again clarification, one of the counties in
my district has already authorized a referendum to increase sales tax by
quarter percent for economic development. They have already authorized
that it will be on the ballot in November. So, they are okay with what
they have done to this point by having already authorized it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Which counties…?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s Richmond County.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Richmond. Is it under 2.5?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, it’s in the extent their total rate is under 2.5 right now. And
yeah, they are scheduled to be on the November ballot, they could
proceed with the referendum.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, I have got Senator Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, Senator Gunn why wouldn’t we allow if a county
is at 2% and they can go up to a half cent more to 2.5%, why would we
allow them to that if they choose to designate a quarter to education
and a quarter to transportation? Why must it necessarily be all one or
other?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator Stein, we think that, we really wanna try to make a
commitment emphasizing education and we think that having it at one half
percent and allowing, supposed to be made is the appropriate avenue to
take, there was little discussion but we do for like that is the best
avenue to take on this particular bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think probably part of that answer would also isn’t that we are not,
we are looking not to have a tax increase on this so that’s why…

2.5%.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up question. If the thought is that counties have the ability to
bring up to their people referendum to get up to 2.5% not exceed 2.5%
and they have both transportation and education needs, and they put it
to the people for that purpose, I’m confused as to why we would not
allow the counties to have what they want for how they operate their
government and I just didn’t hear the answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Gunn, did you hear that? Respond to his question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would say also that Senator Stein will answer a
question ? but I do think that we are wanting to see if you’re going to
do and what to invest in the transportation we’d like you to go ahead
and make that decision. If you want to invest in education we’d like you
to go ahead and make that decision so we think that this is the best
application in this case.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tucker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Probably a question for Ms. Griffin. Help me,
back when we transferred Medicaid to the state, there was a quarter
percent sweetener, if you will, given to the counties. Is that a correct
statement?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator I believe you are referring to the Article 46.  There was
actually another article, the actual Medicaid swap was under Article 44,
whereas the state sales tax increased as the amount to the counties
under Article 44 decreased until it was an even swap. But at the same
time and in that same budget bill the Article 46 as you mentioned was an
additional quarter percent for counties.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So with that quarter percent  there was a broad flexibility for the
counties to be able to use that money for whatever they needed to. Does
passage of this bill supplant that ability for flexibility? For instance
we got one county that used it because they were ?? court house.  And
they used that money to build a court house and now we’re saying that
can’t be used, help me with that. Just, I need clarity on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure. So there are 27 counties that currently levy that quarter percent.
That quarter percent may be used for any general lawful purpose and this
bill would not change that for those counties. But other counties who
have not, that don’t levy the tax would not be able to levy that tax
under this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right seeing any additional questions?  Done. Okay well that’s
Section 1. Would you proceed forward with, lets do it one at a time, 2,
3 and 4.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Me?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair.  Section 2 is going to deal with some JMAC
modifications. As ya’ll know, 2007 JMAC was formed and so the purpose
was to maintain jobs in our state. I’m not going to go over what the
dynamics are in that previous bill but it was limited to 69 million and
6 million dollars on an annual cost.  What the PCS will do is it will
grant for large employers the following modifications. First it’ll allow
that large manufacturers that are investing to enhance their pollution
controls are transitioning from coal to natural gas they will now be
available.  Secondly, it lowers the investment threshold for these
companies from 69 to 50 million. Third change is it will increase the
investment time from 3 to 5 years. And finally it’ll allow large
manufacturer employers that are in  Tier 2 to participate if population
is less than 60,000 as a 7113 and the manufacturer employs at least 800
employees as full time at the project and maintains that level
throughout the term. To give you an explanation on why we’d like to do
this what we’re finding out now is this. We’re getting federal
regulations coming down that are forcing employers in our state to
choose between investing in their operations or shutting down their door
and I think that we would all agree whatever we can do may</p>

These modifications to retain jobs should be our number one emphasis and
therefore, the Jaymac will serve this purpose and I'd like to have your
support on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the commitee, this is a bill that we in the Senate have
already passed and back to the house, and my recollection is that it was
passed unanimously, I think, earlier in the session, so you've seen this
bill. Are there any questions on section two? See, none. Section three,
Senator Gunn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. Personally I'm real excited about this being added
and being considered today. It's being titled the &quot;Job Catalyst
Fund&quot;. Today and moving forward, I've had a lot of discussion with
the Secretary of Commerce and to be quite candid with you, she's doing a
great job. We've got opportunities out there, and what we're seeing in
the economy is we've got a window of probably the next five years where
we're going to have a real opportunity for some significant jobs and
some very, very large employers. But, she's missing a big tool in her
toolbox, and what the job catalyst fund will do is provide her what I
think is a much-needed tool so that she can go out and close deals.
Let's close these deals. This'll give her the opportunity to compete
nationally and internationally for high quality jobs that we so, so
want. Now, it will be- the Job Catalyst Fund- by the way, this is
strictly a framework. We are not talking about an appropriation today.
We are trying to establish a framework moving forward and that will come
at a later time. First of all, let me let you know it will be solely at
the discrestion of the secretary. She needs and we need for her to have
that flexibility when it comes to closing deals, and this will give her,
in fact, that. Now, as you will see, there are a lot of benchmarks that
are required to be made to even be eligible or for her to have the right
to go out and pursue companies. Based on whether you're in tier one,
tier two, or tier three, minimum jobs is 500, 800, and 1200,
respectfully. Same thing, whether you're in tier one, tier two, or three
will dictate whether the project is to be a 20, a 35, or a 50 million
dollar investment. There also is a wage requirement. If you're in tier
one and tier two, your wage requirement will be 100 percent of the
average wage for all insured property employers in the county. If you're
in tier three, your requirement will bump to 110 percent. You must
provide health insurance and you, of course, need to have your tax debts
paid and be in compliance with any regulatory like ??. Now, the local
governments must participate. We've had a lot of dialogue on this but I
think that it is critical that we have a commitment from our local
governments to participate. That participation rate will be as follows:
if you are in tier one, three percent of the investment will need to
come from that county. Tier two, it'll be a six percent, six dollars for
every hundred invested on the state, and if you're in their three
that'll be nine percent. They can be used to acquire and improve land,
infrastructure, facility development, capital investment, and for other
manufacturing products.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Gunn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would you ask him a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, thank you. Senator Gunn, would you care for a glass of water?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm great, yes. It's been a big day.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May we open it up for questions on section three? Senator Brown, yes
sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just a comment. I think this fund would put us
in position to compete with other states such as what South Carolina's
doing now. South Carolina has a similar fund as this.</p>

for the Commerce Secretary and the Governor can make a quick decision on
some of these projects and time's important on a lot of these projects
so it just gets us in the game on competing with those other states.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Ford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman.  Senator Gunn, how, and I
think I heard you, you said you're not going to talk about any
appropriations at this time but if you are how are you proposing we
capitalize this fund?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Gunn, would you like to respond to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm not sure  I can but it is an appropriation matter
and I do not think that that is decided.  I think we were going to get
with, from a practical matter, we're going to get with the Commerce
Secretary to see what number may work for her. I will have to, I'm not
sure Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Ford, we're getting the framework in place and
at some point it'll have to be appropriated from the General Revenue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] She'll find the funds.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Next question is, can you talk, Senator Gunn, about
taxpayer protections as it relates to the framework then about this
fund, making sure that we protect taxpayer money?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I tell you what.  If you could hold on that and let us
do the JDIG and let us go through that for a minute and let me come back
to the protection if I can.  Okay?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Ford, just to maybe be of assistance.  It will
have the same guidelines and protections as the JDIG fund does with ???
and everything.  Any additional questions on Section 3?  Seeing none,
Section 4.  Senator Gunn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, JDIG modifications.  We have spent a lot of time
with the Secretary.  Here's the good news. The good news is she's out
there churning up opportunities for us and some of them she has
commitments and some of them she feels that she will get commitments.
An issue has come with the fact that the JDIG allocation goes to 2015
and if we and if she is successful and we are fortunate enough to have
her be successful, which I am betting on the Secretary, then we are
going to be in a position where we're not going to have a tool because
we will not have those funds available. So what we want to do in this
JDIG modification is that we want to increase the JDIG cap commitment to
an additional $14 million and this is a one-time commitment and it will
run through the 2013-15 fiscal biennium. Also there is, as you may know,
in Section 4.b there is a JDIG requirement as to cost benefit analysis
to determine whether a JDIG award is appropriate.  What we want to do in
this so you do know this is the PSC would allow disregarding of the cost
associated with the awarding of the JDIG as relates to the job catalyst
fund.  The job catalyst fund will be outside what is the cost benefit
ratio for the JDIG grant. I'll be glad to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Before we go with questions on that, Senator Ford,
would you provide some additional background on Senator Ford's question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Ford, the bill does provide that if the
company does not maintain the minimum requirements for the greater of
ten years or the life of the grant plus five years then they have to
repay the amount equal to the disbursement of the fund to the local
government unit.  The local government unit in turn would remit that
back into the job catalyst fund.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.  Is that going to be done annually?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The reporting would be done annually.  Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the Committee, we need to backtrack for
just a moment to clear up section 3.  Section 4 is before you.  Senator
Gunn has done a very good job explaining it.  We have staff available to
help and assist with any questions.  Are there questions on Section 4?
Seeing none, let's go ahead and we have two speakers assigned.  Joanna
Reiss from the North Carolina Association of County Commissioners.  Ms.
Reiss identify yourself, your title, and you have two minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.  Joanna Reiss with the Association of
County Commissioners, Director of Government Relations.  While we
appreciate the attention to and conversation surrounding local revenue
needs we do have some concerns about how this current legislation is
structured, particularly the piece that is actually some loss of
flexibility in the use of the funds. This is a rather large change to be
making so</p>

Quickly, perhaps the committee and the general assembly would consider
sending this concept to a revenue laws to study as a potential piece of
a more comprehensive tax reform package. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I have one other speaker and I hope I
pronounce it properly, Erin Wynia from the League of Municipalities.
Erin would you pleas identify yourself and your title.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure thing. Thank you Mr. Chair. My name is Erin
Wynia, I am a legislative and regulatory issues manager at the League of
Municipalities. And thank you for the opportunity to speak today. This
is the first time that we've seen this language so I will offer very
brief comments. I haven't had a lot of time to digest it yet. Like the
county association we do appreciate the attention to the needs of local
governments to have local option revenues. What we worry about with this
particular proposal is the effect it could have on regions to raise
funds for transportation. Those are usually levied at the county level
and obviously affect the cities within. So we do ask for your further
consideration in a study I think would be an appropriate place for that
to happen. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Very fine. All speakers that have been [??], members
of the committee any additional questions or comments?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise, you have a motion? All right Senator
Hise sends forward a motion for favor report on house bill 1224 PCS, and
unfavorable to the original bill. And with that all in favor please say
aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Oppose, nay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye's have it. Senate bill 763, Senator Reagan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are we gonna do...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh excuse me, I'm sorry. Ladies and gentleman that is
our technical and corrections bill and we have some additions that are
going to be made to that. we're going to go ahead and postpone that one
for today and we will take that up tomorrow in finance. Do we have our
scheduled time yet? Stay tuned to the time, in finance we will bring
that forward tomorrow. And if there are no other comments or questions
through the committee this finance committee is adjourned.</p>
