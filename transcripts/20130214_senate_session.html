Senate will come to order. Sargent in Arms will close the doors. Members
will go to their seats. Memebers and guests in the gallery will please
silence all electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer is Reverend
Peter Milner, Senate chaplain. All members and guests in the gallery
will please stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Almighty God, how deep your love for us. How vast beyond all measure.
That you should give your only Son to make a wretch His treasure. We
come to you today Lord, we often find ourselves not able to live in this
truth, and so we begin to fear the wrong things. Think we have to get
ourselves togehther before you're going to love us. We can get stuck as
people, but Lord, would you give us something we cannot produce
ourselves? Would you give us your love and your grace? Help us to fear
you. Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Increase our awe, our
reference and our delight and you. And may that amazement and
draw-dropped admiration and glory drive us. May it help us communicate
with one another. May I help us forgive one another across the aisle.
May it drive us on this day, Valentine's, and may you drive us
throughout the session. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator berger is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr President. The journal of Wednesday, February 13, 2013 has
been examined and is found to be correct. I move that we dispense with
the reading of the journal, and that it stand approved as written.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Without objection, the journal for February 13th stands approved as
written.
Leaves of absence are granted for senators Brown, Woodard and Meredith.
Senators we have a nurse of the day and a doctor of the day with us. Our
doctor of the day is Dr. John Ebert from Charlotte, NC. Dr. Ebert if you
would stand up please. And our nurse of the day is Audrey Neal from
Durham, North Carolina. Thank you for your service.
Ratification of bills the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Enrolled bills: Enrolling clerk reports the following bills dually
ratified for presentation to the governor. Senate bill 14: An act to
direct the State Board of Education to develop career and college
endorsements for high school diplomas, increase access to career and
technical education teachers in public schools, to work with the State
Board of community colleges to increase the number of students enrolled
in career and technical education and high need employment areas. House
Bill 4: An act to address the unemployment insurance debt and to focus
North Carolinians, North Carolina's employment insurance programs on
putting claimants back to work.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senators we're going to move on to the calendar for public bills. We
have a Senate Resolution 46 the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate bill 46: Election of UNC Board of Governors
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Apodaca, would you like to explain the resolution?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr President, thank you. I would. We're back at that time every two
years for the Board of Governor's election. We're going to use the same
format we used two years ago for those that were here, and for the new
folks it should be on your desk, and the memo will go through the
procedures. The two items I really want to stress to everyone: next
Friday a week from tomorrow by five o'clock, we must have the
application filed in the clerk's office and the SBI, the ethics report,
has to be to the state board by that time also. Now, the application
cannot be faxed, Senator Allran. It can not be emailed, Senator Allran.
It has to be written and hand delivered, as you believe everything
should be. Thank you. So those are the two main items and I think it's
pretty self explanatory in the memo. I'll go over it more if you'd like.
If you have any questions I'll be happy to ask, but what we hope to have
is a slate of 16 to bring forth for voting. So, that's what we have now.
I'll be happy to answer any questions, Mr President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Is there any further question or debate? Hearing ?? the
question for the body is</p>

to the members that we are going to convene on Monday evening at 6:30
and the reason for that is to allow us time to line up and make sure
that we’re all in straight lines and ready to go to the joint session
for the State of the State Address. That’ll be Monday night. I just
wanted to remind everyone. With that, Mr. President, I move that the
Senate do now adjourn, subject to the introduction of bills and
resolutions, the receipt and referral of committee reports, the receipt
of messages from the House and the governor, and the reading of
senatorial statements, to reconvene Monday, February 18th, 2013 at 6:30
p.m.

stated by Senator Berger, to reconvene Monday, February 18th at 6:30
