  Is the House for [??] . Thank you. [Alarm sounds] [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Everyone can view these for about two minutes. It would not be a good
thing to start early because then all of our proceedings would probably
be invalid today. Members will take their seats. Visitors will retire
from the chamber. The sergeant will close the door. Members and visitors
will please silence all electronic devices. The prayer will be offered
by Representative Holley. Members and guests in the gallery will please
stand and remain standing for the pledge of allegiance. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Good morning. Before I get into the prayer, I would like to
read a little daily meditation. It&#39;s called I Must Go Shopping. I
think the women can relate to this one. I must go shopping. I&#39;m
completely out of generosity and want to get some. I also want to
exchange the self-satisfaction that I picked up the other day for some
real humility. They say it wears better. I want to look for tolerance,
which is worn as a wrap this season. I saw some samples of kindness and
I&#39;m a little low on that right now. One can&#39;t get too much of
it. I must try to match some patience. I saw it on the frame and it was
so becoming. I must remember to get my sense of humor mended and keep my
eyes open for some inexpensive goodness. Yes, I must go shopping today.
Let us pray. Dear Lord, thank you for giving us another day. Please
bless our families, friends, community, state and country. We&#39;re
here today as legislators with a purpose and a mission. Lawmaking is an
awesome responsibility. We know you understand because you have given us
the best laws to live by. They&#39;re called the ten commandments. Help
us follow your lead to fulfill this responsibility with integrity,
character and unselfish love for the people we serve. Please be with
each other this [??] in our hearts and spirits as we make sometimes very
difficult decisions. Help us keep your commandments and laws as an
example of how and why we should do our jobs, with real humility,
tolerance, kindness, patience, and yes, some unexpected, inexpensive
goodness. Thank you, Lord, for all you do. In Jesus&#39; name I pray.
Amen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Amen. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the
United States of America and to the republic for which it stands. One
nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
