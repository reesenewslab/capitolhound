Officer hearing to simply allow the superintendent to make use of the
designee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Blackwell. Do we have any questions? Do we have
a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh, we have a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. Over here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Adams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chair. A question for the bill sponsor. You mentioned
that the superintendent could designate, who would likely be designated?
At what level, would it be an assistant or would it be another classroom
teacher or, can you speak to that a little bit?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The bill does not attempt to specify who the superintendent would
designate. It would be in his or her discretion. My assumption is it
would be probably a personnel, a human resources director, or an
associate superintendent with responsibilities over personnel, but
someone reasonably high up the food chain within the LEA who would have
knowledge of the circumstances involved with the personnel involved in
the particular decision.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Adams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chair. So you mentioned that the Board of Education
would approve it. Now would they do each approval or would this be
something that would be put into the board policy? How would that
appear?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The bill would leave that up to the local board. My expectation is that
the school board would exercise its discretion in each instance based on
its judgment about whether they needed the superintendent personally to
be present for the particular hearing that was being held. But I suppose
that under the wording of the statute, and I'll maybe ask staff if they
agree, that they might could have some sort of policy that in general
they were excused and could use the designee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Cara? Have any remarks?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The bill is fairly straightforward. It doesn't provide any requirements
for policy. It simply would allow the superintendent, if it had the
consent, to appoint a designee, and it doesn't go further than that. If
there was an intent to want to add a policy or other requirements, that
may need to be added into the language.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would say in further, my intent was to basically leave that to the
board and the superintendent to work out between them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just for a motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And we got more questions? If not, this is the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Like to move that we give a favorable report to House bill 896.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You hear the motion. All those in favor. All opposed no.
Congratulations. Now we're going to want to go to House bill 754 and
House bill 903, and we're gonna handle by the, Representative Starnes
and we'll start with House bill 754.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chair, ladies and gentlemen of the committee. House bill
754.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Wait, wait just a minute, I'm sorry, Representative Starnes. I tried to
PCS the other one, and this one really does have a PCS, and
Representative Jeter moves that the PCS be before us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chairman, ladies and gentlemen of the committee. The
proposed committee substitute for House bill 754 would authorize the
community colleges to acquire real property by a lease purchase
agreement. Be authorized by the trustees of the community college, it
would be used, be paid for with local money from the county
commissioners, they would have to agree to it, and it would have an
approval by the local government commission. I urge your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ross?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chairman. I think this is a great bill, and at the
appropriate time I'd like to make a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do we have any more, any questions? If not, it's appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I move that we give House bill 754 a favorable report. Proposed
committee substitute, was that before us though? Yeah, the proposed
committee substitute for House bill 754, a favorable report, unfavorable
as to the original bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You've heard the motion. All those in favor? All opposed? Okay,

Congratulations Representative Starnes. Now we'll go to House Bill 903.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chair. This is a PCS. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Do I have a motion for the PCS to be before us? Representative
Dixon moves. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chair. Ladies and
Gentlemen of the committee. The proposed committee substitute for House
bill 903 UNC and community college credit transfers is a bill to require
the University of North Carolina system to accept college credits
transferring in from our community college system. This transfer into
credits is known as a comprehensive articulation agreement. This bill
was first passed in 1995 by former Representative Robert Grady. 18 years
later, very little progress has been made in getting the university
system to accept community college credits. Currently, English is the
only subject universally accepted by our university system. The original
intent of this legislation was to allow students to take core subjects
such as english, math, science, and history at the community college and
then have these subjects transferred to the university of their choice.
Sadly, this has not happened. Students enroll in courses at our
community colleges with the expectation that these credits will
transfer. Some UNC institutions are accepting these credits while others
are not. We need this articulation agreement to be enforced so that
community college credits are universally accepted. This bill requires a
biannual review of the comprehensive articulation agreement with a
progress report to be made to the joint legislative oversight committee
by November of each year. I will answer any questions and I urge your
support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do we have any questions? Representative
Pittman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion at perfect time. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ross. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chair, I'd like to hear
from a Representative from the UNC system on why this might not be
happening at all the institutions whether there's a reason for it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There is. Is there someone from the university system
that wants to speak on it? Identify yourself please. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you,  Drew Barretts University of North Carolina General
Administration. My understanding is these agreements have been hammered
out over years. There are agreements in place. We hear from time to time
anecdotes that they're not being pursued and agreed upon but we haven't
heard the types of challenges that were mentioned here. We have someone
from the community college that might be able to help and answer that a
little bit better. [SPEAKER CHANGES] May I ask him a follow up, Madam
Chair? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes certainly. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the
University system support this bill? I just want to get a feel. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] We don't have a position on this bill at this point. We
certainly want to say that we are working very well with community
college system on an updated ?? agreement and certainly intend to live
by those ?? agreements that have been made. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brandon and then Representative Michaux. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Starnes. Thank you Madam Chair. Representative
Starnes, I understand the bill because I was a victim of this but I will
say that does this look good for the whole entire school system because
I know that the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill or East
Carolina might have different requirements and I do have some problems
with some of the times because we have community college folks that go
in under a lot of remedial courses and just because they've passed that
English course does not necessarily, I think, make sure that they are at
a place where at NC State that their English criteria is there versus
someone at Appalachian State. It would make the assumption that all of
our 16 universities are at the same position when you walk in the door.
I'm not sure that's the case simply just because of the selection
criteria. Someone can graduate from college, I mean from high school
with a 2.8 and get into Appalachian State but they do not get into the
UNC Chapel Hill simply based off of what their level is so the same
applies for when you come out of a community college. Just because you
come out of a community college does not necessarily mean that you're at
the level of work for that particular institution. But you're right I
did go in with the whole notion that all of my credits were gonna be
transferred and they did not so I get with you on that but my question
is have you looked at the fact that the</p>

<p id="15:00">
Where our sixteen universities have different starting points, and it's,
to me, it would be very difficult for me to say that everybody that
comes out of this English course at this particular community college
should be accepted at all sixteen universities when they all have
different levels of what that looks like.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes, would  you like to reply?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brandan, that's the purpose of the articulation
agreement. To make sure that the standards for the course credits are
the same at the community college are the same as the university system.
Now you referenced English, well the English is the only subject that's
universally accepted. You can take the English at the Caldwell Community
College and it would transfer to Chapel Hill State, Elizabeth City
State, Pembroke, wherever you want to go, but the other subjects are not
transferring. They will in some, and they aren't in others. But that's
the purpose of the articulation agreement, so that you set the standards
to make sure that the coursework is the same. But I will say this. I'm
confident that the course you take at the community college level and
these course subjects is excellent educational teaching. When you're at
a community college, you get the professor. When you're at the
university level, you're lucky if you get more than a graduate student.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me madam chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In time, in time. Now Edgar? Representative Michaux.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Now I think he's wrong on that. But anyway, that's his opinion. Let me
ask you this, just, are you sure that the community colleges can offer
the same type of instruction that you get in a university system in
order to be able to transfer those?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes, I don't know if you know, but Sharon Morrissey
is here with the community college. She may can answer that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That'll be fine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That'd be better.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Good morning Representative Starnes, madam chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, if you'll identify yourself for the record, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm Sharon Morrissey, I'm the chief academic officer for the North
Carolina community college system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can you answer the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. The question is do the community colleges offer the same
level?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The same level of instruction in these courses to be transferred to a
university system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All fifty eight of the community colleges offer an associate in arts
degree program which is the first two years of a four year baccalaureate
degree, and these courses in the agreement that we're working on right
now with the university system, these courses are at the same level as
courses that are their equivalents within the university system. We have
asked the UNC faculty and community college faculty who are meeting now
to identify thirty hours of common course equivalency that is guaranteed
to transfer to each of the sixteen universities as course equivalency
credits, so there will be a guarantee of a minimum of thirty hours that
will be mapped to undergraduate general education classes at each of the
universities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So you are now in the process of doing this now, and you are working
with the university system to go through that without this legislation.
Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, that is correct. The comprehensive articulation agreement as
has already been said has been in place since actually 1997 based on
1995 legislation. We're refining and revising the agreement to create a
guarantee of transfer credit for community college students who are
currently facing obstacles in transferring their credits from community
colleges to universities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One more follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No ma'am, I've got a statement. I think, I don't think we need this
legislation simply because they are now working, it appears that they
are now working on the situation. If you come in and you put forced
legislation on them, there's no telling what the quality of that will be
because of the legislation that you are about to enact. I think the path
that they are taking now with the University system and the community
college system working together to get those done, and I think they will
do it right rather than forcing, having some forced legislation out
there that may be done simply because, community college say, well, now
we got this bill in here. We don't have to go, you don't</p>

<p id="20:00">
That's my statement on that. [SPEAKER CHANGERS] Representative Adams.
[SPEAKER CHANGERS] Thank you. I would direct my question to the speaker.
You indicated that there is an articulation agreement in place and that
the courses that are currently transfered, it's my understanding, they
fulfill the general education requirement. What about other courses that
may not fulfill that requirement. Are they received as electives who
apply to the students program? [SPEAKER CHANGERS] Madam Chair. [SPEAKER
CHANGERS] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGERS] Thank you, that's an excellent
question. The work that is being done on the revision to the
articulation agreement is based on sixty hours of transfer credit. The
first 30 would be the guaranteed general education transfer courses. The
second 30 would be pre-major courses that are mapped according to a
student's desired university major and transfer institution. So the
second 30 hours would be designed based on  whatever the student picks
as his major he wants to go into and the university he wants to transfer
into. Upon completion of the entire 60 hours, what we're proposing to
the 2 governing boards is that the student will receive 60 hours of
transfer course credit as well as satisfaction as completing the general
education undergraduate corps and the pre-major courses necessary to get
into the major of the students choice. [SPEAKER CHANGERS]
Follow up ?? [SPEAKER CHANGERS] Yes. Representative Adams. [SPEAKER
CHANGERS] So, Representative Starns and I think mentioned something
about problems. And I think you may have suggested that in your comments
earlier. What kinds of problems are you experiencing now with the
transferring of these credits? [SPEAKER CHANGERS] Yes. [SPEAKER
CHANGERS] Thank you. The current articulation agreement, the one that's
been in place since 1997, is based on the assumption that the student is
going to complete 44 hours general education course work. We call that
the 44 hour general education core. There is a guarantee wrapped around
the completion of the core in the current articulation agreement. The
majority of community college students do not complete the 44 hour core
before they transfer. Therefore they lose the guarantees that are
associated with the completion of the 44 hour core. When they lose those
guarantees, then their courses are articulated on a course by course
basis, meaning that often, they're given elective credit for those
courses instead of general education course credit. So that's the
primary barrier.
[SPEAKER CHANGERS] Madam Chair, if I ask the bill sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGERS] Certainly. [SPEAKER CHANGERS] Representative Starns,
so is what the system is doing. Is that not satisfactory to you? The
courses that you say are not being transfered, are they courses that
don't meet the general education requirement, or can you be a little
more specific about it? And why you don't think what they're doing now
is applicable. [SPEAKER CHANGERS] The purpose of the law in 1995, which
went into effect, in 1997, was to say that if you took an english or
science or math or history course at a community college, which the
intention of going, the community college for two years and then
transferring to a four year institution to get your degree, the goal was
to make sure that the work you did at community college was of
university qualities, so it would transfer. What has happened, 15 years
later is the only subject that's universally accepted is English. The
others may be accepted or they may not be. But typically they're
accepted as an electives.
So you come in to the university, you start out at Calwel community
college and you move to UNC, and then you've got  to take your math
course again. You've got to take your science course again. You've got
to take your history course again, because they didn't transfer. They
were just accepted as electives. So you're taking the course twice. Lot
of people are going to the community college for two years because it's
the only affordable way to that they can go to college. And it's
disappointing and discouraging to the students and to the parents as
well that when they think that they've taken the course work, and they
transfer, the courses don't follow them. And they have to take it again.
So it becomes expensive. And what the 1995 legislative</p>

<p id="25:00">
Said was that you're gonna have an articulation agreement. And the
University works with the community college to make sure that what's
taught at the community college level is an equivalent to what's being
taught at the university level so that there's no problem in making the
transfers. It's fifteen years, and we've got one course that's
universally accepted. I just don't think that is making work towards
progress or what, we grade the schools, wanna make sure they're making
progress. That's not a very good progress report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Speciale.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speciale.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speciale. You do realize that every time I chair, you ask a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's fine, I know when you're looking at me that you're talking to me,
so. I think we do need this, the question was raised whether or not we
need this legislation, and I think we do. It's been eighteen years since
this legislation was written, and we're still trying to iron it out. And
how many, we've got eighteen years, what, almost eighteen years' worth
of people who have spent money at the community college, spent time at
the community college, and here it is eighteen years later and we're
still trying to work out the kinks. I definitely think that we need to
pass this piece of legislation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Luebke?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chair. I had thought based on my day job that, that this
was already happening, Representative Starnes. I know that at UNCG, in
my department, we always take the Sociology courses that people have
taken at any community college, any of the 58 community colleges. So I
guess my question is, what data do you have to suggest that this is a
problem? And maybe you answered that and I missed it, but what's the
source of your data to say that the sixteen campuses are not doing what
the articulation agreement, which I supported back in '95, is not,
supposed to do? What are they not doing? What evidence do you have?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The evidence is the evidence that is presented by the community college
system that they educate the students, then the student goes to
transfer, then they get the reports back that this credit did not
transfer, they will accept it as an elective. So the evidence comes from
the community college system and I'll, there are people here that can
answer specifically if you want more evidence.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, madam chair? Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Starnes. Is there someone from General
Administration here that can speak to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm not sure. Is there someone here from the general administration
office? Again, again, I said.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, Drew Moretz, UNC General Administration. We have been working very
closely with the community college. We are close to the next agreement
and I will say that we do not see this to be a pressing issue. We are
working, as far as the non-credit transfers, we're working very hard to
make sure that any concerns being addressed, that this bill would be
tackling is going to be addressed in this new articulation agreement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could I follow up really quickly? Just a quick follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, are you saying sir that you support the bill or oppose the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We have no position on this bill at this point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. I missed that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are welcome. Representative Glazier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chair. Just a comment and then a question. My comment
goes back to Representative Starnes' comment about who teaches in the
university versus the community college and having, now teaching the
university, having taught seven years at the community college, at least
at Fayetteville State, and I think at the vast majority of our
institutions, all courses, or almost all courses are taught by faculty
members in part because there are very few graduate programs at most of
the non-research universities. And so there's not that many graduate
students to do it, and so I think that a vast number of courses are
being taught at the university level by faculty. With that having been
said, and I agree on the need for articulation agreements, I'm actually
more interested in the last sentence of the bill, which deals with the
requirement that they develop an articulation agreement advising tool.
So my question is how far along is that, and is that sort of going to be
part and parcel to the new articulation agreement so that there is quick
transfer of some information to students and to faculty.

I think maybe Sharon Morse.

The skeleton of an advising tool in existence through the CFNC website.
It’s called Transfer Navigator. So over the next year we’re going to be
strengthening the advising tool to make it easier for students to map
out their second 30 hours. The first 30 hours is guaranteed course
equivalency, but the students will still need to map out the second 30
hours and they will do that by looking at which courses will transfer to
which specific universities.

Follow up.

Thank you, Ms. Morrisey. My question is back. Is there anything that the
legislature needs to do or can do to assist, or is that being done
through the working relationship between the two entities?

get confused. Correct me if I’m wrong here. We’ve got a bill that passed
in 2000, 18 years ago that said they had to do it. In that time there’s
only one course that has been accomplished, so I would respectfully
disagree that there’s not a pressing need here if we can’t get it done
in two decades. All your bill does is say the bill that we passed 18
years ago we need to actually do. Am I missing something?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are exactly right, Representative Jeter. This bill says that we will
enforce the articulation agreements. And that they will report on
November, by November the 1st to the Joint Legislation Education
Oversight Committee as to the progress that’s being made toward this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a motion when it’s appropriate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Cleveland. Representative Bumgardner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aren’t we in, thank you Madam. Representative Starnes, aren’t we in fact
saying that if classes are not transferring from community colleges to
the universities that the community colleges are not good enough? That
they’re somehow substandard. I’ve heard a couple people mention that
their standards weren’t high enough and if that’s the case, isn’t that a
separate issue that maybe we need to, we have some remediation work to
do at the community college level but certainly if 18 years have gone by
and we haven’t, we haven’t made progress other than one class that we
need to do something to help the situation along?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Bumgardner I am convinced as well as many of you are that
the educational standards in our community college system is as high as
anywhere in the nation. And we can be very proud of the work that our
community college does. And this work needs to be recognized by the
university system. Sadly it has not been recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I apologize, Representative Wilkins. I marked through your name and you
didn’t get to say anything.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not yet, Madam Chair. But we’re getting ready to fix that. If I may, I’m
going to agree with something that Representative Michaux said, and with
great trepidation I’m going to disagree with one thing he said. I’m
pleased that the systems are working on this. And obviously there had to
have been a need for that work or else it would not be in progress now.
But my main point, and Representative Michaux I hope you’ll buy into
this. On line 20 of the bill the thing that I really like about the bill
is that it calls for joint reviews after this work has been completed.
And if for no other reason in the world this bill is needed for line 20.
Thanks.

Adopting I've got a question of those four lead in my understanding that
righted the committee, shares a two year court to study were you, played
two years and you move from their two universalist question that is, if
you don't complete a two years it takes four course each of the
curriculum and deposition given way to use of a transfer more behalf to
go through the whole process real trick that are six out of the options,
nothing you can was that if you complete the course of community college
system and that it would transfer knowledge of Marcy into question the
two, under the original isolation agreement C and had two completes a 44
hour general education four in order for all of the courses to transfer
SA a lot of dual education, it's a credit but problem that arises with
transferability is when students did not complete a block said families
to four courses I often found this course is transferred a selective
credit and had to read E the same courses and MFAITNC near university
under the newer version of the edge of a situation agreement with doing
30 HRS on tearing T or ski resorts the transfer which is difficult to do
this even added from college system has become a course numbering system
the universities do not sell it, it is difficult is challenging to sank
into the university's tell us what ports in sociology is standing here
in T to transfer it all 16 universities but that's what we're working on
right now that invented a five-follow question that I have to go with a
good our employers someone has a hard time with four city university
should understand that acre farm language?? (SPEAKER CHANGES)  it
created a solid data college, leftovers four years of community colleges
station near the Airport to be a real show that that person goes to the
college is expected to leave. The workstations - I-N-time thing and
question of what they say you saying that even if it can't get the arms
the students are to less than 44 albums and a word but we would consider
the gal education courses in English and section of bells were not the
applicable two , two of the universe the transfer each university
treating this course is differently from a transfer of own ideas would
not thinking about the course lies are in which university student
transferred to an asylum and get some help from a M a S, (SPEAKER
CHANGES)  when SMS to question the DC Dr. Hammer EC year, that from the
community college and she likes to address this issue but a command
chair and again by its money's gone the other nine frozen North Carolina
associate the college trustees are from people in the past question
about statistics with the question all because of its association with a
totally endorses of the deal along with trusted association recently
endorsed the on the committee and the press association is some survey
were understated straight transfer and this is what they found the
family 37% of it oversee conflating or inconsistent information from the
first 35% reported that they had two on this early weekend courses at
university and 27% had to appeal the university's decision on the
transferability of course , I would also like to say that we have one of
the navy sea bee base as most of our students are working students a lot
of fans they have to take courses call for all been making their painful
and  there also is slowing down the process of being through the system

just wanna see how they feel [SPEAKER CHANGES] We always wanna help out
our good friends in Madison county and Madison does have a site in
Madison county for ab tech the main there are two campus located in ??
county ab tech ?? campus and their main campus they're not having to pay

your bill passes thank you [SPEAKER CHANGES] 523 is our next bill and we
have some people in the audience who i think want to speak on that also
representative brown [SPEAKER CHANGES] thank you madam chair good
morning to the members of the committee house bill 523 is a local bill a
little background on the bill itself back in 1986 [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes
im sorry  representative ?? moves for to have the pcs before us for
house bill 523 [SPEAKER CHANGES] thank you madam chair in 1986 there was
two separate boards of education in ?? county we had a city board as
well as a county board at that time they decided to combine and become
one county wide board at that time there was 12 members on the board of
education and the propose agreement was they would self reduce
themselves to 7 members that unfortunately never happened and today we
still reside with the larger school board in the state of north carolina
in fact its the largest school board in our neighboring states 12
members serving 6 year terms the other portion this bill addresses is a
very lengthy ?? doc session that board members take currently the
election takes place in May and they do not take office until that
following year very lengthy ?? in the doc session for those board
members. A session ago senator Louis Pate proposed a similar bill that
did pass that would reduce the board from 12 members to 7 members and
reduce the term from 6 to 4 years its because we are underneath the
voting rights act we did have to meet pre-clearance from the department
of justice the 6 to 4 year terms did meet pre-clearance however reducing
from 12 to 7 did not this bill will take it again from reducing from 12
members down to 9 members and will coincide with the current county
commissioners one member being elected from 6 districts with 3 super
districts essentially in the department of justice ruling that was the
most favorable make up of the board if we looked to reduce the board
makeup the most important aspect of this legislation ladies and
gentlemen is the fact that we don't enact this legislation within this
body, but we send it to a referendum for the public at large to decide
this on. In terms of the referendum it self there are 2 pieces that they
will be voting on in November the first piece is reducing the board size
from 12 members to 9 members and the second piece that they will be
voting on is reducing the terms from six to four years and also taking
office 30 days after being elected with that I will take questions you
do have a handout in front of you that shows survey results countywide

makeup the most important aspect of this legislation ladies and
gentlemen is the fact that we don't enact this legislation within this
body, but we send it to a referendum for the public at large to decide
this on. In terms of the referendum it self there are 2 pieces that they
will be voting on in November the first piece is reducing the board size
from 12 members to 9 members and the second piece that they will be
voting on is reducing the terms from six to four years and also taking
office 30 days after being elected with that I will take questions you
do have a handout in front of you that shows survey results countywide
as well as letters of support we did hold round table meetings on this
we held public forum on this to elicit feedback thank you madam chair

representative brown [SPEAKER CHANGES] thank you madam chair good

little background on the bill itself back in 1986 [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes
im sorry  representative ?? moves for to have the pcs before us for
house bill 523 [SPEAKER CHANGES] thank you madam chair in 1986 there was
two separate boards of education in ?? county we had a city board as
well as a county board at that time they decided to combine and become
one county wide board at that time there was 12 members on the board of
education and the propose agreement was they would self reduce
themselves to 7 members that unfortunately never happened and today we
still reside with the larger school board in the state of north carolina
in fact its the largest school board in our neighboring states 12
members serving 6 year terms the other portion this bill addresses is a
very lengthy ?? doc session that board members take currently the
election takes place in May and they do not take office until that
following year very lengthy ?? in the doc session for those board
members. A session ago senator Louis Pate proposed a similar bill that
did pass that would reduce the board from 12 members to 7 members and
reduce the term from 6 to 4 years its because we are underneath the
voting rights act we did have to meet pre-clearance from the department
of justice the 6 to 4 year terms did meet pre-clearance however reducing
from 12 to 7 did not this bill will take it again from reducing from 12
members down to 9 members and will coincide with the current county
commissioners one member being elected from 6 districts with 3 super
districts essentially in the department of justice ruling that was the
most favorable make up of the board if we looked to reduce the board

from 12 to 7 did not this bill will take it again from reducing from 12
members down to 9 members and will coincide with the current county
commissioners one member being elected from 6 districts with 3 super
districts essentially in the department of justice ruling that was the
most favorable make up of the board if we looked to reduce the board
makeup the most important aspect of this legislation ladies and
gentlemen is the fact that we don't enact this legislation within this
body, but we send it to a referendum for the public at large to decide
this on. In terms of the referendum it self there are 2 pieces that they
will be voting on in November the first piece is reducing the board size
from 12 members to 9 members and the second piece that they will be
voting on is reducing the terms from six to four years and also taking
office 30 days after being elected with that I will take questions you
do have a handout in front of you that shows survey results countywide
as well as letters of support we did hold round table meetings on this
we held public forum on this to elicit feedback thank you madam chair

im sorry  representative ?? moves for to have the pcs before us for
house bill 523 [SPEAKER CHANGES] thank you madam chair in 1986 there was
two separate boards of education in ?? county we had a city board as
well as a county board at that time they decided to combine and become
one county wide board at that time there was 12 members on the board of
education and the propose agreement was they would self reduce
themselves to 7 members that unfortunately never happened and today we
still reside with the larger school board in the state of north carolina
in fact its the largest school board in our neighboring states 12
members serving 6 year terms the other portion this bill addresses is a
very lengthy ?? doc session that board members take currently the
election takes place in May and they do not take office until that
following year very lengthy ?? in the doc session for those board
members. A session ago senator Louis Pate proposed a similar bill that
did pass that would reduce the board from 12 members to 7 members and
reduce the term from 6 to 4 years its because we are underneath the
voting rights act we did have to meet pre-clearance from the department

members. A session ago senator Louis Pate proposed a similar bill that
did pass that would reduce the board from 12 members to 7 members and
reduce the term from 6 to 4 years its because we are underneath the
voting rights act we did have to meet pre-clearance from the department
of justice the 6 to 4 year terms did meet pre-clearance however reducing
from 12 to 7 did not this bill will take it again from reducing from 12
members down to 9 members and will coincide with the current county
commissioners one member being elected from 6 districts with 3 super
districts essentially in the department of justice ruling that was the
most favorable make up of the board if we looked to reduce the board
makeup the most important aspect of this legislation ladies and
gentlemen is the fact that we don't enact this legislation within this
body, but we send it to a referendum for the public at large to decide
this on. In terms of the referendum it self there are 2 pieces that they
will be voting on in November the first piece is reducing the board size
from 12 members to 9 members and the second piece that they will be
voting on is reducing the terms from six to four years and also taking
office 30 days after being elected with that I will take questions you
do have a handout in front of you that shows survey results countywide
as well as letters of support we did hold round table meetings on this
we held public forum on this to elicit feedback thank you madam chair

in fact its the largest school board in our neighboring states 12
members serving 6 year terms the other portion this bill addresses is a
very lengthy ?? doc session that board members take currently the
election takes place in May and they do not take office until that
following year very lengthy ?? in the doc session for those board
members. A session ago senator Louis Pate proposed a similar bill that
did pass that would reduce the board from 12 members to 7 members and
reduce the term from 6 to 4 years its because we are underneath the
voting rights act we did have to meet pre-clearance from the department
of justice the 6 to 4 year terms did meet pre-clearance however reducing
from 12 to 7 did not this bill will take it again from reducing from 12
members down to 9 members and will coincide with the current county
commissioners one member being elected from 6 districts with 3 super
districts essentially in the department of justice ruling that was the
most favorable make up of the board if we looked to reduce the board
makeup the most important aspect of this legislation ladies and
gentlemen is the fact that we don't enact this legislation within this
body, but we send it to a referendum for the public at large to decide
this on. In terms of the referendum it self there are 2 pieces that they
will be voting on in November the first piece is reducing the board size
from 12 members to 9 members and the second piece that they will be
voting on is reducing the terms from six to four years and also taking
office 30 days after being elected with that I will take questions you
do have a handout in front of you that shows survey results countywide
as well as letters of support we did hold round table meetings on this
we held public forum on this to elicit feedback thank you madam chair

well as a county board at that time they decided to combine and become
one county wide board at that time there was 12 members on the board of
education and the propose agreement was they would self reduce
themselves to 7 members that unfortunately never happened and today we
still reside with the larger school board in the state of north carolina
in fact its the largest school board in our neighboring states 12
members serving 6 year terms the other portion this bill addresses is a
very lengthy ?? doc session that board members take currently the
election takes place in May and they do not take office until that
following year very lengthy ?? in the doc session for those board
members. A session ago senator Louis Pate proposed a similar bill that
did pass that would reduce the board from 12 members to 7 members and
reduce the term from 6 to 4 years its because we are underneath the
voting rights act we did have to meet pre-clearance from the department
of justice the 6 to 4 year terms did meet pre-clearance however reducing
from 12 to 7 did not this bill will take it again from reducing from 12
members down to 9 members and will coincide with the current county
commissioners one member being elected from 6 districts with 3 super
districts essentially in the department of justice ruling that was the
most favorable make up of the board if we looked to reduce the board
makeup the most important aspect of this legislation ladies and
gentlemen is the fact that we don't enact this legislation within this
body, but we send it to a referendum for the public at large to decide
this on. In terms of the referendum it self there are 2 pieces that they
will be voting on in November the first piece is reducing the board size
from 12 members to 9 members and the second piece that they will be
voting on is reducing the terms from six to four years and also taking
office 30 days after being elected with that I will take questions you
do have a handout in front of you that shows survey results countywide

If you will give your name and who you’re with and, if you don’t mind,
answering the question
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma’am. Thank you ma’am and chairman and members of the education
committee. My name is Mayor Blunt Williams and I’m from Greenville. I’m
a current member of the Pea county board of education. Our monthly
salary is 200 dollars a month, with taxes it’s 184.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that sufficient?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Shepard, I appreciate your question. to be clear, they
certainly do a lot of work for the salary they have. But I guess, in
staying with this conversation, it is not a fiscal issue we’re talking
about. When I was elected it wasn’t tax reform, or the economy, or jobs
that constituents we’re coming to me about. It was the size, the
effectiveness, and the efficiency of the Pig County board of education.
What they view as a very decisive and challenging board that is
challenging our students. So that is what this legislation has brought
forth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jeter
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ma’am
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. He just needed you to answer the question. We’ll call on you as
soon as the questions are through. We’ll let you speak. Representative
Jeter –
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, madam chairman. Question for the bill sponsor, Representative
Brown, if I understand this correctly; in essence, you’re separating
this into two major parts. The second part would be the reduction of the
terms from six years to four years, which has already received
pre-clearance warrants.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The first would be a reduction from twelve to nine. Senator Pate’s bill,
in the last session, didn’t get pre-clearance because, according to your
explanation, it went to seven, and the ruling was they felt like nine
was more consistent. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In terms of looking at The Voter Rights Act, they felt that seven would
incorrectly reduce minority representation and that coinciding more
along the lines of the county commissioners would be most favorable make
up. Again, the county commissions have already actually met.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, ma ‘dam chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
How many students are in your district?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Roughly 23,000.
[SPEKAER CHANGES]
Statement, ma ’dam chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can I make a quick statement?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You said 23,000 students. I’m from Becklinberg, we have nine members and
I think we have 135,000 students serving four year terms. I would
strongly encourage this education committee to approve this if nine
people in Becklinberg can manage 130,000. I also believe there’s nine in
Wake and they have 140,000 students on four year terms, currently. I
think this is probably the right way to go, and I strongly commend the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Pishalli, did I get it right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, thank you. I’m just curious, if I heard the board member correctly,
she said she was a four-year member. If they’re going from six to four,
then how come she is already a four-year member?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think she was more, I can’t speak for her, I would assume she was
saying she’s been on the board for four years. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ross.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, ma ‘dam chair. My question was answered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Adams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, ma’dam chair. A couple questions for the bill sponsor, you
say you did a poll, do you have any sense of those numbers, who you
polled in sense of racial make-up, etc?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You can see, in your packet, and then there’s another supplemental item
that we did that you can find on, I believe, the third page of your
packet, if I’m correct. It was a public forum that was held at J.H.
Rows’ High School in Pea County. The make-up of that forum was majority
African American. If you look at those numbers of those people who
answered the question, nineteen of those people that were present at
that public hearing wanted to reduce the board’s size, wanted to just
simply reduce the board’s size; very simple question. We didn’t get into
the weeds of what it would be reduced to, we just simply asked, “would
you like to see the board reduced.” Nineteen of those individuals said
they would like to see it reduced. Of those nineteen members, two were
school board lawyers.</p>

<p id="55:00">
People of the group said that they would not like to see it reduced and
of those nine members, five of them were school board members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So you are proposing to have a referendum?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And follow up ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And they would take office thirty days after?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct and we would be moving elections from the primary
election in May to a general election in November.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just one more question.  Do we have any indication of what the school
board thinks about this? I mean, I saw the letters from people who
support it. Of course you would have those. Did you get a letter?  I
understand that the school board voted.  They voted three times and they
voted it down.  Do you have that information?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s a divided school board. That’s clear.  You have individuals who
actually campaign on the reduction of school board. You have members who
are vehemently opposed to reduction of the school board. A couple of
those members are here today. I equate this.  I own a company. Could you
imagine me going to my managers in my company and saying, “You must
self-reduce”? It’s never going to happen. There’s not a board that’s
going to self-reduce themselves. That’s why it didn’t happen back in
1987 when they rolled into twelve members and it was supposed to reduce
to seven. Those items don’t happen.  What we want to do is we want to
send this to the public at large to decide. The people who are actually
paying the tax dollars to send their children to Pitt County schools.
Let them decide. I think that the most gleaming information that you can
find is on the very first page of the information that I set out and if
you look at the makeup of those who responded, the highest makeup was
educators and education administrators.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.  Let me go through this list I have. I have Representative Tolson,
Brandon Turner, Elmore, and Lubke and then I’m going to take the two
speakers from Pitt County.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.  I just wanted to order a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would love one, but I will take these others in at the appropriate
time. I’ll get back to you.  Representative Brandon.
Thank you, Mrs. Chair. I wanted to ask the bill sponsor or maybe
somebody from ??.  If you have a referendum, I don’t understand what the
problem would be if there’s a reference to people get to choose whether
they like it or not.  He has a poll.  It could be scientific, it could
not be scientific, but the most absolute thing is the people actually
going to vote for it or not so my question to you is that if you have a
problem with it, what… Sometimes we get a problem these things and there
is no referendum and I have a huge problem with that. But you have a
referendum and the people can choose so I don’t understand the problem
could be.  If you could clarify what you are talking about.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that a statement?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I just want to know, if there are people here, if you have a
referendum, what could possibly be the problem.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, we will address that when you speak.  If you would, please.  And
Representative Turner.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chairman, a question was answered.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And Representative Elmore.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brandon addressed my vain of questioning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair. I’m a little disappointed that this bill is not
being discussed in its proper historical context.  I’d be willing to bet
dollars or donuts that this is a result, that the original board was put
together as a result of a lawsuit. That there were many, many lawsuits
in our state during the 1980s about composition of school boards and
whether African Americans had equal opportunity and had candidates of
their choice. And that had to be the origins of this and so I’m struck
by the fact that a single African American speak in favor of this and it
sounds pretty nasty.  It’s inferable that there’s nasty racial politics
going on in your county and I’d like to hear about that. I’d like to
hear, in particular, from African Americans in your community and find
out whether they support this or not because otherwise, it sounds like
certain people are imposing a new plan and it doesn’t sound a whole lot
different from the Wade County situation or where it’s been imposed by
Senator Hunt or the Gilford County situation where Senator Wade is about
to do something. So tell me why this is not just an imposition and tell
me that in fact, you have African Americans…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of order, Madam Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s my question.  What African Americans do you have?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of order, Madam Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don’t know where you are.</p>

Around representative Brown's integrity and not anything to do with the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No sir, representative Johnson knows it's just a
question about the [??].
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's just a question and let's give representative
Brown an opportunity if he wishes or if not we will hear from the two
school board members.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll certainly address that question and it does to me
seem a little bit of a personal attack, I will address that issue
representative Leubke. And I think that it's disrespectful to assume
that this is a racially divided issue and I think that that's what it
creates and that's unfortunate. It's unfortunate that our children pay
that price and I think that that's just sad. In looking at this, this is
not something brought forth as to create a racial divide or what you
inferred is a racial agenda, and I think that's shameful.
What this is representative Leubke, this is a bill to create better
efficiency and a more effective board of education in our community.
This is a bill that was brought forth by many groups throughout the
county. Again if you look at the third page of the handout that I gave
you the majority of those members who signed in on that sheet and wanted
a reduction in school board were of African American descent. Those are
facts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. I would like now for the two school board
members to address, if you would like to speak just give your name and
whom you're affiliated with and you can have two minutes or close to
that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning again. Madame Chair and members of the
education committee, once again I say my name is Mary Blout [??]
Williams and I am from Polk county schools. I disagree with
representative Brown as to how it has come about. In 2010 we as a board,
a 12 member board voted three different times that we did not want to
reduce the size of our board. Upon our disagreement, upon the consensus
of our board members we had certain board members from Mr. Brown's
district and Senator Pate's district. There was no referendum held, no
board members were spoken to about the meetings that Mr. Brown has or
senator Pate had at the time. So it did seem like there was a hidden
agenda there because the majority of the board was not asked.
So once we 12 decided that we didn't ant reduction in our board, that's
when Senator Pate wrote senate bill 260. Now the department of justice
did a survey, came in, did an investigation and they decided that
because if you reduce our board to nine you would eliminate three
minority seats on the board and there's only three minorities on our
entire board. If you go with the plan of the county commissioners and
you reduce us to nine and put us in super district you can give us land
but you won't give us any votes. So therefore if we go to the problem
with the referendum is that you will give us land but you will give us
no votes, so there won't be a guarantee, not with any election on a
non-partisan board that you'll have minorities on the board, but you
won't have any, any at all. And that's where the conflict comes in.
When Mr. Brown came to our school board meeting on March 4th he
basically told us what we were going to do whether we liked it or not.
And those were his words specifically. When he held the public forum at
JH Rose [??] high school, there were up there, the survey that Mr. Brown
did, he only did in his district, he didn't do it county wide. There are
over 100,000 people in Polk county, we represent more than 24,000
students, 36 schools in our district, but he only took call, took 40
people from his district. When he had his initial meeting with the
people in the area concerning this matter he only went to his district,
he didn't ask anybody else in the other six districts, in the other five
districts what they thought. So there is a conflict here.

parent, by the way and all of that, and many other parents have done the
same thing so we need to have a strong school board, a good
representation countywide so we would say please, please remember,
reducing this is going to destroy our minority-majority participation on
that board. We cannot guarantee it any other way. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Brown, would you like to …
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair. The thing that I would really bring to the
committee’s attention, once again, is A, this does go to the vote of the
people, which is the most important aspect, but there is no empirical
data that shows, currently, no empirical data that shows that reducing
12 to 9 is going to drastically prohibit minority representation on this
board. The other important thing to keep in mind is still, this
provision of reducing from 12 to 9 still must meet the Department of
Justice preclearance. So if in fact, this does reduce minority
representation on this board to a hindrance level, it won’t be
precleared by the Department of Justice. There’s still many hurdles that
this legislation has to go through.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Committee, again, I bring your attention to the time and we still have
one more bill to come before us. I did say that we would take a vote
after that and that we would take Tolson's motion. Since that time, I’ve
had Shepard, Malone, Collins, and Pittman, who want to make comments. If
these are necessary we will spend a little bit more time. Shepard has
concede his. How about Malone? And Collins? Pittman? Adams?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma’am, if I could. I wanted to know, in terms of the vote that was
taken by the board, was that a unanimous decision, what was the vote? Do
you know, Representative Brown?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It was not a unanimous decision.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But it was a majority.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, ma’am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mary Blackwell, can you answer that? She answered 9 - 2.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
9 - 2. I just want to make a comment. It seems to me, first of all, I
don’t think we need to get upset as much as we do when the issue of race
occurs down here. I hear it a lot on the floor, I hear it a lot in
committee. It is of concern. It does appear to me that there will be
some diminishment of minority participation. I mean, you’d have to. Most
of, and I assume these two ladies represent districts, so that is
primarily why district systems were created, to sort of guarantee, we’ve
done that in Greensboro, to guarantee participation from districts that
basically have minority population. I do think we need to be concerned
about that and not be so much offended at when race comes up in these
discussion because it has to and I do think that the minority
participation will be diluted and we have to be concerned about that.
You did have a majority vote, if you had 9 - 2, that means you only had
2 people who were in favor of this change, I’m not going to support the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Adams, but you’ve spurred two more people.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Question for the bills sponsor. Are we changing the districts? Changing
the geographical areas that the districts cover with this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, they will coincide with the county commissioners. Yes sir. That has
met Department of Justice preclearance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And we’re still going to have one, as I understand it, there’s going to
be one representative from each district as well as three at large.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct. Well, not at large. They’re super districts, so…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So the county is split in three parts as well as split it six parts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Martin would like to speak on the bill, she’s the primary
sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I just want to commend Representative Brown on all of his
work on this. When we first came up here together as a team, and I also
represent Pitt County, clearly, Representative Brown has taken the lead
on this being part of that community and seeing the issues last year
when they tried to go through this change. He has spent a lot of time
with our delegation giving a lot more in depth background information
and some of the question, Representative Luebke, that you brought up,
and I do think we definitely do not want it to be a race issue, that is
not what is driving this. The driving of it is the efficiency of the
board.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]: Ward for the children that if they can operate more
effectively and efficiently as a small unit then that will benefit
students in the ?? County that is the objective, and not to have things
in the paper all the time without the controversies of the board that is
why the chamber has supported this because they want the board to
function efficiently, and I think if we go forward with a following
department of justice clearances that these issues can hopefully be
addressed, and if there is a change that needs to be made to ensure that
we continue to have appropriate representation. I think those
addressants would come out when we go to the clearance. So, I would
commend this bill to you, and I thank the Representative Brown for his
hard work and also just say that, it's like if we are going to vote
ourselves out of office that is very difficult for those board members,
and we appreciate all of the work that they are doing on the board for
our students and this is why the public needs to have the opportunity to
make that commend because they are not going to put themselves out of
their jobs. Everyone do his best for our students. Thank you.

okay i have a treat for you this should not be difficult. We will have
an anonymous vote here. I do want to point out the differences between
the original bill to the proposed committee substitute. Before i get
into that there is a section &quot;where as is&quot; background which i
find particularly helpful. On these discussions and why are we doing
this and i would like to ask Representative horn to explain a little bit
of the background to super intendeds work group, and the feedback from
are super intendeds cause this to come into action. Representative Horne
thank you madam chair, ladies and gentlemen as all of you have heard
time to time there has been a work group of super intendeds around the
state coming together to kind of give us chairman. Yes I'm sorry Mr.
Collins, I would like to make a motion for a favor report on the propose
committee substitute house bill 839, in favor to the original. There is.
They will be quick and i will take the motion from Collins if there is
no further questions. Anyway the recommendations in here have been
resulted from the super intendeds across the state. Here is some of the
work of the different reports i have reviewed. Than after the reason we
have a committee substitute is because we have been working through dpi,
on their concerns on of what were asking to be reviewed and asking to
get back the feedback to the superintendent admit the school
administrative group, or we could come together. So these are the exact
changes. If anyone oppose to the bill. I don't think there is opposition
to the bill. I'm afraid he was addressing the chair do we have any
opposition against the bill? If not i will take representative colleens
motion. Once again i would like to give a favor report to the house
committee substitute four house fella 39 in favor for the original you
heard the motion all of those in favor all oppose. The I's have it Thank
you the meeting is adjourned.</p>
