<p id="00:00">
00:00 Good morning everybody welcome back we're ready to get the short
session started today and I'm gonna make a few brief comments and then
if there're any questions I'll either respond to them or have the
appropriate member we've done a lot of work in the into-rum to prepare
for the short session and I expect it to be a short short session there
are some things that we have to deal with first among them is the budget
we've received the Governor's budget this morning I believe the Governor
will be making a public announcement today at the one o'clock we like
what we see in the budget we think it's great progress we think it's
something we can build on we look forward to collaborating with the
Governor and the Senate and to get the budget past in a timely fashion
as a part of the budget we will absolutely place a priority on
fulfilling the promise that we made back in the February time frame for
teacher raises and for state employee raises I think if you could if you
ask me to answer the situation with the budget in one word the word
would be manageable and the reason that it's manageable is for the past
three years we've actually asked balanced responsible sustainable budget
so that I know that the press has made much of the short fall  but it
was within the margins of what we had anticipated and it's why this
budget is manageable and it's why we'll be able to fulfill the promises
that we've made another matter that will come up that I think is of
importance is the Cohosh issue if there're questions about that we'll
have the members who have been on point for that to provide you with an
update and then probably the last thing I'll talk about in terms of
important bills or important measures would be the tax reform that we've
done the tax reform is working the tax reform has helped us in
accommodation with tax cuts back in 2011 create two hundred thousand
jobs over the last three years it's had us have the greatest drop in
unemployment over the last five quarters of any state it's responsible
for our ability to go from the state with one of the three or four
highest unemployment rates in 2011 to an unemployment rate that's below
the national average that was done through the great work of the members
that I have with me today and I'm very proud of them.
and it was also through collaboration with the Senate you know a lot of
people want to talk about the differences between the Senate that's a
natural part of the process the legislative process we come in with
different opinions we discuss it we go with it in a professional manner
and we produce results and what we're gonna do in the short session is
no different from what we've done in the last three sessions that's to
come in keep the priorities at the forefront sound fiscal management
budget decisions  things that get out of the way of businesses through
regulatory reform and not much else that I'm happy to answer any
questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[??] I've been talking to some of the folks gathered outside you
requested of the chamber to revisit some of the issues from last year
including medicate expansion unemployment benefit do you see any moves
to dial back the rite wore shift from last session in this current short
session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
well I think the shift was to fiscally sound policy not necessarily rite
wore shift you need to recognize that we had almost three billion dollar
debt to the federal  government because the democrats had failed to step
up and address the unemployment problem when they should have we're
saying people go back to work it's no coincidence that between our tax
regulatory and unemployment reform that we've seen the precipitous drop
in unemployment we're creating jobs we need to build we'll look at
anything to make adjustments if there's valid recommendations we welcome
the democrats to make a proposal in terms of medicate expansion john you
would never in business you would never put more money into a failing
business until you got the business on the right track the daily elected
democrat auditor said that hundreds of millions of dollars were being
wasted she told governor Perdue that governor Perdue did nothing nor did
democratic leadership that came before us now you're gonna see in the
budget we went from a 750 million dollars shortfall in 2010 to
approximately 70 million this year the difference is leadership once we
figure out how to stabilize things and we make sure the maximum amount
possible is going to help people that really need help then we can talk
about expanding it but it's irresponsible and it's causing us to not be
able to provide the care that we should be able to provide and these
folks just need to understand we want to do that but we want to do it in
a sustainable way deeds versus words and nelson I don't know if you're
here if you'd like to make any other comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
you mention leadership someone say that running for senate is a
full-time job and leading the NC house is a full-time job how do you do
both?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
well if I ran the North Carolina house the way harry.       05:00</p>

… runs his Senate where all the decisions are made in his office, then I
probably couldn’t do this job, but you can see I’ve got 119 members,
including some Democrats, that I actually rely on to move policy. See,
that’s the great thing about a chamber that functions versus a chamber
that doesn’t. Last three years, we’ve passed three balanced budgets,
right? We’re going to pass another one here in about four or five weeks.
Harry Reid hasn’t passed one in three years. I don’t need to take
leadership lessons from somebody like that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speaker,
this morning there was another dust up over this insurance mandate
moratorium, that you support the mandate for autism services. What role
did you have in derailing that Bill, or…? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I want
to go back and talk about the Affordable Care Act because I don’t want
the Affordable Care Act oversight committee. I don’t want this to go to
a single issue that was discussed there. We need to go back and review
all the other information that’s been shared in these committees – the
devastating impact that Obamacare is going to have in North Carolina,
the increases in premiums, the threat to having quality, widespread
access to healthcare. Now on the mandate issues, those are things that
need to be taken in isolation. There’s got to be a clear benefit to it.
We can’t do things that simply add cost; they have to add benefit. And
what I’ve directed my members to do is look at these is a way to where
you can have on a piece of paper a compelling reason for doing this
because there’s a downstream benefit that accrues a benefit to the
citizens of North Carolina and the tax payers, and that’s where the rub
is, and I think we’ll see that worked out fairly quickly. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] ?? Legislative Services Commission is meeting on building
rules. Is that in response to the court decision on the ?? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Is Tim here? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m right here. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Tim, you want to field that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Barry, the rules
need to be updated. They haven’t been dealt with in many years, and so
we want to make sure that the rules are clear on public gatherings as
well as a number of other matters, and I think you’ll see the
Legislative Services Commission recommendations come out with building
rules that are updated. This building’s been here a while, there have
been a lot of changes that have been in place since those rules where
done however many years ago, so we’re going to deal with those issues
and some others. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Other questions? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Speaker, where do you get the money? You said you support the pay
raise for teachers and for state employees that are in the Governor’s
budget. Where do you guys get the money to do all that in the face of
the shortfall? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m going to defer to Nelson to cover
some of the details, just because when you pass a budget, unlike the
Democratic Leadership that came before us – they lived far beyond their
means. They funded the budget with two and a half billion dollars in
2011, and recurring obligations with non-recurring money. Well one of
the things we did is we eliminated that practice, so that’s one of the
ways that you create I think a more sustainable budget scenario. The
other thing you do is reserve. If you look at the budget, we did have
some reserves that we can call on. The Governor’s done a great job of
trying to manage the spending this year so that we’ll have some money
carried over from end year budget obligations. And Nelson, where are
you? You want to add onto that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Republicans know how
to budget and we take a fundamentally different approach. We don’t
believe on spending every dime. We believe in making sure that we have
sufficient reserves. We knew that going into tax reform, that we needed
to have a cushion in the budget. We provided for that cushion. We have
reversions and over-collections that have also come into the budget, and
I would say the administration’s done an excellent job of managing the
revenue shortfall over the last several months and has put us in an
excellent position to fulfill our number one priorities and move forward
with a very sound and responsible budget. [SPEAKER CHANGES] In order to
bring in these pay raises and all that you claim, will you have to
perhaps postpone the forthcoming tax decreases? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No,
not at all. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Why not? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The reduction
of those tax rates is key to our long-term economic growth and job
growth in this state. This Republican majority has been focused on
economic development and growth of jobs in this state and prosperity in
this state since we came in in 2011, and we’re very grateful to have a
governor that came on board last year that shares our vision, and we
look to do more reform, whether it’s taxes, regulations – keep North
Carolina’s economy moving and growing. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, and to
add to that, the personal income tax, which was 5.8 this year, 5.75 next
year, is a hard commitment. It will move into place, but it’s another
example of responsible…</p>

<p id="10:00">
fiscal policy. The corporate income tax triggers are based on, they're
based, the reductions are based on triggers. So if the national economy
goes in the wrong direction, as it has a couple of times, then we have a
safety valve for that through the triggering mechanism. If we continue
to hit our revenue targets then they'll go in to place, if they don't
then they'll simply slip until we're certain that we have baseline
funding for government operations. It's a good example of good policy,
never been done before, to my knowledge, in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The speaker told us, back to the senate race, the legislature is under
more scrutiny now than ever before nationally and in the past, the last
couple of years, especially because of the race you're running. How do
you feel about all the scrutiny? Especially during this session, I think
people are really going to be watching the bills that get passed, what
initiatives get made, or all of that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We're gonna stay on strategy. You know, my primary job right now is to
run an efficient legislative session and I have the utmost confidence in
my members to do that. To me, the scrutiny is good and the reason for
that is the enormous success that we've had over the last three years. I
want the national media to know what we've done in terms of economic
recovery. I want them to know that we're the first majority that's
actually created any substantial increase in teacher salaries. I want
them to know that our unemployment debt is going to be gone next year. I
want them to know all those things so I think we run a good discipline
session. This is good for North Carolina. It puts us on a stage and lets
them know that North Carolina has made more progress in the last three
years than any other state on economic policy, we're proud of that, the
more the merrier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, there was a recommendation coming out of the legislative
research commission regarding Common Core ??. Will the House be taking
that up this year?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, and Craig, where are you? Come on up here. By the way, everybody
wish Craig happy birthday. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much Mr. Speaker. Common Core recommendation coming out
of the legislative research committee committed this state to
maintaining high, rigorous standards, which are in place right now and
created a commission that will look at those and find out how we can
expand them and prove them and have them applied to everyone. Our
concern, as a legislature, is federal intrusion. We believe that North
Carolinians should take control of North Carolina education.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But, I'm sorry, because I remember that bill. Actually it said that we
were going to do away with Common Core standards?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, the bureau did not, in fact, say that. Titles of bills and first
paragraphs are not necessarily reflective of bills. The bill clearly-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They're supposed to me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, unfortunately the reality is that the bill said that we are going
to create a commission to look at our state standards to recommend
improvements and take into consideration how they impact the student and
the teacher and that that's how we're going to go forward rather than be
susceptible to a mandate that comes from the federal government.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And Laura, just as a follow-up, the problem with Common Core is, you
want me to get that? The problem with Common Core is not unlike problems
that passed legislatures have had. We're having Washington and Raleigh
overreach in the classroom in my opinion. I, for one, have come to a
place where I believe that there is, there is, we can do better in North
Carolina than Common Core and I think if we go back to the teachers, the
principal, superintendents, and parents that we can do a much better job
that's been done and we can actually use that as a competitive advantage
against other states and actually perform better than other states that
may continue purely with a Common Core model. And the whole process here
was to understand that, based on the decisions made before we came into
power, how we do that in an orderly fashion. Because if you were just to
come in and repeal Common Core this year than what's the underlying plan
for the classroom next academic year? So I would really encourage the
next legislature to continue to find out how we build a better standard
in North Carolina. How much of that is based on empowerment of the local
school districts and the classroom unless people in Raleigh and
Washington telling us what to do. You know, the average salary of a
bureaucrat in Washington and Department of Education is $102,000 a year.
I'd like to see some of, all that work that they're doing in Washington
kind of condensed so that more money can stay in the state and go back
into the classroom.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So if the U.S. military said that North Carolina standards are producing
below par recruits, what do you do?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that we always, first off we've got a community college system,
university system that are two of the best in the nation. Our K-12
system needs to cont-</p>

<p id="15:00">
They need to improve, and that’s exact… and we’ve seen improvement. The
fact of the matter is I don’t want anybody who’s watching this to think
that we don’t have great examples of school systems producing quality
students. Go to Morresville Graded School district, go to Chapel Hill.
Go to any number… go to Greensboro. There’s a number of great examples
of how to get education right. We just have to do a better job of making
that pervasive across the state, and that’s what we mean, you know, when
we go back to standards. How can we go back to Morresville Graded School
District, or what we’re doing with Project L.I.F.T over at Mecklenburg
County, or what we’re doing with digital conversion, and use those as
examples to help these other school systems really improve the outcomes?
And I’m very confident that we’ll do that. I also think that the pay
raises that we’ll have to improve the pay, but also retention of the
teachers will also be a key part in us having that success, and I think
that we’ll see steady progress over the next several years as a result
of what these folks are doing. Folks that haven’t asked a question
first. Yes Sir? [SPEAKER CHANGES] There’s been differing reports on
whether the film incentives in North Carolina have been successful. Your
stance on whether they should be extended as is, potentially changed,
modified, or let them expire? [SPEAKER CHANGES] We’ve spent a lot of
time in revenue laws with that, and I’ve got our Chair of Revenue Laws
here, so I’m going to turn it over to Julia. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
for the question. The film incentive is set to expire. We will continue
working with the Senate, and if there’s a different way that we can do
incentives then that’s what we’re going to be looking at, but what we
have right now is not acceptable for the body. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So you
don’t see them being extended in the current fashion then? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] No Sir, I don’t. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can you tell us where the coal ash legislation is right now, and how
comprehensive you think it’s going to be, and who’s going to pay for it?
 [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Well first, I’m very proud of the work that has
been done by a group led by Representatives Samuelson, Hager and
McGrady, and I have them here and I’d… Chuck, if you’d like to step up
and give an update? [SPEAKE CHANGES] We’re working quite
collaboratively, first with the Senate and also with the Governor’s
office. I think I talk to Senator Apodaca almost every day. We provided
them with a set of principles that we hoped they would work towards, and
Senator Apodaca says we’re there, we’re working through the details
right now. He introduced the Governor’s Bill today – that’s an
indication of the collaboration that’s occurring. We agree that we need
to close the active coal ash ponds, we need to dewater them, and then we
need to go through a remediation process, and that’s what our goal is in
the legislation and the short session. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And I want to
particularly compliment Chuck. Chuck was formerly president of the
National Sierra Club. I think that he more than anybody understands the
importance of us protecting our environment, and that’s why he’s played
a very critical role here, and that’s why I believe that we’re going to
have… we’ve got a great set of guiding principles and I think we’ll have
very responsible policy that addresses the spectrum of issues that have
come up as a result of the Dan ash spill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Going back
to health care, you’re saying that the state is making progress, but an
annual report from the CDC came back yesterday that showed that North
Carolina is slipping backward in a number of health indicators, and
we’re one of the lowest… we’ve got one of the worst infant mortality
rates in this state. How can you say that the state is making progress
if folks in the state are sicker, less well? [SPEAKE CHANGES] Well the
way that we are making progress is by trying to increase the amount of
money that will be available to actually solve the problems, versus
waste, fraud and abuse. The reason that we have the downward trends,
trends do not occur in a period of months; they occur in a period of
years, and it’s because of the mismanagement and the billions of dollars
of waste. Keep in mind the duly elected Democratic state auditor told
Governor Perdue that her department was wasting hundreds of millions of
dollars a year. Imagine if those hundreds of millions of dollars a year
had been spent on interventions to reduce infant mortality and to reduce
some of the health care problems we have to deal with, how much further
along we’d be today. Once we stabilize the situation and we’re freeing
up the maximum money possible for providing the safety net, then we need
to add to it, and I think you’ll see the positive trends coming from
this legislature take root. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I noticed the Economic
Development Partnership was already filed this morning by Representative
Murray. Do you think that’s going to happen this year, and do you think
by the end of the year we’ll have a private partner ?? partnership?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don’t know. I don’t think Tom’s here but…</p>

<p id="20:00">
We were hopeful with trying to get the partnership done last year. We're
working with the Senate and the house. I think generally speaking we
would favor making progress with that because we're already seeing some
positive signs coming from the governor's commerce department. We need
to address concerns that some of the members may have in terms of rule
and urban issues to make sure that it's fairly applied, that it's a code
of benefit to the entire state but I'm reasonably optimistic we will
make movement there. If there's any other member who would like to speak
I'd be happy to have you [CHANGE SPEAKER] can we follow up on that? Do
you support the disclosure of private donors anybody who might want to
disclose or give money to the partnership, that their identities be
disclosed. [CHANGE SPEAKER] I haven't specifically seen the provision
but I think transparency is good and I would generally favor it. Is
there anyone else who hasn't asked a question yet? Okay, well go back
around the horn. [CHANGE SPEAKER] just to quickly go back to the budget
issue ?? You mentioned that they're ?? This year. What are the
assurances that this won't be a recurring problem? [CHANGE SPEAKER] As
long as Republicans stay elected I can assure it won't be a recurring
problem. If the Democrats come into power I can assure you it will. The
fact of the matter is you have to take a look at the last three years we
have done an extraordinary job of a structural deficit of two and a half
billion dollars in our freshman year as a leadership. We came back had a
manageable situation in the short session. We came back last year, we
had a manageable situation. We wanted to do teacher increases last year
but Medicaid gave us a surprise. This cycle Medicaid whole is less than
one hundred million dollars. 2010 it was seven hundred and fifty
million, so the reason I feel confident is that we're moving, the trends
for budgeting are moving in the right direction. I think that there are
very few things that we've done as a matter of policy that would expose
us to risk in North Carolina. If the federal government continues to
fail to address the debt problem and regulatory issues that's the wild
card but those are circumstances for right now that are outside of our
control. [CHANGE SPEAKER] ?? Let me close a few gaps with quick yes or
no questions. Will the house vote to repeal commoncore and do you
personally support ending the ?? [CHANGE SPEAKER] I don't answer yer or
no questions, next question. You can't do that, I mean obviously [CHANGE
SPEAKER] can you answer where you stand on those two things
specifically? [CHANGE SPEAKER] I'll tell you where I believe that
commoncore is not necessarily where we're going to end up, that's what I
said before, so let me restate what I said before. The average
bureaucrat in Washington makes a hundred and two thousand dollars an
hour. Many of them have probably never actually been a teacher. [CHANGE
SPEAKER] A hundred and two thousand dollars an hour, wow. [CHANGE
SPEAKER] Probably one or two of them an hour, but no a hundred and two
thousand dollars a year, outside of a classroom, telling us how to teach
our children. And then they put strings attached to it to makes sure
they have control over. Teachers are frustrated with commoncore, they
have to have lesson plans, they have to have curriculum development, but
many of them would prefer to have things that they think best benefit
their children. So we need to have a methodical approach to saying
what's the best thing that we can do to improve the K through twelve
situation in North Carolina. And I think if we do it in a methodical
way, we don't answer the yes no questions, we don't bow to the pressure
of one group or another we're going to come up with a policy that will
be the best policy in K through twelve education in the country, and
that's what I've asked our members to do. Be methodical, answer the
questions honestly, but if there's an idea. You know, even a blind
squirrel finds a nut from time to time, there's a couple of ideas that I
think we should embrace, embrace them. But I think we're going to find
that most of it is not adding value and improving outcomes in a way that
we could do if we really sat down and try and work with the teachers,
the superintendents, and principals, and do it the right way, do it the
North Carolina way. One last [CHANGE SPEAKER] the second part, if you
don't mind, on film, ?? do you support the sunset of those ?? [CHANGE
SPEAKER] I defer to the leaders who have looked at it more closely, I
for one think that we can come up with a policy that would reward job
creation, but we generally speaking. You know, I don't think our members
save a few are totally for or totally against incentives, were for
things that create jobs and accrue a benefit to all tax payers. What we
need to do is see if we can come up with a framework that fits those
parameters, and were wide open to that. Hopefully we make progress
before the end of the short session. Last question [CHANGE SPEAKER] I
wanted to get back to the pay increases, do you have a number that you
want to see hit either for teachers or rank and file state workers, and
then how do you he lingering sense by some teachers and others that the
numbers</p>

Governor has proposed just isn't there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have confidence that over the next couple of weeks that you're going
to see us fulfill the promise that we made when we did the first press
conference with the Governor, and with Senator ??.  I will tell you some
of the people that are complaining and some of my colleagues in the
minority, it's a bit disingenuous coming from people who in 2010 had
unpaid furloughs for teachers and state employees.  One thing that
hasn't occurred over the last 3 years, when we had the worst fiscal
crisis in 2011, we didn't do furloughs unpaid, but the Democrats who are
now saying this is not enough are the people who sung the bass and
played fiscal games, we're not done, we're not going to do that, we're
going to see pay increases that get us to regional competitiveness next
year, national competitiveness the following year for our starting
teachers, we're going to see pay increases that recognize that state
employees deserve a raise, and as for the details, stay tuned, we'll get
the Governors budget today, and then we'll be making proposals over the
next couple of weeks.  But, make no mistake about it, these folks are
coming out with words, but if you look at their deeds they have failed
the teachers and failed the state employees for a good number of years
before we ever came into power.  We haven't been able to do as much as
we've wanted to, but a part of that has to do with we inherited the
leadership in the worst fiscal time since the Great Depression.  But,
we've made progress. I know people have forgot the 1.2% raise, it wasn't
enough, but it was at least a show of respect and to let the teachers
and the state employees know that they needed help and they're suffering
like a lot of other people under the policies of the folks that came
here before us.  Thank you very much.</p>
