  Okay. We have pages with us this morning. With the House we have
Reshonda Blue. We have a mic, could you tell us a little bit about
yourself please? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning. My name is Reshonda
Blue and I’m from Wake County. Representative Holley is my sponsor and
I’m happy to be here. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Glad to have you with us, and
Miles Hunt. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning. My name is Miles Hunt. I
have Representative Gill as my sponsor. I’m from Wake County. [SPEAKER

County and Josh Thompson is my sponsor and I’m happy to be here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Glad to have you with us. Are you ROTC or JRTOC?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir, Navy. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good. Good to have
you with us. And Sylvia Gregg, Senate Page. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Hi, I’m
Sylvia Gregg. I’m from Brunswick County and my sponsor is Senator Bill
Rabin. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good to have you with us. And Carson Honeycutt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Hi, I’m Carson Honeycutt. I’m from Warren County and
Senator Tillman is my sponsor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you so much. Good
to have you with us. I hope you’re having a good week and getting some
things out of the meetings. Sergeant at Arms, our House Sergeant at
Arms, DH Powell, David Linthicum, and our Senate Sergeant at Arms Marcus
Kitts and Charles Marcalis, I believe, there he is at the door. Thank
you very much and we’ve got again Mr. Charles is with us this morning to
carry on with his report to us and I think he’s probably getting fairly
close to the end of his task for this committee and he’s doing a good
job and has responded to several of our requests for information, so
with that unless there’s some comments from the committee members or the
chairs we will move forward. Mr. Charles? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Chair. I know you are excited to have me back. Today, today we’re
gonna cover the, today will be the last day of talking about the
Judicial Branch budget. Hold your applause to the end please. We will be
talking about the office of indigent defense services today which is the
other agency within the judicial branch of government and then I will go
through some follow up questions about AOC from the last week and then
the previous AOC discussion which I believe was, I don’t know, 2 years
ago? I don’t remember. It was a long time ago. There was snow on the
ground. It was very odd. So the office of indigent defense services,
this slide appeared in the JTS overview. This shows that the breakdown
of personal services and purchase services for IDS. Unlike most agencies
in JTS the IDS has a very large purchase services component, mostly
because IDS runs a fund that pays for private appointed counsel
attorneys and we’ll get into this as we go, but the personal services
side of IDS is the smallest of any of the agencies that you will hear
about in this committee. We’re going to turn to the 14th amendment to
the US Constitution which is part of the reason that we have an office
of indigent defense services and this goes through the Supreme Court
case on Gideon versus Wainwright, basically the point here is that no
person can be denied equal protection of the laws which is echoed in the
North Carolina Constitution. The agency itself came into being in 2000.
The General Assembly passed a bill that created a new agency to run the
indigent defense services. Before that there was a contract that was at
AOC, the pack fund was run by AOC but there were some concerns about its
administration and so IBS was off, it, AOC does remain responsible for
some IDS functions. The purchasing, so the purchasing division that we
heard about when we talked about AOC administration, personnel, so their

  and some IT, although there&#39;s been more of a sharing role in recent
years. And I think as we go forward it seems that there may be more
sharing there. I don&#39;t think I mentioned that the head of IDS is Mr.
Tom Maher. You all heard from him the other day, and he is here today.
IDS responsibilities. Overseeing the provision of legal representation
to indigent defendants. There are three ways that IDS currently does
this, mainly through the Private Appointed Counsel Fund. This is where
the Court appoints defense attorneys from a list that they will have at
First Appearance. This fund is active all throughout the state. There
are areas that have Public Defender offices. But even in those areas
there will be private appointed counsel. The Public Defender can take
some cases. Some cases there will be a conflict and the private
appointed counsel will be assigned. There is this newer kind of hybrid
contract defenders where IDS is offering a contract to certain private
appointed counsel attorneys for a set number of cases. We&#39;ll talk
about this a little bit as we go forward. I&#39;ve got a couple of
slides on it. And then there are state Public Defender offices. These
are in 16 of 41 District Court districts. These are attorneys who are
employees of the state to provide defense to indigent defendants. This
is how IDS&#39;s program budget breaks down. A big chunk of it goes to
the PAC Fund, the Private Appointed Counsel Fund. A smaller piece of it
to the Public Defenders. And a less than 2% slice for administration.
That is $2.4 million. Out of the PAC Fund, currently the way it&#39;s
set up, 51% of that is going to compensate PAC attorneys. 7% of it is
being used for these contract defenders that we&#39;ll talk about in a
minute. And about 2% of it goes to Prisoner Legal Services, which
I&#39;ve got a slide on that, too. From the Public Defender side, about
32% of the whole budget goes for the 16 local Public Defender offices.
And then there&#39;s another 6% for statewide specialty Public
Defenders. Again, we&#39;ll get into that as we go. I just wanted to
show you how these things break down. This is kind of a complicated
slide but this shows the budget history for Indigent Defense. This goes
back to the last five years and includes the current year as authorized.
This shows that the Public Defender section of the budget has been
growing, while the PAC section of the budget has been shrinking a little
bit. The amount for administration is that very tiny little blue-black
slice up at the top. I even had to move the numbers to the side so that
you could see it. That has stayed about the same. It&#39;s grown very
slightly but it&#39;s stayed roughly the same. And then there&#39;s a
section at the very top that&#39;s kind of set off in gray. This is a
shortfall that IDS has been running historically for the last five
years. I&#39;m sorry, I meant to do the shortfall slide next. I&#39;ll
explain the shortfall in just a second. Part of the PAC Fund is paid
through Recoupment 2, which is collected here, as you see at the top,
probationary collections, civil judgments. About 30% of it comes through
state income tax refunds that are captured at the state before
they&#39;re sent to the refunder and sent to back to IDS if they&#39;re
owed to Indigent Defense. And then through Lottery proceeds. IDS does
have some concerns, even though recoupment has been fairly stable for
the last few years, that under the new tax code, since there will be
fewer state income tax refunds they are worried that there will be less
money coming back to IDS through recoupment. There&#39;s also some
concern that as IDS shifts to this new contract system that it will be
harder to track the individual hours that an attorney is spending on a
case. So it will be harder to recoup the hours that the defendant owes
for compensating the attorney upon losing the case or getting a judgment
against him. IDS&#39;s caseload is growing. As you see at the top, this
is all noncriminal, nontraffic

  <p id="10:00">
  dispositions and that number is going down, and this tracks the
dispositions that we looked at when we talked about  AFC.  However, the
percentage that Indigent Defense Services takes of that has grown in
recent years.  And then over a ten year period, it&#39;s grown
significantly.  Okay, the private appointed counsel fund. This is the
fund that is used to compensate private attorneys for indigent defense
services.  This is the the short fall I mentioned. In recent years,
it&#39;s been started off at 9.9 million that was readjusted to 9.2
million for fisical year 10-11. Through some extra non recurring funds,
it dropped to 3.2 million in 13-14.  And currently, in the current
ficial year it&#39;s estimated to be at about 5 million dollar
shortfall.  So, what happens? The fact fund runs out of money.  And then
attorneys submit their claim to get recomponsated and then the last
month or two, sometimes, maybe sometimes a little more of that, of the
physical year, IDS does not have money to pay them. So, the attorneys
have to wait until the new fisical year to get compensated for their fee
applications.  Basically, the amount, the work that they have done that
has been approved by a judge sent to IBS.  They can&#39;t be compensated
until the money comes back in at the beginning of the fisical year.  And
some of the X factors here are the contract defenders.  The contract
defenders are going to get paid.  They have a contract so IDS has to
pull aside money to make sure they are going to be paid, even as the
pact fund is running out of money.  Current rates for private assigned
counsel to help meet some of the strains on the systems.  The Indigent
Defense Services Commission, cut the rates in 2011. They are currently
at $55.00 an hour for most district court cases.  $60.00 and hour for
most superior court cases, because of the 70 for serious felonies, 85
for Capital cases, unless they&#39;ve been declared non capital, at
which point the rate drops to $75.00.  The commision has stated JPS
Everside, and I think most of y&#39;all have been to JPS Everside and
hear this.  Their concern that this rate is too low. It&#39;s hard for
attorneys to meet their overhead at $55.00 an hour.  And, so this is a
concern that the commissioners brought forward. Contract Defenders
System.  This is a system that the general assembly directed IDS to
pursue in 2011. And it is expect to cut cost in the long term.  The idea
here is that IDS is collecting cases into what they call units, which is
estimated to be at about 20% of the time that an attorney can work in a
given year. So for the units themselves very in difficulty. There will
be a unit for adult misdemeanor, a unit for low level felonies, high
level felonies, and IDS has regional defenders that they have hired to
oversee this system, and to make sure that there are quality controls
are in place.  So, IDS puts these units out to bid, attorneys in the
district will bid on these units, and if they win the unit, they have
secured payments, secured work for the given time that they have this
contact.  There&#39;s some benifits too with having a regional defender
overseeing these unit, in that traditionally the pact attorneys, their
out of the district. They are kind of on their own.  And with having
these attorneys under contact with IDS gives IDS a level of oversight
that they did not have before.  They can go on and talk to the
attorneys, in a way that they did not have access to them before they
can provide them with educational materials.  They can make sure that
the units are working.  It&#39;s an interesting hybrid system right now.
 [SPEAKER CHANGE] Question. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Representive Jackson.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you. Is this the appropriate time? [SPEAKER
CHANGE] Sure. [SPEAKER CHANGE] You mentions earlier about the
dificulties with billing clients.  I mean billing the defendant when
they plea guilty or found guilty on the court appointed time.  Has there
been any analysis done on that? By IDS as far as what the contract
attornies are submitting to the courts.  Defendant are paying by?

  From the agency. I think they could probably tell you a little bit more
about the controls in place than I could. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Please
identify yourself. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] We do have a control in place
though I can’t tell you, sorry, specifically how much the drop may be
partly because we don’t, often don’t collect recoupment until a year or
two or three in the future through tax refunds and things of that
nature. The way the system works is when a contract attorney disposes of
a case we have an online reporting system where they report information
about the disposition and there is a built in function that makes them
print out a recoupment form which is provided to the judge to order
recoupment in a case that’s recoupment eligible. We are able to track
whether they printed that so we’re able to know the attorneys who have
recoupment eligible cases in fact printing the form and hopefully
providing it to the judge. What we have not analyzed, at least as of now
is the extent to which we are, judges are ordering less recoupment than
they might have had those cases been handled through the hourly roster
system. That’s something at some point we may be able to look into but
it’s a difficult analysis. Not impossible but difficult. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??]
just asking how this is a [??] in the House contract system is working.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s mixed to be honest. I think there’s a real
concern that people are not being paid enough for the work they’re
taking on and because of that there’s pressure to cut corners. They’re
not paid by the hour so to the extent they can spend fewer hours they
make more per hour and any system that depends on that just inherently
has some pressure and efficiency can be good but it can also involve
cutting corners. We have a built in system that in a particularly
difficult case people can come to us and get exceptional pay. That is
intended to relieve that pressure. We don’t see very many requests for
that so we have a concern about that. I know from talking to attorneys
that they feel overpressured by the work and underpaid. We have gone
through the renewal period for the first six counties and the vast
majority of people getting contract renewed. It may be because they
don’t have another alternative, but most of the people who are doing the
contract work continue to want to do it but I think they have real
concerns in the long term about whether the pay is sufficient for the
work they’re doing. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McNeill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes while he’s standing I just wanna
take off on something he said. My question is this, I know you said it’s
sometimes 2-3 years before you’re able to collect these fees from
people. Has the fact that we don’t report probationers back now for
failure to pay their fines and fees and everything like that, do you
think that’s attributable to your drop or has there been a drop in
collections? [SPEAKER CHANGES] There has been a drop, my understanding
is the primary, Thomas Matter, IDS, for this year I think the primary
driver of the drop is the change in tax withholding. We’ve seen a
significant drop in set off debt which is money that we collect from tax
refunds. More of a drop than we expected. We expected somewhat of a
drop. I’m not aware that we are collecting less significantly from
probation. It is my understanding, and I’m not in court on a daily
basis, but while you can’t be revoked for not paying that you can be
brought back in if you haven’t paid to determine why you’re not paying
and I guess in theory face a CRB or something, so I don’t think we’ve
seen it in probation. It’s certainly something we can look at, it’s
something I haven’t looked at, and see if that in fact is affecting it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That would be great. Thank you. Provide that to the
committee if you think there’s been a drop, a significant drop off
attributable to the fact that they’re not revoked now for failure to pay
those fines and fees. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We will do that. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just wanted to [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES]
They’re, I’m sorry, go ahead. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair.
They’re paid monthly and the next slide I talk a little bit about their
compensation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] Mr. Chairman, Mr. [??] apparently
at some point IDS was [??] is that right? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, Thomas
Maher, Director of IDS. The function that IDS performs up until the year
2000-2001 was part of the Administrative Office of the Courts, so there
wasn’t an IDS at all basically. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Why did it split off?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There was a study done, a legislative study done and
the report I think was in the year 2000 and I think there are a couple
concerns that led to the creation of IDS. One was that having an
independent agency that was focused on managing the resources

  <p id="20:00">
  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Would lead to better management and control of the
costs associated with indigent defense. And then secondly on a quality
and policy basis, that the defense function should be controlled by an
independent agency and should not be overseen primarily by judges who
are making decisions that there is a potential conflict when a judge is
deciding how much the defense attorney in front of them is being paid.
So it was a cost control and a quality concern.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. So you&#39;re saying that IDS is running
cheaper if it&#39;s independent than the AOC could run it as part of an
agency.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We believe so. In fact in our annual report, we report
what the cost per disposition is over the years, and it&#39;s been
remarkably flat, despite tremendous pressures and of course our entire
budget is for an indigent defense. When we don&#39;t control it we face
shortfalls, and we face shortfalls even with controlling it. So we are
acutely aware of the need to try to use resources we&#39;re given as
efficiently as we can.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bingham.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I know there&#39;s been a lot
of studies done, et cetera and from what I gather, the public
defender&#39;s offices are growing and, in your opinion, would the state
be better off to have two public defender&#39;s offices? I know
that&#39;s been discussed et cetera. Have there been any studies
comparing the two?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thomas Maher, Director of IDS. Senator Bingham, in
terms of the actual cost of providing representation compared to the
current low hourly rates we pay to the private lawyers, the honest
answer is the public defenders wouldn&#39;t save money. We already have
public defenders in the larger metropolitan areas, even some smaller
areas, and they just, on a cost basis, it&#39;s hard to compete to $55
an hour because it&#39;s hard for our lawyers, who are paid $55 an hour
quite frankly, to make a living. If the rates were raised to a more
sustainable rate, and we urge that to happen, then the public defenders
are a cost-effective alternative to that. There are other benefits to
having a public defender&#39;s office. Quite often, for example, they do
a very good job of handling cases up front, so jail populations are
lower. I&#39;ve gotten calls from county commissioners who don&#39;t
have a public defender saying, &quot;Can we have a public defender here,
it will help with the jail.&quot; I&#39;ve talked to DAs who think that
there&#39;s a real benefit to having an institutional defense voice to
deal with to make the courts more efficient. Their lawyers are often in
court when they need to be in court, they&#39;re not covering other
counties. So there&#39;s quality both in terms of the lawyering, the
training of young lawyers, and operating the system to having a public
defender. But the honest answer right now is it would not save money at
the rate we&#39;re currently paying private lawyers. There&#39;s also
some very rural counties where having a public defender is-or having any
system is a struggle. We have a public defender in the First District,
they cover the Second District because of the difficulty of finding
private assigned counsel. But covering a lot of counties with the big
geography and very little case load is just a struggle to be
cost-effective no matter how you do it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, this question is also for Mr. Maher.  I noticed
going back and looking at this chart at the shortfalls in the private
and assigned counsel. I&#39;ve noticed 2013-14 saw a significant drop to
the prior year of 7.9 to 3.2, and now this year it&#39;s projected to be
five million. I guess I have a two-pronged question then. Why is it
projected to be five this year, is that because of where we&#39;re at at
this point of the year? And also what did we do right in 2013 and 14 to
get this decrease that now it&#39;s going back up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thomas Maher, Executive Director of IDS. The answer is
the five million is projected based on our current payments and the
history of what we would expect. We&#39;re not quite three-quarters of
the way through the year, so it&#39;s an estimate and things could
change but probably not radically. In terms of why it had been going
down and now it&#39;s turned, there are a number of factors. One is, I
think William mentioned this, there was, I think a $3.7 million
non-recurring appropriation that helped reduce it to 3.2. There was an
offsetting $2 million recurring reduction based on the expected savings
from Class 3 misdemeanors. We were, to be honest, skeptical that we
would save that much, and I don&#39;t believe we&#39;ve saved that much.
So the 3.7 was not, it was offset by a cut that didn&#39;t produce
savings. In addition, for a period of time when we reduced the rates, we
were still paying some fee applications at the old rate, and it&#39;s
  </p>

component. We have begun what we call the systems evaluation project.
We&#39;ve
been fortunate to get a grant to work on it that will allow us to
analyze these
kind of outcomes. We have not yet done that. We are in the process of
doing
that. It&#39;s a big data project, but we&#39;re working on it. I can
tell you without
a data study that I know for example in New Hanover, which is a
relatively new
public defender office, when they first got set up, and shortly after
they
started there was a reduction in the jail population which I think was a
result
of at least handling the front end of the cases more efficiently.
We used to have a county funded position in Durham that was an assistant
public
defender who covered first appearances and it was because the county saw
value
in at least getting people out of jail and if the case can be resolved,
being
resolved. That position went away. We&#39;re certainly looking at that
issue but I
don&#39;t have a study to report back to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow Up? Representative Turner?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Mr. Maher for being
here. I
was wondering.. I heard two years ago, I heard the the county was being
considered for public defender and ?? was gathering information about
that and
I had several complaints that what ??  ?? accused him ?? and then
we&#39;ll have
to pay double ?? appointed and then the public defender gets paid for
their
time anyway. Do you have any comment on that, and has there been an
improvement
in that situation? ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thomas Maher, Executive Director of IDS. The issue of
conflicts is obviously an ongoing one and under the law in North
Carolina and I
think every state, a public defender&#39;s office is treated like a law
firm which
means if one lawyer has a conflict, nobody in the office can represent
the
client. And that&#39;s true for private lawyers. They may have a
conflict. We
expect that public defenders have a certain percentage of case-specfic
conflicts. They can&#39;t represent that client. They are usually pretty
good at
identifying that up front. For example, if two defendents are arrested
for the
same crime, they&#39;re in a good position to identify that fact and
make sure that
one of those defendents is farmed out. It is invariable though, that as
the
case progresses you may learn of a new witness, which turns out you
represented
in the past, or something comes up where you have to withdraw although
you&#39;ve
already started the work. That is also true for the private lawyers. In
fact,
we built this contract system. One of the things we looked at is,
&quot;Okay, not
every case that we give to a lawyer gets resolved by that lawyer because
of
this issue&quot;, and built in the fact that we&#39;re gonna have
certain number of
withdrawals and we&#39;re gonna have to have new lawyers assigned. I
have not heard
that the public defenders are worse at that than the private lawyers. I
think
in general when the system&#39;s set up they&#39;re probably better at
identifying
those because they are able at the intake to look through their case
management
system, identify conflicts, and farm them out if it exists at the
beginning of
the case.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up? Representative Dave Jackson and then
Representative Stephens.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe ?? expected this year&#39;s backlog to be $5
million
dollars? Is that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thomas Maher, Director of IDS. Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And how much have you requested that we freeze the tax
break?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thomas Maher, Director of IDS. To begin we store the
rates at
$5 increments so for each of the various rates that you&#39;ve seen
we&#39;ve asked for
funding for those to go up by $5 an hour.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And how much would a $5 increase affect the budget?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thomas Maher, Director of IDS. Our estimate is for a
fully
annualized cost. I think it&#39;s about $6.5 million. The first year
would not, I
believe, be fully annualized, depending upon when it came into effect.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And so your numbers are close and so maybe you know
what I&#39;m
getting at. Given the choice would you prefer to get rid of your backlog
and
start the year fresh and pay people all the time, do you think attorneys
would
rather have $5 an hour or would they rather know come May and June,
they&#39;re
gonna get paid...

  should not have to wait &#39;til July and August to get for--to get more
space.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thomas Maher, Director of IDS, I&#39;ve actually thought about that
issue, if I was given a choice. And the answer depends upon whether it
is a sustainable backlog that doesn&#39;t grow. If the backlog continued
to grow because of kind of built-in underfunding, then I think we need
to deal with the backlog because at some point that just becomes
unsustainable and probably not responsible budgeting. I suspect for most
of the attorneys who are struggling to pay--and we&#39;ve just done a
survey and we&#39;re going to--of the pack--we&#39;re going to release a
report--we have a significant number of lawyers, for example, who
don&#39;t have health insurance, can&#39;t make payments, can&#39;t have
an office. They would probably prefer the $5 an hour, recognizing that,
come May or June, they may not get paid &#39;til July because they can
build that in. Not paying them enough, but doing it more timely, still
leaves them underpaid. Paying them slightly better with a two-month
delay, assuming it didn&#39;t grow and it wasn&#39;t kind of a
structural problem, is not great, but it&#39;s better in terms of their
willingness to continue staying in the system and doing the work.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Representative Stevens?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you. Mr. Maher, is there a study that&#39;s been done comparing
private-assigned counsel previously to current public defender&#39;s
office? For example, New Hanover County&#39;s got a public defender.
What were we paying private-assigned counsel before? What are we paying
public defender, and any conflict private attorneys? Do we have those
numbers in terms of what it results in savings?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thomas Maher, Director of IDS. The short answer is we haven&#39;t done a
specific cost-effectiveness between the current public defender pay
structure and what the private-assigned counsel would be at the old
$75-an-hour rate. I would be shocked if most of them were not cost
effective, because last time I looked at it, which is maybe about a year
or so ago, most of them become cost effective at less then $75 an hour.
A lot of the work is done in district court, where currently we&#39;re
paying $55 an hour. That&#39;s the biggest drop. So it would not take
full restoration of the rates, in my opinion, though I haven&#39;t
looked at it--done the math--to make most of the larger or mid-sized
public defender offices cost effective. There are some smaller ones that
exist for reasons that have nothing to do with cost effectiveness, like
the First District, where they’re just not going to be, because
there&#39;s not an effective roster system to compare them to.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Follow up. The answer is there really hasn&#39;t been a study?
SPEAKER CHANGES
There&#39;s not a current study. We have old studies at the $75-an-hour
rate. Those public defenders were cost effective. There has been some
increase in the cost for public defenders--for state employee raises,
things of that nature--that reduce their ability to access the full
allotment. Those increases, I don&#39;t think, would make up the
difference between the $75 an hour at which they were cost effective and
the current lower rates. But I haven&#39;t actually done the study.
SPEAKER CHANGES
A different question, please. On your contract rate--this is the first
time I guess I&#39;ve seen enough that I could start to make some
questions--it appears that you&#39;ve collected cases in units that you
believe would be equivalent to 360 hours, 360 billable hours, and were
paying basically $55 an hour for the 360 hours? How is it worked ??
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thomas Maher, Director of IDS. They&#39;re actually paid--if they
actually work 360 hours, they&#39;re paid about $5 an hour less. We
designed these to be cost effective, we&#39;ve got shortfalls. The other
thing we took into account is that one benefit of a contract system is
that attorneys are guaranteed a caseload. So for example, with the
misdemeanor contract where they  take one caseload unit, they get about
ten cases a month. In some places, that&#39;s significantly more than
they might get under roster, and our studies show that, at least up to a
point, increasing the caseload reduces the amount of time per case.
There&#39;s efficiencies to being in court on multiple cases instead of
one case. So the expectation is that they will, in fact, under a
contract system, spend less time per case than a larger number of
attorneys would have spent under a roster system. And so the expected
efficiencies are built into the rate in order to generate some savings
from the contract system.
SPEAKER CHANGES
I can follow up on that. So based on the numbers I&#39;m trying to put
here together a little bit, they basically get about fifteen hundred a
month to take to take ten cases a month, and those cases are just
whatever the judge assigns?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Yes. Thomas Maher, Director of IDS. In essence, what had been with
a--different districts have different lists for assigning counsel, but
generally they break down to the less serious cases, misdemeanors, are
district court, and the more serious. Contract attorneys are basically
on--the contracts are basically three lists. One is misdemeanor,
district court work; one is low-level felonies; and one is high-level
felonies. And the appointment system uses those as a list. So as a
client is given a court appoint

  ??either the public defender and public defender district or the judge
in the non-public defender district will go through those lists and
appoint and they then each month let us know through this online system
what cases they have been appointed, so we actually make sure they are
getting cases and not just sit there resolving them, so that each month
tell how many cases, like that.
[Speaker changes]
And I understand the problem that you have been talking about this
morning with low rates and everything like that. My question is this:
based on the low rates you’d think that if the rates were that low then
the attorney would not be bidding for this work. Are you saying any
problem finding attorneys to be at this work? Is the competition still
good for this. And if it is, what you would attribute that to, not just
that much work out there for the attorneys, so this is basically the
only game in the town? What’s the climate out there.
[Speaker Changes]
Thomas ?? ?? Directed by the … We’ll have the fuller report from our
scrap form from our surveys from the private house council to find out
how much, what changes are happening. I can tell you that we are losing
experienced attorneys. Tons of warm bodies in many places we have enough
attorneys, many of them are very young, they do not have much experience
and there is nothing wrong with having them gain some experience, for
example and just for record. But they are not in the level where they
can handle more serious, complicated cases and that’s where I think we
can see the most attrition. There are some, it is not uniform throughout
the States, there are some counties where it is becoming more a problem
to find attorneys who are willing to take cases at all. There are tends
to be smaller counties where young attorneys may not be moving to and
there are few attorneys to choose from. There is a mix of problems.
There are some counties where we are beginning to have problem finding
attorneys at all, other counties where there are attorneys willing to do
the work but they often don’t have much experience and while most of the
people who work on the contract system renewed, not all of them did.
There was a percentage that said we have done this, it is too much work
for what have been paid. We thought they were good attorneys, but they
chose not to re-opt. In some counties, quite frankly, we make phone
calls asking people to apply, convince them to apply. Probably brunt a
few friendship for people I have talked in to doing this, who now are
not so happy. It is a problem we’ll very much like to fix it before it
becomes more of a problem because keeping a system going is, in my view,
better than waiting till it is totally broken and having tried finding
attorneys come back in to the system they already left.

The slide shows the role out of contract defender system. This is a

prosecutorial map so the counties that are in color here are counties
that have a local public defender office, counties that are shaded are
counties where the contract system has been rolled out to this point. We
have talked about this to some extent at this point. But this is from
the ?? contract defender report. This is how the compensation has been
broken down. The annual compensation will be paid monthly broken down
to, basically will be divided by twelve and per case compensation has a
range on it too, based on the number of case that actually fell within
the unit. This is IDA personnel. The specially defender and ?? defenders
are both paid under the public defender budget which represents 95% of
IDS employees, 5013 FTE. Administration is 23 FTE with 4% of the IDS
FTE. Public defenders are split in to six districts.  Public defender
offices, we have talked about to some extent. And

  <p id="45:00">
  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Of specialty defenders.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you have a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Maher. If I could ask you a question. How many
lawyers do you have in the Office of the Capital Defender?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thomas Maher, Director of IDS. I think, and we&#39;re
going from memory, I&#39;ll double check this, that between the various
offices, we have 17 attorneys who are handling potentially capital cases
within that office.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What kind of caseload, what kind of caseload do they
have?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Each carries in the neighborhood of eight potentially
capital cases at a time. We actually have a policy both for the ??
counsel and I think in theory applies to them that they shouldn&#39;t
carry more without my specific permission. Now if somebody is in a
position to take an additional case, I will take a look at what the
nature of their cases are, if they&#39;ve been, if a lot of them have
been declared non-capital, or if they&#39;re close to being resolved, I
will allow them to handle more than that, but the target is eight cases
becauses a number of them are death penalty cases.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] How many cases-capital cases do they try a year?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thomas Maher, Director of IDS. Within those particular
lawyers working for the capital defender, in terms of capital trials,
there&#39;ll only be a few actual capital trials a year that they would
be involved in because there aren&#39;t that many capital trials within
the state in a year, but they are involved. When there are capital
trials, it&#39;s not uncommon to have one of them or both of them as
counsel. I know there are-I kind of, when there actual capital trials,
which I tend to know what&#39;s going on, as quite often either one or
two  of the assistant capital defenders is involved. I can&#39;t tell
you a specific number of trials, though. off the top of the head.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And the last question, what are the 17 ?? lawyers
paid?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  There&#39;s a range. Thomas Maher, Director of IDS.
The, there are some lawyers there who have in excess of 20 years
experience, and they&#39;re paid substantially more. I would think when
you include longevity some of them are making 90 or 100,00 or more. Now
there&#39;s a significant number who are much younger. Although
they&#39;re experienced, they&#39;ve come from other places, they&#39;re
making less than that. We could clearly get a list of the salaries for
those, but there&#39;s a range, just like there&#39;s a range of
experience within the office.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other questions? President Stevens?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just, sort of following up on that one, they&#39;re
potential capital cases, so at what point do these attorneys get
involved? Is it when the district attorney indicates they&#39;re going
to seek the death penalty? Or is it immediately when they&#39;re charged
do they simply view it as potential capital?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thomas Maher, Executive Director of IDS. The short
answer is both. The capital defender makes appointment decisions. They
have some information about a case at the time an appointment needs to
be made. If, the way it works is in a potential capital case, the judge
will determine that the defendant is indigent and then notify the
capital defender&#39;s office that will make the appointment. They will
take a look at availability of attorneys, where the case is, you can
tell sometimes from the nature of the case off the bat, the likelihood
that it will be capital and take that into account. But the defendant at
that point is entitled to one attorney. If and when the district
attorney in a Rule 24 motion declares that it&#39;s capital, then a
second attorney would be appointed. And at that point obviously it&#39;s
known that that is a capital case.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. There appear to be, if I&#39;m doing my
math correctly, and maybe it&#39;s done differently, there would be four
capital attorneys in each of these regional offices?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thomas Maher, Executive Director of IDS. The Durham
office has more, and then we&#39;ve got the Wilmington office that may
only have three, Winston, Buncome I thought only had two and Forsyth may
have three or four, I don&#39;t remember exactly. Certainly we have that
information.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And then we also pay the cost of keeping up each of
those offices?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. So the five specialty defenders
we&#39;ve talked about the capital defender. The juvenile defenders have
three FTE, the juvenile defender mostly does education for attorneys
dealing with indigent, in cases dealing with indigent individuals. The
appellate defender has 25 FTEs, that is both attorneys and staff in
juveniles. The appellate defender has 25 FTE, that is both attorneys and
staff. And there&#39;s an Office of Parent Representation that is part
of the appellate defender&#39;s office. There&#39;s also the Office of
Special Counsel, dealing with mental health issues with satellite
offices at the major mental health hospitals around the state. IDS

  The total of 23 FTE, general fund funded FTE. This breaks down with most
of the staff there being in financial, being financial staff dealing
with paying of attorneys, the collection of set off debt that we talked
about. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The General Assembly
directed IDS to create a fee transparency online web application last
year and IDS has created this. This posed searchable information from
fee apps with the information that’s listed below. It is now searchable
from the IDS main page. There is a link for fee transparency and you can
click on the applicant there. The repair line of prison or legal
services, sustained, this is a pass through contract, that’s paid out of
the hack fund section of IDS budget. Prison or legal services provides
legal advice to inmates who have submitted a motion for appropriate
release, they identified sentencing errors, they handle post-conviction
litigation for legitimate claims and they explain legal status when
there is no legitimate claim and this helps to cut down on per se
filings. In the Court Commission there was some discussion about how
these motions for appropriate relief do clog the aid offices. After the
reduction in fiscal year 2013-14, POS no longer reviews civil claims. At
this point they look at 14 attorneys total at this point or not
attorneys, 14 staff, excuse me. And the same year there was the low
level misdemeanor classification. Mr. Maher referred to this already.
This led to a $2 million cut for IDS. At this point class 3 misdemeanors
face intermediate punishment, the possibility of jail time only with 4
or more convictions, so with fewer than 4 prior convictions with no
possibility of jail time there should be no state funded attorney
assigned. There’s been some confusion out in the field about how to
implement that. My understanding is that there is a report in CJ Leads
that’s helped to ease some of these challenges. These are re. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] [??] done with the [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] If I could just make
a comment on that. I could tell you that what I see in district court.
I’m not in criminal district court, but I can tell you that our district
court judges have really struggled with this change and I totally
believe what IDS says about they haven’t seen this $2 million savings
because what this requires, it requires the first court [??] a judge to
actually go through and look at a criminal history record to make sure
do you have the three or more previous convictions or not and there is
oftentime the person is charged with, they’ve got a case in that court
room, they’ve got a case in a different court room in a different day,
maybe they’ve got a court appointed attorney on one case but not another
and I think the fault of the judges is just let’s make sure these
people’s constitutional rights are protected and so we’re just gonna
appoint someone even if it turns out they’re not eligible for jail time.
That appears to be my experience and anything that IDS or AOC could tell
me, you know, tell us about [??] then I’d appreciate it if you’d [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I reckon this is my time to put in a shameless plug
for the Courts Commission but it’s an issue that we’ve brought up in
there and discussed and we’re willing to take on any studies you’d like
us to do and some of the things we’ve looked at is are there sentences
we could simply almost turn into infractions or are there classes that
we could actually say no matter what your prior history they’re gonna
come on down, so anything you’d like us to study or look at please let
us know. We’ll take it on. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Question, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The final site here discusses recent legislative
actions to IDS. In 2013 there’s the reduction to prisoner legal services
that I mentioned. There’s also a reduction related to the low level
misdemeanor reclassification and there was a reduction to administrative
staff of $250,000. The additional pack funds also appear here. That was
the 3., I think it was just over 3.75, 3.76, something like that

  3.8 is basically what it came out to in terms of non-recurring funds
since the idea is to help manage the shortfall and in 2014 there was an
administrative reduction of about a half a million dollars and salary
and benefits reserve, this was the raises, about $800,000 so that
totaled out to positive 335,000. This concludes my presentation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, we need to give Mr. Charles a few moments to
respond to some questions. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??]
and I did [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Dear drivers. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??]
the lottery prices. Want to [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe this works
a lot like the state income tax refunds, that this is money that is
captured at, is it the Treasurer’s Office I would think catch it or no?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] I have the bill regarding that. That’s one of the
concerns about my lottery confidentiality bill. Apparently when someone
wins the lottery or a significant prize the lottery commission searches
for these sorts of debts owed to the state just like the state income
tax would and they would deduct that from their check and no, my bill
would not change that. [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s my hesitation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thomas Farr, Executive Director of IDS. Would you pay
for some interpreters? I’m not sure of the specific question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] [??] salaries. I mean, I’m sure that these people like that in
terms of [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thomas Farr,
Executive Director of IDS. There’s actually is, I think the best way to
describe it, there’s kind of a split responsibility for this language
access service. In court interpreting is generally born by the
Administrative Office of the Courts. When we have interpreters, for
example, helping the lawyer communicate with the client outside of court
that’s our responsibility. [SPEAKER CHANGES] On that last slide, just an
explanation of the $800,000 salary and benefits reserve. That seems like
a large number. Is that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That was the $1,000 raises,
sir. I’m sorry. Thank you, Mr. Chair. That was the $1,000 raises I
believe and the accompanying amount of salary and benefits that went out
to other agencies. I believe there’s a part of that that could go to the
retirement fund too. I’d have to go back and look at my budget from last
year specifically to figure out how it breaks down. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s something you could provide then? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh, yes, sir.
Very easily. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] Every, in essence, last year when they did the
salary increase and the benefit, associated benefit retirement changes,
for the first time those were budgeted in the agency’s budget which was
something you had not seen in the past and this could have been a bit
[??] in the front of the budget and [??] see it. That’s maybe why
they’re sticking out at you this year. For the first time they were
budgeted at the agency level. [??] they had I think it was $600,000 in
salary increases and then a health benefit increase and then a
retirement increase in the retirement but in an amount that had to be
appropriated for retirees. So you’ll see the same thing, I’ll have it on
my DHHS slides tomorrow and then you’ll see it when we do DPF as well.
The number in DPF’s much bigger. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Stevens. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So the same level, we
gave $1,000 per employee increase, salary increase, when  did that come
in to this to help insurance benefits and retirement cause that’s
getting close to 2,000. Not quite. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me grab the
phone. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Getting close to 2,000 per employee. [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If all else fails we go to the book. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
There’s a book. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is it, is in the $1,000 of the [??]
included benefits. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It does include benefits, yeah, but
the initial benefit, how much is the benefit per person then? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] [??] $600 or $700 you have [??]
