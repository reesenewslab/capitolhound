[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. Please be seated. About five weeks ago, when I was

wife and I looked behind us to see who they were talking about. What an
honor this is to be here tonight in these beautiful chambers. Mister
speaker, lieutenant governor, mister president pro tempore, governor
Martin who I think is in the audience. Please give a round of applause
for governor Martin. He's been a mentor and a friend and a next door
neighbor. Members of the court, members of the general assembly, and I
also must recognize eight very very hard working people during the last
six weeks and even before that, people who are making tremendous
sacrifices working for state government along with many of you and that
is my cabinet. I'd like all eight members of my cabinet and other
members of my staff to please stand up, you are doing an outstanding job
and I'm proud to have you to be a part of our team. Thank you very much.
??, this is the earliest I've seen you out of your office. I also want
to give a special hello to former governor Jim Holshouser. He's back
home. He had to deal with an immediate issue that came up tonight but I
just want to let you know he's healthy, he's strong, we had a great
conversation today and the governor Holshouser thanks for all your
wisdom and your service to this state. I've really appreciated it. Also,
more than anything else, I welcome the fellow citizens of North
Carolina. You know, I first came to Rawley in nineteen sixty seven as a
fifth grader from Jamestown elementary school to tour this magnificent
chamber. It seems just like yesterday. My</p>

Speaker: Goal is governor is to insure that the fifth graders that were
seen today yesterday and will see tomorrow they are taking the same tour
that i took 46 years ago will also get same work opportunities to live
work play and raise a family and in greatest states of united states of
America and that state is north Carolina,but to make that happen we
cannot accept the statues ?? we cannot live off a brand that needs
updating and major ?? not only compete with our neighbors but to compete
with the rest of the world tonight you will hear ?? of our state but
also some recommended actions that our economy state during the turn i
already know during the state tenure here i have already stepped on some
toes both left and tight i 'm not doing it to cause pain ?? that we must
solve our serious problems now to prevent pain for future generations
that why we are here tonight but one thing i have learned i have learned
during my fourteen years ?? when you try to peace everyone you satisfy
no one what motivates me every morning when i so privilege to get up
here and  ?? as your governor as an opportunity to take part in long
term solutions you must be here not only to represent next generation
but also hardworking men and women who get up everyday in the morning
and take responsibilities for their family manufacturing completely
shift worker with everyday demands to improve quality and ?? knowing
that if it is not achieved that plant may move to shut down not only to
competition united states but after world that's pressure the emergency
room doctors and nurses even our ??  throughout north Carolina who sadly
have to take care enough patients and knows fighting addiction in our
emergency room ?? the farmers who were constantly trying to save their
crops approaching hurricane tornado or storm the hard working ?? cannot
get funds for needed technologies the health students learn and the
sixty year more people who along with me get time in their jobs to what
in kine for over hour and half to get their drivers license renewed we
are here to represent these people and all the people of north Carolina
that specially those people right now are looking for work that is our
goal right now represent all of our people we obviously have lot of
people work together  but my team and i choose to look at these
challenges look at these challenges as opportunities these are
opportunities for every one of us therefore our administration is gonna
focus focus all of their time on three key functions our economy ,our
education and efficiency of our services let's start with the efficiency
first reviewing the budget numbers as we speak and right now next year's
budget provides no new money for revenues so like families and cost we
must live within our budget we must ?? on how we spent our limited
dollars during our first five weeks we had to work on things that we did
not anticipate that's the part of leadership many of the were working on
their same issues this is because those people in Washington required to
make tough decision in work on two master programs of affecting all of
north Carolina is Washington policies are passed with little
understanding or discussion of short terms or long term impact in our
state services and our state tax payers i will not outsource this tough
decisions i was elected to do what is right,</p>

<p id="10:00">
For the people of North Carolina. Now, after extensive reviews in this
brief time that we were given, I have concluded that our government,
like working families throughout our state, must first pay off its debt.
Pay off its credit card. Which in this state's case is $2.5 billion.
Therefore, tomorrow I will sign House Bill 4 to protect our small
businesses from continued over taxation. This will ensure our citizens'
unemployment safety net is secure and financially sound for future
generations. This is the reason I'm signing this bill. These are not
easy decision. But I know one thing. Borrowing from Washington with no
idea or plan on how to pay for it ends with this administration right
now. We aren't going to do it any longer. We are not going to borrow
money from Washington with no idea on how to pay it back. A recent audit
showed that the past administration overspent on Medicaid by $1.4
billion over the past three years. Georgia is able to deliver Medicaid
services at a cost of $4,000 per patient, while North Carolina's
delivery cost is over $6,000 per patient. We must fix this and
strengthen our existing Medicaid system prior to putting at risk further
tax dollars in our broken system. But I must ask all of you to please
give my team the time and the flexibility to first stop the bleeding.
Please, please minimize the reports that you're requiring from our
administration right now. This is just last week. Please minimize
report. I know you have a lot of work to do, and a lot of review. But
please let my administration fix the problem and stop the bleeding now.
We also need your help, and I will be requesting your help through
legislation, to streamline the process of the Office of Administrators
Hearings where delays, delay after delay, are adding millions of dollars
to our costs as we speak today. We must change legislation which allows
us to break through this very costly appeal process. Then we can all
work together with hospitals, with doctors, with insurance companies,
with patients on reforming this broken system. This is the Number One
priority that's been put in our lap, and we have to fix it together. And
we will fix it together. In other areas of inefficiency, and frankly
basic neglect of state operations during the past decade, my
administration is taking immediate action. Our administration is moving
IT equipment in over 30 identified, in the last five weeks, unsafe
locations to ensure that the safety of our employees is protected, and
also the integrity of our IT systems. We've already had one fire. We
don't want to have another. My budget will provide substantial funding
to fix and repair state properties and our broken IT systems in North
Carolina government. We will be requesting legislation to expand efforts
to implement electronic tracking. Tracking systems for state vehicles,
an area where we don't currently have any accountability. In addition,
we are right sizing vehicles where possible to reduce cost and fuel use,
saving hundreds of thousands of dollars each year. We are also
requesting legislation to address state personnel</p>

and productivity issues. This is very serious issue for our cabinet, and
for other people in the councel states who have communicated this issue
to me. We want to reward our talented state employees. But seat warmers
must be a thing of the past [applause]. But I want to also say, we have
to continue to attract, retain, reward and appreciate our state talent
that works so hard for all of us in state government. Let's also give
them a round of applause [applause]. Now let me say-- tell you a few
other things that we're trying to fix regarding short-term and long-term
operations. We recently found out that we inherited a system that has
been double billing on the triangle expressway. Our administration has
already fixed this issue, customer accounts have been refunded, and each
one of those customers that were double billed have been called and
given a personal apology [applause]. That's the culture of state
government that we must have: a culture of customer service. I'd like to
thank our secretary of transportation for his role-model leadership and
delivery, and this excellent customer service in a very short period of
time. But Tony, I charge you with several other projects. First and
foremost: fix the DMV [applause]. And while you're at it, Mister
Secretary, can you please fix the lights on the highways throughout
North Carolina? And will all respect, can you start on I-85 and I-77
interstate in Charlotte, my home town [applause]. We would appreciate
that. Malcolm Brown I know appreciates that. You know most people don't
think of criminal justice, addiction, and mental health issues as
priorities when we work to stream-line government. But as former mayor,
I've seen first hand the collateral damage for families, our communities
and tax payers if we continue to sweep these issues under the rug.
Recently, our first lady and I visited the Durham Rescue Mission. We
were moved by the stories of addiction and it's impact on families.
After meeting many of the people at the mission, and my wife has now
been there twice. Ann said it best, and I'm quoting her, &quot;So many
of us could sit back and say why don't these people get out of it. Why
don't they just quit doing drugs. Why don't they just leave this
battered situation?&quot; And she concluded by saying the following,
&quot;These women and men have more courage than I can fathom in this
entire state.&quot; I want to introduce my wife Ann, and two heroes of
ours from the Durham Mission who have successfully turned their lives
around in fighting their own addiction. Fighting their own addiction
battle, and also preserving their family. Please welcome our first lady,
Ann [Reprory], and our special guests, Mike and Rebecca Alrid. May God
bless you and thank you for your hard work [applause]. Ann your ovation
was bigger than mine, I just want to make a point of that. I'm so proud
of Mike and Rebecca. Their story can be repeated in every of the 100
counties in North Carolina, and we have to do everything that we can</p>

to help this terrible addiction issue throughout North Carolina. For the
sake of North Carolina families I ask you to please send me legislation
which will reestablish our drug treatment course and also increase
penalties for those who setup meth labs in our communities. I will sign
both of those pieces of legislation immediately. I have also instructed
my head of public safety because this issue of drugs and alcohol are
just penetrating our families and our communities. I've instructed my
head of public safety to ensure that all state law enforcement officials
will fight a coordinated effort against the cartel drug rings that are
currently in North Carolina as we speak. We can not ignore, we must
identify them and we must get the state, get them out of this state now.
The sheriffs will tell you this. We need to let people know about this
serious issue. I also want to collaborate with our educational leaders
to ensure that our schools and universities have a strategy to change
the culture. To change the culture that I have seen first hand of binge
drinking and so called recreational drug use. There must be enforcement
in our schools and universities of their own policies and enforcement of
our laws. In addition we must offer to help to these students who are
doing harm to their selves and to our families. This is not a laughing
matter. This is not something that they're just going through a time of
their life. They're causing serious harm to themselves and their
families and we must offer help both through enforcement and through
counseling. That must start now or we're gonna continue to have these
terrible mental health issues for generations to come. Speaking of
education this is an area that I have passion for. I had my teaching
degree at Catawba College. It's another major focus for moving forward
on because North Carolina's been known around the country as a leader in
education and innovation in the classroom. But we can not rest on our
past reputation or our morals. We must continue reform our education
system to stay ahead of the competition, not just in the United States
but throughout the world. Last year, I'm sad to report that 14,000 kids
dropped out of our North Carolina schools. 14,00 kids dropped out of our
schools. 30% of our children weren't able to read at grade level. 65% of
our high school graduates who enter our community colleges need remedial
math or reading. We can all agree on the importance of improving
education because our competitive future depends on it. But tonight we
must begin to change the debate on education. Instead on focusing the
debate only on the budget we now must demand results. We must ensure
that our schools are preparing our students for success by effectively
teaching them both the knowledge, both the knowledge and the skills,
that will help them lead productive lives and also find jobs. The
disconnect right now that I've seen between employers not able to find
qualified talent even with our high end unemployment rate and the
citizens unable to get jobs must be resolved through education. Senator
I know you're working on this and I appreciate it. Market base needs
must be an important factor in education funding, curriculum, and
results. That's why my administration is seeking to expand strategic
partnerships between the education community and the business community.
My budget will promote this philosophy in pre-k , k-12, community
colleges and our university system. I have strongly advocated for two
pathways success in our high schools, vocational and higher college
education.</p>

<p id="30:00">
All of our 100 districts use that money on technology and virtual
learning. This is the future. Why don’t we be ahead of the curve as
opposed to behind the curve? This begins right now. Now, third, and most
important, the number one focus is on the economy and jobs because there
are a lot of people out there hurting right now.  You know it.  I see it
and it’s tough. We’ve got to do everything we can to help people want to
work and get work. And today, North Carolina’s unemployment rate
continues to be the fifth-highest unemployment rate in the country.
This is our North Carolina.  Our number one priority as your governor is
to make sure that we are doing absolutely everything possible to make
North Carolina an engine for job creation. North Carolina’s economic
development brand has not been updated and we’ve looked. It has not been
updated since the 1980s. Governor Martin, thank you, but it’s time we
update your plans. Simply put, our competition in other states have
caught up to us and many times, we have to admit, beating us. We’re
going to develop a long-term strategic plan, Madame Secretary, that
updates our brand and puts us on a path to success. The first part of
that plan is to fix and modernize our tax system in North Carolina.
We’ve got to do it. I know many of you have been working on this for 50
or 60 years.  It was even in Governor Martin’s speech, I think. But the
fact of the matter is our current system is out of date. It was written
in the 1930s. It no longer applies to the modern economy. We must have
an economic and tax policy in North Carolina that is simple, that is
competitive, that is modern, and that is pro-growth. This policy must
reward our people and businesses that build things, produce things, grow
things, and innovate things.  We cannot live off the services through
loan or government jobs. We’ve got to help those people that build
things and make things and produce things and innovate things. Our tax
policy needs to be updated to help those industries. My friend, Joel
Ford, even stood up.  I’m proud of you, Joel.  Thank you. We will work
together.  We will work together on this plan which should meet the
following criteria. Lower rates on personal income and businesses to be
more competitive at least with our next door neighbor. Close loopholes
for special interest to make our system more fair and transparent. It
must be revenue neutral.  We must implement this plan systematically and
strategically to ensure that we don’t put at risk business confidence or
crucial revenue needed for services to our citizens.  A tax reform is
just one tool that we have to build our economy.  We have many other
tools to make this economy start igniting again. During the past decade,
we have sat on the sidelines for far too long on energy exploration. At
a time when our country needs to be more energy-independent, at a time
when our gas prices right now are going up amongst every day and at a
time when our people need jobs, sadly we are in the catch up mode with
other regions of the country. And those states that went first have the
lowest unemployment rates in the country. This administration will move
closely, working with all of you to get North Carolina into the energy
business and begin the process of energy exploration in a safe and
environmentally sound way.  Last week, I proudly joined the governors.
One minute, they’re my competitors and the next minute, they’re my
partners. But I joined the governors of South Carolina and Virginia to
request federal authority to begin offshore exploration in North
Carolina.</p>

not gonna be deterred by those who want to keep the status quo. The way
we've always been doing things in North Carolina. We've got to change.
We've got to adapt. We've gotta be visionary for the future. We're gonna
stay focused despite what some of the critics say. We're gonna stay
focused on fixing the economy, transforming education, and improving
government efficiency. I'm gonna say it one more time fixing the
economy, transforming education and improving government efficiency.
None of this can be about politics, power, legacy, turf, or who gets the
credit. Who cares? This is about the people of North Carolina. This is
why we're here. This is why each one of you are taking time away form
your families everyday to work right here, our state capitol, to have
this privilege. It's about the people of North Carolina. It's not about
power or turf or legacy. It's about solving problems and developing long
term solutions. We can not achieve these goals alone inside the bubble
of government. There's no way. We've got to get out of here
occasionally. Our approach must be outward. Starting tomorrow I and I
ask all of you to bring this message to our citizens on main streets
across our beautiful state. Achieving these goals during our term in
office will not be easy. It's gonna be tough. But we have to fulfill and
exceed North Carolina's potential. Let's unleash, let's unleash our
unlimited resources and opportunity North Carolina has to offer. We will
do it. We must do it. God bless all of you in the great state of North
Carolina and now let's get back to work. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.</p>
