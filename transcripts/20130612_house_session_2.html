The House will come back to order. Representative Whitmire, the Chair
understands the gentleman wishes to be recorded as having voted, “Aye,”
on the McManus amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Affirmative, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman may be recorded as voting, “Aye.”
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Richardson, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I would like to…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The House will come to order.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don’t think my vote got tallied the last time. I would like to be
registered as voting, “No,” on the last minute…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On the motion to table?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On the motion to table, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady will be recorded as voting, “No.” Representative Arp, the Chair
understands the gentleman wishes to change his vote to having voted,
“Aye,” on the Wells amendment? Be recorded.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have three amendments in possession of the
Clerk not including the fourth amendment that Representative
Turner…Representative Turner, is the lady working to try and get a
fiscal note for the purposes of considering the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes we are.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Then that amendment is still in possession of the Clerk. We will wait to
see if we can take that up. It may have to be taken up after we begin
the debate on the bill.
The next amendment that we’re going to take up is the amendment from
Representative Starnes, AMK-30. But ladies and gentlemen, before we do
that, if the House will come to order.
Representative Dollar had an amendment that was in process that the
staff was working on. The Chair understands it’s not a controversial
amendment, it is something that Representative Dollar requires just for
an update to the bill. But I told my Senior Chair I’m holding him up to
the same rule I’ve held all other members up to and that we would not
consider the amendment without leave of the House. Is there objection to
considering the amendment? Representative Dollar’s amendment which is
ALU-20 will be considered.
That leaves three amendments plus Representative Turner’s.
Representative Dollar’s amendment, ALU-20, will follow Representative
Starnes. Representative Starnes is recognized to send amendment AMK-30
forward. The Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Amendment AMK-30, Representative Starnes moves to amend the bill on page
87, lines 12 through 29 by deleting the lines and substituting the
following.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, this
amendment is technical in nature. It just clarifies how audits at the
community colleges are conducted and I urge your approval.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate? If not the question before the House
is the passage of the amendment sent forth by Representative Starnes to
the House Committee substitute for Senate Bill 402. All in favor vote,
“Aye.” All opposed vote, “No.” The Clerk will open the vote.
The Clerk will let the machine record the vote. 110 having voted in the
affirmative, one in the negative, the amendment passes. After
Representative Dollar’s bill is disposed of the last amendment we have
is ALE-33 from Representative Hanes. Representative Dollar is recognized
to send forth ALU-20, the Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Amendment ALU-20, Representative Dollar moves to amend the bill on page
28, line 48 by inserting a new section to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. All this amendment does is provide funds
necessary, $145,000, in the reserve should House bill 392 pass. We have
reserves for bills that are pending in the legislative process. This is
one that was just overlooked to have that reserve and that’s all that
we’re doing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Representative Dollar would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, thank you Representative and I apologize, it’s
late and I’m just trying to figure out what 392 was.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
392 was shared arrest Warrant Status, Public Assistance. I think it’s in
the Senate now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The question before the House is the passage of the amendment sent forth
by Representative Dollar to the House Committee substitute to Senate
Bill 402. All in favor vote, “Aye.” All opposed vote, “No.” The Clerk
will open the vote. The Clerk will let the machine record the vote. 110

...not in the negative the Amendment passes. The final Amendment before
we begin debate. Representative Hanes is recognized as sending forth
Amendment ALE-33, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Amendment ALE-33. Representative Hanes moves to amend
the Bill on page 62, line 13 through page 67, line 47 by deleting the
lines and substituting the following.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the Amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. What this Amendment will do is
remove opportunity scholarships from the budget and ultimately assign
funds to the teachers, assistants allotment. Ladies and gentlemen you
all know that I am a principal sponsor on HB944, and so the announcement
that HB944 had been placed into the House Budget created a huge dilemna
for me and education advocates across the state. Not everyone in this
Chamber had had the opportunity to hear debate on a standalone bill,
fully vetted on the house floor. While I remain a passionate advocate of
all of our children's Constitutional Rights to an equal education, equal
opportunity, a sound and basic education-- that passion must be balanced
with the right to open debate and for our Bills to rise and fall upon
their own merit. As a matter of principle I believe in choice for
economically disadvantaged students. I ran for the seat as a choice
advocate and I stand by that. The decision to place 944 in the budget,
however, ensures that there will be no further debate on this important
issue and I cannot support that decision. I would ask that you support
the Amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Guilford,
Representative Brandon...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ...to debate the Amendment please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the Amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Although I agree with my colleague Representative
Hanes in principle that the Bill should be debated I think we've had a
lot of debate about this issue. There's a lot of issues within the
Budget that we have to deal with this way. So it's not enough for me to
be able to take it out of the Bill simply because of the needs of our
community which are great, for a technicality. We have a number of
children that need, deserve this opportunity and I urge that you
continue to support dignity, justice, equal opportunity and equal access
for children all across this state and go against the Amendment. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Mecklenburg,
Representative Bryan...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ...to speak on the Amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the Amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr Speaker. Just first obviously we have had
a good bipartisan Bill and I will respectfully disagree with my
cosponsor Representative Hanes in speaking against his Amendment. We
have had a very full debate. In fact about 90 of us sat and debated
yesterday in full appropriations. This is after a full debate in our
House education policy with public folks speaking, two separate
meetings, and we also debated in ED appropriations and we will debate
here again. So I think we have had a full and fair debate, and to my
other cosponsor Representative Brandon's point, this is about providing
opportunities for students. Let me say a couple things to reiterate some
points that were made yesterday. I said three things that I will
reiterate again. This program saves money, having opportunity
scholarships will save the state money, it improves public schools and
most importantly it improves student outcomes which is what we should be
about. I want to address one point about public schools. You keep
hearing concerns from folks in public schools worried about what's going
to happen. I want to share two brief quotes or stories. One is from a
superintendent down in Florida and I have referenced this previously.
Florida has run a great program, it's been in existence for ten years.
I'm going to read to you from a superintendent in Jacksonville of
schools. So despite all the concern about what will happen to schools
this is what she said. &quot;I support choice because I think
parents...&quot;</p>

<p id="010:00">
The options. Especially those that don't have the financial means to go
to a private school. I just don't believe that anyone should tell a
parent where they should send their child to school. I'm vehemently
opposed to limiting options, especially to parents whose children are in
lower performing schools, or whose parents don't have the financial
means to have the same flexibility that a parent would have of means.
And that's historically what's happened in our public education system.
In Florida, you will hear story after story of folks that previously did
not support this bill, or that previously did not support choice that
now do. And in fact we had a school choice day here, one of the speakers
was a former chair of the head of the Democratic Party in Florida in the
Senate and he came and said hey, I voted against it the first time. And
he's voted for it every time since. He's seen the benefit that it's
been. With that, I will implore you, I will implore you to vote against
the amendment. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the
gentleman from Cumberland, Representative Glazier rise?  [SPEAKER
CHANGES] First to see if Representative Bryan might yield for a
question, maybe a second, and then to speak to the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Does the gentlemen from Mecklenberg yield to the gentleman from
Cumberland? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much Mr. Speaker. Thank you
Representative. Representative, just so I'm clear before we debate, is
it your intent and is it the provision which is essentially the bill
goal to provide every student who receives a voucher with a sound, basic
education? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. I think parents will make choices that
give their children a sound, basic education. That's right. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up, please? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield
to a second question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just again, I want to be clear. It is your intent
though, that the tax payer money, the voucher money, be used to
education children so that the schools that they attend provide a sound,
basic education to every child. That uses the voucher. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Parents will make choices that give their kids a
sound, basic education. They will. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Last question, Mr.
Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield to a final question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] He does. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
How will we determine whether or not they are receiving a sound, basic
education, at the schools where the voucher and the tax payer money are
being used? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The parents do that. We have homeschools.
We have loads of different things in the state. Loads of different
opportunities for people. And the kids are provided a sound, basic
education. We do have, we have testing measures which we already have in
private schools, and we've increased the testing measures in this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the bill, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentlemen from Cumberland is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry Mr. Speaker. Thank you. I have debated this
before and I'll try to keep my comments brief. I come to this from a
different perspective than a lot of you. As a school board member for
six years, I fought and our district created one of the first choice
programs in the state. A governed choice program that created 52
different options in our school system. For a lot of the reasons that
we've talked about. I also believe and signed on and voted for House
Bill 269 this year, because I think that there are rare occasions in
which our system doesn't provide what it needs to for extraordinary
exceptionalities. And that is important. But I am opposed to this
provision for a number of reasons that it's in the bill and why I am
speaking to Representative Hanes' amendment. First, Representative
Brandon, this is not a technicality. To have fundamentally alter and
create effectively, a second system of education when we can't
adequately fund the first, is a huge matter of policy. And I think
deserved a separate up or down vote. I opposed the discussion years ago
when I was in this body, that suggested that a lottery vote ought to be
put in the budget, because I thought it deserved an up or down vote.
Whether we agree or disagree with the procedure used on it is another
matter. But it was an up or down vote. This is no different. And it
deserved an independent analysis. Second, vouchers in this case are
being used in the bill in a way very differently than the bill was
filed. When this bill was filed,</p>

<p id="015:00">
It had a 300% as I recall, rate a poverty to look at for eligibility.
Which just so you know would have meant that 65% of all children in the
state would have had access to the voucher. It has been reduced to the
130% and that's not a bad thing, and I appreciate the efforts that did
that. But the problem with that is multiple. 1 would this one say to the
parents of the multiple kids who see their tax money being spent on the
130% voucher, and they're at 140%. And people would say well there has
to be a cutoff.
[Speaker change]
Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker change]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Brunswick Representative Byler
rise?
[Speaker change]
See if Representative Glazier would yield for a question.
[Speaker change]
Yes sir.
[Speaker change]
?? of the question. He yields
[Speaker change]
Do I understand that if it was at 300% you'd vote for this?
[Speaker change]
No
[Speaker change]
For the, for the bill and against the amendment.
[Speaker change]
No Representative I wouldn’t, I was gonna get to why. What I'm
suggesting in my argument is the problems that exist at the 130. Not
that I would vote for the 300. I've been pretty clear that I'm opposed
to the, to the voucher system as a whole. As an avocation of the public
school system accepting those exception cases when, when there really
has to be a choice because the public school is not providing the
particularized service that's absolutely for the child, and can't
otherwise do. But at the 130% we are creating an incredible division,
and that's not what public educations supposed to be about. We are
supposed to be about unifying, and to me at least this states commitment
to universal free public education. It’s been an absolutely crucial
element in the ability of generations of North Carolinians to improve
their lives. And it is unlikely that this state would have ever emerged
as a leader had it left the development of education to the whim and
will of a free market. The market is a wonderful mechanism in my view,
for the development of small  and large enterprises, and it is extremely
successful for the production and distribution of a wide range of high
quality goods and services. But the market for all of its strengths is
not the appropriate mechanism to supply services that should be
distribute equally, to people in every neighborhood, in every city, and
in every town, without regard to their ability to pay or their political
power, or where they live. And the reality of course is when this
voucher goes into effect if it does, it will have precisely the opposite
effect. And many of our districts as Representative Whitmire eloquently
has argued several times, there are no real private options, and so the
options will be concentrated. And some children may, if they're able to
cobble together the resources have that option. But the poor child in
the rural county is not gonna have that option, and that to me is the
antithesis of public education. And these are public dollars being spent
for. If we were at 300% we have of course the opposite problem. Which is
really where a lot of the proponents and not, this is not for
Representative Brian ??, believe he's done an incredibly eloquent job,
and articulate job on these. But we all know that if we were at that
level the problem of course was the original fiscal note had 90 million
or more. And we were opening up to exactly what those of us were
concerned about would say, and that is we are truly trying to replace
the system. And so you end up with both problems because you're trying
to do something that was never intended for the delivery of public
education. I am not at all someone opposed to reform, there are a whole
lot of reforms we need to do. Those reforms involve time and attention,
and love, teach, child. And they involve resources. And in this budget
we are not providing, all though hopefully one day we may get to the
point. But we are not providing a pay raise for teachers, we are not at
all hitting into discretionary cut that's massively hurt the school
systems.
[Speaker change]
Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker change]
For what.
[Speaker change]
I do not.
[Speaker change]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Guilford Rise.
[Speaker change]
To see if Representative Glazier will yield for a quick question.
[Speaker change]
Does the gentleman yield to a question for.
[Speaker change]
I do not yield to a question.
[Speaker change]
The gentleman does not yield to a question. The gentleman from
Cumberland continues to have the floor to debate the amendment.
[Speaker change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. And so where we are in this position, there may
be a time and a place for limited movement, but it is not this year. I
don't know how we can go out and say that we're establishing and funding
a second system. Potentially to exponentially grow</p>

<p id="020:00">
and we all know thats likely where it's headed.  and we can't fully fund
the first one that 90 percent of our students are in.  there are
arguments to be made about the cost. But again i quote from
representative whit mar the other day he is right, and those of us who
have served on the school board know: that in the end this will cost a
lot of money and you can put all the fiscal notes you want out, we know
it costs state money the argument is of course that it saves some local
money.  kids don't come in need packages of 23, we are not going to be
able to shift those costs unless the voucher is maximized and i mean
maximized you don't ever have those saves so you are again stuck wit the
problem that you are in effect doing a major cut to public schools .
forget the issue of who we are leaving behind for get the issue of
whether or not the private schools will accept these children with
vouchers.  choice does not mean they get to be accepted.  there are a
whole lot of kids that if i had the choice and i was in a private school
based on their academic record or their disciplinary record or there i
occupationally that i might not want to deal with or feel that my school
could deal with. public schools don't have that choice we accept every
child whether they are add or adhd or with arthritis or traumatic brain
injury or academically gifted.  and for me the ultimate deciding point
on this is about public education public education has always been and
maybe because I'm the first person in my family to graduate from college
and maybe because it was instilled in me but it is the one place in our
country that remains the place that we are united under one place under
one set of values. and if we take that away and we create hundreds of
different places we take away the one thing right now that seems to be
binding us together at a time that we desperately need that. so my
opposition and my reason for supporting representative Haines of
madment, rests on four different grounds. and some. one, as a matter of
policy this is so important it should be decided separately. seconds,
where we are headed and i believe on this is to damage seriously urban
particular urban education without providing rural kids any real
portions.  third, because in the end we don't have the money right now,
to do what we should for public education we at least should have the
decency to wait until we can adequately fund the kids in public school s
before we try to establish a separate system here. and finally because I
honestly don't believe that poor children utter they are urban or rural
will be able to fix this by combing in resources in order to attend and
use the voucher. thank you mr. speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
for what purpose does the person from Brunswick representative ioswer
arise
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
oh I've change my mine mr speaker but see if the gentemlan would yield
for a question
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
does the gentleman yield to a question from the gentleman from
bronswick?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
absolutely
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
he yeilds
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
pleasure I got here just in time to be in the minority and i have a
question coming but i don't remember a pay raise the first budget of 09
10 either but fewer than ours that we had last budget. my question is is
there single child in north Carolina that you can think of in my
district, your district, representative  whitmeires district that would
not have a choice even if this passes or not and given the whole
spectrum of choices, that will not have a free choice of a school if
whether or not this passes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
let me just make sure i understand the question so i'm answering
it&quot; is there any district in which there would be no choice
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
that's correct a free choice no choice what so ever. including
transportation and free breakfast
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
well obviously every has the option in public school with transportation
and lunch, you're asking about the choice. my view is and i haven't
passed all 100 counties. i suspect that every county has at least an
option somewhere and i don't know that to be true but i suspect that
there is at least if not in that county in the adjoining county but
there is a wide difference between having a choice to go somewhere and
having a quality choice.  and if you look at the florida experience with
all due respect to representative Bryantt. it is entirely a mixed bag
there are some parts of floridly whereat he voucher may be used at this
point moderately successful</p>

<p id="025:00">
Although not many in my view. But there are plenty of places in Florida
where those choices are really bad and where the data is really bad as
well, and if you look at Milwaukee and Racine, which have the largest
experience with this, you’ll see that three weeks ago the test scores
came out from both districts, and both of those test scores showed that
the voucher kids performed statistically substantially below their
counterparts in the public school system. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up,
Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Cumberland yield
for a second question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He
yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I certainly don’t want a debate because I’m
not a trial attorney and I have high regard for your skills. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] And I’m not a trial attorney anymore either, Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Pardon my… That’s how much I know about ?? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Does the gentleman wish to ask an additional question? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Certainly. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So
you will admit, good, bad or indifferent, that since each county has at
least one LEA, then you’ll admit there is a free choice available to
every child somewhere in North Carolina whether or not this passes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly I agree that there is a public school system
in every county in North Carolina. Yes sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what
purpose does the gentleman from Lee, Representative Stone rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the
floor to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Ladies and
gentlemen, I want to tell you first of all I appreciate the bill
sponsors for original intent of the bill, and I want to tell you in Lee
County we have several great schools that are public schools. For the
record I have two children both going to public education. My daughter
goes and my son goes to a school called Tramway Elementary. It’s
extremely popular. The parents are involved in all five grades –
extremely involved, and so when I ask the teachers what makes the
parents do so much – they really are at this one school, and then I hear
this discussion and it takes me back to 2010, I’m in a rural community
and we’re having debates – school board debates and Nancy House debates
– and a lady stands up and she asks the school board members, she said
“I have talked to the superintendent, I have talked to the principals,
I’ve talked to the teachers, I’ve talked to everyone I can talk to, but
I can’t get anyone to help me with that choice of my child, the problem
I have,” and it was education. She was very sincere, her trying to solve
a problem. No one there could answer her question, so my question is if
that was my child or your child, we’d move that kid. Everyone in this
room has the funds available to move your child tomorrow if you have
one, or your grandchild. It wouldn’t be a debate, wouldn’t be a
question. We ask parents to get involved and then when we have a pool
parent get involved, you disenfranchise them. You don’t give them an
opportunity. You don’t let a pool parent make a decision about how to
help their whole child’s future because you’re worried about the public
education. I told you, I have two children in public education. I’m very
concerned about public education, but I want to empower the parent. Let
them make a choice on what’s best for their child when no one else
listens, and in some of these rural communities, it happens a lot more
than you know. Now we’re fortunate we have great schools, but at the end
of the day, let the parents make a decision. This bill effects no one
except the pool parents who we continue not to listen to. We’ve got good
employees and bad employees in every industry in the state of North
Carolina. Do not think that one government entity’s going to be exempt
from that. So I ask you to vote no against this amendment and help
empower those parents to make a decision on how and what’s best for
their child in the future. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose
does the gentleman from Rockingham, Representative Jones rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has
the floor to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I cannot more strongly
implore suggestion that this bill and that this issue has not been well
debated and well vetted. It’s been through Appropriations, it’s been
through Education – two of the largest committees. The vast majority of
the members have already participated in this debate, but further than
that, ladies and gentlemen, I would suggest that this is a core
philosophical debate. How you feel about this particular issue really

?? responsible for the children. and should make basic decisions about
how and where the children should be educated. is it the parents? or is
it the state? now during the course of this debate and with some of my
conversations with some of the opponents of school choose if you will
i've heard comments like &quot;well come parents make poor
decisions.&quot; We've heard that we're concerned that some of these
private schools if you will are not accountable enough to us and won't
talk about who us is.  But even on a floor today we've heard the
statement &quot;well how will we determine that the children are getting
a sound basic education?&quot; and ladies and gentlemen i ask who are
we, are we talking about the general assembly  the department of general
construction or the parents? It's already been well said that the
parents who make the decision that is best for their children and I
would suggest in those very very rare instances where there is abuse and
neglect that we have social services in tact; there are laws to protect
those children.  another statement we heard in committee, one of the
committees that debated this bio l said that you are elected to
represent the public schools. Ladies and gentlemen i was elected to
represent people, every child every parent every family we should
support them all whether their parents choose to send them to private
schools public schools charter schools home school those are the people
that we were elected to represent.  education is about a life often a
child. not a system. I think that many on the left for a long time
conveniently neglected this truth if you will.  I want to speak for a
moment I've been listening to the course of this debate and throughout
the whole process i keep hearing about vouchers.  i had a little
delegate with someone who came with my office who was against school
choose and we talk d about that and they admitted this is not about
vouchers but that's our word for it. well ladies and gentlemen i would
suggest that words mean things. in case you're not aware of it a voucher
is a piece of paper that entitles the holder to a discount. or it may be
exchanged for goods or services it's like a coupon if you will. you
might have a coupon or voucher that entitles you to go do down to the
local McDonnalds and get a free cone of ice seam or something.  why is
that important what different does that make? well i should suggest that
it make all the distance in the worlds because it makes a very important
assumption because if someone issues a voucher or a coupon if you will
then it suggests that they have the right the authority to do that. in
other words we are telling the parents if you will when we talk about
vouchers, that the state has the right to determine your childs'
education.  that if you somehow receive a voucher from the government
that you can take that government and then you can make the choice that
you want to make but not unless you do.  and i suggest that if you will
my friends that we not continue to let the left control the narrative if
you will.  control this debate, this is not about vouchers

I would add that our state constitution adds this phrase, “The enjoyment
of the fruits of their own labor.” We don’t hear that one very much.
I think that the parents and the teachers and the students of this state
are tired of being used as pawns in political games. And I think that
parents ought to have, be able to exercise their God given right. It
shouldn’t depend on their income. It shouldn’t depend on their zip code.
I think we ought to have the wherewithal to stand up here today and tell
the citizens of North Carolina that we represent, that we respect their
God given rights to do that. That we’re going to stand for them.
And we’re going to stand for these Opportunity Scholarships and quit
talking about vouchers. Because they don’t need the government’s
permission, or they should not need the government’s permission to
decide what is best for their children.
And with that, Mr. Speaker, I will conclude my remarks, and I will be
glad to yield any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose is the gentleman from Richmond rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] May I ask my question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields to the gentleman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You said earlier that you thought parents should be
able to make the decision if their children go to public schools,
charter schools, private schools, home schools. What about no school? Do
you think parents should be able to make that decision for their
children?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think that a parent ought to be able to decide what
is the proper education for their children. Now…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I could finish my answer. I think that we have laws
on the book as far as drop out rate, drop out whatever, what you might
define as school. I think that every child should be educated. And I
think that the Constitution of the state of North Carolina makes it very
clear that everyone has the right to the privilege of an education. No
one here wants to deny that right. No one here wants to deny that
privilege. But for anybody to make the argument that passing a bill such
as this, or an amendment such as being debated here, Opportunity
Scholarships is somehow denying that right to anyone, I can’t accept
that argument.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Goodman wishes to propound an
additional question. Representative Jones do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So you think if a parent made the decision that his
children didn’t need any school that the state should be able to
intervene and make a decision for that parent?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I will clarify my remarks once again. I believe that
that state has determined that children up to a certain age are not
allowed to drop out of school. As long as they are within that age, they
are going to be receiving an education somewhere. Whether it’s
traditional public schools, charter public schools, private schools, or
home schools. I believe that the parents ought to have the right to make
the determination of what is best for their child because one size
doesn’t fit all, and it’s not the right of the state to tell the child,
or child’s parents what is best for that child.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One more follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield to an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So you agree there are limits to a parent’s decision
to make, or a parent’s right to make decisions about education with
their children?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely. And I think I made it very clear earlier
that we have social services in this state. Nobody here is advocating
that heir is no parent out there that is not somehow… We realize that
there is abuse and neglect that takes place in this state. We have laws
to protect children against that. Nobody is saying that every parent is
perfect. But I am saying that I don’t have a right to tell you how to
raise your children, and you don’t have a right to tell anybody else in
here how to raise theirs. And I don’t think that the state has the right
to determine that certain parents should not have an opportunity to send
their children to the school of their choice. .
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the lady from Guilford,
Representative Adams, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
House, we need to support this amendment. I want to thank Representative
Hanes for his courage first of all, since he had taken a position
regarding the bill. But it’s unfortunate that we are really debating the
bill here. We’re doing that because when the bill was in committee it
came, it went straight to the folks to put in the budget. And we should
have had it here. That’s a part of the process. To debate it. And it
wasn’t right for it to happen that way. So now we have to stand up and
talk about it.</p>

<p id="040:00">
...if we feel strongly about it. But when we talk about what's fair, I
have been involved with education and with public education and we do
have choices. And I think parents should have choices. But I think the
real question is whether or not the government should tell taxpayers
that we should pay for those private choices that parents what to make.
And I just believe if you, there's a cost that comes with that. So if
you make that choice that is not afforded in public education, where the
majority of the children will have to be served, then you should make
the choice to pay the difference and to pay for that. So I still don't
believe that with what we are not doing in terms of supporting our
public schools, we don't have enough money to provide what's needed
there and for us to take dollars away from public education and to give
it to parents for private schools is wrong.
But I think when we talk about these children who are disadvantage and
who need opportunities, all children need opportunities. But I still
will tell you that you're not going to get those opportunities if the
funding, the differences that you will need in terms of the funding, is
not available to you. So you really don't have the opportunity if you
are at the poorest end of the ladder. So perhaps some folks a little bit
above that can pay and that's probably who's going to really get these
opportunities.
So yeah, we have a lot of God given rights and I think some of those
costs money and that's what we're talking about right now and who should
pay. And the public taxpayer should not pay for private schools. That's
not what we're here to do and that's not what we should do. So again, I
want to thank Representative Hanes for this amendment. It is a good
amendment because we didn't do the right thing in bringing this bill and
putting this bill into this budget. So I'm going to support the
amendment and I hope you will, as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Guilford,
Representative Brandon rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak a second time on the amendment, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just wanted to say that, I just want the people to
understand a couple of points about this bill because I keep hearing a
lot of false arguments about it. And what I really want everybody to
know that this boils down to one issue. If you can look at a parent in
the face and understand that this mother comes and tells you, &quot;Yes,
I understand that my child has three F's on their report card, they have
been suspended twice from this school. And it's clearly not working out
for me.&quot; And if you can look that parent in the face and say
because you live in that zip code therefore I understand your child is
going to become a statistic, and I understand your child might go to
jail because of that. But because you live in that zip code, you have to
go to that school. And if anybody in the world believes that is
constitutional, number one, I will challenge you on that. If any of my
colleagues want to believe that that's a progressive thing, I will
challenge you on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do not yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland,
Representative Floyd arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm not asking the gentleman to yield, I just want him
to speak on the amendment, not the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is not propounding any question. I
assume the gentleman is trying to rise to a point of order. The Chair
would rule that the gentleman is properly debating the amendment at this
time. The gentleman from Guilford, Representative Brandon, continues to
have the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. This is really, all this is about is
really, simply about giving someone the dignity and the respect and the
honor to make sure that they do the best that they can do for their
child. And we have a lot of other arguments to talk about. Well, this
might not help everybody. Can someone in this body tell me when we ever
make a bill that helps 100% of the people? We have IB programs,
International Baccalaureate programs. That does not help 100% of the
people. Should we take that out? We have magnet schools. That does not
help 100% of the people. Should we take that out? Of course not. There

<p id="045:00">
Why this bill is so important, what we have to do is look at things
differently and create the space and the opportunity so people can have
more choices. This is not something that all folks will choose but it
does give the opportunity for that parent that wants to choose that to
be able to do that and whenever you have people on one side of the track
that is able to make that decision. See, if it was the other person
example that I gave you, if it was another person that lives across
town, not one that lives in my district, who has the money, and if their
child that gets suspended from school and if it's not working out for
them, then they can simply go make another choice and put their kid in a
private school, and guess what? They get to go to a college and they get
to be a productive citizen in society. That does not happen in my
community. And for anybody to believe that is a justice conversation, I
will challenge you on that, because it's not. Not even close. This is a
matter of fairness. If some people get to do it, why do not the people
in my community get to do it. And I'm tired of people telling me what we
can do. I remember two years ago, and there was the charter school
debate and it was like 'there's no way that's going to be able to
happen'. The poor folks are not going to be able to take advantage of
it. That's what I heard, but I will let you know that we have a charter
school in my community that we started last year. Ninety-eight percent
of them are free and reduced lunch. Ninety-one percent of them have
passed the benchmarks. One-hundred percent of them received
transportation and food. We did everything everybody said we could not
do, and we can continue to do that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Brandon the gentleman will suspend, for what purpose does the
gentleman... [SPEAKER CHANGES] Point of order Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman may state his point of order. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker I am confused on reading amendment, and I'm listening at
Representative Brandon. Could we stay on the amendment please Mr.
Speaker? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The Gentleman, the Chair accepts the
Gentleman's point however the Chair has tried to give both side wide
latitude and debate beginning with Representative Glazier and through
all sides given the nature of the issue. That being said the chair would
ask the gentleman to confine his remarks to the issue at hand as well as
the subsequent speakers. The gentleman from Guilford has about
approximately one minute left. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I was just wanting to
make sure that everybody understood with the charter school bill we had
the exact same arguments as we had here today, and that there's nothing
different I just wanted to be clear, that we have a program in
Charlotte, we have a program in Greensboro. We have private schools in
Greensboro, all across the state, they have been doing this for years so
please stop saying that people don't have access and people in my
community won't be able to do it. My community can do whatever we want
to do, we may be poor but we are not stupid. And we have been able to
stretch a dollar further than anybody that I know, for decades. So
please, please vote against the amendment. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Mecklenburg, the other
representative of Moore arise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment
Mr. Speaker.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate
the amendment.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] You know, I appreciate the passion of
every speaker that has spoke on this amendment for the last forty five
minutes. But I have to rise, it's very rare that I rise to talk about
education issues. But I want to make some clarity, I heard
Representative Jones talk about choice. Representative Jones, I believe
in choice as well. I heard Representative Stone talk about his two
children and what he would do if he had the opportunity, if it was
different. This amendment, does not threaten any of those things. What
it does, is say that this is a major policy decision that we're making
and it's not effectively killing the debate on 944 it's actually just
taking it out, and putting it as a stand alone bill so the House, the
Body can debate it in a judicious way and decide whether it stands on
its own merits, or that it dies on this floor. That's the only thing
that this amendment does. So if you talk about choice, if you talk about
free speech, this is the proper way to debate it, not hide it in the
budget, you put it on the floor and let it stand for itself.</p>

because this issue is too critical to the children of North Carolina, no
matter what side you that may be on, to had it in the budget. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Mecklenburg,
Representative Alexander, rise?[SPEAKER CHANGES]Speak of the Amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman has the floor to debate the
Amendment.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Lady Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, it's
been a long time since I been so confused. This morning I joined with
some of you in the Finance Committee, and I heard a discussion about why
it was impermissible for citizens now to check off $3.00 on their tax
return and have that money to go to the political party of their choice.
And the argument, if I understood it correctly, ultimately, was that was
somehow an impermissible way to select windows and louvers. There were a
bunch of political parties out there and not all of them were being able
to be benefited from that system, and so that system has to go. Well, a
few hours later I came in here and the principles that I thought I had
heard my esteemed colleagues from across the Rubicon talk about this
morning, seems to have been turned on their head because all of a sudden
it's okay to take public money and give it to private citizens when this
morning we were taking public, you know, private citizens were checking
off some of their tax money and saying that that money should go to a
particular political connection.  Well, now, by this evening we have now
flipped. And we've flipped in such a way that I'm just being, I don't
quite get it, and maybe some of you all can give this poor urban waif
some direction.  You see, the last time I looked these vouchers or these
opportunity scholarships, or these transfers of tax money, whatever you
want to call them, did not rise to the point that all of this choice
that I've heard people talk about can be afforded.  See, if you have a
tuition somewhere that's up at this level, and you've got some transfer
of public money that's down at this level. there's a gap, and if you
don't have resources to bridge that gap, you still don't have choice.
You got rhetoric.  You got a hunting license but you don't really have a
choice.  And then, I don't know, you know, again, I'm simple.  It's hard
for me to figure out how we can even contemplate this when we can't
afford to deal with the traditional public schools. We can't afford to
give teachers raises. We can't afford to supply teaching assistants.  We
got a judge in one of these buildings somewhere around here that's told
us there's a disparity between the amount of money some counties have
for traditional public education and the amount of money that other
counties have. And the judge, as I recall, had said that we're supposed
to be putting money out there to make sure that there is a basic level
for all students. Well, if we're supposed to be funding that, and we
don't have money for these other things, how in the name of Jehovah can
we afford to put, what is it, 4,265, well, whatever it is, where's the
money coming from?  Somebody got a printing press down in the basement
here or something?  I mean, I don't get it. And because I don't get it,
I don't think the citizens of North Carolina gonna get it. I don't think
most of the people in here when they stop, you know, with the rhetoric
and what-not will get it. And I think that it's important that this
amendment pass so we get this mess out of the budget.</p>

overwhelmingly, I think it was a hundred and four to three or something

But the gentleman from Chowan continues to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, there's still five in the queues, so I appreciate it. But anyway,
what we've come down to with this debate on this particular issue is
this. We've, we've kinda framed it, or some have framed it, as an either
or, you're either for public education or you're against public
education. And that seems to be the substance of this debate when in
fact this is not an either or situation. There has been plenty of money
that has been spent on public education in North Carolina over the last
ten or twelve years, and I would like to refer folks back to the Leandro
Case. Judge Howard Manning, I'm sure most of us here are familiar with,
with that particular case when.

Thank you. The problem with the, with his findings were that we had a
number of public schools that were failing, I see the queue with thirty
seven, thirty eight, thirty nine, I've only been up here for two minutes
for Heaven's sake! The, my, my point is that there is, there is an, this
is not an either or situation, that we have, we can do both, and we need
to do both. Going back to the Manning decision, there are schools ten
years later after that decision was rendered, ten years later, who are
still, they're failing. Their reading grades are failing. And so do we
continue just trotting down the same course that we've been trotting
down, or do we try to do something different? This is, this is what this
Opportunity Scholarship is all about. It's, you've heard it's a, you've
heard it said that it's about creating choice. Well it is, and it's also
about creating success, and it's about creating competition. And so for
us, for this debate to continue, and I know mine won't very much longer,
but for this debate to continue as an either or, I think is making a big
mistake, I think we need to be thinking about the students, the
opportunity that they will be given, some of them, to escape failing
schools and failing school systems while at the same time we're trying
to stabilize and in fact even improve our public school system, which is
going to take a lot more to do than just money. So if that pleases the
Speaker and pleases Representative Dixon and everyone else, I'll go
ahead and sit down, thank you.

I don't understand that, but Ive heard time and time again that parents
need choice, becuase it helps studdents. You know, and Im concerned
about parents having choice and helping students and I think we all are.
I heard representative brendan say that these students have been
suspended, and he blames that on the school, I think hes missguided, he
aught to blame that on the parent. Parents are responsible for childrens
deportment, not the school. Now, I support these parents being able to
help their children, but I also would submit to you that there is a
residule of students, who have diliquent parents, you may not believe
that. Ask any qualified educator and they will tell you, I can tell you
some right here in this chamber, representative richardson,
representative hollaway, representative cothom, representative rengan,
representative whitmore, representative johnson, representative larry
bell, representative charles graham, theyve been on the firing line, and
they can tell you that they have in schools, what we call, local
parentace. we are those childrens parents, because those parents have
advocated their responsabilitites, now the parents your talking about
have not advocated their responsibilities, they are there for the
children, but what about those children who have those diliquent
parents, whose advocating for them? tell me who, those dedicated and
qualified social workers, those dedicated and qualified guidance
counselors, those dedicated and qualified principles, those dedicated
and qualified super intendants, and by the way, how many super
intendants have asked for this voucher bill? I dont know of any, because
they on the firing line, now if we are truly interested in giving
children choices, look at those children whove come from, i mean
decrepade circumstances, who had a gregat teacher. That local parentace
teacher, and they will you, many successful folk will tell you, I was
successful in life because I had a teacher who cared, my parents werent
there for me, I had a teacher who cared. These students that you have
attempted to help have parents, now if you really are interested in
vouchers, you say you don't like that word, your interested in choice,
than you ought to be terebly terribly interested in those students who
have dilinquant parents, give scholarships to them, I rest my case, mrs.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Chair would—the Chair has tried to give wide latitude and would ask
the Speaker Pro Tempore if he could bring his remarks a little closer
into line with the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I will, Mr. Speaker, the amendment deletes several pages of
opportunity scholarships, which are attacked on the basis that they are
use of taxpayer money for private choices.  I pointed out, first of all,
that this has not even been controversial, in this house for several
years and we’ve been doing it for forty years of giving public tax money
to students at private colleges in thirty—thirty-five private colleges
in North Carolina.  For about fifteen years, we’ve been doing it in
pre-school; it’s called Smart Start.  No objection from the left to
using public tax dollars at private pre-schools.  Second point…I put on
your desk one of the arguments in favor of the amendment, and I oppose
the amendment, is that we just don’t have enough money, we’re not
funding the traditional public schools, we’re not giving pay raises.
But the people who make that argument forget that when you divide in
arithmetic, if the numerator changes but the denominator changes, the
result can be that we’re spending more per pupil with the opportunity
scholarships than without.  Just a little bit, but when you include the
local money, it’s quite a bit of—additional money per pupil if you have
these opportunity scholarships.  And, I urge you to defeat the
amendment.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Ladies and gentlemen, by now as you already
know, everything in politics goes round [sic] and around.  And, this
debate has gone around in a circle.  They—down here years ago, I have
fought for home-schooling, I’ve fought for charter schools; I’ve fought
for people to have that choice.  The choice they wanted was to get away
from government rules, and government regulations, and government
telling them how to educate their children.  And, when I first saw
opportunity scholarships, I thought, oh man!  This is going to be great.
 But the first email I got was from a charter school parent with a
little different perspective:  We sent our children to charter schools
because we wanted to get away from the government telling us what to do.
If we accept that money, then the government is going to tell us what to
do.  And there are forty-three pages of what the schools have to meet in
order to accept this scholarship grant.  So, I think the circle you’re
gonna [sic] see if we continue in [sic] with opportunity scholarship
direction, somebody’s gonna [sic] have to find a way again to get away
from government control of the educational process.  I urge you to vote
for the amendment, and let’s keep our public schools as public schools.
 Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I’d--I’d like to maybe talk about
some of the discussion here, and Representative Floyd, just to give you
my perspective if I was up at the dais right now, this amendment really
is about the policy, it has an appropriation in the budget, but the
policy is there, so you can’t debate this amendment without basically
debating the policy that would fail as a result of this amendment
passing.  And let me say from the beginning, I hope that you will vote
against this amendment.  The—I want to start, though—to kind of calm
things down in terms of traditional K through 12 education,  I want to
thank the hard-working teachers and principals and the volunteers in the
schools for some of the extraordinary work that they’re doing today.

Public school. I no longer - and I'm very careful to make sure that I
remind myself of this. I no longer say K through 12 public education
North Carolina is broke, it's a great political [??] speech, but it's
factually not true. If you go to school systems you will find some great
things going on. The problem is it's not going on everywhere. We have
Mission Possible over in Guilford county. We have Project Lift over in
Mecklenburg county trying to serve the needs of some of the poorest,
most at-risk children in this state who desperately need an option other
than the traditional option that they're receiving. That's why the Gates
Foundation and other businesses have contributed some 55 million dollars
to help these children. If we don't help them we lose them. That's a
great K through 12 public program that's going on.
We can do to the digital conversion that's happening in Morrisville. We
introduced Dr. Mark Edwards earlier today, national superintendent of
the year. Those children in Morrisville don't need a choice because
their public education is rated one of the best in the United states.
President Obama was there just last week talking about it. The problem
is it's not available everywhere. That choice, that public school choice
is not available everywhere. Representative Brandon I consider to be one
of the most courageous people in this body. I remember his speech a
couple years ago when we were trying to lift the cap on charter schools.
This man moved into a district to get closer to the people he wanted to
serve. He got to know these people. He got to know the mothers and the
fathers who have children that they desperately want to educate. They
desperately want to have a better life. They desperately want to get out
of the poverty and the day to day near death experiences that they have
in some of these communities that they live in. They need a choice.
I heard somebody saying that now is not the time or the place, I believe
right now, right here in North Carolina, now is the time and this
legislative body right here is the place where this begins. There are
some people that Ive talked to, some of my members, they've said Tom
this doesn't help me, I live in a rural district, there aren't any
private school options. Well this actually provides the opportunity for
potentially some of those schools to be created because they can't make
the math work with the poor people that want a choice they can't afford
it. Now there may be potentially faith based private schools, other
private schools that can come up because parents can have the choice,
communities can have the choice to come together and help these
children.
I've had others say, well Tom my school systems not a problem. My
teachers reject this, they think it's a threat. Well guess what? You
don't have a problem, you've got a good school system. You've got a
Morrisville grade school district, probably not gonna be a lot of choice
options there, you don't need them. Hopefully if Project Lift is
successful those babies over in West Mecklenburg county won't need it.
But the reality is there are parents, mothers, single mothers of small
children who desperately want a choice.
Now I want to talk about process for a minute because it's very
important to me. I love the debate devices and it's good, I admire
everybody for doing it, but let's be realistic here, this bill was
vetted in education policy committee twice. In one case we had public
hearings, we had public comments. In the next case we have full debate
among the members in education policy, fully debated. But it started
even before that, we've been talking about this and vetting this with
members. We've had some members go visit Florida to see how it's working
there, what would work and what wouldn't work. Then it goes to
appropriations in finance where the chair is rightfully allowed to
debate on the policy, not to constrain it to the matter of the finance
issue which the chair could have easily done, or to the appropriations
issue. They allowed full and complete debate. So for anyone to suggest
to me that a process where we're allowing public input and vetting of
the members and they're voting on this amendment because the process was
somehow foiled, doesn't understand the process that this bill went
through.
About a month, month and a half ago I went to a meeting in Greensboro.
The auditorium was full of about more than 2000 people, 95% of them were
African American. There were many small children there, there were many
single mothers there, there were many parents there on a Tuesday night,
coming out trying to figure out how they can support choice for these
children, choice for their babies. They weren't there for nay other
reason than to say Dear God, give me an option that lets me...</p>

These children get into a path that will make them successful, deliver
them from the poverty and the situations, the challenges that they have
every day and give them hope. This policy gives those poor parents
almost invariably and disproportionately favored to the African American
community an opportunity to prove that choice works. This policy is
effectively a pilot. It focuses on the poorest people in this state
giving them a choice. If it works we can come back and talk later about
whether or not it should be extended but folks let’s try and give this
generation of children who can benefit from this policy out of this
chamber today a choice. Let’s continue to work on public schools that
deserve our attention, that deserve our focus, that deserve increased
funding, deserve more flexibility to do great things they’re already
doing. But let’s vote no on this amendment. Let’s move forward on doing
something very different for the children of our state.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair.
Earlier, all of you heard me support Rep. Tine's amendment to the small
school funding, and with all due respect to the chairs of the Education
subcommittee, which I've spoken to at length, the purpose of Rep. Tine's
amendment was to dampen the drastic amount of winners and the drastic
amount of losers by manipulating the formula. My amendment actually
takes that a step further, and with that, here's the amendments it
improves further. First of all, it keeps all the counties that are
currently receiving small school funds, and remember, they're small,
they don't have economies of scale, and this is a very valid fund. This
is not a slush fund by any means. It's supported in all domains from
what I have seen. With that, it keeps Martin county in, it keeps Anson
county in, and for the counties that are getting close to rotating out,
Ash and Greene, you would be safe with an upper limit of 4080 students
instead of an upper limit of 3200. You're sitting on the bubble right
now. As far as winners and losers: My amendment does not take money. 24
out of 31 of the systems are still winners, and of the 7 who do suffer
somewhat of a loss of funds, 5 of them lose 82,000. That is extremely
small compared to what we started today at. And in the following year,
19 out of 31 are winners, and 2 of those who aren't winners, they
otherwise would be getting a big cut because they would b e rotating out
of the fund. And with that again, I thank you for supporting the Tine
amendment earlier, I will ask you to support this amendment because 1,
it just improves upon what we had. I know there will be questions, I
have tried to get out information, I know it has been a busy day. And
with that, I will welcome questions,  I know we're  ready to go home, I
ask you support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Actually, I forgot to turn my light out. I will critique my amendment in
one regard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir.
It does improve upon the numbers. The way we get there, unfortunately,
basically we remain with the old logic so the formula can be criticized
if one wanted to as being somewhat convoluted. I did clean it up by
taking some things out that made no sense. Is it as clean as I would
have liked to have had it? No. But at this point in the juncture,
especially in the wee hours of the last day or two, this achieves a much
better outcome and again I ask you to support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Avila, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Rep. Horn, I never used the excuse with my kids, &quot;Do it because I
say so,&quot; so if you don't mind could you explain your rationale for
what sounded like a reasonable explanation of this total confusing
mathematical maneuvering here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will try my best, and very briefly. It is a total confusing
mathematical enigma. The small county funding has been that way, we're
moving away from that, we found a way to begin that process, we've got
counties to work together to ameliorate the much of the negative impact
of making that move, a decision we feel has been made that we can all
live with. We ask you to support the decisions that's been made and vote
against the amendment.</p>

Thank you, Representative Horn.  May I ask Representative Whitmire a
question?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Whitmire, does the
gentleman yield?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes, I do.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  The
gentleman yields.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Representative Whitmire, if they've worked and come to an understanding,
what is your rationale for continuing to work with something and not
accept, supposedly, a consensus opinion?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you
for the question.  Write it off to a lot of freshman being in the
chamber, maybe, but I will say this is the reason.  This particular
logic, and it is a convoluted formula, I absolutely give you that, I
have looked at this thing for several years, well before I got here.  I
understand extremely well, had a bill submitted way back when, and at
the end of the day, in ??, Friday, we had a near unanimous vote, there
may have been one whimper of a no, to mitigate what the original
template had, using the new formula, which is sliding scale, and the
reason that we, I submitted an amendment was to mitigate the fact that
some school systems would be losing, in the next two years, like Tyrrell
County, combined over the two years, four thousand dollars short of a
million dollars.  You can't absorb that.  Some would be gaining over
seven hundred.  In other words, there were extremely big winners and
extremely big, actually bigger, larger losers.  So to squeeze that
dynamic down, so we didn't have just chaos in budgets basically been
decided at the local level, that's where Representative Tine and I, we
actually were collaborating with this, mitigated it.  And my point is
this.  Why is there yet another item?  This makes it better, and for the
small schools out there, we're going to lose, with the Tine amendment,
we're going to lose Greene County.  They're going to start rotating out.
 We would lose Anson County.  Ashe County is four students away from
going out of the equation, and that's a shock when you go out.  And this
is all, if I misrecall something, Hertford County is very close, too,
not as close as Ashe.  But it keeps those sound, and it also has four
other counties that because, in their physical effectiveness, didn't
have a tax rate in the most expensive upper-half of the state, they were
penalized, and the APA study from three years ago said we should not
penalize small school funding based on tax rates.  So we create a whole
bunch of winners.  And I know, the math says, if you've got winners,
you've got losers, but where the money was made up, for the counties
that were going to lose it regardless, we took from them in order to
bring them back in, and that's how I was able to mitigate and make the
overall outcome as little of a shock to anybody as possible.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  Followup.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes, sir.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I'm understanding that something is going to have to
change.  Is yours a step in a transition to cleaning up and simplifying
this, or is this something that's going to continue on regardless of
what we do, unless we go with what's proposed, for people who are not in
favor of your amendment?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  And with respect to the
Chair's, the subcommittee Chair's points, Representative Horn, this buys
us time so that we can actually do that in a more responsible manner.
So as far as the formula, it's going to look a whole lot like what's in
the Senate 402 right now, except, to honor the sliding scale concept,
the change that you would see if you compared this amendment to the
Senate is, you would see more length, but it says the same thing, with
the exception, if you hit a certain threshold size or lower, you have a
baseline at 717,000.  That's what it was.  But once you get above that
threshold and get in the upper size range of the small schools, which
are capped in my bill at 4,080 students, your baseline is lower.  So we
do make sure that the smaller you are, the more money you get, because
you don't have the economy of scale.  But we also still realize that
when you're small, less than 4,080 students, you still have economy of
scale issues, especially if you're geographically isolated like several
of the counties are, and you can't just look out and run over to the
next county.  You've got mountain ranges or ocean sounds to get around.
So that's the reason, and the short answer, I apologize for the
verbosity, is we buy time to do this more responsibly.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  Thank you.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Blackwell,
please state your purpose.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  To speak on the

<p id="095:00">
A brief moment to respond further, in part or mostly to Representative
Alma Adam's questions as expressed by her just now. A few years back, a
study was done of a number of the formulas that were used by the
Department of Public Instruction and by the legislature for distributing
funds among the LEAs, the school districts. Included in this study was a
study of the formula used for small counties. Basically, what that
report told us was that this is a very complex formula involving
multiple considerations and factors - a number of which really don't
have anything to do with a system being small. But factors that had been
put in for a variety of reasons, sometimes for political reasons and
sometimes because people had the ability to put in things to consider
other factors that, as I say, were not related to small schools.
The General Assembly has largely ignored that report until this year.
And we decided that we should move to a formula that was based on the
size of the school system. And that's what we did. And in the budget, we
had, before the Tine Amendment, a proposal to change the small school
formula to say that if you had 3200 or fewer students, you wold get an
allocation on a sliding scale. The smaller you were, the more you got.
The closer you were to the 3200, the less you got . We felt that was the
route to go. We understood that some systems would lose as a result of
that, and some would gain. Some would fall out of eligibility
altogether. So we included in the budget a proposal to phase the change
in over five years so that no school that was negatively affected would
feel the impact more than 20% in a given year. Several members of the
body came to us today concerned that because we are passing this budget
very close to July 1, which is when the school district's new budget
years begin, that even though we have the phase-in language that school
districts had not had the opportunity to plan for that. So they asked us
if we would consider revising it or changing it in some way. The result
of those discussions was the Tine amendment. It involved an additional
$600,000 that we would've needed to take elsewhere from the budget. But
what we agreed to do so that we could stay with the plan to move to the
simple formula based on size of the school system, that we would delay
the implementation of the new formula for one year. At that point, we
still proposed to have the five-year phase in beginning at that point.
School systems that were already on the small school formula that was
the complex formula, that is largely what Representative Graig Meyer is
proposing that we continue indefinitely, those systems for one more year
would get the same amount of money. That amount of money would have been
about $600,000 more than the total allocation we had included in the
budget for small school funding. So it was agreed that we would spread
that $600,000 cut evenly over all the schools participating so that
nobody in this next year would feel any significant cut. But that for
next year, we would move to the new formula which allows for the
five-year phase in. We believe this is reasonable. We understand that
anytime you change a formula, somebody may win and somebody may lose. We
feel like the additional year the Tine amendment allows, which is now in
the budget unless we take it out and replace it with going back to the
old system, which is presented by Representative Graig Meyer with a few
modifications. We feel like giving them this extra year to plan and then
having a five-year phase in is reasonable in terms of meeting the goal
to simplify the formula so it's truly reflective of the needs of the
smallest school systems. [Speaker changes]

perhaps to directly question regular Blackwell, who will not look good

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was saying that there were two things that this accomplished one. it
allows us to move forward with simplifying the system so that it truly
makes the need of the smaller school six.and secondly, by delaying it
for a year and phasing it in where allowing the district 's time to

to speak on the amendment agent _ shot saved by this is not stuck
possibly can this there was a study done on this formula. what this
money goes forth to offset these tiny schools. one of my systems as
Allegheny County, a have twelve hundred students in the whole County and
this however changed. that was what happened was going to benefit me
dramatically increase because the sliding scale. I do stand out. I put
this amendment and the con amendment would help us transition over time
to meet the goal of the committee. some of these cuts were upwards of
three hundred and fifty thousand dollars to the school systems
immediately. I don't think that's fair to our children him. this is
afair way to spend the money now and two, as represented about what was
citing a fair way to look at the policy and transition it out how it
appreciates his work for the amendment. Rosetta brought it residual

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
this is big Rob -year-old short one of the things that I've learned in
this body is that there is no simple amendment. and I guess I could take
that to the next level and say that that just because were looking for a
simple solution doesn't mean it's always the right solution. I do
support the are presented with Myers 's amendment that I ask you also
supported President McGrady,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
please take your purpose becoming limited. id. is requested by a member
who, as with my are co chairs I urge you to vote against this amendment
representative. I would go conceded in the very beginning that the
principal point, it was the question the representative Avila put
forward the this is not just to the place where we need to be this
allocation is about getting money to small counties. we've currently got
allocation system that is broken. no one understands it. we're trying to
get to a place where money goes to small counties representative
Steinberg for a meantime put forward an amendment to cause us to
transition their attempt to make a soft landing, and that's an
appropriate amendment represented Whit mire just bills on the old bad
formula that we him place right now and in the way you can tell that he
is from the language that my colleague used he kept talking in terms of
winners and losers, but that's not what this is about. this is about
getting money to some of the most needy schools in the state. the
smallest schools is not about winners and losers, but since he ways that
point, let's point out what this is been about rather consistent with
the First Amendment that was put forward was adopted in ingenuity
brought a half million dollars to Transylvania County that otherwise
wouldn't get it. this amendment will get several million dollars in
Transylvania County and three other counties that otherwise would not
get money because they are no longer small counties are urgent, please
do not adopt this amendment, we have to transition now that has been
adopted by the house, but with representative time</p>

-Thank you sir.
Just a couple of clean up items that were addressed.
The formula is indeed complex.
The formula reflects the current, but the formula is probably less
important than the outcome, and the outcome is what is critical here.
We can study this some more; we can get it. We can get it quote on quote
more rite,  but think about what happens if we lower the cap and, we are
basically kicking the can down the road to the next year; and, what the
problem is now will just enter into the picture in a year delay for the
most part, as far as cleaning up the formula, I did.
I took out some convey-looded items that the study said shouldn't be
there in the first place like relative effort of taxes,getting credit
for population densities and square miles of ocean sound and national
forest. It plays in , but the way we did it; it made some things that
were very cumbersome come out.
There is a phase out for school systems that grow; its in there.
Key point, I didn't take money from anywhere else. We didn't rob
instructional supplies and textbooks at all that.
The senate's version is extremely similar because it looks at what we've
got, and again, we can improve it; but,doing it at the witching hour at
the expense of many is not the rite thing; and, on a final point
representative McGraidy mentioned the quarter million.
There is 204 thousand for 4 counties that are geographically separated
and have small school numbers, they didn't have for years but because
they were penalized  for having low taxes, tax rate,they didn't get it;
but, when you've got 6000 foot mountain ranges isolating your ocean
sound, your small already. Do you think you've got any better help on
your economy of scale as in the lack there of? I ask you to support the
amendment please. This is on that makes it even better than the kine
amendment. Thank you.
:The question before the house; is the amendment set forth by
representative  Whitmire for the house comity senate 402.
All in favor vote &quot;I&quot;

Ladies and gentle men of the house. Ive been in consultation with

brief tonight. But I just wanted to tell you that what you have done is
basically, I, I just think we have morphed from the 19th century into
the 21st century by forgetting about what happened in the 20th century.
What we have done is we have not given people an opportunity, and what
you've done is you've taken away certain things. Fact of the matter is
I've seen things that you've criticized us for when we were in power,
that you have already down. And, and, and because you did it I guess it,
it's alright but it doesn't bless what we did in the same way. For
instance you've got one of the reasons that bill is so thick is because
you've got more special provisions in that bill then you can shake a
stick at. We did not allow to any great extent special provisions. One
of the things that I did was I did not allow our folks to come in with

what is done, but you just put in the External Opportunities Bill, which
is a stand alone bill. You put in the Excellent School Act, which came
from the Senate as a part of this, even though you cut it down a bit,
and then you have also included in this budget some items that really
beg the question. For instance there is an item where somebody is
building a public library in a particular place with 1.5 million
dollars. I don't know that we ever allowed anybody to come in and build
a public library with 1.5 Million dollars for any reason, so what we are
about to do, and I understand, and I say this, and I say it all the time
- you have got the power to do whatever you darn well please that you
want to do and there's nothing anybody can do about it, but my problem
is that you have not really been judicious in using that power, you have
not been humble, you have really ran roughshod, not only over the
minority Party here, but you have ran roughshod over people in this
state, you've taken away from us just a lot of things - in particularly
the minority community is very much upset, because you did not allow
them to have a say so. You don't have anybody on your side that looks
like me, so you can't empathize with that, I don't care what you say
you've done or where you have been, there is no way that you can
empathize with what we feel and how we do this. We have come a long way
simply because we have perceived in what we have tried to do, and so
what you have done to us is you have put us, you've packed us in a
district so that we can't interact with other people, you put us to the
side and said &quot;You got your 24, now go sit in your corner and just
be totally and completely ignored.&quot; These things just can't happen
and I'm very upset and very disturbed. Things that just have happened
all along that impact the way that you have treated a lot of folks in
this budget and I would hope that you would just ?? the day and
overnight take another think about it and pray on it a little bit,
because ... Mr. Speaker, I have tried to temper my remarks to this
junction, but tomorrow maybe different.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Burr is recognized for a period not to

[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I just wanna hit on a couple
high notes obviously concerning two areas of the budget that I have
focused on as a full Chair. First, Health and Human Services. You know,
the House Health and Human Services Budget really takes steps to protect
our most vulnerable citizens and assure that the critical services that
they receive are continued. We've continued our short term assistance
for group home recipients so that issue can continue to be addressed. We
fully funded the alcohol and drug rehab centers that was proposed to be
eliminated by the Senate. We fund our State psych. beds. We came up with
a new approach on how to fund local communities psych. beds to make sure
that folks with those critical mental health needs are looked out for in
all communities. We fund medication assistance programs, the budget
funds, the medicate ??, and we're going to continue in this budget to
take steps to continue to reform and ultimately fix Medicaid in North
Carolina. Under this budget we fund an additional 5,000 slots for
per-school kids, for pre-K, that's 5,000 more kids that will be served
after this budget that the House has passed, that's put into law. When
it comes to the Justice and Public Safety Budget, this House continues
it's commitment to insure the safety and security of all North
Carolinians. We fund the 25 Million dollar upgrade for Viper. We fund
the 16 additional positions for ??, which will help rule North Carolina
and will make sure they're increasing their number of ?? from 3 to 4, so
that someone is there when law enforcement shows up to deal with the
issues that they have and the individuals that they're bringing into the
jails. We fund additional probation and parole officers to meet the
requirements of the Justice Reinvestment Act, we fund additional
positions in in the state crime lab. This budget is also really looking
out for our counties ...</p>

school safety.  Another very important measure that was debated in this
house, a bill that passed this house, passed unanimously, the Help Keep
Our Schools Safe.  That's in this budget.  And in ?? budget we
resurrected and put money toward the Rural Center, despite our folks
across the way and their opinion, we put funds there to help keep
economic growth in our rural counties.  We know that our rural counties
struggle and don't have the resources some of the larger ones have, and
we recognize that.  That's a priority.  Clean water management receives
funds.  This budget moves forward in transportation, taking the
governor's budget, or excuse me, the governor's proposals, and moves
forward with that.  We passed that House bill on the floor, I can't
recollect the number-- seems like it's 817 but I may be incorrect-- but
this budget does just that.  So folks this budget as a whole-- it is a
good budget.  Can you find something you may not like?  Sure.  Even I
can.  But when you folks in the minority were in the majority, I'm sure
that you didn't like every single thing in the budgets that you passed.
And you have to weigh what you like against what you don't like, and I
like by far most everything in this budget.  And again, I think we
funded the priorities, and things that we need to move this state
forward.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hall is recognized to debate the bill
for a period not to exceed five minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, and it's certainly important
that we talk about this budget tonight and that we have even more time
tomorrow and everyone keep that in mind.  So you may hear things
tomorrow that you didn't hear tonight.  We've had a long day and people
have made efforts to improve the budget; some have passed and some have
failed.  But this budget makes it painfully clear that we don't have the
right priorities in mind for North Carolina as reflected by this budget.
 It reveals really our number one priority is to say, whatever we have
to do to provide tax breaks on the finance package and reduce the
revenue necessary for this state, which has increased by a million
people over the last ten years, whatever we have to do that is
necessary, then we'll do that with less money.  And so the fact that
it's in this budget for some amount doesn't mean it's a sufficient
amount or a responsible amount.  But make no mistake, the real victims
in this budget are the middle class families.  It slashes our proven job
creation programs, and it even in the face of this high unemployment we
have in this state and have continued to have, yet and still we have
failed in this budget to address our job creation challenges in North
Carolina.  Worse than that, it cuts education and schools.  It cuts
teachers' assistants.  Maybe not as much as it could, but it still does.
 Where are the priorities?  For the third year in a row we have done
that.  And again, job creation not available in the short term, not
addressed for the long term.  Instead of working to retain teachers for
our kids, we've denied teachers a pay raise.  We've denied them the
resources they need, and we've reduced the people in the classroom who
will groom our leaders and our work force of the future.  It reduces our
access to health care for North Carolinians as well, even in the face of
what we know is coming with our population.  You know this budget is a
way of us telling North Carolinians who are listening now what our
priorities are and what we really value.  It's not enough just to be in
charge, and I know that's a good feeling and I congratulate you on that.
 And I was hoping that as the period of time-- the responsibility would
set in over a period of time and folks would understand it's not _just_
about being in charge; sometimes it's about being responsible.  But this
budget is not responsible to the people of North Carolina.  It's not
responsible to...</p>

successful as it is even today and we're failing that tradition if we
don't focus onjob creation or take action to really reduce unemployment
revenues spenidng on millions on trying to create some kind of branding
campaign for North Carolina we should have put real funding and real job
creation programs we cut those proven job creation programs and we cut
those organizations and entities to provide leveraging our communities
we damaged public education we jeopardize our children's future as a
result no one could feel comfortable about knowing these massive cuts we
yielded on public education on our university systems and our community
college system were going to let teacher assistances go… We know that
our budget does that and maybe not as many as we did last year will have
as many to let go as we did last year there gone a 48 in teacher
training 46 education spending on our citizens and our children but when
they say the race to the bottom of the finish of one and then you got a
race to the top we don't have was necessary for citizens to change what
they needed to do finally all communities of all the falling behind our
transportation budget now continues to shield transportation dollars
from the needed rule community areas back to the cities we have taken
healthcare away from them and our cutting vital regional economic
development organizations that will rule communities in short rule North
Carolina his left without a shut out but don't messages are Mr. Speaker
picograms of resident of dollars and has  [SPEAKER CHANGES].repaired not
exceed five minutes speaker ??  [SPEAKER CHANGES]. Thank you  when I
hear the distinguished minority leader say that we all these bad things
we don't always bad things must be thinking about the budgets when he
was in the majority and I would agree with him  when he was in the
majority that he did lots of bad things but he's not talking about this
budget I mean  think about it we had two fulldays commitments for this
budget right the kinds of unlimited you so think about the things on the
most of the day-to-day was actually spent talking about limited with
respect to prison okay grant things what the Democrats have a hard time
with and they have a very hard time with it had a hard time with it last
two years and apparently this year as well is what they want to do is
see taxes increased the domestic tax reform the same rates lower they
seem to set the truth is what Republicans wanted to set and we've done
this budget this but has been getting good reviews around the state from
folks that don't that are not partisan of people who can clearly the
order this budget and that this budget is realistic we live with him on
the image above we fund the things that are most important in this day
we fund the healthcare needs that represent a book called about we fund
education needs the representative Holloway talked about we find the
public safety needs that have been discussed today we set priorities in
those areas and this budget is responsible we fund recurring
expenditures with recurring dollars we're not all trying to buy the
whole world without trying to protect every fee amount they are
predestined one of the complaints we find the initiative fund that will

The report of the Governor on this is fundamental reform in the state
government . Now you want to talk about the situation in North Carolina.
 We've had for several years, higher than the national average in
unemployment. We're working on job programs. We've got a Work First
program. We've got other efforts to reform what we're doing in commerce
to better the market North Carolina, to make North Carolina more
attractive for capital, more attractive for the dynamic economic growth
that we need here in this state.
Mr. Speaker, you know, people can live in a parallel universe and come
up with any kind of excuse to say &quot;No, I'm not going to vote for
that budget&quot;. But a honest appraisal of the budget that this House
has produced comes to one simple conclusion - that this House has
produced a common sense budget that does provide the services that our
citizens need in the vital areas of education, healthcare, public safety
and job development. We've done it within our resources, and I think the
citizens will be very well served. I commend the budget to you. [Speaker

The question before the House is the passage of the House committee
substitute to Senate bill 402 as amended on its second reading. All in
favor vote 'Aye'. All opposed vote 'No'. The clerk will open the vote.
The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote.  77 having voted
affirmative and 41 in the negative, the House Committee substitute to
Senate bill 402 is passed its second reading, and will remain on the
calendar.
Ladies and Gentlemen, we  are going to adjourn subject to receipt of
messages from the Senate and Committee reports and possibly
modifications to the calendar and other provisions. But I appreciate the
indulgence of the members today. It was a long session. I appreciate the
decorum and the hard work of both members of the majority, the minority.
We're going out of session tomorrow at 9 am. And we will continue the
debate on the third reading of the budget. Again, the chair will not
accept any amendments tomorrow. We will debate it as long as the members
see fit. On Monday, we do expect a calendar. It might even be a lengthy
calendar. Part of that is just in anticipation of beginning the
conferencing process next week, and having to have a light calendar on a
couple days next week as the budget is negotiated between the House and
the Senate.
By motion to members from Gaston and Cleveland Counties, the Chair is
happy to extend the courtesies of the gallery to Craig Collins, the
Chair of the 10th GOP District. Craig, welcome.
