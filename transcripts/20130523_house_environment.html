Pat’s not here today so we’ll go ahead and start the committee. These
people gotta leave here today. We’d like to recognize our Sergeant at
Arms today, we have Bill Bass, Martha Parish. Where you at Martha? Barry
More and Charlie Goodman, Charles Goodman. We don’t have any pages
today? OK, I’m sorry. We got pages today. Alex Jones from Henderson
County Representative McGrady. Elizabeth, how do you say that Elizabeth?
Mazenco from Wake County, Representative Stam. Andrew Scott from Wake
county, Speaker Tillis. Got another tough one here from Guilford. From
Guilford County, Representative Faircloth. Lawrence Strickland from
Forsythe County, Representative Lambert. Thank you all for being here
today. The bill we’ve got today is Senator Buck Newton’s bill, Senate
Bill 234, we just passed the House version of that and this is the
identical bill. And if you’d like, I’d let staff go over the bill since
the Senator is not here today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So the bill basically allows the Wildlife
Resources Commission to issue a hunting heritage apprentice permit which
authorizes a person who doesn’t meet the hunter education course
requirements to purchase a hunting license and hunt if accompanied by a
licensed adult of at least 18 years of age. The applicant can also be
accompanied by an adult land holder or spouse who’s exempted by the
hunting license requirement by statute if they’re on the landholder’s
land. And the permit is valid only for the term of the hunting license
purchased under the authority of the permit. There’s some technical
changes and the bill provides that a person may not obtain a hunting
license without producing a hunter education certificate of competency,
a hunting heritage apprentice permit, or a hunting license issued prior
to July 1st, 2013.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Insko.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I can’t, I’m not sure what this does. Could anybody get one of these
licenses as long as they have an adult who’s 18 or over with a license?
IS there anyone who’s excluded or is it open to everybody? I see the
disabled language, but I don’t see it limited to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ll just point out, as, for what it’s worth, as Representative West
said, we already passed the identical House companion. Representative
John Bell’s House 296 back in April, so this is the same, exact same
language as the bill that you’ve already passed. We have folks from
Wildlife here who might be able to answer that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Anyone from Wildlife that would like to speak to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair. My name is Chris Dell, and I’m the legislative
liason for Wildlife Resource Commission. This bill is allowed for all
adults. It’s identical to what we allow for children now. If you’re
under 16, you’re able to go hunt without a license or without hunter ed
with adult supervision. This will allow people over 16 to go out with
adults. If you want to do a dove hunt, you have to be within eyesight.
So we’re trying to increase our recruitment and retention in a hunting
licenses.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair. So basically what this bill does is lessen the
burden that we currently have. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, yes sir, it does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ok, Madam Chair at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ok, any further – Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, I’m not opposed to this bill. Can you tell me what the status
of Representative Bell’s bill is? If we passed it, is it in the Senate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s in the Senate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, we’re not sure what they’re going to do with this one after it
passes out of here either. Aww I didn’t mean that. Representative, I
mean Senator Newton I’m sorry. Any further questions from the committee?
OK, Representative Stone, we have that motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair. Make a favorable report for Senate Bill 234. I
don’t know if it’s going anywhere else or not, but.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Referral to Rules? No. No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Wait a minute.
