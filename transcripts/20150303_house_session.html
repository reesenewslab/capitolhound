[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker and members of the House, we had a very
good vote on this bill yesterday. Be happy to respond to any questions;
would appreciate your support. There may be a couple of additional
amendments coming today – I’m not sure of that, but would appreciate
your continued support for the bill today. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland, Representative
Glazier, rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, having been in the
majority on the vote yesterday on - [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized for a motion I believe the gentleman is seeking for a motion.
The gentleman may state his motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very
much, Mr. Speaker. I apologize. Having been in the majority yesterday
and the vote on the Hager amendment. Amendment number 3, to Senate Bill
20, or Senate Bill 14, I hereby move to reconsider the chamber’s vote on
that amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Cumberland has
moved to reconsider the vote by which amendment 3 was adopted. The
gentleman has the floor to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you very much, Mr. Speaker, and very briefly. My concern yesterday, and
I attempted because it came up quickly without much notice to find out
what the amendment was about. I talked as fast as I could to staff on
the floor, tried to get with Representative McGrady, who was tied up
looking at other amendments, and at first blush

  <p id="10:00">
  The amendment didn’t appear to be one that was gonna cause great
significant issues.  But on looking at it overnight and today, my
concern is, number one, we’ve added, effectively, a provision on
fracking into a bill that has nothing to do with fracking.  It was meant
to solve some very specific time-sensitive problems as it related to the
Colash Commission, as it related to funding for issues at DPI and the
exchange issue.  This was added in, unrelated to anything directly in
the title, frankly, and unrelated to the substance of what the bill was
doing.  I think that there’s a real important discussion to have about
any issue that comes up that’s fairly substantive and that will have an
effect on, whether it’s fracking or any other issue, in the way that
this will as it relates to air toxins.  I think that this is an issue
where there is an open gap right now, that this attempts to fill very
substantively and will have a significant effect.  It deserves its own
bill, or at least its own consideration and discussion in Committee, and
it deserves, for the body, when we vote, as we were voting last night,
to be told of what the real effect of this provision is going to be.
I’m seeking to reconsider because I think that we all deserve that
discussion, we deserve the scientific knowledge and the basis, we
deserve to know where the amendment is coming from, and we deserve to
debate the substance of the amendment and not have it thrown fast last
night in a bill that has nothing to do with fracking.  And for that
reason, cuz I believe we’re off to a really good start, this session, in
a bipartisan manner, I think what happened on that amendment, probably
very unintentionally, but what happened on that amendment I think caught
most of us on both sides of the aisle off-guard, and I think we need to
reconsider our vote, and renew a discussion on that at a later time,
pass this bill that I voted for, and, and get that moving, and deal with
the fracking issue at a later date.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I do move
to reconsider.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the motion?  The Gentleman from
Hardick, Representative Lewis, is recognized to debate the motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Gentleman has the floor to debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen of the House, it’s very rare that
we do a motion to reconsider, but I have conferred with the Speaker,
with the maker of the motion and also with the majority leader, who will
be debating the motion, and I’m gonna ask all of the Members to please
vote to, in this case, to please vote Green and to allow this matter to
be reconsidered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the Gentleman from Rutherford, Representative Hager, desire to
debate this?  Further discussion, further debate?  If not, the question
before the House is the motion by Representative Glazier to reconsider
the adoption of Amendment Three offered by Representative Hager to the
House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 14.  So any favoring the
motion will vote ‘Aye’, those opposed will vote ‘No’. The clerk will
open the vote.  The clerk will let the machine record the vote. One
hundred and eleven having voted in the affirmative and five in the
negative, the motion is adopted.  We are now back on the, back on the
amendment offered by Representative Hager, on the third reading to the
House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 14.  The gentleman from
Rutherford, Representative Hager, is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I think when the Rules Chairman and I talked
about this, we had said we would just go ahead and have it considered
‘cuz we think the amendment’s a good amendment, and it’ll stand up the,
I think a hundred and five ‘Yes’es that we got yesterday.  What this
amendment does, as I explained yesterday, it fixes the issue in our
Mining and  Energy Commission Rules.  In the original bill, we stated
that we wanted the Mining and Energy Commission to develop the air toxin
rules.  Well, what we didn’t allow them to do was say, “Okay, is the
state and federal rules good enough for this area?  If so, you can adopt
those.”  We didn’t allow them to do that so now if, and what the, what
the amendment does if you remember it from yesterday, it allows those
folks to go back and look at the state and federal air toxin rules for,
especially on the interjects ?? side, and say, “Are they stringent
enough?”, and if they are, it allows them to adopt ‘em.  If they’re not
stringent enough it allows them to go develop other rules.  Basically
all the amendment does.  So I would ask you all to vote as you voted
yesterday, vote Green.

  ...the floor to debate the amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.  While I respectfully disagree with my colleague
from Rutherfordton [sic], I think this is actually a very substantive
amendment.  As you&#39;ll recall, those of you who were here in 2012,
and as Represenative Hager referenced, we mandated that the Mining and
Energy Commission and the Environmental Management Commission adopt
rules relating to air toxics related to the fracking operations.  This
is a very significant side effect of fracking operations, and our rules
- we had no rules on it and this is a very substantive gaping problem
with our rules relating to the fracking - ??fracking.  We also, in that
same time, when we adopted Senate bill 821, we promised North
Carolinians that we would adopt the strongest and the safest rules
relating to fracking in the country and I&#39;m afraid that if we adopt
this amendment we will have abdicated on that promise once again.  I
think that this is the - Representative Hager&#39;s amendment removes
the only statutory requirement that the EMC move forward with air toxics
rules.  There are so many problems associated with air toxics related to
fracking.  And  I think this is very important and I think, as
Representative Glazier mentioned, this is substantive enough that it
deserves its own debate in a separate proceeding and not as an amendment
to a quickly-moving bill that needs to be - it&#39;s a must-pass bill -
so I respectfully request that you vote no on this bill - on this
amendment.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Henderson, Representative
McGrady rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Henderson has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I very much appreciate the majority leader&#39;s willingness to
have a discussion about this amendment. I really don&#39;t believe the
amendment should be part of this bill.  If you go back to the original
bill, this is an appropriations bill.  It had to do with getting funding
to three things that needed funding at the time, Common Core and the
coal ash.  We worked with the senate on another coal ash issue as
opposed to running an amendment with respect, an environmental amends
bill.  By agreement with the Senate we added the coal ash provisions to
the coal ash funding provisions in this bill.   This amendment takes us
to a different place.  It does involve complicated issues. I was
surprised by it, obviously, because it&#39;s largely inconsistent with
positions I&#39;ve taken in the past and I voted for the amendment, but
you couldn&#39;t tell what the amendment did.  Putting aside the pros
and cons of fracking, which I don&#39;t want to get into at all, this
bill should not become a Christmas tree, and it is an appropriations
bill that by a broad consensus, we worked out the coal ash piece to, to
add to it, but otherwise there&#39;s nothing else been added here, and I
really do ask that we don&#39;t take up this amendment now.  I&#39;m
certainly willing to debate it at some point in the future when
we&#39;ve got the facts in front of us, but trying to debate the pros
and cons of what is clearly not just a technical amendment today, I
think is a mistake, and I urge you to vote no on this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What purpose does the gentleman from Wake, Representative Martin, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Wake has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.  Members, I&#39;m one of those that
voted for this amendment yesterday, and also voted for the bill. I am
now in a position where I have to vote against this amendment as
it&#39;s presented for me now, and its own process grounds, separate
from any sort of policy contained in the amendment itself.  One reason
that I voted for it is because like many members who support the
amendment is that I thought it was essentially a technical amendment,
and for that reason, I supported it and allowed it to move forward.  If
instead, we are gonna start adding on, like Representative McGrady said,
ornaments to a Christmas tree on the floor, items that are significant -
whether you agree with the policy or not, but the one thing that&#39;s
not in doubt is that  it is a significant policy item.  If we&#39;re
gonna start doing that, it&#39;s gonna grind our house proceedings on
the floor to a halt, because those of us who are concerned about these
sort of amendments that pop up are gonna have to start asking a lot of
questions and in some cases objecting the third reading, holding it over
to the next day - and probably on 90 percent of the items that we&#39;re
doing that on it&#39;s - it is, those bills are gonna be innocuous, they
aren&#39;t gonna need that kind of scrutiny, but the problem is when
we&#39;re confronted with an amendment that we have not seen before, we
don&#39;t know until we have time, so my concern, members, is if an
amendment like this moves forward now...

  that we are setting ourselves up towards very, very long sessions and
wasting a lot of time going through bills and amendments that don&#39;t
need it. So instead what I suggest we do is perhaps withdraw this
amendment, or vote it down, put it into a bill, with the bill filing
deadlines are still in the future. There&#39;s still plenty of time to
introduce this amendment into a bill of its own. Have it go through the
committee process and vet it like the process is supposed to work, and
then we can go back to the way we tend to do business here, which is if
we believe it&#39;s a technical bill, we&#39;ll tend to support it and
we&#39;ll move forward. So for those reasons I&#39;d urge you to oppose
this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Lee,
Representative Reives, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And I&#39;ll just say without reiterating everything
we&#39;ve already heard. I think we&#39;ve heard plenty of times last
session discussions about just where?? Representative Martin is
discussing. We have an opportunity for a good, clean, easy bill to go
through that everybody&#39;s pretty much in agreement on. This amendment
changes the character of that bill. And we ask again, not for you to
vote based on your belief about policy or not policy regarding this
particular amendment, but based on the fact that this amendment does not
have anything to do, at this point in time, with what this bill was
originally intended for. Right now, this is something that I think we do
need to look at. We just had Senate bill 820 that addressed this issue
just a couple of years ago, and then suddenly we&#39;re readdressing the
issue in an unrelated bill. And so I agree with Representative Martin,
Representative McGrady, Representative Glazier. They have all discussed.
Let&#39;s get this amendment away from this particular bill and if
it&#39;s something we want to discuss, let&#39;s have it discussed in a
separate bill. I thank you for your indulgence.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Nash,
Representative Collins, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would concede that you could argue the germaneness
of this amendment. I fail to see how this is a significant policy
change, to quote one of our representatives. I fail to see how it&#39;s
any kind of policy change hardly at all. If you will read the first
sentence under number two, which is the only thing that was changed,
what you&#39;ll find out is that nothing has been taken away from this
commission. They&#39;ve just been given two additional alternatives.
They can either determine that state air quality rules are good enough.
They can determine that federal qualities are good enough and we&#39;ll
copy those. Or they can come up with their own. So nothing has been
taken away from them. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. We&#39;re just giving
them two additional alternatives to what they had before. To say that
this is a significant policy change is really, really a stretch.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Mecklenburg,
Representative Jeter, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;m less concerned about the Christmas tree
aspect, or whether or not it&#39;s a technical amendment, because if
we&#39;re gonna start that litmus test, Katy, bar the door. We&#39;re
not gonna get out of here until October. I will say that I think this is
indicative of a different problem which is we require PCSs to be out by
9:00 at night, but yet major substantial changes to a bill which happen
or are going to happen and we&#39;re not going to stop, can be done in
an amendment without any prior notice, without any prior warning. And
then we end up voting on things we&#39;ve never even really read, seen,
comprehended, and have no way of doing so. I think this probably
illustrates more so than any the need for having some rule, and I hope
we would address our permanent rules, that this will be part of those
permanent rules, that amendments have to be given to the members at
least in time to do due diligence. As Republicans, we like to say we
read the bills before we vote on them. I know my colleagues in this
chamber like to read the bills before we vote on them. We should be
given the same opportunity on substantial amendments. I don&#39;t say
that in any way as a criticism of this case, because I&#39;d be willing
to bet Roger West five bucks. Just kidding. I&#39;m not. This
amendment&#39;s gonna pass regardless of what I or anyone else says on
this floor. So disposing the amendment, doing away with it, I think is a
issue. I think the way this happened has brought up a bigger issue that
we need to address as a body to protect every member from amendments
that are impossible to understand on the fly. I expect Representative
Hager&#39;s amendment to pass, and I hate that his amendments got tied
into this, but I think it&#39;s a solution we need to fix.

The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, guys this is don’t for yourself and what this
says, this in an issue folks, it don’t like energy exploration, this is
a small change that actually makes it better for the EMC and gives them
alternatives, it makes it a little tougher they can choose to have their
own rules, if they don’t have the State and the Federal rules aren’t
strict enough, that’s what this is about, it’s not about the amendment
in itself as far as having a Christmas Tree, it’s about those folks that
don’t like energy exploration, look at the folks who spoke against this
bill, everyone on and let’s say to the TS spoke against energy
exploration in the past so that’s what this is about, it’s not about to
remind itself this amendment, it’s not about how minor the amendment is
or how technical it is, it’s about a policy that folks that don’t like
energy explorations to have and block by all means that they can, so
that’s what this is about. So I would implore you to vote green on this
issue, let’s get this amendment back in there and let’s make sure that
we get this and there is a small amendment and it is a technical change
like my colleague Representative Collin says and it makes it better for
the EMC to do their job.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
With all respect for my colleague, I don’t view this as a technical
amendment by any stretch of the imagination. It relates to potential and
ongoing litigation that could occur, it opt to be, I’m certainly
comfortable, I’m talking about this in the Environment Committee and
passing out a bill when ?? but it should not have been brought up here
and it shouldn’t be added to this appropriations bill on this session.
And I just think we are going down the wrong road if we go there, as the
gentleman from Nash conceded this is a no way to remain anything else in
this bill. There is nothing else in this bill that relates to the
subject of this amendment. Therefore, I again urge you to vote no on
this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion further debate? If not the question before the house
is amendment 3 offered by the gentleman form Rutherford to the third

  and we actually debated the measure correctly you all remember that we
actually had to take a recess to get this drafted correctly. Well, it
actually while it was debated right it was held a little bit of a
drafting error. So we want to actually take care of that drafting error
so make sure it will actually pass the house as debated and not as
incorrectly written.
[Change Speaker]
What purpose does the gentleman from Henderson to representative Mc
Grady rise?
[Change Speaker]
To ask representative Millis a question.
[Change Speaker]
Does the gentleman from Pender yield to the gentleman from Henderson?
[Change Speaker]
Most certainly.
[Change Speaker]
He yields.
[Change Speaker]
You do a little oblique am I correct in understanding what happened is
you and I explain the amendment last night correctly and we left out the
word, not?
[Change Speaker]
That is correct.
[Change Speaker]
To speak on the amendment.
[Change Speaker]
The gentleman from Henderson has the floor to debate the amendment.
[Change Speaker]
Representative Millis and I were embarrassed a little bit last night
after explaining this amendment at some length. It was drafted to fix a
particular concern that representative Millis and others were raising
and in the haste of moving it to the floor we only forgot one word and
that was not. It&#39;s sort of a critical word and so I would urge the
adoption of the amendment so that it is consistent with what we told you
the amendment did last night.
[Change Speaker]
For what purpose does the lady from Guilford representative Harrison
rise?
[Change Speaker]
Question the amendment sponsor.
[Change Speaker]
Does the gentleman from Pender yield to the lady from Guilford?
[Change Speaker]
Most certainly.
[Change Speaker]
He yields.
[Change Speaker]
Thank you, I don&#39;t have the language of the amendment in front of
me, last nights amendment but is this the provision that says that it
does not require that a plan that is not affiliated with the coal ash
plan does not have to have to have an engineer plan is that the relevant
not?
[Change Speaker]
That&#39;s correct if you actually support this amendment, what the
actual legislation will say is that if you are associated with a dam
that&#39;s associated with coal ash that you will require an engineers
seal in actually to do the emergency action plan. But if your not
associated with a coal ash basin you will not.
[Change Speaker]
To speak to the member.
[Change Speaker]
The lady from Guilford has the floor to debate the amendment.
[Change Speaker]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I think representative Mc Grady pointed out the
problem with representative Millis&#39;s amendment last night and
that&#39;s that several of these ponds are high hazard ponds. The
definition of high hazard pond is that it can result in loss of life or
significant property damage. So I would say that we shouldn&#39;t exempt
high hazard ponds from the requirement to have and engineering plan even
if they are in a coal ash related pond. So I would encourage those of
you and I think there are at least twenty three of us last night that
voted no to continue to vote no on this amendment. Thank you.
[Change Speaker]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Pender representative Millis
rise?
[Change Speaker]
To make a few last comments about the amendment.
[Change Speaker]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment the second time.
[Change Speaker]
First and foremost in light of representative Mc Grady&#39;s comments
there we understand what happened last night in no way shape or form
will I stand up and disrespect bill draft and since the aspects
there&#39;s a long session ahead and what they do is tremendously help
us out so while it was an honest mistake the debate was correct. In
regards to representative Harris and his comments, one thing I want you
guys to realize is that before the passage of this bill emergency action
plans where not actually required. Now they are. So the problem you have
is whether your a little small farm pond or your an intermediate hazard
things of that nature now all of the sudden there&#39;s this requirement
to get emergency action plans. And the actual part that has to deal with
the price of engineering is the actual inundation map. So whoever is
downstream modelling who actually needs to be notified if there is a
need for an evacuation if a dam would fail. But the one thing you guys
need to realize and I want to make sure this comment is made so you guys
can decide how you wanted to vote is that Diener still has the authority
to actually regulate this process. And again Diener has the authority to
accept the emergency action plan or to not accept the emergency action
plan. So again we&#39;re not forgoing any protections to public health
or safety or welfare because that agency is actually charged with that
responsibility. What we&#39;re actually removing is the potential red
tape for every single farm pond in your district to require an engineers
seal and therefore to drive up the costs for you constituents. We&#39;re
protecting health and public safety while also not having a jobs bill
for engineers as well. And I say that, I&#39;m a licensed professional
engineer myself. So again so your not hearing it from someone else your
hearing it from me a licensed PE so I want to make sure you understand
there&#39;s nothing that&#39;s forgoing public protection but
there&#39;s also a study that&#39;s going to happen. Where Diener and

  Then the board can have this conversation if we need some further action
in the future, so vote as you will, but I want you guys who vote for
this to be very comfortable of what you&#39;re actually voting for and
not have no misconceptions.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Henderson, Representative
McGrady rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To speak on the amendment a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Harrison, is correct that I did point out the pros and
cons of the amendment. I did want to point out that I supported the
amendment and will support it again. The state was one of only two
states before we passed the ?? Management Act, that did not provide for
EAP&#39;s related to dam safety and with the passage of this amendment
we&#39;ll make it easier for those EAP&#39;s to be put in place, but
recognize that in some cases an engineer may be needed and in other
cases it isn&#39;t need to be needed. I think its a very reasonable
amendment and I do fully support the amendment put forth by
Representative Millis.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]

Today marks the 100th anniversary of Mount Mitchell State Park which is
comprised of a unique topography that makes Western North Carolina a
great place to live and to visit. In 1835, UNC professor Dr. Elisha
Mitchell initially mapped the peak of the mountain that would bear his
name using only barometric pressure readings and mathematical formulas.
Dr. Mitchell&#39;s measurements were within a margin of error of only 12
feet. I know you engineers in here would be surprised by that. Mount
Mitchell was named in his honor in 1858. North Carolina General Assembly
enacted legislation on March the 3rd 1915 that created a commission to
purchase land on and around the peak of Mount Mitchell located in Yancey
county for the purpose of creating a state park. In purchasing Mount
Mitchell, the tallest peak east of the Mississippi River standing at
6,684 feet, North Carolina&#39;s first state park was established. Mount
Mitchell State Park, which has recorded snowfall in every month of the
year, now encompasses 1,946 acres. Includes a restaurant, camping
grounds, a handicapped accessible viewing tower was added in 2008, and
scenic hiking trails through the miles of remote wilderness among the
Black Mountains. Now, I want to tell you a little personal thing. We
were on a hike, across the Blacks, we started at Mount Mitchell and we
went into Deep Gap, my husband and two of my boys, and as we were going
the boys (of course) went quite a bit ahead of us, and they came back in
a little bit and they said, &quot;Dad, there&#39;s about 25 or 30 men up
there&quot; in the Deep Gap where we were planning on spending the
night. So Keith went on up, and i just kind of laid back a little while,
and as he finally came back he said, &quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;re
gonna have any problem at all. That&#39;s the Charlotte Police
Department up there.&quot; So, thank you.
