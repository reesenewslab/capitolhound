Education, provide scholarship grants in the maximum amount of $4200 to
eligible students to attend non-public schools. The PCS that you see
before you is going to require the State Education Assistance Authority
is going to be the administrator of the program.  They’re going to be
the ones who award the grants. And we’ve got it set up in a two year
process right now you’ll see and so I want to tell you what the
eligibility is for the first year which would be this upcoming year
2013-14.  To be an eligible student in the 2013-2014 year, two factors.
You have to reside in a household with an income level not in excess of
Free/Reduced Lunch, which is 185% of federal poverty guideline.  So you
have to meet that first criteria and then you also have to be a full
time student assigned to and attending North Carolina public school
during the prior 2013 spring semester.  So that is the first year
requirement. There is two requirements only.  Must have been in public
school prior semester and must be at Free/Reduced Lunch level or below.
And just to reiterate on what the education, the State Education
Assistance Authority’s role is going to be in both years, they will be
creating temporary rules for all this including a process which will
likely be a lottery process, similar to what you may have seen for
charter schools in the past. Let me jump into the second year. For
school year 2014-15, these are the criteria.  You have to reside in a
house with an income level, and you can follow along with this basically
in the bill summary.  You have to reside in a household with an income
level not in excess of 133% of the Free/Reduced Lunch level which I
think it says there’s about 240% of poverty guidelines. In addition to
that requirement, you have to meet one of the following criteria. You
have to have been a  full time public school student the prior semester,
received a scholarship grant the following year, be entering
kindergarten or first grade, be a foster student or been adopted the
last year.  Just the two extra sort of criteria which is a very small
number of students. It also sets forth the timelines for the next year.
They would start putting out applications out no later than February 1
and doing initial lottery or whatever mechanism they create later than
March 1.The 2nd one, let me talk about the award priority especially for
the second year. So 1st priority for that 2nd year would go to those
students who received the scholarship grant the prior year now they’ve
still got to meet the income requirement and that’s going to have gone
up slightly so the family could actually have made a little more money
in the year and still qualify but they still got to be below the general
number. In addition, second priority goes as follows.  At least 50% of
the funds, of the new funds must be used for students that qualify for
Free/reduced Lunch level . That initial level and below. In addition no
more than 35% of the funds can be used for grants to students entering
kindergarten or 1st grade, and then any remaining funds are doled out
just to whose eligible. Again with the amount of the scholarship, for
Free/Reduced Lunch students they can get the full $4,200. For students
in the below/above sort of that number but below 133%, they can get up
to 90% of the 4,200.  So there’s some level of parent participation ??.
On eligibility, the Education Assistance Authority will verify, they’ll
select a random number, a set number to verify and they will on an
annual basis also establish rules and they can revoke someone’s award if
they don’t follow the rules.  With respect to the sort of additional
obligations of the SA, I think most of them are actually outlined in
Section 115, actually that’s, well let me skip ahead and just go over
what are the obligations of the nonpublic schools.</p>

<p id="10:00">
So for the non-public schools receiving grants, they have a number of
obligations they have to comply with. They have to provide the SCA with
information on tuition and fees every year. They have to conduct certain
criminal background check. They have to make sure to provide parents
receiving grants with annual written explanations of the student’s
progress, including test scores and standardized test. They also have to
submit annually the test scores of any standardized test administered to
any student receiving a grant—this data is not of public record, these
are individual tests, but it will be used for data purposes. And they
also need to provide graduation rates of the students receiving grants.
Further, they also have to contract with a CPA, and these are to
requirements related to what I’ll call schools that have a fairly
significant number of students. A lot of schools take a couple students;
obviously the burdens that we put on a school taking a couple students
are less than a school that takes a hundred students in the scholarship
program, and in this example if the school receives more than $300,000
in grants, maybe 70 kids or so, in that instance they’re going to have
to go through a financial review with a CPA and provide that
information. In addition, if you have more than 25 students, you have to
provide aggregate test data. So if you’ve got that many students at your
school you’ve gotta provide aggregate test data back to the program.
With respect to the endorsement process, the school will be getting
money twice a year, and it has to be endorsed by the students’ parents
or guardians. Let me let my cosponsors jump in with—I think I’ve covered
the basics. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I just want to thank representative
Bryan??. I know that he is a freshman, but it did not seem like it
working on the bill with him. We really had a deliberative process, and
we worked really hard, and I just want to reiterate some of the things
that I hear some of the rhetoric that comes out of what this bill is and
I wanted to let you know what the bill is not. Some people say this is a
way for wealthy people to get scholarships. That is not true. As you can
look at the bill that you cannot really make more than $50,000 a year
and be able to achieve this. And so I don’t think we can hardly call
that wealthy, and one of the things that we also were able to do is to
make sure that no matter what, how we deal with this bill in the future
or how we deal with this program in the future, that 50% of the kids
will always, free or reduced lunches, will always have access to this
scholarship which was very important for me because as we go through
this bill and as we go through this process, a lot of folks and
communities that look like mine, we’re going to have to be able to build
the capacity to be able to make sure that people that are going to be
able to take advantage of it, and so because of the fact that we have
reserved money for 50% of free and reduced lunch kids, I think that we
will always have the access questions answered. One of the things that I
like about the bill also that we worked with Representatives Brown,
Bryan, and Hanes is that any savings that comes out of this, and there
will be a savings and every single state that has implemented this has
ended up having a savings to the state and North Carolina will be no
different, and once we do get the savings that we have set up a place
where LEAs?? can go?? and be able to retrieve that money for a
public-private partnership. I think that because of all the changes that
we make in the bill, I think it’s really one of the better bills that
we’ve had in a general assembly, and I think it encompasses the values
of both parties, and especially for me as a progressive Democrat this
definitely talks about the issues of justice and equal opportunity and
equal access, and I’ll just leave you with this because I just want
people to understand where it comes from and what that looks like. If
you are able to look at a parent and look them dead square in the face,
and that parent is a poor parent, and you know that they don’t have the
same opportunities and the same access as someone that lives across
town, if you are prepared to look them directly in the face to say, “Yes
ma'am, I know that your child has had 3 F's on their report card,” “Yes
ma'am, I know that they have been suspended twice,” and “Yes ma'am, I
know that school is not working for them, but therefore you live in that
zipcode you must attend that school,” if you’re prepared to call that
progressive, if you’re prepared to call that democratic ideals</p>

If you are prepare to call that equal opportunity and equal access, I
would challenge you on that. But I will say that I stand up hear as a
progressive democrat and say that I will be fighting for my constituents
for equal opportunity and equal access. [Speaker changes]  Afternoon
members. I just want to thank Representative Bryant for his work, as
well as the other co-sponsors of this bill. We worked very, very hard to
create a bill that is really working for the future of North Carolina. I
say all time, several weeks ago, us four stood on a stage along with the
speaker in Greensborough and heard from over three thousand parents all
across this state, not just from Greensborough. They traveled miles,
miles and miles to come to talk to us and it wasn’t to see us. It was to
tell to us and encourage use to continue pushing on with this bill. To
make sure we give their kids an opportunity that they don’t current
have. And this isn’t just about urban districts, I live in a rural
district and this is about opportunity to provide these kids with a
future that they don’t currently have. There are community out-reach
centers in my district, that if you walk in there, these kids are
bright, bright children, who just do not have the opportunity to succeed
under their current environment. This is chance for us to align their
ability with opportunity, and that is what we need ladies and gentleman,
that is a fact, that is the future of North Carolina. I sincerely urge
you to help us support this bill. I look forward to information that
will be given to us as well. Thank you very much. [Speaker changes]
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Talents are universal, but
opportunities are not. Talents are universal, but opportunities are not.
As I thought about this bill, as we spoke about at our news conference
yesterday afternoon and as I contemplated and reflected on my life as
public school student, I am a product of the public school in ???
county. My parents were both administrators in the ?? county school
system for over thirty five years. My aunts and uncles are all teachers.
Most of my cousins are teachers up and down the east coast of this great
nation. As I thought about where we stand today, I came to a simple
conclusion, and that is all our students in our public schools do not
have equal opportunity at a sound and basic education. That is promised
to our students constitutionally in this state. A sound and basic
opportunity, a chance at that. I firmly believe, that it is perhaps, the
number one civil rights issue of our day, education. It keeps our homes
sound, it keeps the future of our students sound and according to every
statistic once our students are reading at a proficient level at the end
of the third grade, it keeps the from being qualified for jail. It keeps
them from joining us in rally, colleagues, while we sit on Jones Street
and they become qualified for Central Prison. That is simply the
reality. When I ran for the North Carolina General Assembly, I ran on
the idea of uniting, on the idea of pulling our colleagues here of the
General Assembly out of silos and I was not all the way there, when it
came to tax credits or vouchers, but as I started doing the research and
I started looking at the realities after I gathered information from the
Department of Public Instruction with regard to third grade reading
proficiency and as I looked across  the state I became quite embarrassed
at what I saw. I saw numbers that reflected in Charlotte for educational
or for economically disadvantaged students, 55% reading proficient, Nash
county 55% reading proficient, North Hampton 51% reading proficient,
Chapel Hill 48%</p>

Sanction, yet we provide no guarantees of quality of performance of
those schools.  When parents want to move to a better school they are
either told no or move to a waiting list of all things because other
parents want to do the exact same thing.  It’s time to give these
families a real chance. Dr. David Figlio of the National Economic
Research Bureau found that in Florida’s scholarship program that just
means tested, that there has been an increased competitive pressure
faced by public schools and that Title 1 schools, Title 1 public
schools, students in those schools are performing better.  This program
helps the schools, the students that go into the privates schools and
students left behind in the public schools.  I urge your support of this
bill. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Our next speaker, Chris Hill, North Carolina Justice Center.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speaking against.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, my name is Chris Hill. I’m with the North Carolina Justice
Center. I’m the Direction of the Education and Law project. We represent
low-income communities and families in North Carolina and so saying
that, I’ve actually spoken to parent that look like me and those that
don’t look like me who are economically disadvantaged and had to explain
to them there are admission barriers in private schools. There are
transportation barriers, there are admission tests, and you might not be
able to get in.  Even with the voucher. I also them that there’s no
evidence in student achievement in Milwaukee and Cleveland, the
jurisdictions that have had vouchers the longest, the public school
students performed better on proficiency exams than the students that
get the vouchers. This diverts, this would divert $100,000 of money from
accountable public schools to unaccountable private schools. Even though
there’s this threshold limit when the schools have to report, there’s no
mandate that they accept that many students and as I’ve said before
there are admission barriers.  $4,200 is not enough money to go to any
private school worth attending.  And the other thing I tell parents is
that this body has the constitutional responsibility to provide for a
free and uniform system of public schools. They should not be digging
into their pockets to provide extra money for an education that they
should be getting for free.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thanks I got it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And there is as I’ve said the constitutional responsibility of this body
to provide the sound basic education. There is not a constitutional
responsibility to provide $100 million for unaccountable private
schools. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Next speaker for, is Tammy Fitzgerald.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chairwoman, I’m glad to see you back.  Glad you’re well. We
support House Bill 944.  I’m not going to go over what the bill does,
the bill sponsors did a great job of doing that. I appreciate the
different perspectives from which they come.  But we want to say that
the quality of a child’s education and future should not be determined
by where he lives or the income of his parents. Many students have no
choice but to attend their local public school because of financial
restraints. Just because of his address, his education could be very
good or very poor. School choice is a much more effective and affordable
way for students to have the opportunity for a quality education
regardless of their family income or home address. Parents should be
able to choose what is best for their own children. Not the state. Many
families cannot afford private school, yet they contribute to the public
school system through their tax dollars. When their local public school
is not meeting their children’s needs, they often have no other option.
School choice allows parents to decide what is important to their family
and then use public or private l funds to choose a school with
corresponding values. In his 1955 essay, the Role of Government and
Education, Milton Friedman concluded, that a system that shifted the
administration of schools from the government to entrepreneurs in the
private sector would enjoy numerous social, political, and economic
benefits. Particularly higher quality schools and a more efficient use
of tax payer money. Now, almost 60 years later, there is data that
verifies that Friedman was right. 10 empirical studies of scholarship
programs including 2 that evaluated Charlotte’s.</p>

Children’s scholarship fund concluded that scholarship recipients had
statistically significant increases in performance. In addition more
than 20 studies identified ways that scholarships delivered spill over
benefits to traditional public schools.  There is a consensus that
education research community shows that school choice raises achievement
for the average participating student.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Next speaker, Charles Brown, Chairman of Scotland County Board of
Education. Speaking against.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning Committee members. My name is Charles Brown. I am the
Chairman of the Scotland County Board of Education. And a member of the
North Carolina School Boards Associations Board of Directors. As you can
see,  I’m Black-American. What you can’t see is that I am the
vice-Chairman of the Scotland County Republican Party. I stand here
before you today in strong opposition to House Bill 944.  A thriving,
vibrant and strong public education system is something that all of us,
regardless of political party, want to see. Speaking as a School Board
Member, a Republican, and most importantly a North Carolinian, I am very
concerned that our public education system would be undermined by
passage of this bill. Proponents claim that school vouchers will promote
the free-market in education.  As a Republican, I understand the
opportunity provided by the free-market but I am here to tell you that
education is not a place where free-market values work as intended.  The
reason is simple. Public schools open their doors to all comers, private
schools do not. There will be a number of students who will not be able
to choose a school they want in a voucher system because private schools
will turn them away. Families in Scotland County will certainly have
minimal choice because we have very few private schools in our area.
What residents in our ?? and many others around the state really depend
on is an adequate funded public school system.  Budget cuts over the
past 4 years have been difficult. These challenges will grow more
serious as 10’s of millions of dollars are diverted from public schools
to  private schools each other.  As a Republican, I also have to object
to vouchers on accountability grounds because we the tax payers have a
right to know the quality of services our dollars our funding. The
quality of public schools will soon be measured by letter grades. But
the quality of the private schools receiving public vouchers will not be
measured at all under this bill.  We also ask our public schools to
administer state required assessments.  I will conclude by saying this.
I submit that school vouchers will actually set public education back
and I respectfully ask you to oppose House Bill 944.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please do not be applauding, that’s just extra noise. We know that
you’re for things or against it. Danny Breed, Oak City Academy.  For.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, my name is Danny Breed, Headmaster at Oak City Academy here
in Raleigh. Oak City’s living out what this bill is seeking to
accomplish. 80% of our students are low-income and they attend through
privately funded scholarships. Parents come to Oak City Academy because
they’re falling behind and they’re discouraged in the current school.
Let me give you two examples. One 1st grader, very intelligent, lost the
total motivation to learn.  Through small class size and a curriculum
tailored for him, he’s regained a love for learning. A month ago he did
his own research project about 5 or 6 pages on China, just because he
wanted to.  Another 9 year old student came to us reading at a
kindergarten level. And he was in our local schools.  Yet this
individualized attention, and an encouraging classroom environment, he
advanced a grade and a half in less than a year in his reading and he’s
exceling at math. There are many families I’ve spoken to in our
community that want the same opportunity as everyone else yet they can’t
afford it. They have no access to it. They’re looking inside an
invisible chain link fence and they can’t get there. That’s why I
support the scholarship.</p>

important to me, know that tis measure is transparency and accountable
,not only to the tax payers but also to the families it could serve.
Encouragingly House Bill 944 has tied income guidelines to make sure
students who qualify for Free/Reduced Lunch, those families that need it
the most can actually receive scholarships. Schools like mine are held
accountable to parents and the public because of the accountability
measures in the standardized testing. The explanation of the grades,
etc. etc. So I want to hope you value every child in our community who
wants to learn and every mother who desires a better education for her
child through supporting Opportunity Scholarship Act. These children
will thrive if given the opportunity.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Next speaker against, Ed Croom from Johnston County Schools.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee. My name is Ed
Croom, and I am superintendent of Johnston County Schools and I speak to
you today on behalf of the many superintendents across the state who are
part of the Superintendents Association as well as many other school
leaders who are part of the North Carolina school administrators. I
would like to first say, that we recognize and say thank you for the
changes in the bill that you have made. These modifications will help.
However we as a collective group still believe that this legislation can
unravel the basic core of a free public education system, which is a
system for all children in this state. We heard earlier there is a lot
of research,  I read through a lot  of it last night. There’s pro’s and
con’s depending on which way you believe you can find research to
promote that thought. However, just about all of the research indicates
that it reduces the amount of funding that goes to public schools and I
would like to remind you, when that funding is reduced, it’s added to
the regular budgeting numbers that we’ve been reduced over the last
several years further. I am really concerned for those districts and
we’ve heard of a couple already, who d not have a private school option
in their county. We would be taking money away from those districts and
sending it to a district that has a private school option. Simply, it
seems to me that it further opens the door for tax payer money to fund
private schools. And I think this is a very slippery slope, it would
catapult us down a very slippery slope where we would not know where the
end of that slope would be.  I head as it was being presented earlier,
choice and choice. All of us in public education understand that we need
to improve, we need to change.  However I would contend to you today,
that simply because you provided another choice does not mean  your
providing a better educational opportunity for children.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speaking for, Jeanie Allen. Center for Education and Reform.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning, Members  of the General Assembly. Thank you for allowing
me to be here. My name is Jeanie Allen I’m President of the Center for
Education Reform. A 20-year national nonprofit research and advocacy
group based in Washington but that does most of its work throughout the
states including yours. And I am honestly am grateful for the bold,
creative unity of this Committee in backing what is increasingly
becoming an issue and an idea that is embraced across a wide variety of
people, political parties and affiliations and is working.  And I’m just
struck by looking around the room trying to figure what I can add to
what you’re going to continue to hear as a barrage of pro and con. But
I’m struck by the amount of opposition to something some people have
never actually seen working in progress. And so when we look back at
Milwaukee 25 years ago, where literally 40% of kids are going to a
school of choice, a majority ?? private school choices. That have not
only increased the graduation rate for those students who had been
failing and left behind before that, but have increased their college
matriculation and graduation of those students and students in
traditional public schools. I want to know where you’re getting your
information and would implore people to actually visit and talk to
people on the ground. People like these folks in Washington D.C. who
have been in the scholarship.</p>

Program for now a little over five years. I have these pictures brought
on the plane because I just wanted you to see these are the kind of
people. They’re not creamed/g. They’re the people who actually want
those opportunities who are graduating from, from, from private schools
all across the country. In Ohio, in Milwaukee, in Cleveland, in
Pennsylvania, and across the board. They’re not only graduating, they’re
being productive members of society. And they’re so much more united in
their belief that this is about not just public education but educating
the public. And so I invite you to come, to visit, to go explore these
areas to understand that sure we can all make numbers dance and sing.
But the proof is in the pudding when you actually look at how this is
working across the country and how it would work here today. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speaking against Minnie Forte/g Brown. [CROSSTALK] My
name is Minnie Fort/g Brown. I am on the board of directors for the
North Carolina School Board’s Association, the Board of Directors for
the National School Board Association and vice chair of the Durham
Public School’s Board Association, representing millions of children. I
urge you to opposed House bill 944. Although the sponsors have called
this an opportunity scholarship this bill is just another radical school
voucher bill. This bill is not the work of your constituents. The people
of, that the people of North Carolina desire. Over 63% of North
Carolinians oppose school’s vouchers. Although 3,000 may have come to
Greensboro I gather to say they came to hear the gospel singer Marvin
Sapp. This bill is a gimmick to fix what not only the hard working
people of North Carolina but strong investments in our public schools
can fix. Why do your constituents oppose school vouchers is because
school vouchers do not work. Vouchers are touted as choice and a
substitution for parental involvement. Shamefully today this bill is
deliberately being peddled as a choice for poor students. The choice
actually belongs to the private school who can and will reject any
student for any reason. Don’t be deceived. The fact is that the vast
majority of states do not permit any form of school vouchers. The fact
is that the national PTA opposes all vouchers. The fact is that vouchers
in Florida, across this country, have not improved student outcomes. The
fact is that Republicans and Democrats in Washington, D.C. together
voted down federal school voucher plans earlier this year. The fact is
that North Carol, that school vouchers in Louisiana were just declared
unconstitutional. The fact is that school vouchers that North Carolina
voters don’t want their tax [UNKNOWN] dollars to, to, for private and
non-public schools, If you use that best practices, you oppose vouchers.
If you want to lift North Carolina from 48th in the country in school
funding you’ll oppose co, vouchers. If your goal is to improve public
education how can you take money from public schools? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speaking for it Jess, Jessica Oney/g. [SPEAKER CHANGES] My name is
Jessica Oney/g. I come to you as a parent who simply wants to provide a
quality education for my children. Last year, my nine year old son,
Christopher, scored a two on his end of grade testing. To pass a student
must earn a three or higher. And after he received tutoring to boost his
reading comprehension skill, he still scored a two again on his, on
retest. Christopher is doing slightly better this year but he’s still,
he’s in an environment with smaller classrooms and more one on one
teacher attention, things that I believe as his mother will help him to
earn threes and fours on his end of grade test which I know he is
capable of doin’. So when I think about opportunity scholarships as a
parent I see them as a blessing for families like mine who would
otherwise be unable to afford a school that can really meet their
children’s academic needs. And while some have said opportunity
scholarships are an effort to take away from our public schools, I see
it as lifeline my child, for my son’s future. Both my sons. And in the
end, I just want to send my son to a school that works for him
regardless of what school it is. I know what is best for him and simply
want to provide him with every opportunity available to insure his
success. This program will allow me to afford a school that can do just
that. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speaking against Barbra Vandenburg/g.

First, the General Assembly requires that all public schools be graded A
through F. If that grading school is appropriate for public schools,
then it is appropriate to apply the same scale to all  private schools
receiving tax payers dollars to educate the children. Each school
receiving taxpayer’s dollars should be graded in the same manner in
order for parents to have the necessary information to make wise
decisions.  If a grading scale of A through F is good for public
schools, then it should be good enough for private schools.
Second, the General Assembly requires that a school’s grade be reported
to the public on a website and that of the Department of Public
Instruction’s Report Card. This proposed bill requires that private
schools receiving taxpayer’s dollars merely to report its standardized
test to an authority. If reporting a grade to taxpayers and parents is
good for public schools, then it should be good enough for private
schools.
Third, private schools are required to give standardized tests. Public
schools must take the test. According to this bill, private schools
choose their on standardized test without meaningful reporting to the
public or to tax payers. If this does not provide enough information to
all students, I urge you to overhaul this bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That concludes the people we can have speak today. Our
meeting next week we will be in our regular room unless something comes
up to change it. And we will take up, if the people that are here that
did not get a chance to speak wish to speak, I’ll allow you to that next
week. And I appreciate the Committee’s indulgence. And our bill
sponsors, I’ll let you repeat some of the things that were said if you
desire to next week. The meeting’s adjourned.</p>
