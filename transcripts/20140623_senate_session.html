Milner, our Senate Chaplain. All members and guests in the gallery will

thank you for bringing us back here again today to a place that
sometimes we do not deserve, for sometimes we don’t even deserve drawing
breath, but we are here to serve and to work and to learn, and so Lord,
we ask you to help us move along together as a community through the
next fiery trial that would come our way, and we ask you to join us on
our journey. Show us your mercy, give us your peace, and plant inside of
us a wisdom and knowledge that’s only from you, for your wisdom is
perfect and your wisdom is given as a free gift to your children, and I
make this prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rabin is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca for what purpose do you
rise? Senator Rabin one second please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Could you have
the reading clerk read that again? I'm having a hard time hearing,
please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Reading clerk if you would please read the
bill one more time please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 731, Southport
occupancy tax modification. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rabin is
recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. This is a
modification of the occupancy tax that is in the little town of
Southport where I live. In 1989 Southport was given the right to levy a
3% occupancy tax, which they did and they do. And two thirds of that go
to travel and tourism, the TDA. They were later given the privilege or
the right to levy a 2% tax which they have not done nor do they plan to
do. However to be in compliance with the law, they have requested that
if by resolution they decide to collect this 2% tax and it will follow
the same two thirds to the TDA that the original did. And Senator
Tillman, this does not change what you pay when you come to Southport,
that was the question before you asked. Thank you. I appreciate your
support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do we have discussion or debate? Hearing
none, the question before the Senate is the passage of the Committee
Substitute to Senate Bill 731 on its second reading. All in favor will
say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed no. The ayes
have it. Committee Substitute to Senate Bill 731 passes its second
reading and without objection will be read a third time. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] North Carolina General Assembly enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is

its third reading. All in favor will say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed no. The ayes have it. The Committee Substitute
to Senate Bill 731 passes its third reading and will be sent to the
House. Senators, we move on to public bills. Second reading. House Bill
346. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 346, governing
bodies collect unpaid judgments. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Wade is
recognized to explain the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. This just
gives city and counties the authority to garnish wages of an elected
official if the judgment has been awarded against them. It's pretty
clean cut. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We have any discussion or debate? Hearing
none, the question before the Senate is the passage of the Senate
Committee Substitute to House Bill 346 on its second reading. All in
favor will vote aye. Opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be provided
