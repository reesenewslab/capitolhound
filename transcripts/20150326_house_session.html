[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you so very much Mr. Speaker. Ladies and
gentlemen, two years ago I came before this body and asked for your
approval to allow Gaston County to run a trial program, a pilot program
if you would, that would provide assistance via an ombudsman for those
moms and dads that choose to be foster parents. They have operated under
that plan for the last two years, and in conference with them over the
last several months, and just a few minor midifications they have asked
us if we would remove that trial statement and allow it to be an ongoing
operational plan

  in the confines of Gaston County, and the bill before you allow that to
do that.  It simply removes it from being a pilot program and allows
them to continue the service that provides a needed service for
specifically the children and secondly for those moms and dads that
choose to open up their house, and their wallets, and their hearts to
provide for these kids.  And I would appreciate an affirmative vote,
thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Further discussion, further debate?  For what purpose
does the gentleman from Cumberland, Representative Lucas rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To see if the gentleman from Gaston would yield to a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Does the gentleman from Gaston yield to the gentleman
from Cumberland?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Representative Torbett.  Can you tell me,
has this has this helped with the waiting list for foster care with the
Ombusman Program, has it helped, or do you have a waiting list?  What is
the status right now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The status is we&#39;re still in need of foster
parents, what it has done is provide help and assistance for those
people determining if they want to be foster parents and also the
relationship with the children that they are having under their care.
So, has it decreased the numbers?  Unfortunately I don&#39;t have a
number to validate that but here&#39;s what I will tell you with
certainty, is that we need all the foster parents that we can possible
get throughout the state to assist with this program.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, very kindly.

question before the House is passage of House Bill 12, a local bill on

  Does the gentleman wish to speak prior to the consideration of the
amendments? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I think in lieu of
the vote yesterday, we can proceed. I will deal with the amendments as
they come. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I won&#39;t count that as debate
against the gentleman on that, but so what we&#39;ll do, Representative
Speciale from Craven, for what purpose does the gentleman rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To bring forth an amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Speciale moves to amend the bill on page 1,
lines 8 through 11, by rewriting the lines to read [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman from Craven has the floor to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen, we did discuss this bill quite a bit
yesterday. I think everybody understands what we&#39;ve got here. We
tried to save some money while we reduce people&#39;s taxes by getting
rid of this exemption and it appears as if many of you are interested
in reinstating it. If we&#39;re going to do that, then let&#39;s make it
fair for the folks that want it, the folks that have pushed many of you
into supporting it, which was the County Commissioner&#39;s Association,
League of Municipalities. If we&#39;re going to give them what they
want, let&#39;s make them put some skin in the game, and let&#39;s do it
50-50. The upside to this, upsides to this, is that we won&#39;t be
giving up and compromising [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a minute
Representative Speciale. The Chair is hearing a lot of noise and I&#39;m
imagining a lot of members are having difficulty hearing the gentleman
debate. I would ask the members please if you have conversations to take
those outside, to give the gentleman the attention he deserves. The
gentleman from Craven has the floor to continue debating the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There are some upsides to this. One of them is that we
are not going to, we will not be compromising in giving away everything
that we set up two years ago. We will be helping the counties and the
cities achieve what they want to achieve. We would be, this would be run
through them before it came to the state. They&#39;d have to approve it.
Whatever the projects are, because they&#39;ll have some money invested
in this because they&#39;ll have to pay us back 50% of the tax credit.
They get to make the decision whether that project goes forward or not.
And because they have an investment in it, they&#39;re going to make
sure that only the best projects move forward. I think it&#39;s a
win-win for everybody, and I&#39;d like to ask for everybody here to
support this amendment and I think that we&#39;ll see good support on
the bill, if this amendment passes. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For
what purpose does the gentleman from Alamance, Representative Ross,
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the amendment sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Craven yield to the gentleman
from Alamance? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative, I can go through examples
all over North Carolina, but I just picked one. Would you agree that the
City of New Bern, North Carolina has gone through a dramatic historic
renovation? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would agree that they have. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. Are you [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman wish to
ask an additional question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] And does the gentleman from Craven yield to an additional
question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are you aware that just in the last 12 months, the
City of New Bern has spent well over a million dollars on
infrastructure, to directly assist historic properties that are being
renovated? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No, I&#39;m not. But because it, whether or
not it affects my district is irrelevant. It&#39;s going to, my
district&#39;s going to follow the rules just like everybody&#39;s
else&#39;s. This isn&#39;t a “I want to do things except I don&#39;t
want it to affect my district.” I don&#39;t play the, I don&#39;t do it
that way. ?? I&#39;ll follow everybody. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield to an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Are you aware that in the
last 10 years, there have been 22 projects in New Bern where the city
has expended over 10 million dollars for the same purpose? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I am aware. I&#39;d like to see how this is relevant. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] All right. Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman
yield to an additional question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Would you agree that that&#39;s
skin in the game? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would agree that that is skin in
the game but however I would also agree that a lot of the money was
private money as well, so everybody has been putting skin in the game
and that&#39;s the way it should be for every community. Not just New
Bern. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate on the
amendment sent forth. For what purpose does the

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. That&#39;s one example, you multiply-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. That&#39;s one example. You could multiply that all across
the entire state of North Carolina, millions. I just ask that you defeat
the amendment.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Pender, Representative Millis,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Representative Speciale, the amendment sponsor, would rise for
a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Craven yield to the gentleman from Pender?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Speciale, thank you for providing this amendment here
today but in light of the conversation that just went on a few moments
ago I just want to ask you a quick question here. It is your belief that
the tax payers of the 16th House District, Pender County and Western
Onslow, should be actually paying a tax burden to subsidize historic
preservation in your district by way of the city of New Bern?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m not sure I understand how you came to that conclusion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Craven yield to an additional question-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do. I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Speciale, regardless of the discussion here prior, my
question is that, by way of our tax code we have exemptions, deductions,
and credits, what&#39;s before us today is an actual state credit in
order to incentivize the preservation of historic buildings. But that
credit takes away, or actually adds to the uniform burden of taxation
for all citizens across this state and therefore, as what was actually
asked, my question to you is that the city of New Bern has actually had
historic preservation tax credits issued to them in part because of the
tax burden that the citizens that represent actually has to bear. My
question to you is that do you believe that the constituents I represent
should be subsidizing interest in your district?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I don&#39;t believe that the citizens in your district should be
subsidizing what goes on in my district and that&#39;s what I think this
amendment does, is it makes it fair, it lets Craven County, for example,
put money in. If were going to do this, the whole concept of tax
incentives is something I disagree with but if we&#39;re going to do
this we need to make it as fair as possible.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, to speak briefly on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Pender has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Fellow colleagues, I understand Representative Speciale&#39;s intent and
I fully support this amendment, by all means, and I definitely hope that
we actually have preservation of historic buildings but not at the
demise of the actual state tax burden. If locals decide to do this, let
them put their monies into it in equitable burden and as you seen this
map here doesn&#39;t include all the aspects of districts across the
state and I wouldn&#39;t want your constituents subsidizing my
constituents by way of a tax burden that is supposed to be uniform,
just, and equitable. I would ask that you support this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Dare, Representative Tine,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thjank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise to opposed the amendment and the reason
is because you&#39;re talking about fairness in this amendment, that you
want to make sure that everybody has a piece in it. Well, this amendment
would exclude several counties, a lot of counties in this state who need
it the most. Washington County with Plymouth that needs revitalization
and needs investment in it&#39;s downtown area is the exact one that
doesn&#39;t have the money to put forward towards this type of effort.
So you&#39;re going to exclude those types of counties, the Hydes, the
Washingtons, the Camdens, those areas that raise $79,000 on one cent
property tax, for example. So it&#39;s not even that their not willing
to, it&#39;s that they just don&#39;t have the ability to. So I opposed
the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Mecklenburg, Representative
Jeter, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if my good friend from Craven would yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Craven yield to the gentleman from Mecklenburg?
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I haven&#39;t raised my hand this high since Luebke asked me a question
a couple weeks ago. My question is if this amendment passes, would it be
your intent to vote for the bill in its entirety?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And that is relevant because...?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It&#39;s relevant to me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There&#39;s another amendment that will be coming forth, if both the
amendments are approved I will support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Nash, Representative Collins,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think I&#39;d just like to comment on the last two comments that were
made. With all due respect to my esteemed colleague from the outer
banks, where I love to vacation, I think history will show us that the
poorer towns and counties are the ones who are more than willing to put
the money in to

  <p id="025:00">
  These things happen. My fear, as I said yesterday, is that it&#39;s not
the little small poor towns and counties that aren&#39;t willing to put
the money up. I know Edgecomb County next to me is willing to mortgage
their future basically on another topic, to try to get the auto
manufacturing plant and they&#39;re putting up tons of money because
they realize the increased property value they&#39;ll have if anything
like that ever comes there. And most of the small towns realize that
too. That if they can turn worthless buildings into buildings that have
a high value, they&#39;re going to get a lot more property taxes in
through the years. It&#39;s the larger, more prosperous cities I worry
about, thinking hey, we can get this state money for free, and you know
the developers are taking very little chance in downtown Charlotte or
downtown Kerry or whatever in order to make a project work and we
probably won&#39;t have to put anything up in addition to that so I
think the situation&#39;s actually reversed from what we&#39;ve been
presented. And I agree with Representative Speciale. If both amendments
that are offered today pass, I will vote for this bill. But if either
one of them fail, I won&#39;t. I would, I think this is an equitable
arrangement that&#39;s being expressed for this amendment. Actually, I
wanted to make both of the amendments that were being brought forward
today but I got beat to the punch by Representatives Speciale and Ford,
so I would ask you to support this amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what
purpose does the gentleman from Catawba, Representative Adams, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I rise to oppose the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This
is fairly transparent. I mean, this turns this tax credit into a
municipal or county appropriation, which then puts it in the hand of a
County Commission or a City Council. This is simply a delaying tactic.
This would effectively gut this bill and this is, I still say, this is a
jobs bill and I urge your support for the pure bill and not the
amendments. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the
gentleman from Gaston, Representative Baumgartner, rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has
the floor to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think this is a
good amendment and I support this amendment and I don&#39;t see anything
wrong with the people in the towns that are developing these historic
properties be involved in the decision making process to decide whether
a project goes forward or not. And I don&#39;t understand what, I hear
all this about economic development and it&#39;s a jobs bill but they
should be involved in it and I want them to be involved in it, and this
amendment makes this a better bill. And I urge you to support. [SPEAKER

Ford, rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, we&#39;re constantly being told by those at home,
“Please leave us alone at local government. Let us have local control.”
That&#39;s what this amendment is doing, and I encourage you to pass it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Cabarrus,
Representative Pittman, rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Ford stole part of my
thunder because I was going to say this enhances local control by having
the local people make decisions on what they want to go forward with. My
other comment is, you know, what was done a year ago or ten years ago,
the last ten years or whatever, is irrelevant to this amendment. This is
talking about what we&#39;re going to do going forward and so I support
the amendment. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the
gentleman from Alamance, Representative Ross, rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. To debate the amendment one final time. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment a second
time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Members, I&#39;ve spent a lot of time
over the last day, trying to give you examples of how our cities and
municipalities and counties participate. I&#39;ve given you hard-dollar
numbers. I don&#39;t know what else I can do to get across the fact that
the participation is already there. The participation is there in the
tune of just millions of dollars. They already participate. That&#39;s
their local control. They decide on these things as they come along. You
know, what are we going to do? What kind of infrastructure are we going
to provide to try to make this happen? To just address one comment that
was made just a moment ago about bigger cities and letting them take
more of the risk. Folks, we don&#39;t take the risk. The state
doesn&#39;t take the risk. The local government doesn&#39;t take the
risk. This is a credit. This is only paid out when the project is
complete and signed off on. The developers that take on these projects
take the risk. I&#39;ve tried to get that across also. So there is no
risk. So when we talk about

  who&#39;s taken risk, let&#39;s be clear. It&#39;s the developer, to the
state, not the municipalities. The effect of this amendment would be
that the wealthier, large cities would probably be able to continue but
everywhere else in North Carolina where you have these historic
properties would not be able to participate because they simply
wouldn&#39;t be able to afford it. Thank you, and I ask you to defeat
the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chair notices we now have three lights. For what purpose does the
gentleman from Chowan, Representative Steinburg, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak the amendment, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Chowan has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I am rising to oppose the amendment. I thought that after
talking with Representative Speciale yesterday, certainly he makes some
very good points, some very interesting points about why more
involvement would be better in terms of the local participation, at
least that&#39;s what he&#39;s suggesting. I think that&#39;s what
others here have stood up and said they believe would be better but I
would just like to remind folks that the areas that are in need and
desperately in need of this investment are areas that have been affected
by the decline of three particular industries, the textile industry, the
tobacco industry, and the furniture industry. Those are the folks that,
those industries were located in many of these towns that we are trying
to help. It has diminished their revenue significantly, which has
limited the amount of money that they have available just to maintain
their own infrastructure let alone expanding the infrastructure through
investment. So these are the towns that we are trying to help. They are
scattered all across the state in rural North Carolina. So I encourage
you to defeat this amendment and support the original bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Harnett, Representative Lewis,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, in honor of Representative Floyd, I seek recognition to
offer a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I would move the previous question on Amendment 2.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Harnett has moved the previous question.  So many in
favor of the motion for previous question will vote aye, those opposed
will vote no, the clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock the
machine and record the vote, 76 having voted in the affirmative and 36
in the negative. The previous question is adopted. Members, since this
is not on a final question to the body there is no rebuttal time. The
question before the House is the adoption of Amendment 2 sent forth by
Representative Speciale. So many favoring adoption of the amendment will
vote aye, those opposed will vote no, the clerk will open the vote. The
clerk will lock the machine and record the vote, 32 having voted in the
affirmative and 81 in the negative. The amendment fails. We are now back
on the question of the bill. For what purpose does the gentleman from
Rowan, Representative ford, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk will
read the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ford moves to amend the bill on page 2, line 25 through
page 3, line 9 by deleting those lines.

The gentleman from Rowan has the floor to debate the amendment.
Actually, before the gentleman proceeds, our nurse of the day is back in
the chamber now and I want to make sure we properly introduce her. Debra
Parker from Middlesex, North Carolina. Thank you for being here with us.
The gentleman from Rowan has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This removes the entire section on non-income
producing properties. Of the 15 cities in my two counties that I
represent, only four have sent official support for this bill and not
one of them have mentioned the private property or homes, they&#39;ve
all talked about downtown. So that&#39;s why I want to pass this and
nobody has a problem with it that I know of back home, I haven&#39;t
heard from them, and so this simply removes the non-income producing
properties. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

  For what purpose does the gentleman from Alamance, Representative Ross,
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Once again, this is an attempt
to try to gut the bill. What we did in the version that we have of this
bill, is we greatly reduced the credit for non-income-producing
properties. The maximum is $22,500, and we did that in order to find a
threshold that we felt like would still allow us to maintain the truly
historic structures that are found in every community across North
Carolina. You know, Raleigh here, you could look at say, Blunt Street
for example. Those old historic homes on Blunt Street. Every community
has them. So we structured this in a way that we could continue to try
to preserve those properties with the opportunity of preventing any of
the abuses that may have happened in the past by not having a cap. So
now we have a cap, the max is $22,500, it&#39;s a good provision in the
bill. It makes the bill work. And I ask you to defeat the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Wilkes,
Representative Elmore, rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I understand my colleague&#39;s point that
you want to look at things through a state-wide viewpoint, but you
always have to go back and look at the particular situations of your
district when you&#39;re looking at issues of that nature. I served on
the Town Board of North Wilkesboro prior to being elected down here and
the big issue we had in our area was our housing inventory. The average
age of a house in North Wilkesboro is 1952, and we took very
conservative policies, unlike bigger cities in the state, on when they
needed additional property tax revenue, they primarily went out and
annexed and trying to annex properties to increase that tax base. We did
not. We did not have those type of policies in place. Plus too, we at
the same time we were losing population. If you look at current maps, my
area&#39;s lost about 3.4% population. So as you lose industries,
leaving your area, you look at what the housing inventory is and even if
we bring in jobs to the area or attempt to, they look at housing
inventory too. And with a per capita income of $13,344 in the town of
North Wilkesboro, it&#39;s very difficult to increase the property taxes
on the people. These type programs help replenish that tax base that we
have in the area. And I&#39;ll give you a firm example. Lowes corporate
office building sat in North Wilkesboro. They came through and tore down
the building because now that company is placed in Morrisville. We lost
I forgot how many hundreds of thousands of tax revenue because that
industry building was gone. A developer comes in with one of our old
cotton mills, develops that into condominiums which replenished that tax
base. So it&#39;s not an issue of locals paying more. There&#39;s not
more to pay in a lot of these areas. So I appreciate my colleague here
sitting next to me&#39;s intent on the amendment, but I would encourage
all of you to look at city data and look at the housing age of your
area. This will really help with the local tax base and the investment
in that, so I urge you to defeat the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For
what purpose does the gentleman from Chowan, Representative Steinberg,
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To address the amendment, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen, I rise to oppose the amendment. I really
feel in my heart and I think those of us who live in many small towns
that have begun to turn the corner, realize that the investment of any
historic properties whether income producing or not, and investment
commercially downtown in historic properties, these two items are
inextricably tied to one another. You, I&#39;ll use Edenton as an
example, my hometown. We came there because of the historic district. We
invested money in our home. Others, many others did the same thing. The
tax base was not there for the people who live there locally to put that
kind of money into these homes. I&#39;m not suggesting that I have the
money either [LAUGHTER] but I put the money in there anyway.

  But, many of the folk who have come to town for that reason, for these
old homes , for restoring these homes and being able to have the
opportunity to help in the restoration of this are also folks who have
come to town to invest in local businesses there.  So the two are
inextricably tied, you can&#39;t have one without the other, at least
not to the extent that we would like to see the impact of this bill have
on rural North Carolina and across the state, indeed.  So, I ask you to
respectfully defeat this amendment and let&#39;s keep the original bill
intact, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]For what purpose does the gentleman from Catawba,
Representative Adams rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Two initial points.  One, for a tax credit to be
triggered, there has to be income.  And second thing is, there has to be
an expense.  You have to have income to enjoy the tax credit.  Now, in a
non income producing property, you&#39;re basically talking about a
residence, you have W-2 income that you use to pay for modifications to
the historic structure, and you get a credit for spending that income
for that purpose.  Now, that income goes to the people who lay the
carpet, who do the painting, who do the plumbing, who do the
modifications to restore the house.  I&#39;m going to give you an
example, another one of my real life examples.  Five houses down the
street from me, there was a house that was built originally in 1903, it
was built by the Menzies Family in Hickory, they&#39;re one of the
founding families in Hickory.  I won&#39;t go through the whole sequence
of events, but the house was partially renovated in  1999 from a very
dilapidated situation.  Unfortunately the folks who did the updates were
crushed in 2008, it ended a 40 year marriage, the house went to the
bank, and now a young couple has come in to buy that house.  A young
minister and his four children and his wife will occupy that house.
They&#39;re not wealthy, but they&#39;re going to be spending their
money to trade people to do the necessary repairs so they can live in
this house.  This is not about rich people, this is about all of us and
I urge you to defeat the amendment and pass the bill in its pure form,
thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Further discussion, further, for what purpose does the
gentleman from Wake, Representative Pendleton rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I wanted to clarify one thing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I&#39;m sorry sir, on these historic tax credits, or
any tax credits, the preponderance of them are not used by the person
that develops them, they are sold to corporations in the maximum tax
bracket and they use them.  So, I wanted to make sure you understand how
these credits work.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]For what purpose does the gentleman from Alamance,
Representative Ross rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Speaker, just a second comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment a
second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]This is really not germane to this part of the
amendment but I just want to clarify something that was just said, these
tax credits under this new bill cannot be sold, we need to be clear on
that.  If you read the second section of the bill, I believe it is, it
spells out the criteria for how you get the credit and the criteria for
the ownership.  They cannot be sold and I just want to make that clear.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Further discussion, further debate?  If not, the
question before the House is the adoption of Amendment 3 sent forth by
Representative Ford.  So many if favor of the amendment will vote aye,
those opposed will vote no, the clerk will open the vote.  The clerk

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Burke has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the House will understand from my comments yesterday that I
am very skeptical at best of historic tax credits, but I think this
amendment would at least improve the bill in a number of respects, and I
hope that the House will consider it in a favorable vein. For one thing,
it would, basically what the amendment would do would be to limit the
availabilities of the credit to properties in tier one and tier two
counties. That&#39;s where we need to, if we&#39;re going to incentivize
growth, if that&#39;s where it&#39;s needed, our tier three counties
with the exception maybe of some pockets in certain areas are doing
pretty well. They already get a disproportionate amount of sales taxes
collected in the state, they get a heavily disproportionate share of
incentive funds in other respects, they are sucking population and
wealth out of the rural counties, and we don&#39;t need to create an
incentive that makes that problem worse. What we need to do is
incentivize growth where it&#39;s not naturally occurring on its own at
a rather rapid clip, so I would ask the House to give serious
consideration to this and in the process, we can also reduce the drain
on the state treasury in terms of what it&#39;s costing us in lost
revenues.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker. Be very brief. I&#39;m tired of discriminating
against half of my county. Half of my county should be tier three, the
other half should not be, but it&#39;s all tier three. So I would urge
the defeat of any amendment like this that discriminates against parts
of counties. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Alamance, Representative Ross
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker, debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gist of the amendment is sort of the opposite of what we&#39;re
trying to do here. In fact, it, is the exact opposite of what we&#39;re
trying to do here. If you go back to the bill, what we have done is we
have specifically targeted tier one and tier two counties with an extra
bonus, and we did that to try to help tier one and tier two counties
that have these historic properties within their areas in order to help
them be able to have the extra push that they need to help get these
projects done. I think that it would be wrong to ?? tier two to tier
three or tier one to tier three. The facts are the tier three counties
may be actually invest more of their dollars into infrastructure, and as
far as the population, the population is gonna go where the jobs are,
and I agree with my colleague that spoke earlier. This, this really is a
jobs bill, and I ask you to defeat the amendment.

Thank you so much and thank you also for place on the calendar today and
for the indulgence have it moved up so I can get back home for an event.
Ladies and gentlemen the house I come Berkeley and you have no
information and I wasn’t expecting this be on the floor but I will try
to do it for remembering. This bill has come through two committees both
received an overwhelming support and if you wanna look at North Carolina
back you won’t see this but if you want to look at North Carolina as we
progress into the future you will see this it’s an innovative approach
to try to…

  Transportation. We&#39;re talking about a vehicle that will have the
capability of going 84 miles per gallon at a cost of $6,800, and
it&#39;s essentially like riding in a car, the car you have today, a
little bit smaller on the inside, but with only three wheels instead of
four. Fully enclosed, air bag, roll cage, seat belts, and most of the
safety things required by the federal government. Now, what the bill
does, currently in North Carolina in that vehicle if you got in it, you
would have to wear a motorcycle helmet. This bill simply says if you get
one of these and you&#39;re riding in it, you would not have to wear a
motorcycle helmet. This same bill, the language is being addressed in
many, a myriad of states across the country to provide the moving
forward of this innovation, of this technology, of this advancement of
transportation for people that very honestly look for something just
like this. And let me add a caveat for some of my, let&#39;s say, more
greener friends. Imagine this now as an electric vehicle. You can see
it, can&#39;t you? This vehicle we&#39;re talking about, it&#39;s a
petroleum, it&#39;s a gas vehicle, but there&#39;s nothing that disables
the opportunity for another entrepreneurial spirit to create an electric
vehicle along the same lines, and this just simply puts it on the, on
the books in North Carolina that this type of innovation, these type of
people can promote this, perhaps manufacture and, and promulgate this
across the countryside in the great state of North Carolina. Thank you,
mister speaker. I&#39;m available for any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the lady from Orange, Representative Insko rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask the bill sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Gaston yield to the lady from Orange?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield and will make every attempt to answer her question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On line 12, it says that the enclosed seating does not require the
operator to straddle or sit astride. It sounds like that that&#39;s an
option, that you can do either.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don&#39;t have a good answer for you, but what it does now, it does
not have that. In other words,  you don&#39;t ride it like a motorcycle.
It has a seat and a steering wheel.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Insko, I believe Representative Torbett has one he might
sell to you if you want it. I don&#39;t know. For what purpose does the
gentleman from Robeson, Representative Graham rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask a question of the bill sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Gaston yield to the gentleman from Robeson?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Happily, mister speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, mister speaker. Representative Torbett, you said this was
enclosed. What is the specs on the enclosure? What type of material
would this enclosure be made from?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do not know. I do not have an answer to that. I&#39;m sure you could
find that online under ELIO if you wanna access Google. Yeah, but you
did hear me say it did have a roll cage included in the vehicle, is
that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Robeson wish to ask an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And does the gentleman from Gaston yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, mister speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
Just to make clear I, I want to support this but I just want to make
sure that the enclosure will be a safe enclosure and is not gonna be
something that will be subjecting the passengers to maybe like a T bone
or something like that that could disintegrate during those type
impacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The, the proper safety is in place. Now, I can&#39;t guarantee ?? in any
automobile manufacturer the absolute guarantee of a safety of a vehicle,
but it meets what, pretty much what&#39;s required for this type of
vehicle.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield to an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Make every attempt, mister speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So the helmets that the, the individuals would not be required to wear a
helmet.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
While in this vehicle, that&#39;s correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker. I&#39;d like to ask a question of
Representative Boles.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Moore yield to the gentleman from Robeson?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Reluctantly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Boles, do you support this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake, Representative Martin
yield, arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask the bill sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Gaston yield to the gentleman from Wake?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker. Mister speaker, the first question I was gonna
ask was already asked  by the gentleman from Robeson and answered to my
satisfaction. The second question I was gonna ask about the equipment
that comes with this vehicle is the

vehicular types, they&#39;re always provided as an option.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Rockingham, Representative Jones, is recognized to
debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, this is a
bill that passed unanimously in the health committee. When you look at
it right off it might look like one of those scope of practice turf war
bills that legislators hate to see, but I am very pleased to tell you
that this is one in which stakeholders came together and agree on. It is
endorsed, supported by the North Carolina Dental Society and the North
Carolina Dental Hygiene Association, the North Carolina board of dental
examiners. I am not aware of any organized opposition to it. It is
currently done in 45 states, and just to tell you quickly what the bill
does, an intraoral local anesthetic, intraoral is an injection in the
mouth, so we&#39;re talking about a dental injection, and a local
anesthetic is, in layman&#39;s terms, what you receive when you are
getting numbed at the dentist&#39;s office. And so this bill would allow
a properly trained dental hygienist under the direct supervision of a
licensed dentist in North Carolina to be able to administer an intraoral
local anesthetic. I would be happy to entertain any questions but I
think hopefully that explains to you, and I would appreciate your
support for the bill.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, this bill was heard this morning in
Finance. It received a favorable report. As a matter of fact it was a
unanimous report. Basically what this bill does is it closes a loophole
in existing law and it also sets a precedent in the law. Some of the
boards of equalization review in the state had ruled on this
differently. It has economic impact on the counties or the state. I
appreciate the bill sponsors, Representative Pierce, Riddell, and
Shepard that went on it with and I stand ready for any questions if
anybody has any but I appreciate your support on the bill.

Senate. Members, to give the body some idea of what the schedule is, as
the Chair indicated earlier, we have a couple of conference reports that
potentially will be added to today&#39;s calendar. The Chair&#39;s
inquiring as to what the status is on those. There were a couple bills
that came out of committee, I believe Representative Stevens had some
that came out of Judiciary that I believe were not controversial. In
order to use our time, we&#39;ll advise of any bill numbers and give
members time to look and see if there&#39;s objection to adding those to
today&#39;s calendar. So if the body will be at ease. For what purpose
does the gentleman from Rowan, Representative Ford, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;ve seen the light. I want to change my vote on the last bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ford, you won&#39;t know how surprised I was to see you
voting red on that bill. The gentleman will be recorded as having voted
aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Scotland, Representative
Pierce, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I want to know what light was it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He was having a little trouble seeing the light, I think. But now he has
seen the light. For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham,
Representative Hall, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ask a question of the Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, there&#39;s an Election Laws meeting scheduled for today.
Is it possible that we could hold that meeting in the interim while the
conference reports are being prepared, as opposed to adding bills to the
calendar or having that election law meeting after session?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s a fair question. Give me just a moment, we&#39;ll look in to
that. The House will come back to order. It is the Chair&#39;s intention
to do the following. One, to put us in recess until 2:15, which will be
about 30 minutes and to

2:10, which would be five minutes before the end of session as opposed
to the normal fifteen minute rule which hopefully, I believe these are
local bills that Representative Jones indicated that they are, to take
those up. That is, that is the intention of the chair at this point. For
what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland, Representative Floyd
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
See if the election committee chair will yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Rockingham yield to the gentleman from Cumberland?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is it possible that we can have that meeting in 1425 in, then to go
across.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Floyd, I think it would be quicker for us to just walk
over to 544 than to try to have the staff try to move everything
that&#39;s already ready in place. I think if we can leave now, mister
speaker, may I be recognized for an announcement?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Rockingham is recognized for a committee
announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The elections law committee will meet in room 544 immediately upon
recess.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Union, Representative Horn
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may speak to a moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, yesterday I
brought you up to date on Representative Brawley&#39;s wife, and I bring
you up to date again. It&#39;s amazing what can happen in a short period
of time. She&#39;s doing so well that there&#39;s a pretty good
possibility that she&#39;ll be coming home tomorrow and we&#39;ll have
the pleasure of Representative Brawley&#39;s company with us next week.
So I&#39;m very pleased to be able to tell you that. Thank you all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, before we leave, these are the bills the chair is looking at
adding to today&#39;s calendar. Representatives Davis and Ford are
recognized to send forward a committee report. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representatives Davis and Ford, local government committee report, House
bill 199 Raleigh donate service animals to officers, favorable.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Calendar, and without objection to today&#39;s calendar, is there
objection? Hearing none, so ordered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House bill 204, Caswell beach quick take eminent domain, favorable.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Calendar, and without objection, today&#39;s calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House bill 243, local economic development commission, favorable.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Calendar, and without objection, today&#39;s calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House bill 263, City of Trinity terms of election.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Objection.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
First of all, calendar. The chair would inquire to add to today&#39;s
calendar. The gentleman from Durham, Representative Luebke has stated an
objection to that. Just a moment. Believe this is Representative
Hurley&#39;s bill. Does the lady desire to make a motion to add it to
today&#39;s calendar, or is that lady fine if that bill rolls over to
Monday?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;d like for it to be heard today, if it could be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Very well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Make a motion that it be heard today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham, Representative Luebke
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister speaker, we spent most of the local government committee meeting
today on this bill. I respect Representative Hurley&#39;s support for
the bill. There was however an amendment to the bill that narrowly lost
that asked for a referendum on the bill. It&#39;s a bill to change the
composition of the Trinity City Council. It is not proper in my judgment
to take a bill of that controversy and put it on the calendar at this
late hour at a time really when we&#39;re really just putting it on the
calendar because we&#39;re waiting for conference reports. It&#39;s
really, to my judgment, mister chair, I would ask you to remove this
from the calendar because it was high level of controversy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Davidson, Representative
Watford rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;d also like to object to this hearing today, because I submitted
the bill, the amendment to the bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. The, just, just for the body&#39;s notice of where we are
procedurally, the objections have been noted which would be, which would
at this point require a motion to be made which has been made by the
lady of Randolph to add the bill to today&#39;s calendar. It can be
added by a simple majority vote is, is where we stand. So the motion
before the, the motion before the body is to add House bill 263 to
today&#39;s calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Guilford, Representative Blust
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Representative Hurley a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady from Randolph yield to the gentleman from Guilford?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hurley, is there a reason this bill is particularly time
sensitive that would mean we need to hear it today?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not really. I&#39;ll be glad to withdraw it until Monday.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland,
Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I was wondering if we could have one minute just to
look at that bill before we have to note an objection.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Absolutely, I&#39;d be glad to afford the gentleman
that.  Actually, the Chair&#39;s determined, I don&#39;t move anything
controversial but we&#39;ve added four bills to the calendar, they are
local bills, I don&#39;t believe they&#39;ll get in much discussion, I
hope not.  If they do, I can feel certain that, be assured from the
Chair that they&#39;ll probably be moved to next week.  But this bill
here, let me put it to you this way, unless I get a request from any
Wake County Representatives to add this bill to today&#39;s calendar,
the Chair&#39;s going to allow this bill to go over to Monday&#39;s
calendar.  Is anyone representing Wake desire that this bill be added to
today&#39;s calendar?  Seeing no likes, the bill will go on Monday
night&#39;s calendar.  Members, given that we&#39;ve taken a few minutes
with procedural matters, the House is going to go into recess shortly,
come back at 2:30.  Chairman Jones, your committee is permitted to meet
up until 2:25, that will suspend the normal 15 minute rule for you.  Any
notices or announcements anyone feels inclined to make at this moment?
If not, we&#39;re going to go into recess subject to receipt of
conference reports, committee reports and messages from the Senate,
referral of bills and resolutions until 2:30 PM.

Bill 6, Autocycle definition and regulations, and Representative
Torbett, you are invited to come forward and present your bill.  Can I
have a motion to have the bill properly before us?  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Good morning, it&#39;s an exciting time in North
Carolina, what you guys are looking at today pretty much just hammers
home what we&#39;re doing in North Carolina as far as innovation,
expanding the opportunities for entrepreneurial activity, and looking
forward as opposed to looking through the rear view mirror as what the
future of transportation might bring to our citizens in North Carolina.
The reason I say it&#39;s exciting is if you all haven&#39;t pretty much
viewed or seen what we&#39;re talking about today, imagine yourself
today in the automobile that you drive, but now your automobile just
happens to have only three wheels instead of four wheels.  It&#39;s
totally enclosed and has the safety aparatuses designed for the

  vehicle to keep you safe, and now you&#39;re getting, how many miles per
gallon?  Quite a few more than you&#39;re probably currently getting.
It&#39;s an entry market, it&#39;s an exciting market, my guess is
we&#39;ll see these in North Carolina if we&#39;re fortunate to move
ahead with this bill in the very near future.  I&#39;ll even step out on
a limb and say it may end up being one of the mainstays of our future
transportation needs as far as where the consumer goes.  When you&#39;re
looking for a vehicle has low cost, high miles per gallon, extended
life, and it&#39;s an attractive vehicle, my guess is they&#39;ll be
selling quite a few.  With that Madame Chairman, if there are any
questions, I&#39;ll lean to your advice, and also we do have a gentleman
from the Elio Company here, and at the proper time perhaps have him
available for comments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, and do you want staff to go over the bill or
have the presenter first.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yeah, I guess it would probably be of benefit if staff
want to go over the bill and that would be great, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, recognized staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Good morning.  I&#39;m Gregory with the Research
Division.  The main thrust of the bill is to move autocycles from
regulatory regime of motorcycles to it&#39;s own regulatory regime which
is more like automobiles.  And so under current law, an operator of an
autocycle in North Carolina would have to have a helmet and would have
to have a driver&#39;s license endorsement to operate a motorcycle, so
it would be classified as a motorcycle.  So the basic structure of the
bill is just go through, click through some of the DMV statutes so that
we will classify them as their own thing, an autocycle.  They&#39;ll be
regulated like an automobile as far as lights and safety equipment under
state law.  Under federal law there still a motorcycle, but the
advantage to this would allow, like this one company here that&#39;s
making such a big push to market these in the United States, that
operators of these vehicles would just be able to use a normal
driver&#39;s license and they would not have to wear a helmet.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.  Do we have a representative from Elio
Motors who would like to speak?  Okay, please come forward.  Do you have
a presentation, is it given on the computer?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes, Madame Chair, there&#39;s handouts there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I think they&#39;re in the packet, correct?  Okay, I
guess there are some extra handouts in the back if anyone is interested,
and they should be in your packet.  Please state your name, company and
position for our records.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Madame Chairman and honorable members of the House
Finance Committee, my name is Joel Sheltron, I am Vice President of Elio
Motors, Governmental Affairs.  Representative Torbett did a great job of
talking about our vehicle.  I&#39;d like to give you a little bit of
background about the vehicle.  It&#39;s a two passenger, tandem seating,
front wheel drive, three wheel, three cylinder, gasoline powered, fully
enclosed, as mentioned technically considered a motorcycle by federal
standards.  The vehicle will retail for an expected $6,800 and get an
expected 84 miles to the gallon.  It&#39;s been engineered to the
highest available standards.  It has three air bags, it has a high
strength roll cage, ABS stability controlled traction control, plus
other safety enhancement equipment that you would normally find in a
automobile.  It&#39;s truly a cross between an automobile and a
motorcycle.  Currently, looking at your handout there, and I&#39;ve got
two different handouts.  The one I brought was a little different.  But
anyway, P4, our prototype, if you notice there we have 41,000 pre-sold
reservations, which is amazing.  We wont be in production until next
year and people have already put in mostly non-refundable deposits on
this vehicle.  The next page shows you that the interior of the vehicle
is basically half a car and has a steering wheel, has controls just like
an automotive control.  Of course the problem we have is the fact that
in North Carolina

  North Carolina is one of four states now that require helmets for
everyone in the vehicle. We have some states that are age-specific, and
H6 would insert &quot;autocycle&quot; in definition and would exempt
from autocycle--from helmets and the motorcycle endorsement. The helmet
issue, we&#39;re going to look at that first. Wearing a helmet in a
completely enclosed vehicle makes it difficult to hear emergency
vehicles, sirens. Wearing a helmet reduces vision and can create blind
spots. Our vehicle, as well as others on the road today, with airbags,
are not designed for helmet use. Airbag deployment requires sensitive
calibrations. Adding a three- to four-pound helmet on adds 30% to 40%
more weight to the head. No automobile manufacturer considers helmets
when calibrating airbag deployment. The extra weight of a helmet will
actually lower our safety rating because of neck elongation, one of the
measurements considered, and this is crash ratings. The use of a helmet
with safety, three-point safety restraints, puts the operator and
passenger in a dangerous situation. The three-point restraints hold the
body against the seat, but the head, with the extra weight of the
helmet, will be pulled violently forward in a frontal collision. To
avoid the significant injuries results from the action, NASCAR drivers
are now using the HANS device. They drive a lot faster than we do.
However, the NASCAR and safety engineers will tell you that you can get
killed just as quickly at 30 miles an hour if you stop quickly enough
under this scenario. So the helmets are actually a very dangerous thing
to require. The next page here, if you want to look at the helmet map,
shows you exactly where we&#39;re at in the nation with helmet
requirements. I got a call yesterday that Ohio&#39;s now done, so we can
cross that off. Two days ago, New Mexico was finished. And so things are
moving along quite nicely. We&#39;re almost done with the helmet portion
of the legislation would, this legislation would take care of.
Motorcycle endorsement is another issue. We&#39;re way too wide. You can
see by, in the handout, how we&#39;re way too wide, way too long, to
pass your motorcycle skills test. And there isn&#39;t anything on the
skills test that would be relevant to our vehicle anyway.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me, Mr. Shatern??, if you could conclude in one minute, and then
we can start taking questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And so obviously if we can&#39;t pass the test, there is no reason and
no benefit, no protection of the public require a motorcycle test for
this type of vehicle. It handles like an automobile, it drives like an
automobile, it has automotive controls. Thank you very much, and with
the Chairman&#39;s--Madam Chairman&#39;s leave, I will answer any
questions that you have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. Members, do we have any questions about this bill?
Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair, for a motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Any other questions? Yes, Representative Adams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. There&#39;s two-cycle and four cycle, and what&#39;s the weight of
the vehicle?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The vehicle weighs 1,229 pounds, it&#39;s a four-cycle engine, it&#39;s
three-cylinder--it&#39;s a regular automotive engine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Fuel injected?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It&#39;s sequential port fuel injection.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hastings.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;ll try to be brief. NHTSA, National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, do you also work at the federal level?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes we have, currently we have legislation that mirrors Representative
Torbett&#39;s legislation on the federal level, so they&#39;re already
working on that now. Senator Vitter has Senate Bill 685.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So there&#39;s a supremacy clause issue that you&#39;re having to deal
with at the federal level because of unilateral action at the state
level would still put you in a problematic situation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There isn&#39;t a supremacy clause issue. You can do whatever you want
to in North Carolina. However, the reason we introduced it on the
federal level is because these vehicles are going to be on the road, and
they need consistent safety standards. You can imagine what it would be
like if you tried to register in another state, and you don&#39;t fit
the definition.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So there isn&#39;t a supremacy

  issue then what do you do with the fact that the Federal Government
classifies it as a motorcycle?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The states have the ability, as long as they accept the
certification of motorcycle to register the vehicle as an autocycle.
Some are using motor vehicle and an autocycle is a motor vehicle, some
states are saying an autocycle is a motorcycle.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Okay, Representative Carney?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Madame Chair, and I&#39;m on the
Transportation Committee and this was fully debated in there and
it&#39;s here in Finance and looking at the physical note, there&#39;s
not a really big hit to the state for the, it could be a revenue
generator which was hard for the staff to estimate, so I&#39;m sorry the
Representative Collins beat me to the motion.  But one question, if I
may, of the bills sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes, Rep, go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Torbett, we&#39;ve ran out of time in
Transportation, but I&#39;m dying to ask you this question, will you fit
in one of these cars?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Carney, probably like you, the closest
I&#39;ve been to the vehicle is what I&#39;ve seen on the website.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Any other questions?  Representative Jones?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, this is a financial question, but can you
explain, to Representative Torbett, why is the cost.  We&#39;ve got a
$90 million cost and then an ongoing $9 million, what is that for?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Madame Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]You&#39;re recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I could, but there&#39;s someone here of much higher
intelligence than me that can speak on that and that would be
Commissioner Thomas from the Department of Motor Vehicles, if Madame
Chair would like him to address the fiscal impact.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Will the representative from the DMV come forward?  And
state your name and department for our records, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, my name is Kelly Thomas, Commissioner of
Motor Vehicles, and I&#39;m not looking at the same fiscal note you are.
 The IT costs for this initiative, which I very much support, the
definition of autocycle and the classification of this vehicle is
exactly what brings us into current operations in the State of North
Carolina, so I very much look forward to autocycles.  I also look
forward to the next classification of vehicles, the autonomous vehicle,
that we&#39;ll see here in recent, or in very soon history.  But anyway,
back to the IT question, our estimate for IT build requirements is
$109,000 to put this autocycle definition into our STARS database, so I
don&#39;t have whatever figure you&#39;re looking at, at $9 million.
$109,000 for IT costs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Okay, got that.  Representative Warren, did you have a
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yeah, I&#39;m just curious whether or not the
occupants, it seats two and everything, is it one behind the other?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]It seats two, tandem, and the reason for that is you
are able to reduce the wind pressure on the front of the vehicle, which
helps get better fuel economy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Collins, you&#39;re recognized for a
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I&#39;d like to make a motion for a favorable report
for Committee Substitute to House Bill 6, unfavorable to the original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Members, you&#39;ve heard the motion, and all in favor
of a favorable report will now signify by saying aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Opposed?  House Bill 6 passes Committee, it will be
sent to the floor.  Thank you for joining us, thank you Representative
Torbett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Madame Chairman, members of the Committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]We are now going to hear House Bill 229, Modify
religious property exemptions.  Representative McNeil and other
sponsors, please come forward.  Can I have a motion to have the PCS
properly before us?  Representative Carney in second.  Representative
Warren, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.  I want to thank the Committee and Chairman
for allowing us to bring House Bill 229 before you.  This bill basically
does two things, it attempts to close a loophole in current law, and
also make the law consistent across the whole state.  If you&#39;ll go
all the way, the first page is current law, if you&#39;ll go all the way
to the second page, you&#39;ll see in Section G, there&#39;s some strike
throughs, those are basically just technical corrections.  The meat of
the change in this law is in Section 3, excuse me Subsection 3 at the
very end.  And basically, let me explain to you what this does.

For years in North Carolina religious property that is occupied for
religious purposes has been tax exempt. Recently, through some liberal
interpretations by local tax departments they have taken buildings that
were under construction, that were not completed by January 1st, has not
being occupied. Giving you an example, what happened in North Carolina
that we had a Church that was building a new sanctuary well I’m sorry
the old sanctuary on property they are doing for years, they were not
through, it was a 900 or almost a thousand seats sanctuary, they were
not through with construction on January 1st. Therefore, they
technically had not occupied it according to a liberal interpretational
law. So theoretically and the tax department said, “We are gonna tax the
bill, we are not gonna tax the land on its own because it has been taxed
down for years.” Obviously, since the building was not under
construction, was not finished construction so they couldn’t get an
occupancy permit to occupy for any purposes. So they were in kind of get
22 situation. Well, luckily they appeal to that ruling and the board of
equalization review in Randolph County said, “No, no, no we don’t
believe that statue that is exempting religious property.” However, in
other counties I understand for South County and other counties the
board of equalization review has gone against the Churches and said
that, “They had to pay their taxes.” So I personally, when I heard about
the situation I didn’t believe that that was the intent of the original
statue that exempted property. So I saw as a loophole, I saw that it has
been interpreted different in different counties and the state. And I
felt like it was something that we needed to do as legislators to close
this loophole and make it all consistent across the entire state. I will
direct you to the fiscal note, on the back it shows no fiscal impact to
the state and it shows no fiscal impact to the counties. And my
co-sponsor ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, ?? are you not gonna look out for the brother and the sisters in
and we just get through in a building and I can understand the impact of
it will be taxed and it’s a strange loophole there but it’s not in use
but both people noticed it’s gonna be used for religious purpose so I
wanna thank Representative McNeil for that. So I would join with him and
ask to be work to this ?? Church Community and those Churches who are in
the process to build for that time period, thank you Madam Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, are there questions from the committee?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have Representative Jones.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair for the motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Setzer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was gonna make a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, any other questions? Representative Jones you are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, I will propose favorable report for the committee substitute
for House Bill 229 unfavorable to the original.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members you have heard the motion, all in favor signify by saying aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any oppose, no. Thank you very much, Committee Substitute to House Bill
229 passes. Next in our agenda, we have House Bill 265: NCEMPA Asset
Sale and Representative Collins please come forward to present the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[Inaudible] ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Since we have fully debated this in public utilizes, I feel comfortable
to maintain as Chair come present the bill but if that changes I will
have my colleague step up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And Representative Stam would also be here, he was first to speak on
this bill yesterday but he’s involved in other meeting, if he was needed
I will him certainly it wouldn’t be. We debated this bill fully in
public utilizes and you folks on public utilities, okay. So you have
heard it already, so we are not gonna debate it. And this is the Finance
Committee; we should be interested in the finance. So let me say this is
the bill that I have been waiting to run through this house for five
years and Senator Newton said same thing in the Senate, we had the Study
Committee four years ago that we begged and pleaded and we are awarded
and nine Co-Chairs too where this was one of the main findings of the
Study Committee, the folks at Duke and ?? I would be ?? if I did not
thank them publicly, ?? on this than anybody else to make this day come
true and it looks like finally where I live and some of the areas that
Representative Pierce lives and some of the areas that you represent
those 30 or 40% premiums that we are paying on electricity are finally
gonna combine and…

As far as the fiscal piece goes let me just say this, there is not a
fiscal note if you will notice on this, this is not ?? will come with a
market driven solution to something that benefits everybody, it benefits
??, it benefits the other groups ??, group progress right there through
this bill, fuel cost go down by an estimated 70 million dollars a year,
there are no losers in this and we are not asking for a dime or state
money, this is not a bailout solution, this is a market driven solution.
Also, the other thing is that it does not affect the states bonding
capacity or whatsoever because in the campus and ?? in the state. I
think those are the financial questions for us, I will stop here and
Representative Pierce.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wanna say this. [Laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Committee thank you for that, I just had Representative Kim and some of
the same folks down, and I want to thank Representative Hager just
because what my constituents just really worked on him for this bill. So
we are just glad to be here this morning and many capacities but some of
the newspaper articles from local papers that talked about the win, win
situation for all of us citizens and lot of our folks are benefited and
citizens and others who sometime these bills are really burdensome they
have to choose sometime between it and other things. So just I want to
get into all of that, just a great dealing and I’m just glad to be, it’s
a great day, many of seen in North Carolina with this bill is finally
signed and becomes law, it will be truly a great day. So thank you all
for allowing us to share that we did this morning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I had a few questions, Representative Jones.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For motion at appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Moore.

I was gonna do the same, let me just say that I’m very that this bill is
come about, I have relatives who live in rural areas, they are not
blessed to and live where I live and this has been a concern for them in
the passage so I look forward to the passage and giving some relief to
those citizens who have these issues for the years hopefully.

Members, this is the bill the Chair had previously announced was being
looked at it being added to today. However, it&#39;s been determined
that the conference report is material, therefore the Chair rules it is
material. As a result, it is eligible to calendared on Monday, March the
30th, it will be calendered for Monday, March the 30th. For what purpose
does the gentleman from Chowan, Representative Steinburg, rise? Alright,
Senate Bill 14, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 14, a bill to be entitled an act to provide funds for the
operating expenses of Academic Standards and Review Commission.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Wake, Representative Dollar, has the floor to debate
the conference report and for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I would move the adoption of the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman&#39;s motion is accepted. The gentleman now has the floor
to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The bill went back over to the Senate, we had a good conference, the
Senate agreed with and took our recommendations for adjustments that
were agreed upon. With respect to the coal ash section of the bill, the
Senate agreed to our changes with respect to the Economic Development
Partnership Board. We came to an agreement on the provisions that the
House had put in with regard to the health information exchange freeing
up some money, to keep that operation moving forward for the state. We
kept also in the provision that the House had put in with respect to an
audit with the local DSS&#39;s that was put in by the House. With
respect to the first two provisions of the original bill, the House had
taken out $100,000 from, that was for the defense of a lawsuit with
regard to the Rules Review Commission and the Board of Education. The
compromise was not $100,000 but there was a compromise to $50,000 for
the purposes of assisting in the defense of that particular suit. As
some of you may know some of the provisions were dropped, contingents
were dropped from that suit, but not all of them and that money will
come out of reversions. And then the conference report also provides, as
the underlying original bill provide, $275,000 for the Academic
Standards Review Commission from DPI operating costs, LAP salaries and
the like. So I would be happy to answer any questions. Everyone on all
sides signed off on the conference report and would appreciate your
support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the motion to adopt the conference
report? If not, the question before the House is the adoption of the
conference report to Senate Bill 14. So many favoring adoption of the
conference report will vote aye, those opposed will vote no, the clerk
will open the vote.

see some museums and all? This is kind of a chance to rest and relax a
minute too? Well we&#39;re glad to have you here, as you can see there

to go home for the week but we&#39;re honored you all came with us.
Sorry we wrapped up our business before you could see some of the action

dealing with a number of bills, but I hope you guys have a good time. I
recommend the Science and Nature Museum. The snakes, that&#39;s the
coolest thing to see. I hope you guys enjoy your visit and have a nice
weekend. Thank you.
