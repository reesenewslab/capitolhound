becauseperforce I grimaced this is a siesta represents about two months
of work on it represents all countless meetings with all the interested
parties of the first waltz for Bob Carney 's sitepersonnel director Neil
Alexander, and about a half-dozen meetings with him. the one thing I
felt me more than anything else is his passion for good HR much improved

which all of the aforementioned groups have had tremendous input.
infact, I've met with on-site employees Association twice already this

<p id="05:00">
Understanding that when we left that meeting this is basically the only
substance that we had a disagreement on. I agreed with him to work on
this between now and the floor. I talked to Neil Alexander today about
an hour ago. He agrees that there's still some negotiation here. The
change here is that a person who would have their rift rights currently
only if they were offered an equal or higher paying job. The economy
being what it is, we don't know that that's always gonna be available.
This bill says that the job could be a lower paying job. Again we don't
wanna offer any opportunity for abuse the concern is what if they decide
to make a doctor take a custodians job. Senator Allan Grease that's not
what we're interested in doing. I've talk to them about putting some
limits on that. Has to be in a certain range, prefer to do it by pay
grade or something. He agrees to negotiate on that. That was the one
issue or disagreement we had last night when I finished the meeting.
Then 11 oclock this morning when I was heading here I got this. But
anyway, we'll discuss that later I'm sure. On page six, I've written so
much on this page I couldn't see the page number. This is redefining to
some degree the agreement process basically the way it'll work is a lot
like it does today. The person will complain to their supervisor if they
cant get together the appeals at a department level. At some stage of
the game as you'll see with this bill. They've asked for alternative
methods they wanted to use meditations wherever possible. And that will
be defined by state personnel officers, not in this bill but by state
personnel offices. So I dont know when the meditations will come in. I
imagine it will come in even at the departmental level. But anyways, if
you cant get it straightened out at the departmental level. You'll
appeal to OSP They have a hearing officer who will then in 60 days make
a recommendation to state personnel commission. They either accept,
reject, or modify the state the recommendation of the state personnel,
the OSP hearing officer. Then if you dont like the state personnel's
decision you can appeal to the OAH. They have 60 days to review the
decision and either uphold it or reject it. And then if you dont like
that decision you can go to the superior court. Most of the next few
stuff on the next few pages was taken out because we replaced it with
the process I just explained to you. On page 9, I highlighted the stuff
under 126. Thats 34.2 because this is the language under which they're
gonna try to bring into mediation. It just says that at its discretion
the committee can adopt all alternatives dispute resolution procedures.
Now that doesnt mean they can break the process we just described. It
means they can add these additions to it to try to get it resolved
before it gets to the process of having to go to a hearing officer or
having to go to the OAH. So hopefully a lot of that stuff will be fixed
in a shorter period. The whole reason for changing the process is that
right now some of the cases are taking up to 450 days to resolve. Which
i agree with the directors that's absolutely ridiculous and terrible for
job moral for those people in the middle of this process. On page 11,
well we actually removed, the 6.4 on your bill summary.  But that was
actually removed and more negotiations will ascend. And we took that
out. So that's not an issue anymore. Section 7.1 they've added in
disability and genetic information just to bring the thing up to date.
Thing's you cant discriminate against somebody because of. 7.2 just
offer some flexibility and training it can done at the departmental
level or at the OSP level. Where as before that was more straight
jacketed. Section 7.3 eliminates some reporting requirements to the
general assembly until we can find out what we're exactly using for them
to send over here. Section 7.4 this one says that an employee who
objects the material in their file can grieve it but only up to the
department level. Not beyond the department level. The fault was that
sometimes thats done beyond the department level as a way to try to pre
emp a process later on. Section 7.5, excuse me just one second. 7.5, I
wrote some of the stuff on my bill summary and some on the actual bill.
This just recognized and consolidates reporting requirements in the
state personnel act and allows the OSP director to ask agencies for some
specific reports. Then on page 14...</p>

[Speaker Changes] In how we do work. And really we’re investing in
employees and strengthening the employee/employer relationship so
employers can be successful. And again, I want to thank everybody that
worked on this and we actually had the opportunity to a couple of
meetings with Representatives who worked on a lot of issues with them on
those, and again we’re glad to be at this point, we thank you for your
support. And again, thank you for the opportunity to speak to you on the
bill. Thank you very much.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Alexander. At this moment, we will hear
one more person who is in favor of the bill, and then we will hear two
in opposition. The committee will suspend.
I’d like for recognized Dana Cope. Dana, if you could, state your name
and title and organization for the record please.
[Speaker Changes] Sure, thank you Mr. Chairmen, my name is Dana Cope and
I’m the executive director of the state employees association and I’m ??
to speak against this bill if that is appropriate.
[Speaker Changes] You have the floor.
[Speaker Changes] So you all are busier than a centipede in a toe
counting contest. I’ve been over here yesterday and today and wow, I
remember the days when i use to walk the halls constantly in crossover
deadlines, so I don’t envy your positions. We were finally given a copy
of this bill around 7:30, and Representative Collins was very kind to
share that with us. And my staff turned around roughly a 20 page
document in 14 hours for us to digest and give feedback to chairmen
collins. I do want to thank the chairmen for allowing me to speak and to
say how important the state personnel act is to not only your employees
but also to taxpayers in North Caorlina. Maintinaing the state personel
act is crucial to stopping political patronage and nepotism in ranking
file state jobs. We appreciate the OSP director, Neil Alexander for his
willingness to go over this bill with us in advance. And our members who
work in the states mental hospitals, prisons, and on the highways, share
the governors goal quite frankly of creating the most efficient system
to serve the state of North Carolina  And there are some aspects with
this bill that we can agree to, but in our opinion, the bad far outweigh
the good. We just have an honest disagreement with the new
administration on this. Thats all it is. First, employees lose their
right to object to to false and misleading information in their
personnel files under this bill. This will cause serious legal and
liability issues and will result in costly lawsuits against the state.
In this bill, the new grievance process laid out bypasses OAH and
includes a process that takes up 210 days to complete under the bill
before you. We want appeals to be heard properly so our members can
better serve the public. Instead we propose that OHS conduct the
hearings, not simply just review them and take away their judicial
authority. The reduction and force priority for those who have been laid
off from state service is meaningless in the bill proposed before you
since it can be lost by excepting or refusing a job offered at a lower
pay grade. We most strongly object to the section of this bill that
repeals the SPA provision for violation of political hiring and
promotions. It also removes the right of the employees to file
grievances in instances of this have occurred. Without these provisions,
get ready for a return to the wild west and for state government to turn
into a system ripe for political patronage, cronyism, and nepotism.
[Speaker Changes] Mr. Cope.
[Speaker Changes] Yes?
[Speaker Changes] You have 30 seconds to wrap it up.
[Speaker Changes] Okay, we strongly question the language in this bill
that pertains to whether an employee may be fired without just cause.
And pubic employees deserve a system that rewards or punishes based on
what they know, not who they know. And for the reasons I have laid out,
I urge you to vote no on this bill, or at the very least, study this
matter further. The State personnel has been in placed for 48 years to
protect public servants from partisan politics and have served this
state well. Monumental changes like this presented in this bill
shouldn’t be rushed. This effects over 120 thousand families in North
Carolina and it is imperative that you do your due diligence before
changing such an important law.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Cope. Next up will be Carl Dean,
speaking in favor of the bill. Mr. Dean, if you could, state your name
and title for the committee.
[Speaker Changes] Yes sir. Good morning, I’m...</p>

…the court system. The bill does however, allow the person to put a
statement in the file that refutes the information so for internal
purposes they would have an opportunity to do that but they would still
have to pursue their remedies, elsewhere, yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma’am, but…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you have a follow-up question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, just that both of them could be self-serving. I do have one other
question on another section of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’re recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Why are you repealing GS-126.5 (e) and (f)? That’s dealing with SPA
employees who take exempt positions, respectively.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. The effect of those repeals means that individuals who are
being RIFed would not be able to have automatic prioritization for a
reassignment into other areas. Or for example the persons who might be
changing classification over to exempt status they won’t have the same
rights they might have had to get another position in state government.
Currently if you’ve had 10 years as an SPA employee that provides you
certain alternatives that other people might not have. That’s taken away
going forward prospectively.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could I follow up, Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One last follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess my problem there is that if you’ve got a career state employee,
a person defined as you define a career state employee here and that
person is moved to an exempt position and the administration changes of
course and then the exempt position goes out that career employee has no
protection at all as what was under 126.5 (e) and (f). Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, that has been modified.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McNeill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a comment or statement and a question. It looks to me like an
excellent bill and an excellent start at trying to do a very, very
complicated job. And I know from what you said that you worked for
several months with both sides.
It sounds to me like there are just some issues that have just come up
recently that haven’t been resolved. This is going from here to
Appropriations and I assume that you’re still willing to work with these
entities to work this out. So I think it’s a good bill and I think both
sides can finish working this out, we have time to do it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Collins, you have a comment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would like to follow up with something that was said previously. The
version which was complained that they only got it last night, the
Senate got this an hour after I got it last night and it only differed
by two changes from the other version which I gave them the previous
night as soon as I got it.
And both of those changes were concessions to Senate, so to say they’ve
only had last night and this morning to look at it is a little bit
disingenuous. Also another statement that was made, this does not bypass
OAH. The statement was made that this bypasses OAH but if you read the
bill clearly it does not bypass OAH.
The one measure of disagreement that I knew we had when I left the
meeting last night I have promised to continue to work on and have
talked to State Personnel Director today about working on that between
this and Appropriations, you’re exactly right.
So the differences that I knew we had I’ve agreed to work on and I’ve
kept my end of the bargain every time I’ve promised any group something
on this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hurley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. And I’m not sure which employees are under the
State Personnel Act. I do know that not every state employee is under
the State Personnel Act. I know those that work for the court system are
not covered under this. However I do have a question.
I know that because of the budget restraints, constraints we are having
to maybe close some facilities and the employees who work for those I
think have been given first choice at times. And I just wondered of any
other jobs that might be available because there are some employees that
will be RIFed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, that’s one of the major concerns on the part that I’ve agreed to
get some clarity on between now and Appropriations, that part about not
offering a job too far below what you’re currently being paid. That’s
exactly what we’re talking about.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Bell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In my district I have quite a few state
employees for the First District, a whole lot of them. And I’ve been
hearing from a lot of them in the last day or two. And I’m sure that the
intentions were good here and I’m just wondering if they’re aware of
everything in this…</p>

[Speaker changes.] and this bill is comin' up.  Ya' know, I listen to
Mr. Cope????? talk and everything and he's head of Scenic???? which most
of his employees belong to Scenic/????? in that area, a member of that
organization. And I'm just wonderin' if we've had long enough to get all
of them on board,or whatever.  I know that you don't care whether they
get on board or not but I think they ought to be informed ???? because
we need to have satisfied employees.  If you don't have that, you're not
gonna have good government anywhere because they're the ones who carry
it out not the people here.  When you talk about the stakeholders, the
employees at the lower level are the stakeholders that I believe should
be...should be concerned about. So I would like to make a motion that we
turn this into a study bill instead of passing this regular law.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Collins?
[Speaker changes.] Well, I would certainly oppose that motion. I've
worked on this thing too hard for too long. I have no idea...to answer
your question, Representative ???????... I have no idea how well the
employees on the trickle down side understand it.  All I know is
Scenic????? has been aware of this thing since it's inception.  I have
kept them aware at every stage of the game. When I got the original
legislation, I passed it on the them. I've met with them repeatedly over
more than a month now so the state employees have had the opportunity,
as far as I'm concerned, to be made aware of it but I don't control what
happens to the information once I share it with the leaders of the other
groups.  I've negotiated in good faith...frankly, almost as long as I'm
willing to negotiate. And made concession after concession after
concession on both sides.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Wilkins?
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chair. This bill has changed
drastically from the form it was in when I became part of it...and I've
not been a part of the negotiations for practical reasons.
Representative Collins has taken on that heavy lifting.  Representative
Collins and I have spoken this morning. I've got a coupla' reservations
about pieces of this bill. He is aware of that. He is absolutely gonna'
work with me if we move this bill forward. I've
also...Representative...if I may, sort of address this to Representative
Bell, yes, I've been approached by Scenic???? lobbyists ?????? but I've
also talked with Scenic folks at home. I know their concerns.
Representative Collins knows that I share at least one of them. If this
moves forward, there will be work done to it.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Representative Wilkins. Representative
Floyd.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you Mister Chair. I think that certain parts of
the bill is good and certain part of it is not so good and I think
Representative Hurley mentioned a question and this related to...on Page
5, Line 50...and that is &quot;state employment equal to or lower&quot;.
 When you're havin' a reduction, given ????? the ???? of personnel, one
does not know truly whether or not he is being pushed out, asked out or
kicked out. So if I've looked at, if I refused to take a position lower
than what I am, then I'm rejected or released and I think that it should
be a numerical number. I know you mentioned that something...but it
should be a numerical number in there so when that supervisor won't
deliberately choose me out of the rank and file. And I think that
the...there's always a second ?????
[Speaker changes.] Follow up.
[Speaker changes.] The thing that the regular employee have and sometime
you don't have and you do know whether or not certain things are placed
in your file and given the opportunity, I got to sit there and then
write a response to something that I got through the grapevine...that I
asked about...then I submit something or I take my bottom line pay and
hire an attorney, as Representative Charlotte????? mentioned, to seek to
get that removed.  I'm like Representative Bell, I know that you work
hard....</p>

?? on this, but I do think that when we’re looking at this, we’re going
to see many challenges in the future as it relates to this. I just think
that we just ought to take just a little bit more time to vent out
something, to vent out this. I know it’s time-sensitive but I think we
need to look at some other things, and I want to know… My last question
is on page 11. This is just for EEOC reasons. Why was “creed” crossed
out on line 33? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I can answer that. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
President Collins. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That was an archaic word that… We
just don’t use the word “creed” anymore. Religion is already mentioned
in there, which is basically what creed is. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I just…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There’s no devious intent in that, and as I mentioned
to you as far as your first part of the question, that’s the very part
of the bill we’ve gotten Director… I keep wanting to call him Secretary…
Director Alexander to work on and put a definitive limit on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One last question. Representative Mobley. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Two concerns. My first question is to the
Chair. I missed the very beginning of your presentation. How long have
you been working on this piece of legislation? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ve
been working on this piece of legislation since either late March, I
believe, or early April. Something like that. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It seems like two years. It’s probably been
two months or less. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] My next question is, could we possibly hear
from a representative for the state employees? Not the person who has
already spoken but someone else. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We have already heard
one pro and one opposed. I’d like to go ahead and move this to a vote.
Representative Davis, you’re recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’d like to make a motion that we give a
favorable as to the PCS and an unfavorable report as to the original
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] With a referral to appropriations? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Call for ayes and no’s, Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ayes
and no’s having been called, the Clerk will read the roll. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Collins? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Alexander? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Bell? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blust? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

Representative Floyd?  [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ford? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Graham? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Gill? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hollo? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hurley? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

Representative Moffitt? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ross? Representative Stevens? [SPEAKER CHANGES] ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Turner? [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Waddell? [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Wilkins? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER CHANGES] 18
having voted for and 8 against, the bill passes and will be sent to
Appropriations. Next on our agenda is House Bill 359. Representative
Collins, you’re recognized to present the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, committee, and on the last bill, I look
forward to continuing to do what seems my life recently and go back to
the negotiating table. House Bill 359’s a lot shorter, should be a lot
simpler than the last one I just presented. Hopefully it’ll go a lot
quicker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Collins? Representative Collins, we have
the PCS before us. Representative Wilkins makes a motion that it be
before us. All in favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] PCS is before us. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This bill basically does
four things with our retirement plan. Number one, it allows for</p>

For a transfer option that's already available to people in the 401K
plan, to people in the 457 plan, it makes that same transfer available
to the 403B program and the reason that's necessary is because that's a
new program. So it's just offering the same transfer option there that
you have with all of the other state voluntary retirement plans. Section
two clarifies the timing of the social security offset. If you're
getting a disability payment from the state it's offset by the amount
you get from social security disability. In the past the state for some
reason has been able to offset that one month before you actually got
your social security checks. So you're one month kind of short on money.
This trues it up so that we can't cut your check until social security
is actually paying your disability benefits. So that should be a benefit
for employees.
Number three, this is for those people who are so fortunate that they
are drawing a bigger retirement benefit that the IRS code actually
allows under section 415. So this should affect very few people. What it
does is saying that basically we're setting aside a separate pool of
money so that these payments won't harm those of us who are not in that
circumstance under the state retirement plan. And also that this
arrangement to pay people above the $205,000 a year, which is what it is
if you're in your 60s when you retire. That paying above that amount
will no longer be an option for people who retire after January 1, 2015.
So this will be a savings to the state at some point in time after that
occurs.
Section four just requires a form that's approved by the retirement
system t be used for filing of quadros [SP] domestic relations orders.
That's for operational efficiency. We're told that will save the state
time and money in executing these arrangements. So that's basically the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any questions from members of the committee? A motion
from the committee? Representative Ford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Move for a favorable report to house bill 359 up to
the PCS on 359, I'm favorable to the original. referral to finance has
been stricken.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All in favor for the motion say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Motion carries the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman, thank you committee. Next up
is house bill 551. Representative Davis you're recognized to present
your bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry, this is a local bill request by the city of
Wilmington. What it does is it makes changes to the local fireman's
reeif fund for the city of Wilmington regarding the transfer of funds to
the Wilmington's fireman benefit fund. And by doing this over time it
will give the board of trustees the flexibility to use more funds for
active duty firefighters, build a fund solvency and still provide
funding to retirees. All [??] of Tyler Newman from the city of
Wilmington is here and Stanley Moore from physical [??] resource is here
if there are any questions by anyone on the committee. It does come with
a unanimously favorable report from government and to my knowledge there
is no opposition. We have spent a lot of time venting this out with all
parties involved and to my knowledge everything has been worked out to
everyone's satisfaction.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Any questions from members of the
committee?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bill now is the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman I move for favorable for the bill number
551.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The motion being properly before us all those in favor
say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All those opposed. Motion carries. Thank you
Representative Davis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you members of the
committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In the estimation of the chair we only have two
minutes left, we've got two additional bills. We will not have time to
hear those bill. So no other business being before us we are adjourned.</p>
