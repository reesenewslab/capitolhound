The house committee on elections will please come to order.  Members
please take your seats. As always, the chair would like to extend his
thanks to the pages who are here with us today.  They include Leah Leek,
Chris Myers, Ben Perry, and Rachel Zimmerman.  Would you raise your
hand?  Thank you so much for your time for being with us today.  And of
course, the chair extends his thanks to our Sargent at Arms staff, Fred
Hines, Young Bay, Patrick Mason, and Charles Godwin and last but not
least of course to our staff who is here to support us.  The order of
business today this committee will here house bill 490 Lee County
elections and then we will move into a time of receiving expert
testimony on the topic of voter ID.  With that the chair is going to now
move into house bill 490.  It is the chair's understanding that there is
a proposed committee substitute for this bill, and that that bill has
been passed out.  Representative Burr moves that the proposed committee
substitute for house bill 490 be before the committee for discussion.
Seeing no objection it is so ordered and Representative Stone is
recognize for the purpose of  explaining house bill 490.  You have the
floor sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you mister chair, thank you elections committee.
Today we have house bill 490 and basically what the bill does, is it
take city county elections and make those partisan and it takes our
board of elections, our board of school board elections, and makes those
partisan and when we would normally have an election in May, it moves it
to November where the majority of voters show up.  There was some
technical changes , and mister chair at this time with your pleasure
we'd like to have the staff go over those changes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If staff would address the changes between the
original house bill 490 and the proposed committee substitute that is
before us.  Recognize Ms. Quick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you mister chair.  The only changes from the
original bill to the pcs are purely technical, there are no substantive
changes.  You want me to go over those I can.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stone do you have further remarks sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I just want to advise the chair that I know of
three people that's here from the city of Sanford, and one from the
school board that would like to speak to the committee at the given
time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.  If with the committee's indulgence,while we
usually have committee discussion first, since we do have three guests
from the Lee County and at the request of bill sponsor, the chair is
going to invite those form Lee to speak at this time.  Without
objection, we will move in that direction, first from Sanford city
council.  I understand we have both the major and the major pro-temp.
The chair would like to invite you the microphone at the rear of the
room and  if the Sargent at Arms could make sure microphone is on. If
you would please begin your remarks by stating your name and your title.
 He's on the way to get your mic on right now.  And we are glad that
you're here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mister chairman,  members of the committee,
and our Representatives Stone and McManus.  Our city council met last
night and for many of us it was the first time that we'd heard of this
bill, and when we discussed it we decided to pass a resolution.  And
mister chairman, I have to repeat this many times and why I forgot it I
don't know, I'm Corneal Olive, and I'm the mayor of Sanford.  But we
passed a resolution which we'd be glad to share with you, not because we
didn't know about the bill, but because for as long as we can remember,
our city has run under a non-partisan system, and it's run so well, and
it's also has not been assessed.</p>

<p id="005:00">
...with politics. So many of the things that we do as a city are not
politically related. As one of our council members said, &quot;There's
not much political about potholes.&quot; We are very concerned about our
infrastructure and we work very had at it. We are in a situation that if
it ain't broke, don't fix it. There's so many issues that this entails,
but I won't belabor this today. I will send you a copy of our
resolution.
Right now, we don't have to worry about who is going, what party is
going to be in and if we have a vacancy who's going to be appointed to
be a replacement. These are issues that are of great concern to us. We
don't want to politicize city council. Thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Mayor, and I believe we that the
Mayor Pro Tempore, as well. If we have the Mayor Pro Tempore, sir,
please step to the mic and identify yourself and we'd be glad to receive
your remarks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. My name is Sam Gaskins, Mayor Pro Tempore. I've
noticed there are several of you from Guilford County. I am an associate
professor of chemistry at Guilford County, so I'm frequently next door
to you. You may be considering something similar. But traditionally, as
the Mayor mentioned, in North Carolina the municipalities and schools
are non-partisan elections. Again, we just learned about this two days
ago, so we really haven't had the opportunity to discuss this or hear
from our citizens.
Actually, we would like to have you consider giving our citizens the
opportunity to speak, if nothing else, possibly as a referendum. But for
this particularly, we would look and ask for you to oppose this, vote
against it, or at least delete section 3. Again, this is rather short
notice for us. We did have the opportunity last night to be exposed to
it. And if you could, I know there were changes that were made. Again,
we know very little about this bill and would greatly appreciate having
any changes read to us. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And I also believe, the Chair believes that there is a
representative from the Lee County Board of Education and if so, we'd
certainly welcome your remarks, ma'am. You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Chairman Lewis, members of the committee.
My name is Tamra Rogen. I'm a member of the Lee County Board of
Education. I'm a republican member of the board and we have a republican
leaning board, but that is not, has anything to do with the decisions we
make as a board of education. Our decisions are solely based on what is
best for the children that we serve and partisan politics has nothing to
do with it. We think about what is going to be best for our community,
what's going to be best for our children, and that's the type of
decisions we make. So I'm going to ask you to please vote against this
bill and oppose it. I just found out about this bill yesterday. We have
not had a chance, as a board, to talk about this bill. We have not had a
chance to discuss this with our citizens, as Mr. Gaskins has said. And I
ask that you please oppose this bill or strike out section 1 and 2 until
we have a chance at least to talk about it as a board and talk about it
with our community. Once again, we do not make any decisions based on
partisan politics about our students, about our children. Our decisions
always based on what's best for our children and I could see how this
could really make relations messy between board members and I really
feel that the children of our county would suffer if this bill goes
forward. So please ask you to please oppose this bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Representative Stone, did you wish to add
anything at this time? If not, we'll move into the committee discussion.
Representative McManus, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the bill, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I also represent part of Lee County, only about a
quarter of the county but actually about 65% the town of Sanford. I'm
very much against this bill. I think that it is inappropriate for us to
be making decisions for local governments and local boards of education
when we have so much State business that is our responsibility. The
boards were not in support of this, they do not want it, they were
unaware and I think it is wrong for us to take this action. I would...</p>

[Speaker changes.] ...ask that you please oppose this.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Ma'am. Representative Michaux, please
state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] Let me ask the staff a question...is Lee County a
Section 5 County?
[Speaker changes.] Mister Cohen???????
[Speaker changes.] Yes, it is, Representative Michaux.
[Speaker changes.] Well...and you got the mayor and a mayor pro
tem...and board of education opposin' it? I think that sorta speaks for
itself...if it goes through here, you gonna' have problems elsewhere
with it...can tell ya' that now.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Representative Michaux...Representative
Iler, please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chairman...to make a comment on the
bill.
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman is recognized to comment on the bill.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chairman...my county, Brunswick, is
one of the counties listed as partisan elections for the school board
?????? municipalities ?????? most of them do not have partisan
elections; however, I can tell you that our elections produce a lot of
candidates running for individual slots on the board and not necessarily
just the top vote getters like a lottery...like some of the counties,
like just the top three vote getters out of 14-15 whatever it might
be...might be elected so I'm in favor of keeping our county on a
partisan basis and I'm in favor of any other county that would do that
to take a look at it...and I'm really more concerned, Mister Chairman
and Representative Stone, I'm really more concerned about the people,
givin' them a choice and lettin' them know more about the candidates,
how they may stand.  I think party labels do have meaning...I think they
do have information for the voters and I think that non-partisan
elections do not and I'm in favor of partisan elections; however, being
aware that most of the municipalities are non-partisan at this time.
But there again, that's just in my county. Thank you.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you.  Representative Harrison, please state
your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] To ask a question of the bill's sponsor...or the
Staff actually. I think it's for the Staff.
[Speaker changes.] The lady may propose her inquiry.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chair, I just was wondering cause
we have a similar proposal for Guilford County, how many boards of
education are partisan in the state?  Is it that list that's in the
original bill or is...are there more?
[Speaker changes.] On page one, lines 23 and 24 are all except
Winston/Salem, Forsyth is also partisan. Or I'm told it's a 15
currently.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Chairman.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] I think Representative ????????...I mean Mister Cohen
could answer a question for me.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Stam, you are recognized to pose your
inquiry to Mr. Cohen.
[Speaker changes.] Yeah, Mr. Cohen, there was some county or city, maybe
it was ??????????? that tried to go from partisan to non-partisan and
the US Justice Department stopped them. Am I right?
[Speaker changes.] Yes, although later after it went through court, the
Justice Department withdrew its objection
[Speaker changes.] Representative Avila, please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chairman, I'd like to ask a
question of Representative Iler.
[Speaker changes.] Will the gentleman yield?
[Speaker changes.] I yield.
[Speaker changes.] He yields. You're recognized.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you.  When Brunswick County went partisan, can
you tell me what the process was?
[Speaker changes.] I can't because it's been partisan since I been
there...almost 15 years.
[Speaker changes.] May I redirect that question to Staff, Mister
Chairman?
[Speaker changes.] Would anyone on Staff like to speak to that?
[Speaker changes.] I believe it was changed in 1981.  Brunswick went
through, in the late seventies, early eighties, several sequences over
three or four sessions where it kept being changed from one method to
another with local bills with the eventual one, the current system was
in the early to mid-eighties when it went to the current system, I
understand.
[Speaker changes.] Follow up on that?
[Speaker changes.] The lady is recognized.
[Speaker changes.] Could you clarify if there was a referendum or is
this was just an edict that was passsed. What kind of selection process
was used?
[Speaker changes.] I'm told there was not a referendum in Brunswick
County on that issue.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Iler, please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] One additional comment.
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman is recognized to comment on the bill.
[Speaker changes.] Again, I'm not sure I...first meaning of the question
from Representative Avila...</p>

Another meeting could be the process we have now. We have a five-member
Board of Education and they represent five different districts in the
county, the same as the commissioner districts. So we don't have
everybody from one town or from one area of the county. They're spread
throughout the county. But they answer as far as election day, they're
voted on by the entire county. But they also have their districts and
they're scattered out among them. They have to live in those districts.
That's one advantage also. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
Representative Floyd, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
speak on the bill, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, I think
that, I understand what Representative Starnes is attempting to do. At
the same time, I understand you know, the citizens and what they are
simply, you know they're asking is for number one, time. And number two
is so, ?? referendum. And that the people you know, decide. So I think
that those are the two questions there so they can be involved in the
process. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Speciale please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to speak on the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Everyone here knows that there's no such thing as non-partisan
elections. We all find out who these people are and what they stand for
based on party affiliation and everything else. All he's doing here, it
appears to me, is try to let the people know which train of thought with
regard to government that these people are. It has nothing to do with
how the Board of Aldermen or whatever they're called is going to do
their job. It  has nothing to do with how the mayor does their job,
other than their political ideology. It gives you an idea  how, I like
to know what party someone is, because it gives me a basic idea of which
way, if I don't know anything else about them, it gives me an idea of
which way they lean. Larger government, smaller government, whatever the
differences are. It gives me that idea. I think personally every
election should be partisan so we know the political ideology of the
people that are running for office and that includes the judges. I urge
you to support this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, I know we have a
pretty packed agenda. This is a local bill. I feel Lee County is a great
place but it's a Lee County issue and the Representatives ask for it. I
move for favorable to the PCS and unfavorable to the original. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Moore has moved that the proposed Committee
Substitute for House Bill 490 be given a favorable report, unfavorable
to the original bill. Further discussion or debate. Seeing none, those
who favor the motion will signify by saying aye. Those who oppose will
signify by saying no. In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it and
the motion carries. The Chair would like to take a brief moment of
personal privilege if I could, and introduce my wife Michelle, who is
here today. [APPLAUSE] At this time we're going to move into a series of
expert presentations. The Chair invited, the Chair through staff ask
quite a few folks who had expertise both in voter ID, how it came to be
and more importantly how it is administered to come and to speak to you
and to share information that they have and then we want to allow time
in the end for there to be inquiries to these experts. With that said, I
will go as quickly as I can through the introductions. Our first
presenter will be the Georgia Secretary of State, Bryan Kemp. Secretary
Kemp is here today and has served as Secretary of State since January of
2010. Prior to that, he was a member of the Georgia State Senate and has
a very long and distinguished career. The Chair will make Secretary
Kemp's bio part of the record but will not take time right now to read
it in its entirety. With that sir, Secretary Kemp, welcome sir. We're
glad you're here. We appreciate your time and you have the floor.</p>

<p id="020:00">
Good Afternoon. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me the
opportunity to be here.  As you said in my introduction, as a former
legislator, I certainly appreciate the job all of you have to do
representing your individual districts.  That being said, I'm not really
here today to try to sway you one way or another on the legislation
you're considering here, but really to just share with you some facts
and data post-photo ID law in Georgia, and certainly I'll be glad to
take any questions about my personal view on this matter as we conclude,
if you would like me to.  In 2006, the State of Georgia enacted Senate
Bill 84, which requires voters who cast their ballot in person to do
that with 1 of 6 forms of acceptable ID.  As I mentioned, I was in the
legislature when we passed this matter, so I was fairly educated on what
we were doing at the time, and have been Secretary of State, kind of,
post-implementation, and post-legal challenges in the last 3 years.  The
forms of ID that we accept in Georgia are Driver's License, any valid
state or federal government issued photo ID, including the free photo ID
card that we issue in Georgia by the County Registrars, or the
Department of Driver's Services, of course the US Passport, valid photo
IDs from different branches of government, or agencies including the US
Government, Georgia State Government, counties, municipalities, boards,
authorities, and other entities.  Also, military IDs, and tribunal IDs
are accepted.  If a voter comes to the polls and forgets to bring their
photo ID, they're not turned away.  They are still able to cast a
provisional ballot.  We never turn voters away at the polls because they
do not have a photo ID.  They're allowed to vote provisionally, and then
they have 3 days after the election to go back to their county, present
their photo ID, and then if they do that, their vote will be counted.  A
little bit of background information, just post-legislation passing.
There was a great deal done to raise awareness.  The Secretary of
State's office created a website about the photo ID requirement, the
free voter ID cards, and how to access those at the county level, and
with the Department of Driver's Services.  As far as the outreach and
education, there was also a lot done to make the public aware of this
requirement.  I think, being 6, 7 years done the road now since the
implementation, I think there is a lot more public awareness about photo
ID, certainly then there was in 2006.  But there was a big educational
campaign that was held in Georgia prior to the 6 elections between
September of 2007 and the November 2008 general election, which as your
all know was a presidential race.  Some of the things that we've done,
we had mail and utility bill inserts, over 5 million pieces.  We were
sending out packages of information to non-government agencies like
Chamber of Commences, churches, etcetera.  We did automated calls, video
PSAs, radio PSAs, and then certainly the Secretary of State's office was
issuing press releases about the requirements as well.  Some of the
highlights that we had from the educational standpoint, over 5000 radio
PSAs within Secretary Handle and the Atlanta Falcons players.  They
really raised awareness about this, also raising awareness about other
important deadlines like voter registration and early voting.  Also, the
Falcons home games featured LED banners so the fans could have access to
that.  There were radio ads purchased statewide, TV ads doing things in
conjunction with the Atlanta Braves and other stations across the state.
 Then we also had ads running on the mass transit buses in Atlanta.</p>

<p id="025:00">
To raise awareness, some of the numbers which I think really help as you
go through your decision making process and keep in mind that the
Georgia probably in 2006, we had you know probably about, north of 9
million people living in the state, now we are closer to 10 million and
in that whole period of time that we have been issuing the free photo
id, voter id cards at the county level or the department of drivers
services, we only issued 29,611 photo id in the state of you know 10
million people. We have almost 6 million people in our voter rolls and
you can see in 2008 obviously that was the first presidential election
year post photo ids and we had at the time before last two years the
majority of ids we issued wasn't at presidential election year. And you
can see as well this year in 2012 we had a little uptick with 3600 you
know compared to the other governors race in 2010 when we had about 2700
voter id cards issued. I will tell you too on a side note we had alot of
the some of our bigger county election officials that complain now that
there is alot of people coming in to get the free photo id not because
of voting purposes, but use it for other means, cashing checks, that is
prohibited. This card is only suppose to be used for voting but word has
gotten out on the streets that you can get a picture id if you are
registered to vote. You can do it at the county licensing office so some
of the id cards that were issued those people are not using them for
voting but for other purposes and we don't know the number of that but
that just complaints we hear from our local election officials.
This is the number of photo ids that our department of drivers services
or our drivers license issuing entity in Georgia state government. They
have only issued less than 12,000 so the majority of this is done at the
county level. The uh this slide really gives you some figures on the
photo id cards which we really have gone over and I mentioned third
bullet point there that we had  had an little increase  this year
because it was a presidential race. When you start to analyzing the
votes we have counted, Georgia has cast more than 18 million votes in 38
state, federal, state and federal elections since 2007 when this
legislation was implemented and started using. This does not include our
municipal and county elections that are often times held in off years of
state and federal elections so we have had this requirement and in many
many elections in the state. When you analyze the votes cast, I think
these are probably some of the most interesting numbers when you start
comparing first the 2004 to the 2008 general election.
When you are looking at the presidential race, you can see that post
2004 non photo id and 2008 when you had to have a photo id to vote in
person. The hispanic Latino increase was 140%, African American 42% and
the white was 8%.
When you look at 2012 numbers, there was an increase of 20.5% hispanic
Latino vote this year, 2.5% with African American and 4% with whites. So
even you know obviously the first year , first presidential race after
the legislation was implemented, the numbers were really huge with
minority participation increasing very high levels but even since then
in the last in this years presidential election those number continue to
go up. As far as turn out and number of statistics we kind of went over
that again comparing  to 2006 to 2010, which was a gubernatorial year,
you still had a large increase in hispanic Latino votes 66 and a half
percent and African American.</p>

<p id="030:00">
Participation increased 44.2%. That was in a gubernatorial. Comparing to
2006 when we didn’t have photo ID to 2010 when we did. Also, when you
look at the revisional ballot. That’s one of those things that people
talk about a lot. How many people end up having to vote provisional
ballots? The number is very small. In GA, when you look at the general
election in 2008, which was the presidential race. We had almost 4
million people vote in the state and we had less than 1200 of them that
actually came to the polls and did not have their photo ID and they had
to vote a provisional ballot. Very very small number. When you look at
the 2010 general election, which again was again the governor’s race was
the top ballot on the ticket. We had in the primary a million, a little
over a million people voted. We had only 204 people who came to the
polls without their photo ID and had to vote a provisional ballot. Then
when you look at the general election in 2010, about 2.5 million people
voted, less than 400 had to vote provisional ballots because they lacked
a photo ID. Another interesting number from this year was our March 6th
presidential preference primary. We had about a million people vote.
Obviously, most of those people voting were on the Republican side. We
did have some special elections on that day as well around the state. We
had million people that voted. 103 did not have their photo ID. The
reasons that folks may vote the provisional ballot and then not come
back to show their photo ID, I think can vary. Probably the obvious
biggest reason is the race is decided by a large amount of votes. They
just feel like, my vote’s not going to really matter if I go back. Some
people obviously want their vote to count no matter what the
circumstance. I think others when the race is decided just decide not to
go back and show their ID so their vote can be counted. Obviously others
should not have been voting in the first place and did not have the
proper documents to be able to vote. Another interesting number that I
think tells a lot about showing a photo ID when you vote in person. In
GA, we have an absentee process 45 days before all of these general
elections, either the primary or the November election in the state.
Even with the photo ID requirement you see that GA citizens they like to
vote in person. The number continues to get larger as the years go by.
In most elections we’re voting anywhere from 92 to almost 95 % of our
people are showing up either on election day or in early voting when
you’re actually voting in person on one of our electronic voting
machines and you have to show your photo ID. I was going to go through
real quickly just some of our legal challenges. I know that’s an issue
that is talked about as this type of legislation is considered. In
September of 2007, Judge Harold Murphy in the US District Court
dismissed a challenge to a photo ID law brought by common cause finding
that the law imposed no undue burden on the right to vote. In January of
2009, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Judge Murphy’s decision
noting that quote, “the interest in detecting and deterring voter fraud
is a valid neutral justification that this court cannot ignore.”
Additional information on legal challenges, in March 2011 the GA Supreme
Court upheld the photo ID’s law’s, the law’s constitutionality in a
challenge brought by the Democratic Party of GA. GA’s photo ID law has
now withstood challenges in the Fulton County Superior Court, the US
District Court, the US Court of Appeals, and the GA Supreme Court. Quick
slide just on the cost of this. I think some of the things that we did
in GA. Being one of the first states to do this, when there wasn’t a lot
of information about this. We probably did more than we really had to. I
think out of an abundance of (??) we wanted to make sure that our
citizens understood the requirements of photo ID…</p>

[Speaker changes.] ...It was first implemented.  The initial contract
was a little less than $600,000. That was puttin' a laptop and a small
camera and printer in the County Elections Offices so we could do the
photo ID's...free photo ID's  there.  There was less than $300,000 for
training, which a lot of the money we're gonna spend regardless but that
was somethin' that we focused on with our training that year with the
county elections officials. There was also some online training and then
the outreach in education part is...I'm sorry, forgot to ???? that
slide...is basically the cost of the advertising campaign and the
different ads and things that were done...just that cost.  And, Mister
Chairman, that concludes my presentation.  I don't know if you want me
to take questions now or yield to later time.
[Speaker changes.] It was the Chair's intent to allow a few inquiries at
this time and then to come back if the Secretary would allow that.  The
Chair saw Representative Floyd's hand first and then Representative Iler
so Representative Floyd did you wish to pose...
[Speaker changes.] Two questions, Mister Chair.
[Speaker changes.] You have the floor.
[Speaker changes.] One, can the staff provide us with a copy of this
presentation?
[Speaker changes.] I assume you don't have any objection to that Mr.
Secretary?
[Speaker changes.] It will be done, sir.
[Speaker changes.] Question number two is that you mentioned that some
individuals get free ID and use them to cash checks. I think it numbered
like 3000...somewhere in that proximity...so I want to...someone that
could check, research the records cause they got an ID, their name and
address is also on that so if you peruse the books, you can see what
percentage of those persons that received the ID actually voted.
[Speaker changes.] Right.  I may have not been clear enough on that.  We
don't know the number of people that get a free photo ID to be used for
other purposes. We know the number of photo ID's that we give out.  We
could certainly try...I believe the number...the people that get photo
ID's that don't vote, I don't know that we've ever done that. My comment
about cashin' checks or usin' those ID's for other purposes was just
what I'm hearin' from the county elections officials...that they know
people that are comin' in at the local level, gettin' a free ID and
they're not voting in the elections there.
[Speaker changes.] Follow up, Mister Chair.  It's just a matter of just
seein'...not necessarily what you said to cash checks, but just to see
if they receive an ID...are they actually voting once they receive the
ID?
[Speaker changes.] I believe that most of the people are but I think,
from what we're...we hear from very trusted local elections officials
that we work with, there are people that get 'em and use 'em for other
purposes.
[Speaker changes.] Follow up, Mister Chair?  Last question.
[Speaker changes.] Yes, sir...
[Speaker changes.] I understand what you're sayin' but I'm equally
concerned that...so it can help us...that those individuals who receive
ID's are actually voting. Not necessarily what &quot;trusted
people&quot; have said...I'm not disagreeing with that at all...I just
want..
[Speaker changes.] So, is your concern then, that they get the ID and
they're not allowed to vote?
[Speaker changes.] No, they get the ID and are not voting.
[Speaker changes.] Right.
[Speaker changes.] And that's...it's a concern whether or not
they...that way you can say confidence that those persons are perhaps
usin' it for other purposes.
[Speaker changes.] right.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Iler.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Mister Chairman. Thank you, Mister
Secretary. ???? comin' out from Georgia...I have family there...I
haven't heard no controversy about this at all from them; however, my
question, sir, is there someone at the polling places who has to make a
determination that this ID looks like the person standing in front of
them?  How does that work?
[Speaker changes.] Yes, well, when you come in and check in...you know
we have an electronic poll book, so you have somebody sittin' at a
computer so when you go in the polling location, the voter has to fill
out a voter certificate and then you take that and your photo ID and you
go up and you give that to the person workin' at the polls or the early
voting location.  They will verify the photo ID and then they
will..there's a place on our certificate where they check that they
checked the photo ID and then they initial that and then they'll find
you in the poll book...they'll give you your ID back and then you get
your card where you can go vote on the machine...
[Speaker changes.] mmmm....Mister Chairman...</p>

You're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, if the picture does not look like the person
that someone there who is charged with making the determination and what
happens if whoever that is determines they do not look like it?  Is it
provisional or what?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes sir.  That's a very good question.  Our county
person that's in charge of that polling location if somebody- if the
photo ID does not match- they'll get the poll manager over there.
They'll make a determination.  If there is not a clear resolution of
that, where they have another photo ID or something of that nature, the
person would be allowed to proved a provisional ballot until we can
determine whether the voter was who they said they were, and were
eligible.  They would not be turned away from voting though.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. Thank you Representative Jones.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you mister chair,  miss secretary.  I'm sitting
behind you and let me just first of all join my colleagues and say
welcome the North Carolina, and thank you for being here.  My mother's
from Georgia and next the state of North Carolina, that's where most of
my relatives live, and I've spent a fair amount of time there over the
years, and it's a great state, and reminds me very much of our state,
very similar in size, and demographics, and I've always been very
impressed with that correlation.  And that's why some your numbers I
found very fascinating.  I just wanted to go back over some maybe some
of your experience, since you were in the state senate at the time.  One
thing you pointed out was that less than 30,000 voter IDs have been
issued, and virtually a seven year period, since 2006.   We've been
presented with estimates of over 600,000 people that some people seem to
think we're going to need to issue these IDs for, and I find it
fascinating that apparently the people of North Carolina are 20 times
more likely not to have an ID than the people of Georgia, and I also
found it fascinating when you brought out the percentage of voter
increase, particularly in the minority community.  We're being told by
many of our folks here that we're disenfranchising these voters, and I
guess I just wanted to ask you from your experience, when you were in
the Georgia State Senate, were there similar estimates coming out at
that time, were you getting similar advice, were the estimates you were
hearing at the time were they conservative estimates, were they accurate
estimates as it played out?  What kind of things were you hearing
previous to 2006?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well thank you Representative Jones.  I don't remember
the numbers that were thrown around in '06 about the number of people
that may not have a photo ID.  I know that since I've been running for
secretary of state and serving in this role, there's always people that
quote numbers that are in my opinion very, very high, and the numbers
don't seem to turn out to be as high as sometimes quoted.  My personal
opinion, I don’t know the numbers here in North Carolina, and I don't
know or remember the numbers that were quoted in Georgia, but I just
believe that this day and time, that the majority of our citizens have a
photo ID, and if they don't have one, and are motivated to vote, or if
they're having to go through the airport, or do anything else in
Georgia, you got to show a photo ID and actually getting in government
buildings, and you wear a name-tag that has your photo ID on it so I
don't believe a lot of the numbers will play out.  I could be wrong
there, but certainly in Georgia, in a state at the time was over 90
million people, we've only had 30,000 people get photo IDs, and there's
no question that minority participation in our state has increased
greatly.  And I think it will continue to do that.  There are some
people that are not going to vote, they're just never going to vote, no
matter what we do.  That's hard for me to believe that people think that
way, but I think also people who do want to vote will be involved in the
process.  It's very easy.  I know in Georgia, to get a photo ID, even if
you don't have one, and certainly in our state, you don't have to have a
photo ID to vote absentee by mail as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Follow-up mister chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognizes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I also wanted to ask mister secretary if I could, a
little bit about the cost to the state.  You mentioned in one of your
slides that the cost per ID was about $9 per card, I think maybe $9.50
in the current year, so it appears Georgia has probably spent less.</p>

<p id="045:00">
300 thousand dollars directly in cost, and with the training and other
things you mentioned, it sounds like that the cost was relatively
minimal in the context. Our annual budget here is about 20 billion
dollars, and I assume Georgia’s probably pretty similar. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] It is. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Maybe you could just comment on that.
We’re being told that this is something that’s going to be extremely
expensive to the state, and maybe you could comment on that. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Well I don’t think the 1.7 million dollars I believe it was
that we’ve spent was a lot of money. There’s certain things in my
opinion that governments should be spending money on and other things
that they shouldn’t. Certainly elections is one of them because that’s
what people expect. No matter what side you’re on, everybody wants a
fair process, and it’s part of our job, I think, to educate our citizens
and make sure that they’re aware of our voting laws and rules. I think
some of the cost here would probably be lower when you think about our
great state and our great 159 counties that we have. That’s a lot more
than most states out there, and we had to buy computers and cameras and
the equipment to do the free photo IDs for every county in the state,
and certainly I think that would be lower, a lower cost to you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Secretary and thank you Mr. Chairman. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Representative. Representative Harrison. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair, and thank you for making the trip. I have
a quick comment and then two questions. I would suspect that the vast
increase from the 2004 to the 2008 numbers in minority participation had
a lot to do with President Obama’s investment in the ground game because
he put a significant amount of resources into Georgia to turn out the
vote. It looked like it dropped off a little bit from 2008 to 2012, but
that’s neither here nor there, but it does seem like the increase would
be due a lot to that, but my question was related to the expenses of… To
follow up on Representative Jones’ question, 1.7 covered both the cost
of implementation as well as education? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe that
was the total cost, yes ma’am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And just to follow-up,
Mr. Chair, how long did you all engage in that campaign of educating the
public? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think it was between the 2007 and 2008
election cycle, so it was leading up to the presidential race in 2008.
Of course, we still promote that. Every election we’re sending out press
releases; “Early voting starts this day. Remember to take your photo
ID.” We do that basically in everything that we do leading up to any of
the elections, and I think the one point to make: Certainly I think the
statement you made is true about President Obama and his ground game,
and I think it was also just our citizens, whether they were for the
President or against him, they wanted to vote in that race, and those
that didn’t have a photo ID, they went and got one. I think the number
that I think is good for us is all those people, they now have a photo
ID, so they didn’t need one for the ’12 cycle, but there were people
that still needed one to vote this year, and they went and got them, and
that number increased, which I think is a good thing. It’s still a very
small number compared… It’s 36 hundred I think, compared to the 30
thousand that we’d given out in the previous six or seven years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The ladies recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
and last follow-up. Did you all have documented cases of voter fraud,
what percentage of voter fraud that you were responding to, or…?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well the thing about voter fraud pre-photo ID is I
don’t know that people knew that fraud was happening because when it
used to be that you could vote with somebody’s power bill, if you went
by and stole a power bill out of my mailbox and I was somebody that was
registered to vote but maybe I hadn’t voted in the last election or two,
in my eyes you could target that person for voter fraud. You could swing
by there one day, slip the power bill out of there, and you could go in
and say this person doesn’t normally vote, and go in and vote in that
person’s name, and there’s no way to know that. When they have a photo
ID, you know who that person is and that they should be on the rolls and
are eligible to vote. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Conrad. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I had a couple of questions. For the
approximately 30 thousand peoples who did have to primarily go to the
Board of Elections and a few to the DMV to get photo ID, what did they
have to show as far as documentation? A birth certificate, or what were
the steps that they had to go through to obtain the photo ID in Georgia?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There’s a few things in the</p>

<p id="050:00">
The law and the state election board rules that have to be verified for
those individuals to get that photo ID. They have to have some sort of
photo ID that has their legal name and date of birth on it. They have to
have a document showing the person's date of birth - which obviously the
first one would have accounted for as well. They have to have evidence
that the person is registered to vote, so they have to be a registered
voter to get the free photo ID. And any other documentation that shows
the persons name or date of birth.
[speaker changes] Can I have the follow up mister chairman?
[speaker changes] You're recognized.
[speaker changes] Also one point of discussion here - I'm very curious
as to how the state of Georgia handled this - is with college students.
?? Them to use their student IDs and do you have any way to verify that
they are voting both in a local Georgia election while they are
attending a university there, and not also voting absentee in their home
state or home location.
[speaker changes] Right that's a very, very good question and something
that we deal with a lot. We do allow student IDs from university system,
universities and colleges. Because that's a - as I mentioned in the
presentation - that's a government ID. There's also has been legislation
proposed in the past years that has not passed allowing private colleges
and university IDs as well, which I personally support. It's had a
little bit of a hard time in the legislature, but I think if you have a
reputable, accredited college or university, even if it's private, in
the state and a student has a photo ID my personal belief is we should
accept that. What was the last part of that question, I'm sorry.
[speaker changes] One concern that we had whether students - I believe
after they've been here in North Carolina for 30 days they can register
to vote here whether it's a private or a public university. But we have
no way of tracking. Say they're from Maryland or Pennsylvania -a lot of
our schools like White Forest bring in students from out of state.
Perhaps their parents have ordered an absentee ballot for them to also
vote a second time at home and they may not be aware that [crosstalk].
[speaker changes] Yeah we've had incidence of people voting in multiple
elections, different states, same elections. And we're kinda in a tough
spot on that because the federal voter registration laws keep us from
removing people from the roles, I think it's 60 days before an election.
In Georgia we have a cut off of 30 days before the election to be able
to register to vote in that election. So you have that 30 day window
that we can't take anybody off the roles but they can still register in
Georgia. So we may have somebody that registers in Georgia that would be
legally able to vote in Georgia. But say, Alabama, North Carolina, South
Carolina, whoever it is, they would be prohibited from removing that
person off the roles. So you get into a situation where you can have
people that show up on the roles twice. There's some of the things that
the states are doing right now to have cross checks and to be able to
communicate. That's something we're working on but it can happen.
[speaker changes] Representative Michaux.
[speaker changes] Thank you mister chairman. mister secretary, just a
couple of questions. Started ??. Do you have earlier voting in Georgia.
[speaker changes] Yes sir, we have. Previously, to 2010 I believe it
was, we had 45 days of no excuse absentee by mail. So you could vote by
mail any time 45 days before the election. We also had in-person early
voting 45 days before the election. Two years ago the legislature, with
my support, changed that to move the 45 day in-person to 21 because our
counties were requesting that from a cost saving standpoint.
[speaker changes] So [just a moment], you've got a 21 day period for
early voting.
[speaker changes] For in-person. We also have -
[speaker changes] In-person early voting.
[speaker changes] 45 days by early mail.
[speaker changes] Another question is you indicated: do you have to be
registered to get the voter ID that you talked about?
[speaker changes] Yes sir, you have to be a registered voter to get the
free voter ID card.
[speaker changes] You don't have to have the photo ID to be registered?
[speaker changes] To get registered in Georgia we have a proof of
citizenship law. Just like when you get your driver's license in Georgia
you have to prove your citizenship.</p>

You can register to vote through Motor Voter. Obviously, when you get
your driver's license you can also register to vote because you've
proven your citizenship and meeting all the other requirements at that
time, like we know who you are, where you live, those type things. But
to get the free photo ID card for voting you do have to be on the voter
rolls. And to be on the voter rolls in Georgia, you have to prove all of
those things prior to getting on the rolls.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Another question. Have you had any problem with
individual...
[bell sound]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That happens when that...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm sure I've gone past my time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, that's the Senate. That...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Chair will apologize to Representative Michaux and
also to the Secretary. The Senate has a herd mentality so you call them
the with a cow bell. You have the floor, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I can relate to that, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Have you had...you answered my question about fraud,
but have you had any problems since you've been requiring photo ID's of
individuals who have acquired duplicate photo ID's, that you know of?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Not that I know of. Certainly, that's not really our
big concern. I think our big concern is making sure that they have at
least one photo ID that meets the requirements so that local elections
official can check them in and know that that person that's voting is
that person that's on the voter rolls.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. But there is the possibility of an
individual who wanted to create a problem to get multiple voter ID's and
use them at multiple voting places.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] They could certainly get multiple voter ID's. I think
that wouldn't be too terrible if somebody did that and we wouldn't
prohibit that, either. If somebody came in and said, &quot;Hey, I lost
my ID that I need to vote.&quot; We're going to give them another one
because if they're eligible we want them to be able to vote. I think we
have other checks in places, I believe, to check the voter rolls to make
sure that you don't have multiple people voting. The same person voting
two or three times. That's why we have the check in process that we do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One follow up. This has to do with...do you know, and
I think you answered this but I need to know. Do you have any idea as to
how many people would be eligible to vote who did not have voter ID or
could not get voter ID?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I wouldn't have any way of knowing that, but I think
the number is very small. But that's one of the reasons we have our
absentee voting process. If we have an individual that is older, that's
on our voter rolls and they may have a hard time getting to the polls,
or they may have a hard time getting out to get the free photo ID, that
they can vote by mail as long as their on the voter rolls.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But that person doesn't have to show voter ID?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Did the other, just a editorial comment. I know why
you had, I don't have the ties that other folks have to Georgia, I know
a whole lot of politicians in Georgia. Some you probably know. But
anyway, the bottom line was that in the big turnout that you had in
2008, there was no question and I don't think anybody's mind, that Obama
ground thing, they may have paid for folks to get voter, I mean, if
there was a cost involved, to get the folks out. Particularly in the
minority community because it was a race that could have been...and the
same thing happened in 2012 with particularly in the minority community.
So that was the reason, I believe, that you had, like it happened all
over the country.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, that whether you had photo ID or whatnot, that
happened all over the country, so that was an aberration, but that I
hope would keep up for a long time, even without the voter ID.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ??, that's a very good point, but I think it also
shows that people motivated to be involved in the process that simply
showing a photo ID to vote is not going to prohibit them from going and
getting one in being able to be involved in the process. I couldn't have
got here today if I didn't have a photo ID...</p>

I went through the airport. [SPEAKER CHANGES] But you don’t have a
constitutional right to go through the airport. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well
that’s true. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Michaux.
Representative Speciale. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I want to say I appreciate
you being here and answering all these questions. Do you know of any… I
don’t know if you would know this because it would probably a municipal
election. Do you know of any elections where the number of people who
did not come in and show their ID – in other words they have to do a
provisional and they never came back three days later – where the
numbers might have changed the course of the election? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don’t know that. We don’t do the municipal elections in Georgia; the
cities do that themselves. Sometimes they contract. I wouldn’t have any
way of answering that question. I imagine that that could probably be
the case in an election. We have some elections that end in ties or
there may be a one vote victory. I would think that in most of those
cases though, those people if they were eligible to vote, they’d be…
somebody would be taking them back to show that photo ID where their
provisional ballot would count. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
McNeill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, Mr. Secretary. I thank you again for
also coming up and answering our questions. I noticed during your
presentation you said you accepted expired IDs. Is there a cutoff on
that? So they could be a 20-year expired ID? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir,
and I think our thinking behind that is my stepfather’s a good example.
He’s 85-plus years old. He can’t see real well anymore, we can’t get a
driver’s license; he’s not going to go down to the county elections
office and fool with getting a photo ID just to vote, but he’s got his
old driver’s license. It’s probably been ten years since he’s driven,
but if he wants to go vote in person, he can use that ID. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Cunningham. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
finally. In your slide it had six million voters in your state, and you
all only do 30 thousand. That was between the DMV and your voter ID.
What percentage is voting? And I would like to think that we’re not
going off ’08 and the last cycle because those are going to be bumped
very high, so what percentage in an average voting would you be looking
at as far as your state? Because that number seems very, very low if
you’re looking at six million people, because I don’t want to think that
the other five or six, other five or four million people have some type
of ID. That just seems extreme. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I think when you
look at the numbers, you have to – and if I’m not answering your
question, you can restate it, but when you look at the numbers, we got a
state now of almost ten million people. Certainly some of the numbers in
’08… we probably had nine and a half million people. We’ve been growing
pretty fast in Georgia the last several years, but you’ve got to think
about voting-age population too. So we’ve got ten million people in the
state, but we’ve got a bunch of those that are under 18 and are not
eligible to vote. In the presidential races, we generally turn out about
70% of the registered voters; in the gubernatorial years, it’s probably
closer to 50%. So even looking at those numbers like a governor’s race
where we may only have two and a half people vote, I think the number of
provisional ballots of people that went and voted and didn’t have a
photo ID was, like, 12 hundred, the best I remember. I don’t know if
that’s answering your question or not. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes ma’am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So what is your voter-age
population that’s over 18 who can vote out of that ten million? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I’d probably say… we probably have of eligible people that are
registered to vote, I’d think we’d be probably in the 68 to 72% range. I
can verify that with the Chairman’s Office when I get back if you’d like
me to, but I think that’s about right. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes ma’am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, and ladies and
gentlemen, just so you know, the Chair saw Representative Jones, Graham,
Iler, Faircloth and Avila, so we’re going to get those, and then we’re
going to let the Secretary rest for just a moment and we’re going to
hear from our next presenter. So Representative Jones. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and again, I’m behind you, Mr. Secretary. I
wanted to follow up with a line of questioning a couple of
Representatives posed about the increase</p>

In particular, minority participation in the presidential years, and I
just wanted to verify the numbers I wrote down were correct. But you
also reported on your slide, I believe, that in the gubernatorial
elections between 2006 and 2010 that the the African American
participation was up about 40%. I just wanted to ask, do I have that
right, and if that's correct, do you have any comments as to any other
extenuating circumstances why it was up. We've talked a lot about the
presidential race, but I wanted, to me those numbers are far more
telling if that's the case.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, you're, you're correct when you look at the '06, well when you
compare 2006 to 2010, the general election which was a Governor's race,
I believe we had a US Senate race at the time as well, and, obviously
both of those were contested. The African American increase was 44, over
44%. The Hispanic/Latino increase was 66%, so they did go up even in
non-presidential years.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Graham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, you answered my question. I was concerned with duplication
and replacement, and if there was a cost for replacement. I think you
answered that with Representative Michaux. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Graham. Representative Iler.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. I hate to chase this early voting rabbit too
far, but it was brought up, and I want to ask one simple question I
believe. In your early voting, do you, it was 45 days and now 21 days,
do you have one voting place of ?? elections in each county, or do you
have multiple sites in each county?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Right. We have, the counties have discretion with that. Most of our
smaller counties will have, they'll be voting at the county courthouse
or the local annex, the government annex. You have bigger counties like
Fulton which is Atlanta or Cobb, some of the other metro counties, they
may have anywhere from four to six early voting locations, depending on
the size of the county and the logistics.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. Would you say most counties have one place during early
voting?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, the majority of the counties in the state have one. It's really
probably our, I'd say it's probably less than seven or eight that have
multiple locations the whole time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up comment, mister chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I can report that I voted early before there was early voting. I would
go to my board of elections and ask for an absentee ballot, fill it out
right there and turn it in when I was gonna be out of town during
election days. So there's been early voting years before we called it
early voting. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Faircloth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. Mister secretary, over here to your left.
Thank you for being here and I just wanted to ask, does Georgia have a
systematic way of purging deceased persons from their old voter rolls?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We do. We have, in Georgia we have a statewide voter registration system
which the secretary of state's office is in charge of. And we have
different reports that we get from vital statistics when we have
deceased people and are able to pull them off the rolls. Unfortunately,
it takes us a long time to get that information. We actually passed a
law last year that was part of our legislative package where we can now
give the county registrars the ability to remove deceased voters off the
rolls when they have personal knowledge. So like if they see an obituary
of somebody in the local paper, they can go in and remove that person
until it's verified with vital statistics. And we have some ways to
verify that. We send a letter to the deceased person and if they reply
then obviously we don't take them off the rolls, but if they don't, we
can remove them.  And that's just giving some local flexibility to the
local registrars. It helps us keep our rolls cleaner than they have
been. Because you can have, sometimes it may take us months to get
deceased voters and we've actually had people that we had mailed
absentee ballots to that legally requested one, they passed away, and
that ballot got voted by a family member because it showed up at the
house, because they weren't taken off the rolls because we didn't have
the data at that time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What about a system for purging people who have moved their residence
out of state?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, that's a little bit tougher question because we have federal,
kinda some federal intervention there that keeps</p>

from removing people off the rolls 60 days before the election, I
believe is the right day.  So that's a little harder to do.  One of the
things that we've been working on, a lot of the Secretaries of State
around the country have entered into a compact that we're now checking
our voter rolls.  It's called the Kansas Project, where we reach a
memorandum agreement.  And we send our voter rolls to Kansas, and
they'll run them against all the voter rolls that are also in the
compact.  There's now close to 30 states that are doing this, and if
there's duplicates that show up, then both those states will contact the
voters and kind of work together to figure out where that person is
legally registered and decide who should do what as far as removing
them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank your Mr. Chair, and I will also give my Georgia
roots, born and raised in Bullock.  I don't think I caught this in any
of your discussion in early voting, does Georgia have same day
registration?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]No Mame, we do not have same day registration.  We have
a 30 day cut-off before the election.  You've got to be registered 30
days before the election.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]And last inquiry for the Secretary/Representative
Mobley?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Chair.  My question regards your early
voting.  I think you said 21 days in-person, and 45 days by mail.  The
in-person voting, is that allowed 21 days, calendar days?  Are Sundays
included?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes Mame, good question.  We don't vote on Sundays in
Georgia, but the new statute that we passed when we changed to the 21
days, it is a date count.  There is a mandatory Saturday, so we have 3
weeks early voting.  The first day will start on the Monday, whatever
that Monday is, 3 weeks out.  It will go Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, and Friday.  Then the next week, which would be the 2nd week
you'd have all 5 weekdays, plus that Saturday would be mandatory for all
counties in Georgia.  And then the 3rd week you'd have Monday through
Friday.  Now the counties do have the flexibility.  Some of our bigger
counties, if they want to have an additional Saturday, they could have
early voting the first Saturday.  They cannot do the Saturday before the
election, because the local election officials would throw me out of
office if I allowed voting on the Saturday before the Tuesday election.
They really need that day to deal with absentee ballots, to get their
poll workers and their equipment organized an ready to go out. And
that's the reason we don't allow that Saturday before the election.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you very, very much for your time, Mr. Secretary,
and for your very good presentation.  At this time the Chair is pleased
to recognize Mr. Ion Sancho.  Mr. Sancho is the Supervisor of the
Elections for Leon County, Florida.  As I did with the Secretary, I will
not read his very extensive bio, I will point out a few things.  Mr
Sancho has been Director since 1989.  He was asked by, he was actually
appointed by the Florida Supreme Court in December of 2000, as the
technical expert to oversee the Florida recount.  He has also testified
before the US Congress, the US Election Assistance Committee, and the US
Civil Rights Commission.  So we're very, very glad that you're here sir,
and you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you very much.  The State of Florida has a very,
very different scheme in terms of its voter registration, and voter
identification procedure.  We have been toying with the idea of the
setting up a database in the late '90s.  The election of 2000, which
opened the door of the Help America Vote Act, simply allowed us to
decide to put this into play.  And so, our regime really doesn't look
like most of the states.  In fact we check the eligibility at the front
end of the process, in a process called No Match, No Vote.  We do this
through a state-wide voter registration database</p>

<p id="075:00">
such as was required by the Help America Vote Act, but it’s a live time,
not a batch system, with portals available to every user who needs it
including the Department of Corrections, the Department of Health and
Vital Statistics… Every supervisor of elections is connected to it, so
no matter where you’re the supervisor of elections from, all eleven and
a half million registered voters are available to be seen on my
computer. So what we basically do is we require when an individual
registers to vote that you provide us a valid Florida driver’s license –
it cannot be expired and it cannot be from another state – or you give
us the last four digits of your social security, and that will be
matched within 24 hours against the databases, and we then will be given
notification from the Division of elections as to whether or not the
individual is eligible to be registered to vote. So this is called ‘No
Match, No vote’, and this was litigated in2006 and 2007 in Florida. This
litigation, which upheld the ability of us to require the state and to
match this before you could be registered, meant that we could actually
then cut corners at the back end of the process, i.e. we do require a
picture ID before a vote is cast in a normal manner, but if you don’t
have picture ID, we will require you to provisionally vote, and you do
not have to return to confirm the validity of that vote. That ballot is
taken from the precinct or an early voting location and will be
confirmed against the original voter registration signature that we have
in our files in a computerized format, and our statewide database allows
us to take snapshots and compare the signatures on a computer screen
side-by-side, no matter where you live in the state of Florida. I can
look up a Broward County resident or a Pensacola resident; it makes no
difference. All of the eleven and a half million records are available
for my election workers to process and to see and to verify, and if an
individual does not bring picture ID to vote, they cannot vote in the
normal manner until that provisional ballot is brought back to the
elections office where the canvassing board, which is the certification
panel of local officials, the county judge, the county commission or the
supervisor of elections, none who can be opposed or on the ballot or
participate in any public way in the election, or you’re barred from
voting and participating on the panel – so the local panel verifies that
the signature is the signature that we captured when that voter
registered to vote, and the voter does not have to make a return trip to
any elections office in the state. The number one reason that individual
provisional ballots are not counted is that they are simply not
registered to vote. During the 2000 election there was a north Florida
decision which said that if an individual demanded to be given a
provisional ballot, the election official has no discretion to not
provide the provisional ballot, and being a resident of north Florida, I
have to abide by that decision, so the number two reason why an
individual’s provisional ballot might not count would be the fact that
you cast it not in your legal voting precinct, and under Florida law, a
provisional ballot can only be counted if it is cast at your provided
polling location that you are assigned to on election day. If you go to
any other voting precinct and cast that provisional ballot, that ballot
is void. That is the number two reason for voided provisional ballots in
the state of Florida; they are registered to vote in the county, they
are eligible, but they went to the wrong polling place to vote it and
that ballot is void. The process that we have used and has been now in
effect for two gubernatorial elections and two presidential elections I
think has served us well. The issue of disenfranchising citizens was not
a feature of the 2008 presidential elections in Florida or the 2012
election, although I might say that the nationalization of the political
voter ID laws meant that the number one question that I faced when I
went to talk to voters about voter registration was “What are our voter
ID requirements? What do we have to do?” Well the answer is nothing. If
you voted in 2008 and 2006 the same way you vote</p>

In those years, that same ID we'll require in 2012. But that information
was really lost at the national media level, and that was the number one
concern of my voters in Leon County, was what are the new voter
registration requirements? And we didn't have any new voter registration
requirements in Florida. The citizens just assumed so because everywhere
they were looking, they were seeing they were seeing that on the
political media in television and radio. Our system cost $23 million to
build. We paid for our Florida voter registration database out of the
Federal Help America Vote monies. State of Florida, those monies were
apportioned out based on population. The state of Florida received well
north of $100 million as its portion of HAVA money, and the state took
about $23 million of that money and built this integrated, live time
system, which quite frankly, was developed with tremendous amount of
input from the Supervisor of Elections because it meets everyone's
needs. We can verify the eligibility of any voter, anywhere, at any
time. Anyone can do it that's an election official. You don't have to be
me sitting in front of a computer. A technical person can sign on and go
onto what we call Voter Focus and find out. I have at my disposal
everybody's voting history, everybody's voting record. And we know, for
example, if you voted an absentee ballot in Miami and came up to Leon
County and tried to re-register, we would bring up your record and say,
you've already voted. End of story. That database is the heart of what
we have built in Florida, and that has served us very, very well to this
point. And I would suggest that that kind of a database, which was what
was called for in the Help America Vote Act, really does give the state
of Florida, I believe, a very, very great advantage over other states
who are attempting to do this process without this kind of synchronized
instant-time database. Because we don't have to wait months for deaths.
We don't have to wait hours to determine whether or not someone has cast
a ballot in another jurisdiction. It is known almost instantly. And if
you have electronic electronic poll book technology, which connects into
the state-wide database, you can determine on Election Day within five
minutes whether or not an individual has cast a vote in any other
precinct in the state. Leon County has chosen not to do electronic poll
books. We have our own system base with laptops that we didn't have to
pay anybody any proprietary licensing fees. But our laptops go directly
to our database, so any voter that goes to early vote or absentee ballot
vote, that record is instantly updated while the voter is in front of
the in-person early voting site. And that ends all issues of multiple
voting at that point. I apologize for not having a slide show, but I was
notified yesterday morning at 9:00 that I was supposed to be here, and I
had a legislative session. Senate Bill 600 in the State of Florida was
heard yesterday from 1:00 to 3:30 and I had to attend that. Because that
was our major election reform bill following the 2011 legislative
session, which changed the election laws. We have had to address the
long lines that were pertinent to Florida's 2012 election. Florida,
according to the Pew Center on the States, had the longest wait times of
any state in the nation. We averaged 45 minutes wait on Election Day.
And as we can go into our computer, our Florida voter registration
database, and see the last voter actually voted at Miami-Dade at 2:03
a.m., some seven hours after the poll closed on Election Night. What the
Legislature is doing now in House Bill 7013 and Senate Bill 600 is
restoring the cutbacks to early voting, which in fact was the pressure
relief valve to accommodate Florida's voters. Florida has fewer polling
places today in 2012 than we did in 2000. Our population grew 18.3
percent in the last decade. We simply lost the ability to build enough
electoral infrastructure, i.e., precincts, which is the number difficult
job that a local official has, finding accessible polling locations. We
basically threw our hands up in surrender on that issue. Early voting is
where the extra voters have to go. That's the only way we can
accommodate them. And reducing early</p>

voting from 14 days to 8 days in 2011 caused 225 thousand voters not to
be accessed that were accessed in 2008, and it caused a huge overflow on
election day, so both election bills restore on a permissive basis to
local supervisor of elections the ability to go back to full 14 days of
early voting and including voting on the Sunday before the Tuesday
election. Again, that’s permissive, but the majority of the urban
supervisor of elections testifying before the House and Senate said that
if they were given the choice, they would provide Sunday voting before
the election. So the bills are now in that position in the state of
Florida, and our session ends at the end of this month, so hopefully we
will reform our laws to make them a little bit more accessible because
the issue of accommodating voters is critical to elections and has now
caused Florida to have become the laughing stock twice in a decade, and
we’re not really proud of that, and again, we want this process to
accessible. That is our number one, number two and number everything
priority, and that’s where we are in Florida today. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. I know there are several members that want to ask… Would
you mind sharing briefly with them the book that you give out? And I’m
going to ask that we get one of those before you leave please. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] We do a tremendous amount of voter education. This is our
election guide that I send to every registered voter in Leon County. We
have 190 thousand of them; 190 thousand of these were mailed out. I also
print out about 10 thousand extra because at every public meeting that
we go to, we bring them. We also take them to early voting sites.
Everybody who’s in line at an early voting site, we walk it up and down,
we tell them about this, and in this guide, for example, it lists right
here in a very prominent page that the state of Florida requires you to
bring a photo ID if you want to vote normally, and that includes a
Florida driver’s license, a Florida ID card, which is available from the
Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, a US passport, a debit
or credit card, a military ID, a student ID, a retirement center ID, a
neighborhood association ID and a public assistance ID. These picture
IDs are acceptable. If they do not contain a signature, you must present
a second ID with the signature. So we want a picture ID and the
signature, but we’ll take two pieces of documentation to confirm that.
Again, this information has been sent out from the local counties. The
state does not do any public relations in the state of Florida. The
state does not buy television ads telling citizens about this. The state
runs the Election Department; all the elections, however, are run by
local officials. All of the voter education comes out of my budget,
although there is a HAVA component with a matching 15% requirement. But
all of the rest, the television commercials that I buy – and I but about
30 thousand dollars of television commercials every major election –
comes out of my county’s budget, and my county willingly coughs it up
because we had an election problem in 1984 that caused five thousand
voters to be turned away from the polls, so our county government was a
little sensitized to what happens when you screw up an election before
the 2000 election happened. So that is money well-spent in my opinion.
If you can educate the voters as to what is required well in advance
before they came in, you don’t have the problems, and again, we’ve not
been seeing the problems that I keep hearing about in other states in
Florida – at least not on this point, picture ID. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Mobley. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you
kindly, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To your right, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m
to your right. I have two questions. The first question deals with your
signatures. If I understood you correctly, you said you collected on the
front end as well as the picture ID. My concern and my question would be
number one, sometimes signatures change, and I have a mother that this
has happened to because of a stroke. Her signature would not look like
anything of what it would have looked 20 years ago.</p>

<p id="090:00">
when you might have collected that first signature, how do you deal with
signature changes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Well, we advertise for signature changes, and every
mail-out that comes out of my office has a statement about updating your
signature.  But what we've found out in this process, signatures
actually make the  greatest change to from the, say, an 18 year old
voter to when they become a professional.  Those that are registered to
vote as a high school senior, our signatures do not look anything like
they looked like when we were a high school senior.  They change
dramatically in that first 10 years.  They don't change dramatically
after that.  And Florida will accept any mark.  You don't have to be
able to sign.  If you have someone, for example, and this is a common
question, I get calls from children all the time, My parent can't sign
anything, what can we do?  Well, you can put a pen in their hand, and
they can put a dot on that form.  We'll accept that dot as the legal
signature of that citizen for all elections. But the issue is getting
the information out to them that you have to do this signature update.
That you can't, that power of attorney for example, is illegal in
Florida, so children cannot sign for a parent's ballot.  These are
things that you have to educate the voters to.  And we'll accept any
kind of a mark, as long as it's in that individuals own handwriting, so
they don't have to worry about then kind of mark that they get.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, sir.  Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes Mame, you're recognized, but before you are, please
yield for just one moment, Representative.  The speaker has asked me to
announce that the House will not reconvene until 3:15.  That will allow
us time to complete this, and we're going to add one additional speaker
when these remarks are concluded.  Representative, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.  The other one is with regards to the
picture, and I can only assume that you do the same thing or advertise
for updated pictures.  However, sometimes our pictures change because of
age, because of accidents, burns or whatever that disfigure us from time
to time.  How do you deal with that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Well again, under Florida law, you don't actually have
to have a picture ID to have a ballot to count.  If you come in, and I
have an attorney for example, a civil rights attorney, very prominent in
my community who says it is illegal and un-American for you to require
me to show ID to vote.  We give them a provisional ballot every
election, they mark the provisional ballot, it comes back to my office,
my staff has 48 hours to go into the database and compare his signature
on that provisional ballot with his signature on his voter registration
form.  It checks, his ballot counts every time.  So an individual who is
not capable of showing a picture ID, is not barred from casting a vote
that will be counted in any election.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Michaux?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me be sure that I'm clear
on what I'm hearing.  You require voter ID, but you really don't need it
to vote.  Is that because if you go to the polls, and you've forgotten
your ID, you can still vote by provisional ballot, and you don't have to
come back, because you have the data with which to check that with?  Is
that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]That is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Follow up, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Let me ask you this about the database, a little bit
more on that.  You use Harvard money, as I understand it, to build that
database that now encompasses all of Florida, and you can use that
database to check, at the station, signatures for instance, of the
person who doesn't have a photo ID.  Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes, sir.  I could grab the signature of the voter in
any of the 67 counties in the State of Florida at any time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Alright.  Let me follow up, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Let me ask you this about voter fraud.  Have you had
any voter fraud since this, and how does that voter fraud correlate, or
relate itself to absentee voting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Well, let me be sort of specific here, because as an
election official, voter fraud means nothing to me.  There is election
fraud, and there are election frauds.  Candidates commit election fraud
all the time.  Individuals collecting candidate petitions seeking to be
candidates, collect fraud.  We know of those cases.  In-person voter
impersonation</p>

fraud we don't know of those cases. We'd see almost none of that. We do
see and there's been some major effort looking at efforts by citizens to
manipulate the system. Our residences and we have right now prosecutions
occurring across the state of Florida. They're all related to two areas,
absentee ballots and individuals manufacturing fraudulent voter
registrations so they get paid by their companies for doing work on a
fraudulent bases. Those two kinds of ongoing criminality we see on a
regular basis in elections. But not individuals bringing fraudulent ids
to vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir you're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, one of, going to the area of early voting, as I
understand it you all, you in Florida initially had 45 days early
voting, No I'm sorry you had 21 days early voting. I'm thinking of
Georgia.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually we only had 14 days.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You only had 14.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And that was cut back to what?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] 8.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And what was your experience with that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It was a nightmare in that the same type of people,
the same people and we tracked this, we've been doing early voting in
Leon County since 1994. We actually have maps set which every identifies
every household of every early voter so we can identify where that
location needs to be placed. And early voting really is in my opinion
the safest form on voting in the state of Florida currently. Because it
is, unlike the precincts, all early voting sites are live wired directly
to the databases to the counties. That way we can actually do the
instant updates that we can not due unless your're using electronic poll
books at the precinct. So we like early voting. Early voting has been
the way that we can accommodate the huge numbers of citizens who are now
in Florida sort of trained to vote. We really got into early voting in
Leon County in 1994 when we had an 82% turnout in that presidential race
in 92. And I had two hour lines in the precincts and I realized that on
my pushing voter registration and I don't have enough precincts for them
to vote at that I'm looking at a disaster. And so we started using early
voting as a way to deal with these large turnouts and not add any more
precincts. And the entire state of Florida has gone in that in that in
that direction.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One final and I want to go back to the and I say this
particularly for North Carolina to hear, the HAVA money, you all took
advantage of all that money that came from the feds that which they, by
the way Mr. Chairman they still owe us if we can still get it. But that
was what helped you build that database.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And what built it? Now, Now it comes at a cost.  When
we got the HAVA money the states were able to parse it out any way they
want to because HAVA did not mandate how the state plans would be
formulated. The state of Florida decided it would recompense all urban
counties those below 100,000 population their new technology at 100%.
For those counties over 100,000 you only got 20¢ on the dollar
recompense because their theory was the local government is urban and
wealthier and they could absorb the costs. So urban areas only got 20%
of the money they needed for voting machines and that rest of that money
became the statewide database money. That was our state's priority build
an integrated system that would make the entire process work well rather
than just technology for counties.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank you sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative. Representative Iler.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Over here sir. Right here, in
front of you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh OK Sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thanks for coming from Florida and presenting this.
Two quick questions. Do you have in early voting do you have same day
registration?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  No sir. Our's 29 day cutoff before and that in terms
of individuals who can not be identified as eligible they have to clear
that up by the 29th day or they're not eligible to cast a vote in the
election.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. Followup. You're recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] On your provisional ballot now in my county which I'm
familiar with and I think the other 99 counties if you vote a
provisional ballot in the wrong precinct but the correct county and that
is counted by the county. So you're saying you've got to be in the right
precinct or can be in the correct county.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Help America Vote Act did not describe any
requirements for provisional ballots leaving it totally to the state and
you're correct if you</p>

cast the ballot in the wrong precinct and you’re an eligible voter and
otherwise eligible to vote for every federal and state office, none of
your votes will count on that ballot. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Conrad. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m right
here. Thank you for coming from Florida; I visit there quite often. I
had a question that addressed… You were talking about your long lines,
particularly in this past election, and your need and enthusiasm for
early voting. Did you not have… I know you did in Leon County and maybe
statewide, quite a number of very long and complex ballot questions,
some really long, and they may even be in that voter guide that you had…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] They are. [SPEAKER CHANGES] … that would make someone
stand and take maybe four or five times longer voting. I’ve read through
some of them myself, and I had to read them two or three times to even
understand the complexity. They’re complex, long questions, so I wanted
to make sure that that information was out there that that contributed
to the long lines that you have. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely.
Absolutely it did. I would say those two reasons led to the long lines –
the longer than average ballot and a shorter than normal time to use
early voting. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
so much, sir. We really do appreciate… I’m sorry, Representative Blust.
Last inquiry. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I have a question. In your system… One
of the things I’ve discovered here is in North Carolina in there are
addresses where there are multiple sets of names listed. I’ve been to
houses knocking on doors where I’ve seen up to five… I’m trying to
remember; maybe six different sets of names – say two Thomases, two
Jones, two Smiths, and those are still validly-registered names at those
addresses. Does your system detect that, and is there some way to
determine when people are no longer… a name of a legally-registered
voter is no longer at an address, and how would your system handle that,
and could you even drop those from the rolls? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
answer is yes. We do follow the federal guidelines, which says that you
cannot remove someone for simply not voting, but what we do in our state
is send out notices to all nonvoters every time, and if they come back
as undeliverable, now they’re going to go into the hold file and after
two general elections, which is four years because congressional
elections are every two years, they will be removed. If there is no
activity, no response, they will be sent a notice and be pulled off of
the list. So it’s not for nonvoting; it’s for failure to respond to a
notice about why aren’t you voting. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Representative Blust, and thank you sir very, very much for your
presentation. Ladies and gentlemen, the Chair is going to add to the
agenda remarks from Dr. William Barber, the President of the North
Carolina NAACP. He will not be here – he is not able to be here next
week when we had planned to receive remarks, so we want to extend to him
the time to speak now. So sir… [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. I appreciate that and we will indeed take care of that on the
10th. Before we adjourn, are there any other inquiries to our guests
from Georgia or from Florida. Not seeing any, please accept on behalf of
the Speaker of the House, the Chairs and all of the members our very
deepest appreciation for your time, and would you please join me in a
round of applause to thank our presenters? The chair thanks each of you
for your time. This committee stands adjourned.</p>
