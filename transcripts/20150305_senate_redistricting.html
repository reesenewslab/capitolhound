and then the second hour describing Senate Bill 181. We will be having
public comments on both of those bills. Members of the committee, today
will mostly be listening. If they have questions that they need
submitted for the next meeting which will be Tuesday the 3/10/15 at 3pm
to 5pm then they would submit it to Miss Churchill. After our presenters
bring forward the bill then we will have staff explain it in detail. The
public comments are going to be for 2 minutes. They should be directing
it to the bill. Personal comments are inappropriate. If there are
questions that need to be sent forward I believe we’re going to be
forwarding it to our clerk, is that correct? Okay.

  Okay, I guess getting the ground rules, ground rules down. Again, there
will be no vote on this today. The vote will likely be on the 10th.
Let&#39;s take up the first bill, which will be Senate bill 36. Senator
Wade, please come forward. Senator Brock makes a motion that we, we have
a proposed committee substitute for Senate bill 36 that we adopted for
discussion. All in favor say aye. Opposed nay. Ayes have it. Senator
Wade, if you&#39;ll be kind enough to briefly describe what&#39;s going
on with Senate bill 36, and then staff will assist with detail. I
believe we&#39;re going to have, be able to put the maps on the screen.
I think there are some public documents in the hands of the public right
now on 36 first and then later, there will be there will be, there will
be some distribution for Senate bill 81. Senator Wade, welcome to the
committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman, members of the committee. Senate bill 36 is a
redistricting of Greensboro city. What it does is it puts first off,
it&#39;s non partisan. It puts the city in seven districts. The citizens
will be in seven districts. The reason for seven districts, it will have
a smaller population and allow that elected official from that district
to be more accountable to the people. Also, it will encourage more
citizens to get involved and run in a smaller area and would keep the
cost down instead of having to run in a larger area. It also make better
geographic diversity of districts, and it encourages people to get out
and represent their neighborhood and community and run for office. Also
this bill extends the terms of the council member from two years to four
years, and to get into the specifics, I think Ms. Churchill, mister
chairman, is going to discuss that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She will go, she will describe the details of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And after that I think there are citizens here to talk on this subject.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I believe and I am trusting that they have already signed up in the,
in the seat sheet to be speaking. Ms. Churchill, would you like to
explain Senate bill 36, Greensboro city council changes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Glad to, I&#39;ll go, would you like for me to go through the bill
section by section?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section one is in two parts. It clarifies that the city of Greensboro
will continue to operate under the council manager form of government
and that that will continue until there is a subsequent act of the
general assembly. Section two of the bill would amend the current
structure of the form of government to have, provide for seven members
of the city council and a mayor. It also establishes seven new
districts. Those districts, the description in writing that starts on
page one, line 20 and goes through page 9, line 38. And once we get the
screens working, we&#39;ll be able to see the map on the screen.
Sections three and four change the powers and duties of the mayor of
Greensboro to provide that the mayor will vote only in the case of a tie
amongst the city council members and the mayor will have a vote in the
consideration of the employment, discipline, or dismissal of the city
manager or the city attorney. Section five of the bill would place the
city of Greensboro under the election and runoff method of determining
elections for the city council, and all this would be effective when it
becomes law, which means it would apply to the 2015 elections. Yes, sir.
In the packets from, on the members&#39; desk, there is a hard copy of
the map and the statistical analysis of the districts that would be
imposed upon the city of Greensboro, the city of Greensboro, sorry. At
this point in time, I don&#39;t think we made enough copies for everyone
in the public. Ms. Mangum will be posting the map and the stats to the
committee&#39;s website this afternoon, so they will be available to the
public.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And, and that would be under the

  we are to influence events. This current system does concentrate
political power. We do not elect state senators and we do not elect
house representatives in the state of North Carolina on a statewide,
at-large basis. We do that for a very specific reason. There should be
no difference between that and a county and a municipality. After all,
there is no city or county constitution that protects the citizens&#39;
rights. Those powers are inherent in the state government where there is
a state constitution and that is the rightful place for this power to be
attributed, and so therefore it is within the purview of this body,
then, to affect this change. It is within the law. Our seven districts
in ??, the proper answer, that perhaps can be debated but leaving a
system in place that empowers at-large majorities to concentrate power
and to effectively eliminate the voice of the rest of the population
needs to changed. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. Julie Peeples coming forward, Jim Saintsing on deck.
Identify yourself, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Julie Peeples, I am from Greensboro. I&#39;ve lived there 24 years and I
am also a pastor in Greensboro, and I appreciate this opportunity to
address you all. I have a letter that Mayor Vaughan, the current mayor
of Greensboro, has asked me to share, &quot;Members of the Senate
Committee on Redistricting, my name is Nancy Vaughan and I am the Mayor
of Greensboro. I regret I am unable to attend today&#39;s redistricting
committee meeting due to a longstanding prior commitment. I would like
to voice my personal, strong opposition to Senate Bill 36. It is
important to recognize this bill was not requested as part of our
legislative agenda, in fact the Greensboro City Council passed a
resolution in opposition to Senate Bill 36 and in support of a public
referendum, nor was it requested by the community at-large. It is a
local bill that lacks local support. Currently, the city council
includes five district representatives, three at-large, and a mayor, the
5-3-1 format. The newly proposed configuration consists of a seven
district representatives and a mayor who would have very limited voting
privileges. The 5-3-1 system gives all voters greater representation.
The beauty of this system is it allows every voter the opportunity to
vote for a majority of the city council. That is a powerful tool when
residents bring matters and concerns before the council. It&#39;s
empowering. It inspires the council to work together to find the best
solution for the common good. It has been stated the motivation to
change the structure has been linked to a desire for council to be more
business-minded. Truth be told, we are business friendly council in
dealing with very difficult circumstances. Changing our council
structure will not make these disappear. This is a distraction. While we
do not dispute that the city derives its power from the state,
shouldn&#39;t there be some accountability to the voters of Greensboro?
This is a local bill and should have more input. I would ask that any
changes to our council structure be approved by a public referendum by
the people it would affect the most. Thank you for your service to our
state.&quot; And I would also want to remind us of Article one, Section
two of the state constitution, that all power derives from the people.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Ma&#39;am. We&#39;ll have Jim Saintsing, and on deck Goldie
Wells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. My name is Jim Saintsing, I have been a resident of
Greensboro for almost 30 years and I oppose this bill. The greatest
concern to me in this bill is that it eliminates the local option under
chapter 160A, Article five, part four. This part of the general statute
gives all the cities and towns in North Carolina the right to determine
their form of local government, within limits. It also gives them the
right to change that form of government if they choose to do so. Section
1B of the bill, originally, provided for outright repeal of that part of
the general statutes. The version that I see now cleans this language up
a little bit but as I read it, it still prohibits the city of Greensboro
from altering or amending its own form of government. So the question
arises, why is Greensboro being singled out for this treatment?
There&#39;s no reasonable answer. Whatever the merits of the proposed
changes to the form of government elsewhere in the bill, we in
Greensboro should have the right provided in the statutes and granted to
all the other cities and towns in North Carolina to change the form of
government as the people desire it. So, taking away this right is a
denial of equal protection and it&#39;s unfair to Greensboro

  And it really doesn’t make sense so I urge you not to recommend the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. We have Goldie Wells coming up and
Willie Taylor on deck. [SPEAKER CHANGES] My name is Goldie Francis Wells
and I am a resident of Greensboro, NC and I am a former City Council
person for Greensboro. I have a specific concern. I served with
district, as a representative for District 2 in Greensboro and under
Senate Bill 36 our current, in the current plan, North Carolina A and T
is surrounded by the neighborhoods and precincts Geo 1, 67 and 68 and
they are all assigned and have been assigned to District 2. The A and T
community’s three precincts on that would be split into District 1, 2
and 7 in the current plan, Bennett College and its surrounding
neighborhoods, Precincts 69 and 70 are both assigned to District 2 along
with A and T, their fellow historic black college in Greensboro. In
Senate Bill 36, Bennett College community is split between 7 and 1. In
the current plan Northeast Greensboro, Precincts Minor 1 and Minor 2 are
now in District 2, they would be assigned to Districts 2 and 3. I’m
really concerned about the split. I feel that the whole redistricting
plan is a plan that will dilute the power of the African-American
community. We are presented with three minority majority districts,
however it gives an advantage with only 29, no, I’m sorry, 19% of
registered voters of a specific party. If this new plan comes in they
will have 42% on the council, so I’m really concerned about the
splitting of these districts. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for
being here. I have Willie Taylor coming up and Tony Wilkens on deck.
Please identify yourself. [SPEAKER CHANGES] My name is Willie Taylor. I
have lived in Greensboro for about 45 years and for the past 15-20 years
I’ve been very active in local city government. I have actually run for
the city council. I ask really why Greensboro? To my knowledge there is
not another city in North Carolina who has been redistricted and their
government composition changed as this bill would do for Greensboro. We
have approximately 300,000 people in Greensboro. I read the paper every
day, letters to the editor, I’ve been to all the City Council meetings.
I was there when the [??] delegation came and I can only identify some
8-10 people out of the 300,000, approximately 300,000, who support this
bill. At the City Council meeting this past Tuesday night, one of our
members, an attorney I might add, commented that should this bill pass
that it would almost, he could almost guarantee that it would go into
litigation. As a resident of Greensboro, and a resident of Greensboro, a
city I love and a state I love, I really find it most unnecessary as a
taxpayer to have to pay legal fees for a bill the vast majority of our
citizens don’t want. I respect you. I respect your position and what
you’re doing. Please, if the bill is not thrown out, give us an
opportunity for a referendum. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
very much. Tony Wilkens is next, Ellen Weiner is on deck. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of committee. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Identify yourself. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Tony Wilkens and I
currently serve on the Greensboro City Council. You’ve got the new map
up here and I’ve got the current map here that I wanna share some
statistics with. This current 5-3-1 system was twice voted down by
referendum and was enacted by a City Council a little over 30 years ago.

  This current system would allow 5 members, which is a majority. That’s
the magic number, to reside in the same district. Even currently we have
a majority living in two districts. Another concern is an area about 2
miles, a 2 mile circle in this area right here we have five members of
our counsel living in that little 2 mile circle. Consequently taxpayer
funded projects on the outside of the power loop are delayed fairly
regularly. We’ve waited 10 years to get a park in district 5 that I
represent. The new system that you have I think is a more fair
representation of, and I believe it would lead to a more fair
distribution of the tax funded projects. In the new 7 district system
there are 3 districts that are not represented at all right now, which
represents 42% of Greensboro, so I am here to speak in favor of the new
7 district plan. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Thank you for
being here. Ellen Weiner is next on deck. Emily Seawell. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Hello, my name is Ellen Weiner. I’m a resident of Greensboro.
This is new to me. I’ve never gotten in the car to come to Raleigh
before to speak to a committee. I have Senator Wade and I understand
Senator Krawiec from Forsyth County to thank for this. I’m coming
because I want to speak against this. I have two reasons. You all don’t
live in Greensboro and you need to know, I see this as sneaky and as
undemocratic. You need to know the sneaky part. We woke up reading in
the paper about this bill. We had no idea as Greensboro residents that
it was in the works. There had been no community conversations. There
has been no citizen input. I look at these maps that Senator Wade says
are non-partisan, who drew them? I don’t know who drew them. We citizens
had no impact on this, so you need to know that, that this was sprung on
us and that’s one reason we’re here. It’s just not the republican way. I
just don’t see it. Secondly, now Senator Wade has given you, you have
more say in my city counsel makeup now than I do. You have the right to
vote on it. I have no right. That’s not democratic. If you lived in
Greensboro, you would know that right now I had the chance to vote for 5
people on the city council. I have district representation, 3 at large
and the mayor, so I have 5 people that need my vote. With this system
right now it’ll shrink to 2 people and the mayor. We won’t even have a
vote on anything to say. The third thing is if this is right, why do you
have to repeal a part of our state constitution to take away
Greensboro’s rights to self-government. That’s a serious thing, and
finally, please, if you’re gonna do it, we need a referendum. Let us
have a voice. Thank you for hearing our comments. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. Emily Seawell is next and Tom Coruthers is on deck.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good afternoon, my name is Emily Seawell. I’m with the
Southern Coalition for Social Justice and I’m also a Greensboro resident
and a student at [??] Law School in Greensboro. We’re here in opposition
to Senate Bill 36. I have 4 points to make today. First, under the
current plan the deviations are just under 4%. The new plan would
increase those deviations to just under 10%. That’s more than double and
there’s no discernable justification that’s been given for that
increase. Second, these districts are not compacted visually on the map
or mathematically. Third, this bill would break up many strong
communities of interest as council member Wells said in addition to
breaking up the historically black Bennett College and North Carolina
AMT communities, it would break up UNCG from its surrounding
neighborhoods as well as Guilford College from its surrounding
neighborhoods. It breaks up Northeast Greensboro as you can see on the
map and it would also break up two historic neighborhoods just outside
of downtown, Fisher Park and Irving Park that have historically voted
together and been governed together. Fourth and maybe most troubling in
the long term, this bill would repeal part four of article 5 of chapter
168 of the general statutes with respect to the Greensboro City Council.
That means that the Greensboro City Council, unlike almost all other
municipalities in the state, would no longer be able to change its form
of government. As former Mayor Knight said, we’re the

  Third largest city in the state and we wouldn&#39;t be able to change
form of government. So in conclusion, I&#39;d like to restate my
opposition to SB36 both on behalf of the Southern Coalition for Social
Justice and on my own behalf as a Greensboro resident and university
student. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. Mr. Carruthers is next. Please identify yourself
and Darrel Baskerville is on deck. Senator Rucho, Senator Wade, and
members of the committee, my name is Tom Carruthers. I&#39;m the City
Attorney for the City of Greensboro and my remarks here are on behalf of
the elected body along with the remarks of our Council Member Tony
Wilkins, who I&#39;m pleased to see in the attendance today. Senator
Wade, we extend our warm wishes and congratulations to you and thank you
for your many efforts on behalf of the City of Greensboro. We still
consider you one of our own and on those small matters on which we
disagree from time to time, we disagree as friends. However, Senate Bill
36 is one of those matters which we disagree. The City Council of
Greensboro opposes the seven district division of our city. Since 1983
our city has operated under a five district, three at large, one mayor
system. It has proven very effective as a vehicle to allow our citizens
both to cooperate and to compete toward the greater good and it is
something that has seen widespread support over the last three weeks in
almost unanimous interest in those expressing to the City Council their
desire to keep this the same. In addition, we question why Section 1B
would remove from our City Council the right to self-determination. This
has been provided to all municipal governments since 1969 by the General
Assembly and we wish to maintain this right as well. And finally, we are
here to urge referendum. Our Council voted unanimously to have these
changes, these proposed changes placed to referendum of the voters. We
would point out that that is exactly the right given to our sister city
in High Point when its year of election was recently changed by this
assembly. We urge you to consider strongly this referendum and we hope
you find that request compelling. In closing, I also offer up our two
resolutions adopted in the last thirty days from our City Council in
opposition and would like to offer them if there is interest.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Please give that to the Sergeant at Arms before you go and
he&#39;ll provide us. Thanks for speaking. Moving on to Baskerville is
next and then I hope I&#39;m correct, I can&#39;t read the writing,
Emily Brown is on deck.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good afternoon, members of the committee. My name is Darrel Baskerville.
I&#39;m a resident of Greensboro. I am one of the young folks out of our
city and I&#39;m very happy to be here. I&#39;m founder of a grassroots
organization named Greensboro For Justice. Greensboro For Justice works
with young folks and college folks in our town. Greensboro has a
beautiful advantage of having five institutions of higher learning in
the downtown area and it&#39;s a tough job to try to get young folks
interested in government when there&#39;s a big mistrust of government
right now. In the minds of young folks, they begin to see similarities
in how the over-militarization of police is working, they kind of see
that connection in tandem with government. And so as a young person, I
see this Bill as a challenge to get young people to kind of understand
and again to trust government and the patterns of government. I carry
with me today the voice of the residents of Greensboro, our full City
Council, I would just like to point out minus Council Member Tony
Wilkins, who I was surprised to hear that supports the Bill even though
he sits on our Council in Greensboro in opposition. And like they said,
our Council just unanimously voted for referendum. But I also carry the
votes of both the Republicans, I’m sorry, the members of our General
Assembly from both chambers in saying that we do not support it and if a
change is going to come to Greensboro, it should come from the residents
of Greensboro. I&#39;ve got 20 seconds here, okay. So Senate Bill 36 is
a dangerous Bill for Greensboro residents and a nail in the coffin of
Democracy. Senator Wade, you have targeted Greensboro for a party
strategy that ferociously seeks to disenfranchise residents and our
local resident officials from the decision-making process of how our
city should be ran. Representative Cecil Brockman explains this is
nothing more than a partisan party grab and a state level overreach into
a local matter. Senator Wade is attempting to rig the game in her favor
because her party lacks the ability to win seats in Greensboro. Thank
you very much.

  Senate Bill 36 would give the African American community an opportunity
to gain one additional seat on the City Council which would be three
seats out of seven districts not including the mayor. The current system
only guarantees two seats out of nine including the mayor as a voting
member. The current system for electing City Council members in
Greenboro has been in place for 33 years and has not been adjusted or
modified to adapt for the changes in demographics in Greensboro since
that time. When this system was adopted in 1982 the African American
community consisted of approximated 25% of the population of Greensboro.
I ask that you consider the adoption of this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. We have Ceclia Parker coming forward, Robbie
Perkins on deck. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and
committee members. My name is Ceclia Parker and I reside in Greensboro.
With the current districting there is simply an unbalance in
representation within our community. Out of nine city council members,
five of the members reside within one district, District 3 according to
the new map. With the current redistricting, those currently
unrepresented districts have an opportunity to gain representation and
have a voice, giving equal representation among black, white and other
citizens, therefore I am in support of the redistricting proposal,
Senate Bill 36. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. Robbie
Perkins is up, Theresa Pickett on deck. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho,
members of the committee, my name is Robbie Perkins and for 18 of the
last 21 years I served as a district councilperson from Greensboro, an
at large councilperson from Greensboro and from 2011-2013 as the mayor
of the city of Greensboro and I am here to support this bill. I’m here
to support this bill because if you took the proposal that Senator Wade
has before you and were incorporating a city this would be a strong
model of government because it gives all of the people all over the city
a representative that they can reach out and touch. I think we’ve gotten
comfortable with the current system in Greensboro and that level of
comfort is evidenced by the way our at large folks are elected. They’re,
everyone files for at large is cut down to six and then all of our
citizens have three votes and all of them can vote once, twice or three
times. No one is competing against each other and the issues aren’t
clearly defined. I think it’s time for a change. I would prefer a mayor
with a voter veto and I strongly endorse the 4 year term concept. Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, and I should’ve said, I think it’s
Thesa Picket, sorry, and then on deck, Marshall Beckett. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Hello, my name is Thesa Picket and I’m a citizen of Guilford
County. I’m also a part of several boards. I’ve served on the commission
of status of women subcommittees and several other boards in Guilford
County. I stand in favor of the Senate Bill 36 even though the process
has been deemed as largely non-democratic, however I agree that greater
representation amongst its citizens is needed. Senate Bill 36 will
provide this much needed opportunity. The current district structure
concentrates representation within Northwest Greensboro which in my
opinion is unjust. The system has been in place for over 30 years. The
current system was created when African Americans consisted of 25% of
the population and currently now consist of 42% of the population. With
this being said there is a need, with this being said there has been a
consistent challenge for the African American community to gain full
support and votes for our projects due to the concentration of
representation under the current representation. There has been public
and private conversation as well as dialogue and I think it is fair to
say the common suggestion for this bill would be to have 2 year terms
versus 4 year terms and to give the mayor voting power versus veto
power. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. Marshall
Bennett next, Bill Infrick on deck. [SPEAKER CHANGES] My name is

  36 should not become law. Article one, section two of the North Carolina
Constitution states that &quot;all political power is vested in and
derived from the people. All government of right originates from the
people and is founded upon their will only and is instituted solely for
the good of the whole.&quot; How can government be derived from the
people if it is imposed on them by members of the General Assembly, most
of whom do not represent the citizens of Greensboro. This is a local
issue, not a state one. Let the people of Greensboro choose their own
system of government. Governor McCrory said on Tuesday that, and I
quote, &quot;As Governor, I constantly have to fight Washington not to
interfere. I think the same philosophy applies to Raleigh interfering
with local governments.&quot; While I am opposed to the contents of the
bill itself, such as the elimination of at-large council seats and the
removal of the mayor&#39;s voting powers, I believe this bill should die
simply on the principle that it does not give the people of Greensboro a
choice. If this bill passes, who knows which city will be next? Maybe
yours. Please respect the democratic right of the people of Greensboro
to choose their own system of government. Please kill Bill SB36. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. Dillon Frick next, Tim Morlin on deck.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hope you all are doing well. My name is Dillon Frick, proud resident of
Greensboro, proud student, UNCG. My friend Marcel and I actually had to
miss a civil liberties class this afternoon to come here, but our
professor said that coming here is a better way to teach us about
upholding our own civil liberties than class. I feel that if everyone in
this room had taken a civil liberties class we would not be having this
meeting today. I&#39;ll begin with a quote from Trudy Wade in 2012,
&quot;I believe that government is a threat to personal freedom and
individual liberty,&quot; I couldn&#39;t agree more, &quot;therefore I
will attempt to reduce the power and influence of politicians and
bureaucrats in order to maximize the freedom of the people of North
Carolina.&quot; Senate Bill 36 is a threat to our personal freedom and
our liberties. What&#39;s insulting is that a bill that is designed off
the request of one businessman is trumping the will of over 279,000
residents of Greensboro. What&#39;s even more ironic to me is that this
fight is being led by the very individuals that were elected of the
tenets of believing in small government. When today, and the last few
weeks, these people, like Ms. Wade, have stood to infringe on the rights
of our local government and our local politics to control our own
elections and the way that we rule our city. The only reasoning for this
bill is to limit the power and the voice of democrats, regardless of
anyone&#39;s political affiliation, it&#39;s evident. No one is ignorant
enough to think this bill encourages a non-partisan system or
doesn&#39;t advance the will of one party, the party of Ms. Wade, the
party of Mr. Knight, the Party of Mr. Perkins. Senators, I ask that you
let Greensboro govern our own city. The will of the people is evident,
we did not vote Robbie Perkins back in to office, we did not vote Trudy
Wade back in to office, and we stand against 36. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. Tim Morlin, on deck, Chuck Winfrey.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good afternoon, members of the committee. There are several things that
I could get up here and talk about-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could you identify yourself, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m sorry, my name is Tim Morlin. I reside in Greensboro, North
Carolina, indeed I have for almost all of my life. There are many
different things that I could talk about that I see as wrong with this
bill but I figured just to start off I would take the map that&#39;s
projected up here for everyone to see. One of the basic premises of the
need for SB36 is the fact that we don&#39;t have adequate representation
from people within our neighborhoods. District four makes no sense, it
squiggles around the city. District seven goes from the northeastern
part of the city down to the southern part, encompassing downtown.
It&#39;s completely arbitrary. In fact, none of us in this room here
that I know of have heard from Senator Wade or anyone else why the map
looks the way that it does. But beyond that, the map is not the biggest
problem here. The biggest problem, that others have eluded to today, is
that we have not been given a voice. Last month we had a meeting of the
Guilford County Delegation, and I would point out that we had about 200
citizens of Greensboro in attendance, and just as my rough estimation I
would say that 90% of the speakers that night were in stark opposition
to this bill. The point is, our voices have not been heard and if it
does indeed come to pass, we have to have a referendum on this matter.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. And this is our last speaker

  on this bill Mr. Winfrey.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Chuck
Winfrey I am a native and resident of Greensboro North Carolina and a
former member of your state board of elections. During that time I had
the chance to observe the effect that financial pressures on candidates
can have on the political process. To that end I believe that Senator
Wade&#39;s bill reduces the financial pressure on candidates in several
ways. First off increases the terms from two years to four years. That
allows the candidates to spend less time fund raising and more time
actually governing. It reduces the expense associated with an at large
race. The at large city council races are the most expensive races that
are on the ballot. And by reducing that need for fund raising I think
that may also reduce the demands on the candidates and office holders.
And thirdly it decreases the size of each district. So each district
will have roughly one seventh of the population of the city. The current
system each district has one fifth of the population of the city. And
that in my opinion may lower the threshold for the financial pressures
on each candidate. One might question how the district is drawn, I
don&#39;t know how the districts were arrived at. I support the plan, I
do share Mr. Sansings concerns about the elimination of the local option
in revising it so I would suggest as a possible improvement to make that
a sunset provision. Say that provision not apply for some number of
years say ten years after which time the city could in fact reorganize
itself any way it wanted. So again I want to thank Senator Wade for her
efforts and actually bringing to the public&#39;s attention the fact
that the system that we have now is not set in stone. Thank you very
much.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you very much ladies and gentleman of the committee and all in the
audience that concludes the public comment on senate bill thirty six for
today. If there are some questions by committee members I would ask you
prior to the next meeting to forward it to our staff and by the way I
was remiss in not saying thank you again for our ?? staff. Some of the
most able people we have in the general assembly working with us to
allow us to move forward on this legislation. Miss Churchill will there
be something that will be distributed for
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes sir we&#39;re in the process of making copies of a single sheet of
paper that will have the website and e-mail address for anyone that
wants to access the documents that were passed out and committee members
today. Anyone that wants to sign up to speak on Tuesday the tenth and
anyone that wants to submit written comment to the committee clerk.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
There will be limited discussion on Tuesday in regards to debate because
the committee members will be the ones needing to debate this issue at
length. And I will say to you that there is sign up so we&#39;re going
to move forward onto senate bill one eighty one and I&#39;ll ask, which
is Wake county, I&#39;ll ask senator Barefoot to come forward. Give a
description and as we did earlier have staff describe the legislation to
you the committee members and the audience and then we&#39;ll open it up
for public comment. Senator Barefoot welcome to the re-districting
committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Just hold one second while the noise is there leaving.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Chair can I ask one question please?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator McKissick what is it relevant to?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Procedural question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Procedural?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes. Simply I take it what we&#39;re doing today is receiving simply
public comments on both bills but there won&#39;t be any committee
discussion or opportunity for question? Is that procedurally
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Today there will be no discussion at this point. We&#39;ll look at it
but I don&#39;t suspect we&#39;ll have any discussion primarily because
we are trying to gather information. But the next meeting we will have
full unopened debate on it. But you can come from a base of knowledge
after gathering information today on both bills.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
One quick Mr. Chair if I could.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I know I heard some unreadiness among those in Wake county because they
did not know this was going to be on the calender today. I know the
folks in Greensboro were very much aware.

  here, in Section 1B the individuals who serve districts 4, 5, and 6.
Their seats are up for election this year. They would run again in the
exact same districts as they ran in in 2014 to serve a two-year term.
And in addition, in 2016, there would be two individuals that ran--that
resided and ran in the lettered districts that are currently going to be
used for the Wake County Board of Education. In the map that you have on
the screen and in your packets, those are the A and B. We could not
figure out a great way to depict that, so we tried our best.

Miss Churchill, when you say &quot;this year,&quot; you mean the 2016
elections?
SPEAKER CHANGES
Yes sir, I mean the 2016 elections.
SPEAKER CHANGES
So we&#39;ll be clear about that to members of the committee.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Then in 2018, the scheme will be completely implemented, and in
2018--let me back up. The two individuals that would be serving in the
lettered districts would be elected in 2016 to serve a four-year term,
meaning they would be up for election again in 2020. In 2018, the seven
members that would be up for election, meaning the three that ran in
2016 for a two-year term and the four who are currently who were elected
in 2014 would all run at the same time under the numbered districts that
are currently used for the Wake County Board of Education, and they
would be elected to a four-year term. Then Section 2 of the bill would
limit the ability of Wake County to redraw the maps until after the 2020
census.
SPEAKER CHANGES
That concludes your explanation of the bill, alright? Very fine, thank
you. As we did with the previous bill, Senate Bill 181, Wake County, we
will--I have nine speakers have signed up, and they will have two
minutes to discuss their thoughts about Senate Bill 181. Again, our
Sergeant-at-Arms will be there to show everyone the time, 20 second
warning, and then you&#39;ll see the red &quot;stop,&quot; which we
would hope that everybody would comply with. First speaker, Frances
George, on deck, J.T. Knott Jr. Please identify yourself.
SPEAKER CHANGES
My name is Frances George, and I grew up in eastern Wake County on a
farm. I now live in the city of Raleigh just a few miles from this
building. Life is different, depending on where you  live in the county.
I know, I&#39;ve lived in both parts. However, there are still many men
and women who live in rural Wake County, men and women who live and work
on their family farms, in their small family businesses, and in small
towns throughout the county. They do not live in Raleigh, they do not
even work in Raleigh, some of them. Their experience is different. After
the most recent election, I was astounded as Senator Barefoot just told
us, that five of the seven commissioners live within a 15-mile radius
within the city of Raleigh, and that 70% of the towns in Wake County
don&#39;t have a single representative on the county commissioner board.
I know from my life experience in rural Wake County and in the city of
Raleigh that everybody needs a voice. They need direct representation,
and that&#39;s why I&#39;m here today. There are property owners in
these rural regions who live on a single small lot, like many of us here
in Raleigh. Some have ten acres, but there are many who have hundreds of
acres in farmland, and these citizens need a voice on the board. The
board needs the expertise and the wisdom of those who understand rural
Wake County because they live there. They need to know how county
property tax increases, county land development regulations affect large
land owners differently than those that live in the city of Raleigh and
have never managed or farmed or developed tracts of land privately. One
size fits all does not work. Each district and each small town needs a
voice on the board from people who actually live and vote in each
district only. Voted for by the district only, by those who live in the
district only. Senator Barefoot&#39;s proposed legislation does just
that. This legislation will give direct representation, accurately
reflecting the entire county, and one that truly represents all regions
of our county--those who live and work in Raleigh, and those who live
and work in the rural districts of our great county. Thank you, I stand
in favor of Senate Bill 181.
SPEAKER CHANGES
Thank you very much. J.T. Knott Jr. is next, and on deck, David Kosar.

infantry combat. I was wounded, received the Purple Heart, came back to
Wake County. For 12 years of my life, I was honored and had the
privilege of serving as a Wake County Commissioner, from 1970 to 1982. I
truly believe Wake County is the garden spot of the world, and this bill
that’s before you, that’s put to you by Senator Barefoot will . . . has
the means to keep it that way.
Senator Barefoot’s bill is a way to give power back to its citizens.
Senator Barefoot’s bill gives each County Commissioner direct authority
to be responsible for a portion of Wake County. Senator Barefoot’s bill
provides citizens from each district an opportunity to elect a County
Commissioner to be their voice in their district of the county. The
opportunity to elect their representative with no one else involved,
makes Wake County Commissioners responsible to over a million people.
Thank you.
Speaker Change: Thank you, Mr. Knot,  David Cosart next, Rachel Pear on
deck.
Speaker Change: Good afternoon, my name is David Cosart. I’m a lifelong
resident of eastern Wake County.  I currently reside in Wendell and I’ve
been there for the last 30 years. I have experience in . . . over 30
years of experience . . . in process management and in large
enterprises, and I support Senator Barefoot’s bill because I believe
this is a better process. It’s a better process because it brings . . .
it will allow us to have more accountability between our County
Commissioners and the residents of eastern Wake County. Wake County is
very diverse, with over a million residents, and it encompasses around
800 plus square acres of area. There’s a large difference between
Wendell and Morrisville. I live in Wendell and I work in Morrisville, so
I know. We need representation from eastern Wake County that will be
accountable to us, so we need the geographic diversity that is outlined
in the bill and I would appreciate your support.
Speaker Change: Thank you very much. Rachel Pear is next, James West on
deck.
Speaker Change: My name is Rachel Pear and I live in eastern Wake County
in the Knightdale community. Thank you, Mr Chairman and the members of
the committee, for allowing me to come and speak in favor of Senate Bill
181. I was born in the city of Raleigh when the population was 40,000,
so, needless to say, I have seen monumental changes take place. But,
those changes are not restricted to the city of Raleigh. There are 12
municipalities in Wake County, and all of those municipalities and the
communities surrounding them have experienced the same dramatic growth
that Raleigh has, along with the benefit and the problems that come with
that kind of growth. But fortunately, these towns and communities have
been successful in maintaining their identity, which is a good thing.
But, when people lose confidence in their elected officials that’s not a
good thing. So it . . . common sense tells me that this bill is almost a
no-brainer. We need to have representative.

  ...goals. Those goals include representing the people, and making
quality decisions that represent those people. To satisfy those goals,
one word comes to mind: that word is diversity. I believe it is time to
move beyond the D&#39;s and the R&#39;s, to think about the diversity
that the bodies are making these decisions, and from that perspective,
the Wake County Commission represents the highest level of diversity
that I can even possibly remember. In terms of age, income, gender,
color, income, and life experiences this Wake County Commission is as
diverse as we&#39;ve ever had, truly representing the people of Wake
County. To that end I believe we satisfy the goals that we share in
common. If you are concerned about the representation that we now have 1
million people in Wake County, I would ask that you consider adding a
couple of representatives to our board even though, let me remind this
body that, there are counties in North Carolina of which a Senator does
not even live such as in Franklin County. Senators, I believe that this
is a solution looking for a problem, and I ask you to vote against
Senate Bill 181. Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. John Burns next. Matt Calabria on deck.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senators, my name is John Burns. I was elected
in November of 2014 as a Wake County Commissioner. I was elected by
171,000 votes in Wake Country - from all across Wake County from Zebulon
and Lindell all the way to Holly Springs. From Wake Forest all the way
to Garner, and yes, including the city of Raleigh. I&#39;m here to
oppose this bill. I&#39;m here to oppose this bill because it&#39;s
unneeded. We are working very hard, Senator, on the Wake County
Commission to have a collaborative process to work on what this county
needs. We are working with the business community, we are working with
rural and urban, Republican and Democrat alike. We&#39;re working on
transit issues. We&#39;re working on human services delivery. We&#39;re
working on ways to make this government more responsive to its people,
something this body should consider doing. Senator Rucho, I&#39;ve heard
all the justifications for this bill: Not one of them is accurate,
Senator. A 15 mile radius encompasses 706 square miles. That&#39;s about
100 square miles less than the entire Wake County.  We have a
residential district scheme. We must live in our districts to represent
them. I was elected under the same scheme that elected my predecessor,
Mr. Coble, who worked very hard for this county. I have appointed
Republicans. I have appointed rural and urban residents alike to the
boards that do the business of this county, and I ask you to allow the
people of Wake County to continue to govern themselves because we&#39;re
doing a darn good job of it. This is the place the people want to be.
This is the economic engine of this state, and the more it is messed
with with on high the more at risk you put those benefits. Now, I
apologize for my attire, I found out about this hearing as I was on my
way to a very important meeting at the Belk Arena at Davidson College,
but I turned around and came back to speak to this issue less than 24
hours after this bill was submitted. This bill is a wrong bill. Add a
member. Add two members, that&#39;s fine, I&#39;ll work with anybody.
I&#39;m looking forward to working with everybody, including the members
in this room. We have a lot of work to do. This is NOT want needs to be
done. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Mr. Calabria, you will be our last speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, I&#39;m Matt Calabria, I&#39;m a Wake
County Commissioner. I live in Fuquay-Varina, far from downtown Raleigh.
I represent Fuquay-Varina, Holly Springs, and Garner, and all other
municipalities in Wake County. I urge opposition to this bill because it
doesn&#39;t reflect the will of Wake County&#39;s citizens. First, it
seeks to gerrymander the districts for partisan purposes. Second,
it&#39;ss been a rushed process, and we&#39;ve failed to be able to
weigh in in the way that we ought to be able to weigh in on such an
important bill. Third, it seeks to override local government, the
government closest to the people. This bill doesn&#39;t achieve goals it
purports to achieve with the respect to the financing piece and the
fundraising piece. Certainly I appreciate Senator Barefoot&#39;s
attempts to make my fundraising life easier, but we know that the size
of the district does not correlate with the amount of money that has to
be raised to win an election as Senator Barefoot&#39;s and many other
General Assembly elections certainly demonstrate. Furthermore, every
single voter in Wake County can vote in every single County Commission
race. My phone rings whether you call me from Rolesville or Wendell or
Wake Forest. We all represent Wake County. There&#39;s not a problem.
There&#39;s been no demonstrable  upswell. This isn&#39;t grassroots.
It&#39;s astroturf.

  Wake County citizens have spoken, and it’s absurd to oppose their voice,
to thwart their voice, simply because we don’t like what they have to
say. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. That concludes
the public hearing portion of today’s meeting. Members of the committee,
I will say that on Tuesday March the 10th at 3:00, we will have an
additional redistricting meeting. We will have some public comment, but
the majority of the meeting will be dedicated to the members to discuss
what they’ve heard today, what they will read over the weekend and over
the period of time between now and the next meeting. There is a vehicle
for written public comment and members of the committee, are there any
specific questions either now or if you have them later, direct them to
Ms. Churchill so that they can provide you the information that you need
to make the best decision. Yes ma’am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho,
can I get clarification? You stated earlier that we needed to submit
questions ahead of time. Does that pertain here? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Information or questions that you need to have some additional
information from staff, so that you will be more knowledgeable. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator McKissick. Good to see you today. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good to see you as always, Senator Rucho. We’ve been doing this a long
time. In any case, Senator, just for purposes of clarification, I know
the Wake County Representatives that spoke today and many others that
contacted me in the last hour before the meeting began, did express some
deep concern about not being aware that Wake County was going to be on
the agenda today. I think almost everybody knew that Greensboro would
there. So I’m, I understand you say earlier there will be public comment
at the next meeting. Will that be specifically for say, Wake County
persons who are concerned about this bill, to express their concerns or
support? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, there will be some time available for
Greensboro and there will be some time available for Wake, and we will
do what we can to make sure that as many folks as possible can provide
their direct input. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Quick follow-up, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] About how long do you
anticipate that meeting’s going, should we reserve our schedules for
time? [SPEAKER CHANGES] It will be two hours, between 3 and 5. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] And last follow-up, Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I take it that normal process we’ve had is that any
questions we have we can direct to staff or to the respective bill
sponsors to get answer, at that particular time and I assume that’s the
way we’re proceeding. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well you can ask a question at
the meeting. You can ask them in advance, so that they can provide you
the information early on, so that you come more knowledgeable to your
next meeting, to be able to discuss the issues surrounding both of these
bills. And hopefully we will be taking a vote on both bills on the next
meeting. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The vote will be taken next meeting. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Committee vote next week. We will be voting on both of them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] All right.
Members of the committee, any additional questions? Staff, any
additional comments? Mr. Vice Chairman, any comments? Okay. Well that
being said, it was an informative meeting and if there are no additional
thoughts or questions by committee, then this meeting is adjourned.
