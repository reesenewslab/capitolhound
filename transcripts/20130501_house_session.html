Members and visitors in the gallery, please turn off all cellular phones
and personal electronic devices.  The prayer will be offered by
Representative Lucas.  Members and visitors in the gallery, please stand
and please remain standing for the pledge of allegiance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My fellow legislators, as we prepare to make decisions that affect our 9
1/2 million citizens of this state, I think we'd do well to reflect how
we influence these citizens.  I was compelled to think about how I
effect citizens as I listened last week to Representative Jordan and his
resolution on Doc Watson.  And how Doc, despite his limitations and in
fact inability, debilatation, if you would, to continue and strive on.
And that reminded me of my favorite poet, who had a debilitation, the
Englishman, John Milton.  Milton said, on his blindness, when I consider
how my life is spent near half my days in the dark world and wide, and
that one talent ??  To hide, lies with me useless.  Though my soul more
bent to serve my maker.  God and sacked day laborer in like denied.  I
fondly ask, lest he return, his returning child.  God does not need
either man's work or his own gifts, who best bear his mild yoke.  They
serve him best.  His state is kingly.  Thousands of his bidding speed.
So close to land and ocean without rest.  They also serve who only stand
and wait.  So, with our debilitations and our inability to sometimes
understand the plight of our citizens, and even sometimes with our
blindness, let us look to God for help.  Eternal God, we invoke thy
blessings on these, your people.  We ask you to give us the wisdom and
the patience of your servant Job, as we wait for your wisdom that
descends from on high.  Kind father, help us to realize our limitations.
 Help us to recognize our debilitations, and help us, kind father, to
look with favor on those who are less than we are.  Father, we need your
grace.  We need your humbleness, we need a sense of humility to accept
your grace.  Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to
the republic, for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.

Debate the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. During
my freshman year, in 1997, 98, Walter Church was one of the people that
I sought out to get to know, and because he was an expert in an area
where I had very little information. He was very supportive of my
efforts to learn a little bit about banking, and he became a really
strong mentor for me, and I, I agree with Sir Representative Blackwell,
not only was he highly respected back in his district, but he was
respected in his chamber by all the members. He was a very gracious
gentleman, well-informed. He loved life, he loved his family, and spoke
often of them, and he loved North Carolina and his chamber and I commend
the resolution to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Starnes, please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The general assembly has recognized to debate the
resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES]. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, ladies and
gentlemen of the House. If there was ever a person who personified a
true Southern gentleman, it would be Walter Church. He was just a kind
and decent man, and he had just a smile about him, always a gentle
demeanor. People enjoyed being in his company. He was just a pleasant
type person. He was a person who had very strong convictions. He knew
what he believed in, he knew what he wanted to do, but he had a very
quiet way about him, and if you think that you've got to be loud and
boisterous to get something done, you should see the way that Walter
Church would operate, was he showed many people how they could get
something done by just being very quiet and respectful. And he was
always very effective. I remember one time in the agriculture committee,
Senator Apodaca had a bill to find spring water, and that bill made it
out of that committee, and Walter Church did not like that bill, because
he was in the water business, and anyway, he went over and he just
whispered something in Dewey Hill's ear, who was the chairman of the Ag
committee at the time, and that bill disappeared, and I don't know what
happened to it. We never saw it again. But he knew how to do things and
that was a very effective way of getting it done. During the session
when we had the co-speakers, I had the pleasure of serving as a co-chair
with Representative Church as co-chair in the financial institutions
committee. And we worked together very well, never had a cross word with
each other. I remember several years ago, it was very common for towns
to hold their own elections, and each town, or the towns that so opted
would have their own elections board and they would keep their roles and
they would do their own municipal elections. Well, Senator Wib Gulley at
that time put in a bill to abolish that and only allow the county boards
to conduct the local elections. Well his town of Morganton and my town
of Granite Falls wanted to continue to do their own elections and so we
said, well we want an exemption to that. And then there was the little
town of Rodhiss which straddles the Caldwell Burke county line. Well
we're in the conference committee with Senator Gulley and Representative
Church and myself, and he, and of course, Senator Gulley wanted to
abolish them all and we said no, we've got to have these three towns. We
want an exception. He said, Well, I'll give you Granite Falls and I'll
give you Morganton, but he said, I've never even heard of Rodhiss and we
are not going to put a little place like that in this bill. And Walter
Church said, well, that's where I was born, so I think it will just stay
in there. And it did. So we got the exception to that. But, he told me a
story one time, and I guess it was true. He said when he got married
that he was a, a Baptist and a Democrat, and he said his wife was a
Presbyterian and a Republican. So they wanted to have a happy marriage
and so they made an agreement that he would become a Democrat and he
would become a Presbyterian. He said, we've got along real well after
that. I don't know if that was a good trade or not, but it worked for
him. But anyway, Mr Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House, I have
nothing but good things to say about Walter Church. He was a great
fellow and we need more people like him, and he's certainly an example
that I can follow. I commend the resolution to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Larry Hall, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] General has recognized to
debate the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr Speaker, and I'm
certainly one of many people who would stand up and tell you stories
about what Walter Church did for them after they got to this legislature
during the time he was here. And one story in particular, and I'll make
it short as I know the day is wearing long but certainly for the family
that know many of times when he has done things for people that have
gone unnoticed. But during my first term here, I had the fortune or
misfortune to come very late in the term. Actually to fill out a term
and was.</p>

...be here for about two weeks. And after I was sworn in, whenever I
would be in my seat at the start of a session, there would be no
problem. But with all of the representatives and being one of the few
new people, it would be a slightly different matter when I would try to
come into the chambers after a session had started.
So I asked Representative Church, I said, &quot;What's the secret. Why
is it that I have a problem getting into the Chamber?&quot; He said,
&quot;Young man, you don't have any recognition, you don't have a
pin..&quot; I said I'm a freshman, I don't know where to get a pin, how
do you get a pin. He said you get them at the start of the session.
The next day, he came to me, as I made sure I got to the session early,
so I could get in and brought me a pin. He said, &quot;This will take
care of it for you.&quot; And I think that indicates the acts of
kindness he had for everybody.
I had the opportunity to serve on his committee as well, and he was
always willing to stop and explain the procedure and what we went
through. I certainly commend not just the resolution to you, but the
acts of kindness he performed during his life.

Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, the title of the bill pretty much
tells you what is in the full text of the bill, but it's really an
important piece of legislation, considered a cleanup bill for the Office
of the State Treasurer, in order for their office to do a lot of
adjustment and recommendations that will stabilize the Firemen's Pension
Fund.
The most important parts of the bill: it does rename the pension fund,
it creates a new definition section in the bill, it changes the
governing structure</p>

athletes who are popular now, but it's nice to see them learn the
history of sports, and my older son in particular he's a huge sports

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, this is a bill to
improve and make uniform the existing legal process for HOA foreclosure
in North Carolina. This is not a bill to expand HOA foreclosure powers
or to expand consumer protections. We have worked hard with a number of
parties to make sure this is a very limited bill. It is supported by the
Bar Association, it's been vetted by the Justice Center, the
Administrative Office of Courts, the Association of Clerks of Court, the
Realtors, the Homebuilders and the Community Associations Institute.
Representative Stam and Representative Glazier are also supportive of
this bill with me. Let me tell you just very briefly what the bill does.
It provides a uniform process across all 100 counties for HOA and
condominium foreclosure. Under current law, the statute provides that an
HOA lean can be foreclosed in like manner as the deed of trust under
Chapter 45. But it doesn't give any more specifics as to what that
foreclosure would look like. And Chapter 45 is written with the deed of
trust in mind, which includes a trustee in the process. There is no
trustee in an HOA lien under current law. This has led to confusion and
differing standards across the state, and neither owners, HOA's or
clerks of court have a clear expectation of the process. Clarifying this
process also cures certain issues related to sales that occur through a
largely undefined process. As a part of the clarification and uniform
procedure, the bill also provides an important protection for individual
owners in HOA foreclosures that does not exist under the current law as
written. It introduces a trustee into the HOA foreclosure process and
tracks the HOA process with the most common mortgage foreclosure process
that clerks of court presently handle. The Bar Association and the
Justice Center have worked together to make sure that the trustee in the
HOA foreclosure will have the same fiduciary duties and obligations as a
trustee in a deed of trust foreclosure. Additionally, the bill makes
clear that the attorney acting as trustee, if he's also the attorney for
the HOA, that attorney must withdraw and a neutral trustee be appointed
the instant the matter becomes contested. I commend the bill to you.

Our military here in the state of North Carolina. If you look at what’s
happening in the future on encroachment on military bases across the
country, and knowing that we’re experiencing, well in 2014 15, we’ll be
experiencing ??, this bill right here would ensure that our state
remains the most military friendly in the entire country. House Bill
484, the permitting of wind energy facilities, would establish a
permitting program for deciding and operations of wind energy facilities
in the state of North Carolina. This program will be implemented by the
Department of Environment and Natural Resources, and has an identical
companion bill that’s currently in the Senate. I want to stress that
House Bill 484 is not against wind energy, and the potential development
of wind energy in North Carolina. It basically develops a permitting
process for wind energy at the same time protecting the continuation and
expansion of our vital military mission here in the state. This problem
became clear in 2012 when out-of-state developers sought FFA approval to
build a large scale wind energy facility called the ?? Project in
Beaufort County. This included 500 foot wind turbines located directly
in Seymour Johnson Air Forces base low level primary training route,
leading into the Derek County bombing range. Other wind energy projects
are currently planned and FFA is reviewing the process. House Bill 484
provides a preliminary scoping and permitting process where DENR, DENR
is the Division of Energy Mineral and Land Resources, will work annually
with North Carolina military bases to determine where the wind energy
facilities would conflict with military training routes and operations,
and then permit the development of wind energy facilities only where the
facilities would not adversely impact military training operations. For
those of you that have been in environment and public utilities and
finance, this bill has received favorable report and you’ve seen the
maps on how many low level flying routes we do have here in the state
that are not only used by Seymour Johnson Air Force base but also by
Cherry Point, also by Sumter down in South Carolina and Langley up in
Virginia. This legislation has been developed after extensive meetings
with DENR, the Governor’s military affairs advisor, local military
communities including Seymour Johnson and Cherry Point, the wind energy
industry. While the wind energy industry is not completely happy with
this legislation, we have invited them to the table and the result of
this legislation is from all parties the developments the process that
protects our military and environmental concerns, but also adds comfort
to the wind energy, that they can safely invest in these projects. On
your desk, there’s been two handouts passed. The first handout you will
see actually comes from a number of businesses, elected officials, and
communities that have said we understand the risk it brings to our
military and would like something done. The second would be from the
Governor’s military advisor, Colonel John Nicholson, retired, stating
that this has full support of the Governor’s office. At this time I
believe there is an amendment or two amendments to come forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Whitmire, please state your purpose.

make sure we had the pieces of national security and a very critical
piece of our economic sector protected, this is one last item to make
sure we’ve got it all covered. And basically under the identifying the
installations that need to have the protection, we have our RADAR sites
that look East out over the Atlantic and are very critical to
identifying intruder aircraft that are not squawking and talking as they
come into U.S. airspace. And with that, this amendment adds them to this
bill. I ask you to support it please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative

&quot;..The other day was to think about an old joke... and the old joke
was the one where the young bride was taking cooking lessons from her
mother, and mama picked up the roast and she lopped off the end of it
and put the roast in the pan and of course the young girl wanted to
know, &quot;well why did you do that?&quot; and mama goes, &quot;well, I
don't know, my mother taught me how to do that&quot;. They go to
gram-mama and gram-mama doesn't know, her mother taught her how to do
that. This is a very fortunate family because the great gram-mom is
still alive. They go to great gram-mom and say, &quot;why do you cut off
the end of the roast before you cook it?&quot; and she goes, &quot;my
roasting pan was too small&quot;. We have a piece of legislation here
that is tied to legislation that has been changed, and that is, in the
past there was a county component to medicaid, and that no longer
exists. What is happening now with the way we've reorganized our
healthcare system with the large two mental-health issues through the
MCO's, we've created a significant problem for a lot of our citizens, to
the point that some of them are losing critical care.  We're talking
about a small group who have innovations waiver, and there are a lot of
other groups who also have this issue. It's more complicated for them,
and we're gonna be working on that but we need to take a first step.
What is happening, is when a client signs up, in say, White County, they
have services with providers in the White County system. Lets say that
person, because of family needs or whatever happens, they need to move
to Bunkham? County. They need to find a new provider, but White County
may not have a contract with that provider, and actually may not want to
set up a single client contract. So, we're having people- and a young
lady who explained her situation in health committee has three adopted
sons, all who were cocaine-addicted babies and needs very very critical
care without a lot of interruptions , is facing that issue. Her children
were signed up in the foster care system before they adopted them, in
??? County. They live in Lee County and have a provider there but with
the new changes with MCO, the previous provider MCO is not willing to
sign a single client contract. She has three young boys who are losing
their services in a matter of days, and we are hoping to get that taken
care of, but we don't know how many more are down the road and this is
an issue that we need to take care of now. Is it gonna be easy? No,
because there's a lot of rules and money and things of that nature that
are gonna be changed. But the convenience, the inconvenience, rather,
that the system change should rest with us, it should not rest with our
citizens when their healthcare is at risk.
We have to develop a system that serves the people, we shouldn't ask the
people to serve us and change how they live their lives because of rules
that we can change here in the general assembly, and I'd ask for your
support in this legislation, thank you.&quot;

&quot;You are recognized to speak on the bill.&quot;
[Speaker Changes]
Representative Hamilton: &quot;Thank you... I rise in support of this
bill today, and as Representative Avella?? has laid out for you, the
purpose of this bill is to allow the recipients to be a little more
mobile, and if they move from one area of the state to another area of
the state that is not covered by the same care organization, the money
and the services that the recipient gets, that money should move with
the recipient, not be held hostage by one MCO vs another. This has
affected a constituent in my area as well, and I would guess that it was
this unintended consequence of the legislation that was passed a couple
years ago has affected many many families in North Carolina, and I went
to Representative Avella?? when this was brought to my attention, and
reached out to her and we talked about it and we were able to work this
solution so the services follow the patient, not the other way around.
So, I urge you to support this and commend the resolution to you...thank
you.&quot;

<p id="090:00">
Representative: …. There was a family there, a woman there, who
represented her problem about a provider. This bill does not deal with
the provider issue. Am I correct about that? The issue, as I understand,
has to do with the fact that the current county of residence, MCO, will
not contract with provider in Lee County, which is in Sand Hills.
Representative: Follow up?
Speaker: Representative, will you yield for a follow up?
Representative: I do.
Speaker: She yields.
Representative: Will this bill, that we are passing today, require that
MCO to contract with the provider, or is there another step that you
need to take to get that accomplished?
Representative: My understanding of this is that we are going to remove
the requirement of county of origin and it will be where your current
residence is in terms of dealing with your providers and getting your
services paid for. I know that when we talked about this before, because
of the differences of MCO’s – you raised the question of differences in
services and first one thing then another, and that they may not be the
same. I think that if this is a statewide program that people are to
receive, then I think it is in our best interest, and definitely the
point of interest of our citizens, to make sure they can move from one
area to another, or adopted children, that they can move from one area
of the state to another and not get held up the way they have been in
this particular situation.
Representative: Follow up?
Speaker: Representative, will you yield for a follow up?
Representative: I do.
Speaker: She yields.
Representative: So, I am not sure that I am clear about the answer to
the question I asked. So, you are saying that this bill will address the
concerns the woman with her family had yesterday. It will allow her
family to get services from the same provider that she had before,
because this bill does not say anything about a provider at all. It only
talks about the Medicaid eligibility. I support this bill as written,
but I do not think it says anything about the provider.
Representative:  What we are talking about here is the state’s
requirement that you will get your Medicaid if  you stay in the county
you were in when you signed up for it. I don’t think that was what the
intent of the application of our program.

And in one respect, those statutes provide that the superintendent must
appear at the hearing where these matters are being concerned, or can
appear by a designee that he or she chooses. Primarily, the current
statute allows that designation to take place in the case of hearings
that are held with a hearing officer. This bill would simply make the
provision that the superintendent has the choice, if the school board
concurs, to also make use of a designee in hearings before the school
board over the same types of matters. I’ll be glad to answer any

I think what I’m trying to figure out is what is meant by public
operating used by local governments or operating a public enterprise.
What are you getting at with this piece of legislation you want them to
look at?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Michaux.
I am concerned that the public enterprise statutes are insufficient to
protect the integrity of the public infrastructure. I am concerned that
our cities and counties may be taking money from those public
enterprises to subsidize their operating budget at the sacrifice of the
infrastructure and I would like to look into that.

Have those folks in the citizens’ county been contacted or asked about

referendum will have two pieces a part of it. The first piece will be
addressing the board size. Asking the voters to choose whether they
would like to reduce the board from twelve members to nine members or
not. The second piece that they'll be voting on is to be able to reduce
the length of term from six years to four years and allow those members
to take office thirty days after election. With that I will yield for
any questions. I will certainly wish for your support on this
resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Farmer Butterfield please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]To debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]The ladies recognize to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank
you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and Gentlemen House Bill 523 happens to have
been a Bill that has been very contraversial over the years. And I've
just gotten elected recently to represent Pitt County and my committment
to the Constituents in Pitt County that elected me was to ensure that
their interests and their concerns would be my interests and my concerns
when I came to the Legislature to represent them. So I have to say to
you that there is opposition to this Bill. Now there was opposition when
it was reduced by Senator Pate from twelve to seven and that did not
pass the Justice Departments clearance so now we tslking about reducing
from twelve to nine. I have members of the Board of Education to come
yesterday and speak against the Bill. They have shared that when the
Board of Education members voted on this Legislation and talked about
reducing the size from twelve to nine out of the members were in favor
of leaving like it is. This has taken a lot of time and energy on the
part of Representative Brown as well as myself and Senator Don Davis of
the Senate. We spent a lot of time on this issue. And I can tell you
that people move from totally being against changing from twelve to nine
primarily because they're concerned about their representation as
African-Americans in the District. They want to make sure that the
population throughout the community is well represented and in order to
do that they have to have a minimum of three members which they now have
and the way the Districts are being composed in this Legislation is not
applicable or not appropriate for them to do this. So I'm hoping as I
told Representative Brown yesterday when I met with him and the group
after the Education Committee voted on this Legislation was that we can
get some changes made in terms of how the Districts are drawn thats more
amenable to ensuring that African-Americans are represented equal to or
greater than what they are now. Right now they at about twenty four
percent. Their thirty seven percent of the population of Pitt County so
we've had some consultations with some experts about how to draw the
lines that would make it about thirty three percent. So I ask that you
not vote for this and hope that when it comes from-when it goes to the
Senate it will be ammended and enhanced for my Constituents. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Martin please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To debate the Bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]The ladies
recognize to debate the Bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker. I
rise because I also represent Pitt County and I want to commend the
Bill's sponsor Brian Brown for the diligent work that he has done in
preparing this Legislation and he has shared with the entire delagation
throughout the process and met with us as we've moved forward and again
the goal of this is to have a more effective and efficient school board
to benefit the children. It is not to disadvantage the minority
population at all. And as Representative Brown has indicated it will
have to go through preclearance in order to be approved and verify that
this will be a positive realignment. My understanding is that it is
going to a similiar structure to the community, the County
Commissioners. The same number of Representatives and I would think if
that is aligned to represent minorities now that this should be o.k. But
I don't know that for certain but that is why I think it is important
there is that second step where it does have to be precleared and
another important ammendment from what ran last year is that it is going
to the public for a vote. There are some people who have pushed for it
not to be put of referendum because they're kind of tired of dealing
with it and it's ineffecient and they want it to be changed. That is
what we are hearing from our Constituents. But this is a compromise. The
balance of where we can move forward and include the public and we feel
its less contraversial to do it in this manner so I commend the Bill to
you. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Rosetta Lensko please state your

Representative Brown, I read through the Email of the bill. Do I
understand correctly that the elections are moved from the odd year to
the even year?
[Speaker Changes] Yes Madam, they are, it will be during the general
elections during the presidential election.
[Speaker Changes] Does the gentlemen yield?
[Speaker Changes] I yield

[Speaker Changes] I don’t see any thing here that makes the elections

[Speaker Changes] Yes Madam, they would still be non-partisan
[Speaker Changes] May I speak on the bill?
[Speaker Changes] The lady is recognized to debate the bill
[Speaker Changes] I just like to comment briefly that I have served on a
school board that was bi-partisan. I believe education should be
non-partisan. I think these elections are better held in a non-partisan
odd year. And I vote against the bill for that purpose and for no other.
We really need to keep our education system bi-partisan
[Speaker Changes] Rep Brown Please state your purpose
[Speaker Changes] To speak on the bill second time
[Speaker Changes] The gentlemen is recognized to debate the bill for the
second time
[Speaker Changes] I would like to address a few things. First and
foremost I completely understand the controversy that surrounds this
piece of legislation. And rest assure that our motives are not to reduce
any minority representation on this school board. It’s extremely
important to us that we maintain that characteristics that makes our
county so special. And to Rep Martin’s point, beyond passing through a
referendum by a public vote, it does have to still meet the department
of justice pre clearance. And that is an extremely important aspect to
keep in mind. The other thing that I would just submit to this body when
you are thinking about the statements where the school board decides not
to self reduce themselves , I would request this body to ask you to
self reduce yourself and come up with a decision of whether you would
actually make that happen or not. This is a bill that is requested by
the constituent and this is a bill that would go before the constituent
and this is a bill that the constituent would share their voice on in
the most democratic way possible and I urge you to support this bill.
