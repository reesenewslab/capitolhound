<p id="00:00">
Well good morning everyone and I’m sure that you got a lot of
information as we did on House Bill 998.  This is the House version of a
Tax Simplification Reduction Act, and of course, we call it the Tax
Increase on the Working family act.  Now, those of you who have had an
opportunity to see it, know and have head this morning that what is
really happening is we’re raising the tax on working families and
reducing the tax on business and that’s really the essence of what we’re
doing here and obviously we think that’s a problems for North Carolina,
for North Carolina’s working families. We know that the sales tax is
going to go up that folks are going to pay and these working families
are going to have by our estimation and calculation approximately 262
million in sales taxes they’re going to pay. And that again is going to
be just an awesome burden to transfer onto the working families of North
Carolina who are already baring a great burden in this state.  When you
think about the earned income credit going away which is the tax
increase and you may hear about that later on and have questions, and
then look at the increase amount that folks are going to pay in sales
taxes. This does not seem to be what working families in North Carolina
need to recover and for this state to move forward.  We don’t think it’s
a fair portion of the burden and we hope that as we go forward changes
will be made to respect the sacrifices the working families have already
made and make sure we have a fair portion of this tax burden. Right now,
Representative Tine wants to talk to us a little bit about what this tax
plan means.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you and good morning.  In Committee today there were a few back of
the envelope calculations made with individual representatives saying
that they might pay more under this tax plan on certain provisions.  The
issue isn’t whether or not you might pay or less on a few provisions,
it’s what is your total percentage salary that you might be paying and
it certainly looks like once you factor in the Earned Income Tax credit,
the fact that we’re increasing our electricity tax from 3.22 to 4.75.
When you look at the addition of tax on services it certainly looks like
the working families are going to be paying a higher percentage of their
salary than those that have more assets and more income.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Now, we know again North Carolina depends on its medical ?? and they’re
the ones at risk.  Again 20% of folks in North Carolina don’t pay taxes
at all at the upper echelon of personal taxes. So we know the folks at
risk, where we grow our economy, where our state has its stability, is
based on the working families in North Carolina.  Representative e
Luebke again, former finance chair had some observations about 998.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Hall and I do thank you him for the
opportunity to comment on House Bill 998.  I did have a few remarks in
Committee and I really want to stress these points. It has been stated
by others in the past, that these are bills, Senate Bill, House Bill,
we’re talking about the House Bill that are tax breaks for millionaire.
And it absolutely is. Millionaires pay marginal rates, 7.75% on all the
income they make as a married couple above 100,000. So if we’re talking
about a millionaire, a 4 millionaire a family making 4 million dollars
Their income cuts way down their income tax cuts way down to 7.75 to
5.9.  It’s going to be a significant number.  When I ask in the
committee, there have been  no numbers run on that. But you can bet its
significant. And our team, democratic team is going to have those
numbers reported in the next meeting.  So the one point is that it’s a
tax break for millionaires.  The second point it is a tax increase on
the middle class and working families of the state.  And you see that
when you look at the expansion of the sales tax in the services. The
example I made in the committee meeting just now, you have $400 of
repairs.  You currently pay a sales tax on that.  But what this bill
does is, if you have a$100 in labor they’re going to add that to your
bill.</p>

<p id="05:00">
So just in the example of the trip to the auto repair shop, your bill
will be 6.75% higher on labor. That is to say instead of paying $100 on
labor you're paying $106.75. And this is a tax that virtually every
North Carolinian is going to pay except those who are too poor to own a
car. So this is an example of just one tax increase on the middle class,
on working families. The fact is it's also on the poor because you make
$20,000, you got a car you still got to get it repaired. You got to get
tired at some point and you're going to pay that $6.75 extra that you do
not pay now. That's why we say collectively this is a tax to increase,
it increases the taxes on middle and working class families and it
provides a tax break for the millionaires. And I'll just stop there,
I'll be happy to take a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Since we have this time, this opportunity and
certainly we want to make sure we recognize that the earned income tax
credit is hitting working families at the same time. Representative
Goodman has some observations as a business man who has constituents as
well as clientele who have to utilize goods and services to talk about
the impact of the earned income tax credit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, good morning. Before I make my comments I
want to expand on something representative Leubke said. I have a
furniture and flooring business  and when we sell flooring to a customer
the labor is not taxed. Often times on a home if you recarpeted and
refloored your whole home the total bill could be seven, eight, nine
thousand dollars. The labor portion of that could be $4000 dollars and
you're talking about hundreds of dollars in increase for a home owner
when he remodels or upgrades his home. So I just wanted to make that
point but more than that I just want to talk about the income tax credit
that was removed earlier in the session which is nothing but a tax
increase on low income taxpayers.
In Richmond county that affected, which is my county, that affected over
6000 returns and represented over $800,000 dollars of income in our
county. That is money that is taken out of a struggling economy down in
rural North Carolina , it is money that people don't have in their
pockets to spend and there's very little discretionary income in rural
North Carolina today. And to make it tougher for consumers to go out and
buy the things they need, furniture, appliances, things for their home,
this was just - it's very devastating to poor people. I don;t think
people who have high incomes really understand how working people and
lower income people have to squeeze every dollar to be able to provide
for their families. And this was a tax increase on poor and middle class
families while at the same time they're going to give a tax break to
people that are millionaires, and I think it's unconscionable. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We won't belabor the point except to say it's going to
be a continuing fight and a continuing effort for working families and
for us to continue to pile on them transferring those responsibilities
and that responsibility of the highest paid to the working families
making ti almost impossible for them, asking them in essence to pay an
additional by our calculations $262 million additional sales tax dollars
and sales and service taxes. So we think that is a problem that needs to
be addressed and we have to find a different way rather than asking our
middle class really to just give up their futures, our working families
to just give up their futures and allow those who are already receiving
the best in North Carolina and enjoying the best to have even a better
deal at their expense. I will go ahead and take questions for any of our
speakers here today. Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Their justification for some of this is, one that by
lowering the corporate income tax I think you may have heard they [??]
to a sticker shop right now for businesses looking to come here, that
they're going to create more jobs and that's going to help working
families. What would be your response to that? And then the other part
of that is the standard deduction for double [??] in here as well, and
that has been a part of their case for mitigating the receptivity.</p>

<p id="10:00">
Again, and I start with the standard deduction, noting that it was
already commented that more than one third of North Carolinians don't do
deductions. And so, They won't itemize. They won't get the benefit of
that. The question of job creation, of whether or not this will be a job
creator, you would have to put yourself in a time capsule and see. We
haven't read Site Selection magazine, we haven't read all the national
surveys that say we're one of the best places in America over the last
ten years, always in the top five in almost every category, and to say
now that we need to do this to attract business, um, that doesn't wash
with the facts. Now if that was going to be the case, you turn around
and say well, we're going to take care of our corporate rate except that
we won't be competitive with South Carolina, so one of the states
closest to us, we decide not to be competitive with them. If that was in
fact the consideration. What we are saying is, Everyone just go to South
Carolina.
So I understand those comments and that theory but I think the facts
show that we already have a good system in place. It attracts business.
It's been successful. It's nationally competitive. And what we continue
to do is find a way to raise the taxes on the middle class, now, these
working families and give even more tax breaks where they're not needed,
or even being asked for. Now twenty percent, as I mentioned, are not
even paying income tax. So as we move forward, these working class of
North Carolina, these working families have to have a chance. This is
not an improvement over what we have in the tax code. Again, Put that
additional two hundred sixty two million dollars in services, in sales
taxes on them, just will break their backs. And we're concerned about
that.  Yes Ma'am
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just want to play a little devil's advocate here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's fine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] When we talk about taxes, many of the tax breaks for
the wealthy get a pretty high level. You know, it's easy to understand
the [UNKNOWN] point of view on it, but I think if you lump in some of
the service taxes-- You know, services being added to sales taxes, I
think that's kind of a different discussion, because even democratic tax
experts say that the tax credits needed to be reformed in that
department for a long time. For we are no longer a manufacturing
economy, we're a service economy and so most people agree. I think the
bond rating agencies ? Some services at least do need to be included
into that sales tax. It's a reflection of the age that we live in. So I
was wondering if you or some of the others can respond to that. Because
it does seem like the sales tax is very very narrow in North Carolina
and that a lot of experts on both sides of the aisle say it should be
broader. That it should reflect more services. So I just want to put
that out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ok. And I know representative [UNKNOWN] who has been
finance committee chair for over a four year period wants to address
that, because he also looked at that issue at a high level. But
certainly to say that if we talk about these taxes on services and then
say, We're going to exempt those at the highest level-- architects,
lawyers, doctors, etcetera. Those professional services. Where's the
equity and fairness in having that philosophy and saying, Who has to pay
those taxes? and provide them to the state. Representative [UNKNOWN]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me say that when there has been discussion about
the need to widen the sales tax base, this perspective, this point has
been made in the context of maintaining progressive income taxes. The
point about this bill is that it eliminates progressive income taxes.
There is no progressivity in the bill that was presented this morning.
As I said, and repeating: A family making forty thousand dollars is
going to be taxed the same as the family making four million dollars.
That is totally unfair to the middle class of North Carolina. The fact
of the matter is, if you have it as we have it now, and you have the
7.5% upward bracket for families making more than one hundred thousand
dollars, that brings in millions of dollars into the state, and reflects
a fairness strategy. So that when we recognize the expansion of the
sales tax to some services, it's in the context of still saying the
millionaires should pay their fair share. The millionaires are getting a
big break here, but we are finding ways to increase the sales tax</p>

<p id="15:00">
on the middle class and working families and you see that if you'll go
to the bill its actually in the first page of the bill. They assert
&quot;we are reducing income taxes&quot; and i.e we're eliminating the
progressivity in the income tax, and we are increasing sales taxes.
sales taxes is another word for consumption taxes.  So they state on
page one of the bill we're increasing the regressivity of the tax code,
we're reducing the progressivity of the tax code.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would like to speak about a group and make kind of make it personal.
My mother is 88 years old.  Therefore, she's not able to do her yard,
not able to clean her house as she's been able to do in the past and
these are services that now she is now having to pay someone come in and
do.  Also she has been in her home for over 50 years.  And just recently
she has had major repairs to her home.  And she's on a fixed income
because she's a farmer and she's drawing a retirement check, Social
Security check from the proceeds of a farm.  So her income is very low.
But now she will have to tax all those services she is having to pay
for, because of this new tax reform.  And not only my mother, but many
seniors are going to get caught up into this because they're at an age
that they've been in their homes a long time, their homes are needing
repairs, they're at an age they are not able to maintain their yards and
keep their homes up and so they're bringing people in.  And I don't
think we've thought about that number of people.  Yes, they probably do
fall into middle class and poor.  But they are also are a subgroup that
stands alone, so I think we need to understand what a hardship this is
going to put on people like my mother.  Who is 88 years old and unable
to many of the things many of the things she used to be able to around
her home.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In closing I just want to say as we look at this its supposedly a
revenue neutral bill.  That means, we can really see that someone is
going to pay less under this bill, someone is going to pay more.   Those
who are now being asked to pay more again are going to be our working
families.  Those who will be paying less, who will have their tax rate
reduced the most will be those, who in some instances have the best of
North Carolina and have already enjoyed the best of the benefits of
North Carolina.  So our concern again is our working families, our
middle class that we have to have in North Carolina that are the bridge
for this state to go forward.  And this tax bill clearly shifts the
burden to them and off of a fair progressive system that we currently
have.  No more questions?  Thank you.</p>
