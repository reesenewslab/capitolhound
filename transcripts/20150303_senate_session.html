  There comes a time when you have been bested and surpassed and it is
time to publicly acknowledge it. And the time is now. You can carry it.
What we have here is we have a framed copy of the North Carolina
Marksman of the year of 2015, Sarah Lang, with a target that has a
perfect in-the-center bullseye, and we thought that it would be
appropriate to recognize her from when we had the shooting competition
and acknowledge excellence.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We are just glad you finally manned up, Senator. Great
job. Senator Hise, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Send for a senatorial statement and a moment of
Personal Privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, you can send forward your statement. If we
have a page bring that forward, please. And, Senator, you have the
floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President, members of the Senate. I
want to stand up today and recognize what is a historic day for the
state of North Carolina. On March 3, 1915, this General Assembly
authorized its first state park, Mount Mitchell State Park, 100 years
ago today. Mount Mitchell State Park, for those of you who don&#39;t
know, is the highest point east of the Mississippi. It stands at 6684
feet and is quite a climate, I guess to say, anomaly in western North
Carolina. A few things I just want to mention out for people. For those
who think it&#39;s cold, they have the coldest recorded temperature on
Mount Mitchell State Park at 34 degrees below zero. The highest recorded
temperature ever is 81 degrees. That is coming forward, and have had
wind gusts that exceed 176 miles an hour standing on the park. Now we
have a lot of these across the state and we begin this process of
recognizing 100 years of North Carolina state park system. I&#39;m proud
and privileged I even got, while I was in college, to live for three
months on top of Mount Mitchell State Park while I was out for the
summer in college. So these are experiences we have all over this state
with a wonderful park system. I ask to commend this statement to you and
ask to recognize our park systems, and today their 100 year anniversary.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator. Senator Rabon, for what purpose do
you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask Senator Hise if Senator Hise will yield for a
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I will yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise, I believe that you said 6684 feet. Is
that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is that before or after sea level rise has been
calculated?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise yield to one more question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a little more realistic. Senator Hise, is the
golf course part of the state park?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The golf course is not part of the state park that is
there, but is part of our community and is recognized for one of the
best courses you can play in western North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Inquiry to the Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Have you played that golf course? It&#39;s wonderful.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have not, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;d love to take you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. You have any other notices or
announcements? Is there any further business to come before the Senate?
If not, the Chair recognizes Senator Berger for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. I move that the Senate do
now adjourn subject to the standard stipulation set forth in Senate rule
24.1, and subject to committee reports to reconvene on Wednesday, March
4, 2015, at 2:00 p.m. And, Mr. President, if I could, an explanation. We
would intend to take care of any business that we have a 2:00 and then
recess until 4:00 for purposes of the joint session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The motion is the Senate do now adjourn subject to the
standard stipulations to reconvene Wednesday, March 4 at 2:00 p.m.
Seconded by Senator Sanderson. All in favor say Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed No. The Ayes have it. The Senate stands
adjourned.
