<p id="00:00">
...everyone, I'd like to call this meeting to order. I appreciate you
being here this morning. First of all, I'd like to thank our pages for
being here. We have Cassie Burke from Senator Tarte's office. Kennedy
Terrill from Senator Tarte, Emily Rundel from Senator Tillman, Faith
Coleman from Senator Barefoot and Katie Steg from Senator Berger. Thank
you for being here today and how you're serving this committe. I'd also
like to recognize the Sergeants-at-Arms, we have Ashley Mickens, Steve
Wilson, Ed Kessler and Billy Fritcher.
We do have two bills before us today. The first one we're going to be
taking up is Senate Bill 236, where we'll be voting on that by, our plan
is a quarter till, because we do have to move to another committee after
this, but we also have Senate Bill 674, which we will have a few minutes
at the end for discussion only, but we wanted to give time for that. We
do have some time for public speaking. We'll have four people doing
public speaking, two minutes a piece, but before that we are going to be
discussion the bill just so you have an idea of what the schedule will
look like for this meeting today.
Now, what we have to do first is a motion to adopt a PCS for Senate Bill
236. We have a motion from Senator Tillman. All in favor of the motion,
say aye. Opposed no. The ayes have it and the PCS is before you. Senator
Hunt, you're recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Morning, everybody. Hope everybody is having a great
morning so far. Senate Bill 236 would allow counties to be responsible
for the construction, improvement, ownership and acquisition of school,
public school property. The proposed committee substitute would turn the
bill into a local bill that would apply to the counties listed. It would
also make the following changes to clarify that the counties would be
responsible for school construction, acquisition, but not responsible
for furnishings and buses and things like that. It would also provide
that local boards of education can present the needs for their school
buildings concurrent with the submission of the school budget. The
purpose of this is really to take advantage of the skill sets that the
county commissions have and the school boards have. The idea really is
to give the school boards an opportunity to spend the time they need on
school education issues and to take advantage of the business acumen the
county commissioners generally have to negotiate construction contracts,
site acquisition and so on. There are other advantages, such as
duplication of construction staffs at the school board level and the
county commission level, there's no reason for taxpayers to be paying
for two construction staffs. I'll be happy to try to answer any
questions. Staff and I, between the two, can do it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, thank you. Senator Cook?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have an amendment and then also a question. Let me
try my question first.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Before you go, do members have copies of the
amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, they do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Thank you. Yes, go ahead with your question,
please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is Beaufort County included in this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, it is. OK. Thank you. The amendment I'm
introducing simply allows for mobile units to be included, such as if
there's some concern the commissioners and the local school board can
resolve dispute using the mediation process.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any questions about this amendment? Questions or
comments? Senator Tillman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would like for staff to have a moment to consider
what this is doing and then see if they could respond to it. Senator
Hunt, would that be OK with you?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are you talking about the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure. Which amendment number are we talking about,
please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't have it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It's AT...it says Senator blank on it, 68 version 1.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK. Got it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff, do you have a comment on the impact of this
amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In the PCS, there's a process provided...</p>

<p id="05:00">
…each year annually the school boards are supposed to provide adequate
classroom space and they do that through the school budget process. If
the county had assumed that responsibility, the PCS now says that the
LEA would each year at the time that they submit their budget, would
submit information on what adequate classroom space is needed to the
county commissioners and then there’s a mediation process provided.
There’s also a provision in that same statute that allows LEAs to buy
mobile classrooms if they were to have a sudden influx of population and
this would provide that same mediation process for when they had to
determine if they needed to acquire mobile classrooms because they had
reached a capacity issue in their space.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Cook.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Let me make sure that I understand what you’re saying.
This amendment is redundant?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No sir. The process is different. One is for the
actual school building and then the mobile classrooms is when you have
other sort of influx of peoples and you need to have short term housing
and this just provides in both situations that there would be a way for
them to be able to mediate if they had to work out the numbers and space
situation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hunt do you have a comment on this amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I’m in favor of the amendment, yeah. Just makes
sense if the county commissioner takes ownership of school property that
temporary classrooms would be included.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do we have an amendment before us. All in favor of the
amendment say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Aye
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed no. The ayes have it and the amendment is now
part of the PCS. Senator Curtis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have another amendment please. This amendment
removes Iredell County from the bill at the request of the Iredell
County commissioners. The Iredell County school board and the
Mooresville City school board all wish Iredell County to be removed and
Senator Brock is okay with this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any discussion on the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d like to see that amendment. Let me take a peek at
that. Senator Curtis, the amendment I’m looking at takes more than
Iredell out of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That was not what I asked bill drafting to do. I asked
them to remove Iredell only.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair. Sounds like we better…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes
[SPEAKER CHANGES] …get a new amendment on the table.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hunt, looking at staff here. This only removes
one county because there’s only talking about removing that one line. It
doesn’t change the other lines does it? So it does change that one
county and I’m sorry I didn’t hear what your last comment was.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well do we need to get another amendment printed or
can you just say that we’re just going to remove that one county?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s what the amendment does. It just removes that
one county. There’s several lines of the bill that had the different
counties listed and takes that one county out of that one line of the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just bear with me. Let me read it myself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Cook, did you have question while Senator Hunt
is reading this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, I just think I can maybe help clarify. The line
14 says this act shall apply only in the following counties, Beaufort,
Dare, then on line 15 it goes on to include some other counties. This
amendment that’s on the table then goes on to say Davie, Harnett,
Iredell, Lee, Rockingham, Rowan and Wake, so that the only county that’s
apparently being left…oops wrong one.  So much for adding clarity.
Alright, …</p>

…the Guilford, Harnett, Lee,Rockingham,Rowan and Wake. So it’s pretty
clear, at least from my point of view, that Beaufort County is included.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ten-four. I got it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you and Senator Hunt you have a comment on the
amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have no problem with the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Any further comments or questions about the
amendment? Hearing none, all in favor with the amendment say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed say no. The ayes have it. The PCS as amended
is before us. Any questions or comments on, so you have Senator Hartsell
and then Senator Robinson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay I’m sort of conflicted in this situation having
at least one time being both a county attorney and the school board’s
attorney at the same time. Also the local options situation here but I
have one very specific question. Rowan County, which is not in my
district, is in this bill. However there are two school systems in Rowan
just like there are two school systems in Cabarrus because the
Kannapolis system crosses the line and there is physically a school in
Kannapolis that is located on the line and has portions of it in one
country or the other. How does this bill affect that situation with
regard to the schools physically located in Rowan County that are part
of the…there are actually some other schools that are complaining and
I’m just…because I have a problem…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I can answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Can you tell me what’s going on here?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hartsell, the first question I have is which
LEA is that assigned to? You can only be assigned to one LEA. Which LEA
is that school assigned to?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Kannapolis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hunt did you have a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah. I can explain it if I say something wrong, staff
can correct me but basically if the school system is incorporated in two
counties that is not included in this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay so let me just clarify. To the extent that Rowan
is included in this bill, then Kannapolis would not be in this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff do you have a clarification on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is not how we read the bill to be written. That
it would affect those LEAs if it’s within the county and in the case
that Senator Hartsell is discussing, we think that it would be subject
to whichever school system owns the buildings for that school.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sorry Senator Hunt.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ve an amendment to run.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Do the members have copies?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] They have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please explain your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It amends the same line that Senator Curtis did
earlier and I guess that we’ll need to be technically changed because
Iredell’s already been removed so, I’m not seeking Iredell back in.
Maybe staff can help clarify how we do this to make sure we’re voting on
a clean amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We’ll have staff talk about that. Tell me what your
intent is. We can change that technically.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just remove Wake in the same way they removed Iredell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay so let me get with staff real quick. We got a
question as that there is an amendment but since the bill’s already been
amended to remove Iredell County can we just do a perfecting amendment,
perfection to...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ..endorse then we’ll fix it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay so…
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just want it clear that my intent is not to add in
back Iredell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay so we do have an amendment before us with the
purpose as stated.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And the purpose is that Wade County has a triple A
bond rating. We build more schools that any other county in the state,
maybe Mecklenburg but I really don’t even think Mecklenburg is. In the
last 12 years, we’ve built or done a major renovation in 104 schools. We
do an excellent job. We win dozens of construction and design awards.
Our costs are low. They saved $100 million dollars in savings from the
last round of major construction. Last five years we purchased 16
parcels. Savings of six…</p>

dollars below appraise value in that time. The county has a fraction of
the assets. The school system maintains three times the number of
assets, has three times the amount of construction work and progress
than the county. This notion that the county is somehow better is wrong,
that's basically how it is. And the people are opposed to this. 64% in a
poll by Triangle Business Journal think that it's wrong for the county
to own and manage and build the schools. They think that should be the
job of the school board and it's fairly basic concept. Schools are
instruments to further education. The location of the school, the size
of the school, what programs are at the school, what facilities are at
the school, these are all educational matters they are not construction
matters and what the school does is further the educational ends of the
children school system in such a way as to and they do it in a very cost
effective way so the default should be for it to be with the school
system and there should be a reason why you would take it away and there
is no reason and for that reason I encourage you all to support this
amendment to exclude Wake County from this legislation. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Hunt. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein just for the
record the Wake County Commissions are strongly in favor of this and the
Wake County school board and other school boards across mostly much ??
areas have approximately 9% of their people are business people. Now do
you want 9% of your school board negotiating these complicated contracts
for construction for site acquisition. At the same time, these
metropolitan areas like Wake County have approximately 65% of their
county commissioners are business people. Now who do you want
negotiating these contracts? So I am strongly opposed to this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I will respond to his question of me. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Stein you may respond. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I
don't know how you think the government works but the school board does
not go and negotiate with landowners. What they do is they have a highly
professional staff whose job it is to acquire the land, develop the
land, construct the buildings, maintain and repair those structures. The
schoolboard members actually don't build the buildings, they hire
professionals to do that and what you want is competent management at a
board level to provide supervision and what I have just demonstrated
through the record over the last 10-15 years is they have done an
exemplary job and the schoolboard is opposed to this. The county
commission may be in favor of it but the schoolboard is opposed to it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hunt. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, I'm a
business person. My company built about 4,000 multifamily housing units
across the southeast and I don't know how to hammer a nail but I know
that I make the decision about what's going on. If the schoolboard's
making these business decisions they're not qualified to do, the county
commission needs to do that. I vote against the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Any further questions or comments on the amendment? Seeing none
all in favor of the amendment say aye. All opposed say no. No's have it
and the amendment is defeated. Senator Robinson you did - I saw your
hand up earlier. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes I have an ?? chair by this table.
I have heard from Guilford County school board and some are in the
audience this morning and I think several of our delegation were visited
on yesterday by one or two of the members one who talked extensively to
me and the legislative chair and co-chairs both who they're democrats
and republicans on that schoolboard I want to remind people and they
done a very good job of determining the needs of Guilford County. They
have used business persons in their collaborations and we have built new
schools even recently have decided even in the face of budget cuts with
a new school being built. And so it's a very collaborative system
they've done an excellent job and they do know what the needs of the
children are in terms of what schools should be built and have recently
had to make some hard decisions of what schools needed to be repaired
and that kind of thing. Renovated and maintained and have even not
getting the kind of funds they need recently in the county budget have
determined that</p>

Have pulled/g in of the collaborations in the community to go ahead and
to do that. And so my amendment asks is for Guilford County to be
excluded. And of course you’d have to take our deal/g out of the since
you voted for that. But I’d ask that you support that Guilford County
has done a good job. As a matter of fact recently one of our schools was
named and that’s, that’s the Early College at Guilford was named one of
the top in the nation’s for achievements. It was because we have great
school board. And they not only make sure academic progress is there but
they also make sure that our kids have the kind of facilities and the
kind of maintenance that is needed to promote a good quality of
education. So I ask for support on this amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thoughts or comments on the amendment. We’ve got Senator Wade. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I ask you to vote against this amendment. I’ve talked with
county commissioners from Guilford. They certainly want the option of,
of this, which this bill extends to them in order to cut costs on school
construction. Neighboring areas to our area are doing it two to three
times less than we’re building schools in Guilford County. And they
would at least have this option. And I would appreciate you voting no in
this amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Robinson [SPEAKER CHANGES]  We have [INAUDIBLE] we do have some members
of the school board present. Will we have that opportunity? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Have we, we have had a list. So have they signed up on the
list? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. I’m sure they have. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If
they’ve signed up then they’ll be heard. [SPEAKER CHANGES] But they’ve
come to voice their opposition to this. And they have done a good job of
managing. I’d like for that to be done prior to moving ahead with
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think we can do it. Do we have? Will we
have people hearing then this will be your slot. Do we have someone from
the Guilford County school board who would like to use their two minutes
now. Do we have Kristine/g Kuchner/g or Terry [UNKNOWN] ? Do, do, do we?
Is Terry Runningjar/g from Guilford County? Then. I’m sorry. I’m sorry
we don’t have a currently someone signed up from Guilford County.
[INAUDIBLE] [SPEAKER CHANGES] We were told there could only be two
speakers so they consolidate. Has that changed? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That
was two speakers and I just named the two speakers. Kristine and Terry
will be speaking. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Oh, they’re not here? [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  All right. So any. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [INAUDIBLE] is not from
Guilford and neither is Kristine. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Those, those are two
people we had signed up from [CROSSTALK] [SPEAKER CHANGES] are from
Guilford. This is co-chair of the [INAUDIBLE] [SPEAKER CHANGES] I have a
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right. [CROSSTALK] [SPEAKER CHANGES] would you let
her speak please? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, we’ll let you speak for two
minutes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ll be brief. I want to make sure the other
speakers are allowed to speak too. Good morning everyone. Rebecca
Buffington/g member of the Guilford County Board of Education. I thank
you for your opportunity to speak. Points of. Senator Robinson and
Senator Wade both have very good points. That, and all of you do.
There’s a lot of institutional knowledge on both boards, Board of
Education and the County Commissioners. And we’ve taken advantage of
that very well I feel like in Guilford County and have worked together
and collaborate and Trudy’s/g point is they, they, they want these,
Senator Wade’s point is that they want the option in that. They’ve been
very involved in the initial bond issue and construction process in
Guilford County. And we worked closely and we made it clear they want to
continue that relationship. We’ve worked when we’re building schools.
But they want nothing to do pass that. They don’t, they don’t want to
make decisions about how we use the facilities and things. And so I
think careful consideration of the wording of the bill is important.
We’ve done a good job I feel of collaborating. But I want to remind you
we’re the only elected officials focused exclusively on education. And
we feel in the best position to make educational decisions that impact
our students. It would threaten the independence of school boards, alter
long settled practice in law, upset the balance of power on the local
school board, county commissioners’ relations, solve no identified
problems and actually create a host of new problems. Every school board
in the state would be affected if county commissioners were given this
sort of authority. Boards have good relationships within our county and

Any further comments on this amendment?  Senator Wade.

I ask you to please vote no on this amendment.

I concur.

We have a lot of business in front of us.  I think we have discussed

amendment at this time.  All in favor say aye, all opposed say no.

No.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant do you have a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just wanted for the record and the public record to indicate that I
was in error when I voted against Senator Stein's amendment. I got
distracted so I voted on the wrong side and it probably won't affect the
result but I definitely wanted the members of the public who are here to
know that.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Duly noted, Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I heard that.  I wondered what you were doing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hartsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, I need to send forward an amendment, I think it has been
distributed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes it has been distributed.  Could you explain it please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This amendment simply exempts the Cannapolis City School System which
happens to be in two counties from the ?? end county application.  I
spoke with Senator Brock and he is fine with this and I would appreciate
your adoption of it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Hunt do you have any comments?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I am not problem with it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let us vote on this amendment then, all in favor of the amendment, say
aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a question, if I may
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, you have a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I am completely at peace with this amendment.  My question to this bill
sponsor is, surely we are concerned about the lack of business acumen of
the Cannapolis School Board.  Shouldn't, isn't it our imperative to
require that the county do the building of construction that affects
these schools, how can you support this amendment if
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Senator Stein, I am relying on the expertise of Senator Hartsell. He is
familiar with that Board.  I am just relying totally on what he said.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Hunt.  We did promise and I know people have come a
long way to speak on this and I'm going to leave time for the public to
speak so we are going to vote on this amendment at this time.  All those
in favor of this amendment, say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed say no.  The ayes have it and the amendment is engrossed in PCS.
 At this time I would like to hear from the public on this bill.  We do
have four people.  Let us move quickly.  Let us start with Christine
Kushner followed by Joe Bryan.  If you could be on deck when the person
finishes then we can just keep going, the person up and on deck.  Thank
you.  Please identify yourself, your name and who you are with.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning Mr.Chairman and members of the committee.  Thank you for
the opportunity to speak on Senate Bill 236.  My name is Christine
Kushner and I am vice-chair of the Wake County Board of Education.  This
legislation is truly a solution in search of a problem.  The Wake County
Board of Education, together with our professional staff, has
effectively managed more than $2.2 billion  worth of construction,
completing 42 new schools and 62 major renovations since 2001.
Together, working with the county commissioners, together we have saved
more than $100 million dollars during that budget and Construction
cycle. Currently the acquisition of land for new schools is a
collaborative process.  A collaborative process between the school
system and the county.  This system of checks and balances has worked
for our community and the system of checks and balances has served the
taxpayers very well.  This system is done away with in Senate Bill 236.
The greater Raleigh Chamber of Commerce has withheld its support of this
bill.  Instead they favor a local agreement that would create real
improves in the process of building new schools for our students and
we agree with that approach.  We do not need a state law for Wake County
to address the matters that local officials, duly elected, local
officials can solve together.  I ask now that School Board members who
have come to voice their opposition to this bill, please stand and I ask
you that you vote no against this bill.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Ms. Kushner and followed by Joe Bryan to be
followed by Terry ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning, my name is Joe Bryan, I am chairman of the Wake County
Board of Commissioners and a past president of the North Carolina
Association of County Commissioners.  We fully support this bill that
Senator Hunt is bringing forth.  There are major issues in terms of
assets and liabilities not being linked with the county.  There is the
issue of duplication, there is the ability to have better joint use
agreements with our twelve municipalities in our particular county</p>

offer numerous examples where the school board weren't doing appraisals,
they didn't have a checklist. They wanted to buy a property in Cary for
eight million dollars that we eventually bought for four million
dollars, and we are constantly having these struggles, and they've
become a board of construction versus a board of education invoking all
of the academic excellence that needs to occur in our classrooms. So, I
would urge you to do this, to support this.  When we had this grand
public policy debate at the legislative conference for the North
Carolina Association of County Commissioners, it passed there on two
thirds area of most of the counties wanting to have this option. It is
an option particularly in counties that are building a lot of schools -
in Wake county five to seven schools - that will create added
transparency and accountability to the public, and the ability to save
some money. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. We do have Terry Reneger, followed by our final
speaker will be David Thompson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning, appreciate the opportunity to let me speak this morning.
My name is Terry Reneger. I am a former school board member in Davie
county, and I am a current county commissioner but I am here as a
citizen this morning. The issue before us - bill 236 - there is... I'm
taken by the fact that it got lost in the math with all these
amendments, but less than 10% of the counties are in this bill at this
point. There's a message there. The effect on this would be to usurp the
checks and balances that have been inherent in the system since the
Great Depression. The effect would be to chill discussion and input from
educational experts as to what is needed to build a school. Davie
county's a small county. We're 42,000 people. We build a school every
once in a while. We don't have issues like the metropolitan areas when
it comes to building schools. The notion that the school board does not
have the business acumen, or doesn't have access to the business acumen
to efficiently build a school in a cost effective manner is bogus in my
opinion. At best, this is - again - an attempt to chill debate. At
worst, this is just about control. The current county commissioners have
the financial lever to do what they need to do as far as funding
facilities, and this is redundant. But in conclusion this, for Davie
county, is about not allowing the people to vote, quite frankly. If this
bill is passed, local citizens - not only just Davie, but the people
that's in this - would be deprived of the opportunity to participate in
the democratic process, and we urge you to vote against bill 236. Thank
you for your time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for your comments, and our final speaker will be David
Thompson. Two minutes, please, and identify yourself please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm David Thompson, executive director of the North Carolina Association
of County Commissioners. The number one adopted goal of our county
commissioners across the State this year is restoration of lottery funds
for school construction. The reason for this goal as high priority is
that counties are responsible, and they take this responsibility very
seriously for school construction funding across the State. Many
counties rely on this funding along with property taxes to issue debt
service payments that have been approved by the taxpayers that elected
them. This local bill simply gives these counties the option to align
the authority, and just as importantly the accountability - and I've
warned Commissioner Bryan that you better be careful what you wish for,
because you just may get it - the accountability to the taxpayers that
elect them. It aligns the authority and the accountability to taxpayers
and parents where it belongs, to the responsible party for school
construction, and in this case, it's the board of county commissioners.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you for your time. I know Senator Rabin's had his hand up for a
while. Did you have a question or a comment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
More of a comment. The speaker who said it's about control is exactly
right. The way I look at this, it's quite simple the way I read the bill
anyhow, that there's not a lot of change, that the collaboration goes
on, it's just that the business part of it goes to the business world.
Nothing is barring any educator from having full input just as they have
now. I support the bill, and hope everyone in the room will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I thank you for your comments. Any further questions, or comments?
Seeing none, we do have a motion here for a favorable report, now what
this will be is, this is going to be a motion for a favorable to the PCS
as amended</p>

With a favorable report to the new PCS, unfavorable to the original
bill. All in favor say aye.

Aye.

Oppose say no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The ayes have it and the PCS as amended is passed.  Thank you.. we do
have Senator Daniel, as we say for discussion only.  He has a bill here
before us. What we first need is a motion to adopt the PCS.  So moot.
All in favor of the motion say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oppose say no. The ayes have it and the PCS is before you. Senator
Daniel you are recognized to explain the PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee. This bill does
exactly what it says it does. It’s intended to prohibit costly local
government litigation that’s something that Senator Brown and Senator
Hise and I had discussed earlier in the session. In fact I think it sort
arose out of a conversation that we had in this committee one day about
the animosity and the cost that is incurred when a school boards and
county commission decides to sue, when school boards decide to sue
county commissions to try to achieve a greater funding level. So
basically the PCS, the only difference is that the original bill sort of
in my understanding struck the current statutory process in its entirety
whereby school boards and county commissions can mediate and then
proceed to litigation and I’ve had some discussions following the time
the bill was filed with the School Board Association and they felt like
the mediation process had some valued and was in fact utilized
successfully in many cases. So the PCS puts, leaves the mediation
process in place that’s currently in place but basically all it does is
remove the statutory authority that has been given to school boards to
sue county commissions when they don’t feel like they’ve been given
enough money for their school year.  However, what it doesn’t do is
remove a school boards constitutional authority to sue if they feel like
constitutionally they have a claim against the county for not providing
an adequate education.  That’s the gist of the bill.  I’d be glad to
hear any comments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do we have any questions or comments? Senator Bryant?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would just like the staff to tell me and I’m sorry that I’m not, I
don’t already know these details.   But the difference between this
constitutional cause of action they have and what’s been struck on page
3? If staff could explain the difference, thank you. Or the sponsor, if
the sponsor wants to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’ll defer to Staff, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Staff, do you have an answer to that question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The language that’s been struck in the bill actually just removes the
procedural framework, the statutory framework to bring a suit.  So you
would just bring a suit outside of how this statute would write. Excuse
me and then the expedited process that’s in the statute currently so you
could still bring a lawsuit but it just wouldn’t have the confines or
the  procedure set out in the statue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And what would the school board have to prove?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Under a series of court cases that have been happening over the last few
years, since the mid 90’s the lander decision and said that this state
is responsible for providing a sound basic education and so if there
were allegations that there was insufficient funds necessary, provided
to provide a sound basic education, ultimately, that is the state
responsibility that the state has delegated that portions of that to the
county so that would be the basis for the lawsuit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a comment  Mr. Chair, than you. I want to know that in face of this
bill and the recent one that for some of our counties took the authority
to construct and repair buildings that they felt was needed for our kids
in our school boards. So have a good school board and as you heard the
Speaker say, the collaboration has been a good one since we merged three
systems a long time ago and I was on that Committee.  We’ve had a good
collaboration but now we moving a step further I think to create a
division.  Because what this means is and I don’t think our school board
has ever sued our county commissions because even when they dint get
what they needed they still worked with that and got outside resources.
So what we do here at the state is we create legislations that raises
issues for them to say, well you don’t have any money to sue them
anymore and that’s never been the issue. At least with the.</p>

I think of account has never been the issue is when a collaborative
point that exempt hands about what I think we're creating legislation to
create a problem enough and can theory is not an consultant Jeff
question centered around the site Mr. I just relax out of the house for
you and I think in most cases the SQL military commissions at work
together to problems you have a case the lawyer that's not happening to
me if you bring a lawsuit watching a data mapping it is you create a
situation that is already a little difficult and made impossible because
I guess it's why should we you got to turn each other in trying to back
together to work together in the future really becomes more difficult
now because a trust I is completely out and that was my also cited
nobleness but ineffectively I think both parties understand intensive
education you would think and I can work together more 30s issues will
also but to me if he gets to appoint a board of are you about has to
look at investors than you got the choice that would allow you to get
think it just perpetuates gets worse and worse and I get better and that
was not also final list will like UIQ Caesar salad told by Center weight
and cock is restricted and met up the center ground up our agreement
assignments of seeing some of that myself and Emma are stated on our
laps the bill sponsor vessels in prior conversations we had a recession
that escapes me now we have our Israeli army figures available to us how
much money's been spent on litigation in the last on a file 10 years
between school boards and carry commissioners was sure it it would add
up to quite a pretty penny to convince our better educate our students
can attend from Senate not all have the statistics I could probably get
them Thursday the boards Association the only justice that I have a
project share with you our statistics about the amount of times I asked
10 years at the mediation process is the news is also based on the
hospital of Theseus left mediation process in the in the following would
you just briefly give us a taste of our so-called working with committee
will allow that second question is the 1997 out to counties use
mediation process 1900 or three counties are contrary to counties if
anyone is an economic; Wagner and Mark Moran union running on it was
their County 2000 offered in Northampton 2001 Cumberland North Hampton
Tameka 2002 governor counties that utilize mediation 2003 Union County
2004 Cabarrus Iredell and more thousand and five blatant Burke Halifax
Scotland Des Moines 2006 Beaufort Madison tender 2007 Graham Pamlico
union 2008 different person to thousand and nine Burke Halifax 2010
Halifax and was really only ones that I have a question on that list as
necessary as mediation or litigation understanding from staff as a
dessert cases were mediation which it was not necessarily litigation and
we are a subset of ActiveX window litigation follow-ups are problem told
me is that they don't have the statistics but they would have to get
them through probably the school boards Association or did you have
someone from sclerosis is your information regarding my distance
nonsense capacity and then fight yourself an organization in North
Carolina school boards Association and never actually met actual data in
a rain out since the statute was in place and I am only aware for a fact
finds that anyways had actually gone on to court may step them have
either been resolved at the mediation battle is resolved and the work
does scoreboard chase a person thank you very much this winter and we do
have a meeting coming in after us I do to help him celebrate cook and
clean committing after I decided to thank Sen. Daniel Arena secondhand

And serve on the Guilford County Board of Commissioners, and yes, we
were threatened several times to be sued by the school board, and yes
there was some litigation. And finally, it was dropped, so I didn't want
you to think that Guilford hadn't been involved in that, and I
appreciate you bringing this because I think it'll probably take some of
that willingness to work together, will make them want to work together,
since there's not the threat of we'll sue you if you don't do this,
because I've certainly been a County Commissioner and experienced that.
And I think this is the way to make them focus more on education of
students and work together.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator Wade. We're gonna have Senator Cook, and then Senator
Daniel have a final, a closing statement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd just like to add that Beaufort county, I think you even mentioned
there was some mediation in 2006. It also ended up in court and Beaufort
County at the time was a tier one county. For those of you that don't
know, that means it was pretty poor. And, and this litigation ended up
being thousands of, hundreds of thousands of dollars. It's just such a
monumental waste of money. I, I, I remember at the time thinking how
aggravating this is. We need to foster cooperation, and I believe this
bill will do that. There's no reason that the county commissioners and
the school board can't get together and collaborate, but there has to be
somebody who makes a final decision. And that's all this bill attempts
to do. And I think it's a great bill and thanks for bringing it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you and Senator Daniel, you're recognized to make a final decision
and then we'll conclude the meeting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister Chairman. Thank you Senator Cook and Senator Wade and
thank you your sentiments sir. Along the lines of what Senator Brown
said, is that litigation really only has negative consequences, and the
only positive consequence is that lawyers make a lot of money and it's
not good for the citizens, it's not good for the students, but it is
good for the lawyers, so. Thank you mister Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. I appreciate your time today committee, and the
meeting is adjourned.</p>
