…come to order so that the gentleman can be heard. The gentleman has the
floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s funny that you should call me Representative
Cook, as the only difference in the language of this bill since we
passed it out of the House on June 19th is it used to say Representative
Tine at the top, and now it says Senator Cook. We passed it out on June
19th, so I commend the bill to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not, the
question before the House is the Passage of Senate Bill 788 on its
second reading. Submitee favoring passage of the bill will vote aye,
those opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the vote.
Representative Warren, does the gentleman wish to record on this vote?
The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. Ninety having voted
in the affirmative, and 6 in the negative, Senate Bill 788 passes its
second reading and will, without objection, be read a third time.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 376, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 376, an act to allow Montgomery County
employees and the dependents of employees to participate in the state
health plan for teachers and state employees. The General Assembly of
North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Stanly,
Representative Burr, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The bill that we have before
us today is very similar to a bill that was passed out of here about two
or three weeks ago from Representative Brawley concerning several
editions to the state health plan. There was an attempt to look into an
amendment for that so we wouldn’t have to add an additional bill, but as
required by the rules we had to wait on the ?? note to come back.
So this is given them that opportunity to be added to the state health
plan. Nearly identical to the bill that was passed a few weeks ago, and
it is just for Montgomery County and just for their existing county
employees. So I would ask for the members support. Thank you, Mr.
Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not, the
question before the House is the Passage of Senate Bill 376 the House
Committee Substitute on its second reading. Submitee favoring passage of
the bill will vote aye, those opposed will vote no. The clerk will open
the vote.
Chair notes that Holloway, Dollar, Johnson, Tillis all vote aye. The
clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. Ninety-five having
voted in the affirmative, and five in the negative, the House Committee
Substitute for Senate Bill 376 passes its second reading, and will
without objection, be read a third time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham,
Representative Luebke, rise? For what purpose does the lady from
Hertford, Representative Mobley, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask the bill sponsor a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Stanly yield to the lady from
Hertford?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I noticed in your explanation you said that the
current county employees, what happens for those who might come on next
year or the year after?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry. By that I mean county employees will be
added, not retirees. Not the retirees of the county. They will be
excluded from the plan. And they’ll be covered by the county.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not, the
question before the House is the passage of the House Committee
Substitute for Senate Bill 376 on its third reading. Submitee favoring
passage of the bill will say aye, those opposed will say no. The ayes

need to account for property holding a joint tenancy in unequal shares,
to clarify the provisions for filing certified copies of probated wills
in other counties where the decedent has real property, and to delete
the statutory forms for judgment debtors claiming exemptions under
General Statute 121601, because the administrative office of the courts
already has widely used forms for that purpose, as recommended by the
General Statutes Commission and to the recommendations of the North
Carolina Bar Association to clarify their requirements for the timely
substitution of a personal representative in place of a decedent an
action pending and the decedent’s death and to clarify that the common

For what purpose does the gentlemen from Cabarrus, Representative
Pittman, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Mr. Speaker, I need to change my vote on Bill 788 to no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
OK.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
The gentleman will be recorded as having voted no on the second reading
of Senate Bill 788.
For what purpose does the lady from Yancey, Representative Presnell,

[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
I need to change my vote on 788 to no, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
The lady will be recorded as having voted no on second reading of Senate
Bill 788.
For what purpose does the gentleman from Guilford, Representative Blust,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House. This really is a simple,
non-controversial bill. It just includes recommendations from the
General Statutes Commission that we’re agreed upon during the interim
before we went into the short session. Most of it’s highly technical in
nature. I’ll be glad to try to answer any questions.
Probably the major provision, at least for a number of pages, is to
eliminate a couple of the forms for designating exemptions when someone
loses a law suit or someone files bankruptcy or for some reason needs to
exempt their property from creditors. It’s eliminating those forms,
because the administrative office of the court produces forms at their
discretion and sometimes those forms would be different, so the
commission just decided to eliminate the form that is included in the
Statute.
I’ll be happy to try to answer any questions. I ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Further discussion, further debate?
For what purpose does the gentlemen from Craven, Representative
Speciale, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
To ask if the gentleman would explain Section 1.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Does the gentleman from Guilford yield to the gentleman from Craven.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Yes, Section 1 is simply an attempt to make sure that, when someone
commits a murder, they don’t benefit in any way from their bad act. That
nothing, no property somehow will come back to the slayer from the
decedent’s estate.  That’s generally what that is, it’s just trying to
tighten it up and clarify that, that we don’t want bad actors to benefit
from their bad acts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:
Further discussion, further debate?
If not, the question for the House is the passage of the House Committee
Substitute for Senate Bill 773 on it’s second reading.
Any favoring passage of the bill will vote eye; those who oppose the
vote, no.  The court will open the vote.

is one change that is substantive however which is that instead of being
a local bill for Dare and Currituck, it became a bill for statewide.
Again, it deals with the issue of all of these timeshares becoming owned
in common which would create 10,000 owners or so. There are some
exemptions that already exist, this adds timeshares to it and it was
vetted by the bar association. I commend the bill to you.

For what purpose does the gentleman from Gaston, Rep. Hastings rise?

For a motion and to debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to state his motion and to debate the same.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I move that we do adopt the conference report, and out of respect I
wanted to say one short brief comment about the original bill that
eventually led to the LRC, and that has to do with the fact that Rep.
Fulgum was also a primary sponsor of the original bill, House bill 202,
and would appreciate your support today. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake, Rep. Martin rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much Mr. Speaker.
First of all, I'd like to thank the marine from Gaston for his work on
this bill. This has been a model for how I think the legislative process
should work. This bill's got a thorough vetting at every stop on the
process, and everyone involved in it has been very open to ideas. And in
the end, the bill that you got before  you is not at all perfect and I
think it does need a little more work, but it's definitely one that I'm
going to support. In the end, the federal recognition provisions of it
are so important and need to go forward. This is a significantly
improved version from what we had before, that this House overwhelmingly
rejected because it expands the pool from which the Governor can choose
the next Adjutant General. A Couple concerns that are still out there,
and since Rep. Whitmeyer is not here, I'm going to echo I think what one
of his concerns was, which is a highly qualified National Guard officer,
who because he or she is highly qualified, spends 5 or 6 years away from
the North Carolina National Guard on joint assignments, would by virtue
of their selection for those prestigious jobs potentially not be
eligible to be selected as the adjutant general under this bill. That
needs a little bit further look I think.
The other concern I have though is that if the governor did find a
problem that he or she believed in the North Carolina National guard
needed to be addressed by hiring someone from outside the North Carolina
National Guard, while under this version they could look to the</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I would move that we do concur with House bill
101, and I will again briefly explain this bill has been worked on with
members from the DMV, members from the House, and members from the
Senate. And again, we had a good vetting of this bill in the House
finance committee yesterday for the purpose of discussion and debate.
The objective of the bill is that currently we have 116 special
registration plates that expired July 1 of '13,  and we are opening that
process to allow some of the entities until October 1 of '14 to achieve
the number that is required. In some cases it's 300 applications, in
other cases it's 500. But also the new process will be developed after
October 1 of '14, if a constituent comes to you and wants to have a
special plate authorized, your answer will be this: They are to gather
the 300 applications, prepaid applications that will be ready to go to
DMV,  and after that, it will be up to you to file the bill to authorize
the plate. What's happened in the- currently, what's happening is many
constituents come to us and ask that we authorized a plate, that's why
we have about 116 special plates that have never materialized to be what
we would anticipate what we would want them to be. But this is a good
cleanup bill, again, it was a unanimous vote coming out of House finance
yesterday, and I would ask for your suppot.

Rep. Howard, this is a friendly question. I've got a constituent that
has approached me about changing the face of their plate. Now they've
already have a plate and they've already got over the number that would
be required. This would not apply to them, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No ma'am.

Okay, thank you.</p>

CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask the House to concur with the Senate
Committee Substitute. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman’s motion having
been stated, the gentleman is recognized to debate the motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House,
there is presently a state wide law that makes the theft of a Venus
flytrap a misdemeanor. When this body passed House Bill 1059, it was, it
had two components. One was making the theft of a Venus flytrap a Class
A felony. The other had to deal with the occupancy tax in New Hanover
County. When it came back from the Senate, the Senate had PCSd it,
taking out the Venus flytrap section but keeping the room occupancy tax
section. I have talked with the Senate President pro tempore staff this
morning. The rationale for doing that was what the Senate would like to
do, and they are in fact working on a bill that would be connected to
their regulatory reform bill that they’re building now. That will
disregard the misdemeanor statewide statute and replace it with a
statewide statute making it a Class A felony for the theft of a Venus
flytrap. So I would much rather have a statewide bill rather than a
local bill, so that’s why I ask that we concur. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Catlin, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Out of respect for my
colleague, I disagree. I think that a room occupancy tax changes are not
sufficient for New Hanover County. It basically takes money that was set
aside in kind of a locked up, unaffiliated area and now it goes to
travel and tourism. And they’ve agreed to give some of it back to ??
maintenance but I don’t know if that’s going to happen for sure. I would
actually like to be able to come back in the long session and fix this
more properly. So I would vote not to concur. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hamilton, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. With all due respect to
my colleague, Representative Catlin from New Hanover County, I’m rising
to encourage everyone to concur on this vote. We have reached consensus
among all the beach towns, the county commissioners in the City of
Wilmington. They’re behind this bill, they’re satisfied with the outcome
of the changes to the room occupancy tax, and we’re ready to move
forward. I appreciate your green vote. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Davis, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ?? motion please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion a
second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I would just like to say that in looking
at this, I had discussed prior to introducing the room occupancy tax
section of House Bill 1059, I had spoken on two different occasions with
the County Manager for New Hanover County, the county staff, and
Representatives from the beach communities, the City of Wilmington, and
the tourism bureau authority that governs the use of the room occupancy
tax funds. We’re all on the same page. They all agree to the language
that I presented. I see no reason whatsoever not to concur and let’s
move forward. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further
debate. If not, the question before the House is the motion to concur in
the Senate Committee Substitute number 2 to House Bill 1059. All in
favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote.
[PAUSE] The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote.</p>

Voted in the affirmative and 16 in the negative. The house has concurred
and Senate committee substitute number two for House Bill 1059. The bill
will be in vote. Ladies and chair understands that there are still
amendments being prepared for technical amendments, or the technical
corrections. Any member who wishes to prepare an amendment for technical
corrections will be allowed to do so by informing the clerk, either by
providing them with the amendment or the intent to have an amendment
prepared by 11:00. That's 15 minutes. And again, ladies and gentlemen,
to be clear, that is simply to inform the clerk that you are preparing
an amendment.
Either you're in possession of the amendment or issued an to prepare an
amendment. You have 15 minutes to determine if that's something you'd
like to do. The chair will entertain any amendments to amendments that
are passed, however that will come afterwards, because that means we're
talking to a different substance. Senate Bill 793, The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To the president of the Senate, the speaker of the
house of representatives, the conferee is appointed to resolve the
differences between the Senate and the House of Representatives on
Senate Bill 793. A bill to be entitled and active to provide that a
teacher employed by a charter school may serve as a non-voting member.
The board of directors the charter school, et al. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representatives Hardester, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
To make a motion and to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  The
gentlemen is recognized for a motion and to debate the motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members, you may recall this bill passed
the House a few weeks ago. It went to conference. It makes a variety of
technical changes to charter school laws. There were changes made in
conferee but the overall content of the bill remains the same. The bill
primarily focuses on charter school approval transparency and
operational procedures.
The conference report passed the Senate on unanimous note 45 to 0. I
think it's a good bill and I'd appreciate your support of conference
report. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Davis. This
gentleman have the light on for the... Representative Cotham, please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and members. That was a pretty brief
synopsis of a pretty big bill. So congratulations Representative
Hardister. You're learning how things work here. And I'm going to
violate those rules today and talk about this bill, this conference
report and ask you not to adopt the conference report.
A little bit of history, as you all know charter schools were originally
created to be labs of innovation. To look at what's going well in our
schools, what's not. Let's try some new things, let's see if it works.
Let's hopefully share that information with our traditional schools. All
with the interest of improving student achievement in holding everyone
accountable. And in a lot of ways, in North Carolina, at a lot of great
charter schools that we have in our state, they're doing that. And
that's something we should be proud of. North Carolina, when the
democrats were in charge, preceded very cautiously when it came to
adopting and accepting new charter schools. Some people said we were a
little too cautious, and so when the republicans took over, we saw a lot
of sweeping changes, when it came to charter school laws. And the number
of charters we could have, and what these charters would look like and
what they would not look like.
As a result, there's been some problems, some confusion, and some
modifications that needed to be made. And that's kind of where we are
today. So this conference reports corrects some problems, explains
somethings, but leaves a lot out. I was a conferee on this conference
report, and I take that role very seriously. And with honor. I was very
disappointed.</p>

<p id="040:00">
And a few things that happened, and I know there are political
differences and we come from different walks of life, but I could not
sign this conference report.  And that's the first time that I've ever
not signed a conference report, and I did not take that decision
lightly.  Because just as I voted for your budget, I do try to really
look at things with overall what can I live with what can I not live
with.  And there were two big issues in this conference report that I
cannot accept.
The first one is the discrimination clause.  And that's going to be
talked about more by one of my colleagues, but I believe that all
children are children of God.  I really do believe that.  And I think
that we should not discriminate against any child or anyone in general,
and so that gave me great pause and I did vote against that, in the
conference report.  I was the only no, but I still was a no.
But the second issue that I am going to focus a little bit more on,
really kinda sent my brain spiraling and running and asking a lot of
questions, which is a dangerous time for me because I like to think
about processes and patterns, and I got a hint of some things that might
be happening or could happening, and that all revolves around
transparency.  I believe that public money should be transparent, and
that we are responsible to the taxpayers.  And so if a charter school,
lets say, is operated by what we call an EMO, an Educational Management
Organization, that's a for profit company.  If they operate a charter
school, and have their teachers, and will now have to disclose their
teachers salaries.  Which I think is fine and good, and that was really
never the biggest source of heartburn that many people had.  The problem
comes in with those non-teachers, and that public money, and where it's
going and what we as taxpayers and those whom we are responsible for
looking out for.  Where are those tax dollars going?  And is there
transparency?  So I started of thinking about this, and as someone who
is a sitting principal, and has a principal license, if I had a charter
school, and had an EMO for profit company with charter schools, I would
have my staff my teachers and they would again be subject to public
records.  But then, hypothetically of course, I could hire my friends
and family maybe even some of you, to work for me at my private charter
school.  As subject employees of this company, this EMO, this company -
which lets be mindful is still getting public money.  So the money is
flowing.  And I could pay you whatever we want.  Whatever we agree upon.
Now is this am I trying to say all charters are doing this?  Absolutely
not.  Absolutely not.  But even if one is doing it, with public taxpayer
dollars, shouldn't that be a problem?  Shouldn't that cause us concern,
because yesterday I heard so many of you talk about, we are responsible
for public dollars, and we don't want someone to use public dollars for
their own economic impact, and that was my good friend from Gaston
county who said that.  And so, I ask you the same thing when it comes to
charter schools.  There's too many questions around transparency, and so
if there are too many questions around transparency, then it likely says
we're not transparent.  And that's really the issue here.
And so the senate got this bill very quickly they didn't know it was
coming, there was a nice little quick presentation.  Everybody was told
it was good, we're moving, we fixed the problems, move on they voted
45-0.  Then my phone started ringing last night off the hook of oh my
gosh what happened.  School systems started calling other members myself
asking questions, and I just think that if we have so much confusion, if
we're making the law some ambiguous if we're having so much ambiguity,
why why are we doing this?  And</p>

<p id="045:00">
again, we are responsible to the taxpayer dollars. And I think that this
should give all of us cause and pause, and we should say yes. We believe
in transparency, we believe in accountability, we don't want a school
that's set up in Wilmington to get upwards of $15 million of public
money where those EMO salaries go to have 99% public money. To pay
whomever they want, how much every they want, and we know nothing.
Doesn't that give any of us concern? Is that really any of us being
transparent? Our own governor told that newspaper that he would veto
this bill if public disclosure was not in there, and I hope he will
stand to his word. And so I really ask you to really think about that,
and support public tax dollars, but going for public good. For public
education, and really knowing where our money really is going. Because
if the money flows, then we should know where it goes. And that's not
happening. And that's a serious problem. That's an ethical problem for
me, and I could not support this conference report. And so you might
hear some things. Well, we have disclosure. Well, they're going to be
the same as everybody else. Not exactly. And there's a reason why this
is probably all happening today or the attempt yesterday until I
objected. I noticed in an article that I read in a newspaper that a
public records was filed for a certain for-profit charter entity, and
they said that they would respond, and give all this information over
next week. So if this bill passes today, if the Governor changes his
veto stance and signs it, then it becomes law. And then that charter
school, knowing what they probably knew, they're not going to give over
those records next week. Because now they don't have to, because we just
said they don't. I have a problem with that, and I hope that you will
too. I ask you not to adopt the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Meyer, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I'd like to ask Rep. Hardister a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Hardister, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Rep. Hardister.
When we debated this bill in the House, we had a little bit of
controversy about protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered
students. We had a great moment of unanimity where we found a compromise
amendment to take care of our concerns. We voted 115-0 to support that
amendment thanks to Rep. Ramsey. And now when this comes back to us, it
appears that those protections are gone. Why would we support a
conference report where that unanimous stand that we took has been
stricken from the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Meyer, thank you for the question.
When we voted on that amendment, it was- I have the language here. It
was- would it- okay, here's what it say. &quot;A charter school should
not discriminate against any student respect to any category protected
under the United States Constitution under Federal law applicable to the
states.&quot; And the conference committee, we felt like we don't need
to subject that kind of policy in a charter school bill, because it
could have broad effect. And so, we felt that's something that ought to
be taken up in a long session. If we're gonna mirror Federal law, that's
something that ought  to be vetted, debated, go through the process, so
what we did as a compromise in the conference committee is we decided to
take existing state law as it applies to traditional public schools and
apply that to charter schools. And that's what we have in the bill now.
Mr. Speaker, may I debate the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My concern is that we did have a thorough process where our  amendment
to provide protections for LGBT students was thoroughly debated by this
body, we debated that over 2 days, in fact. And we passed an amendment
unanimously. Our job is to make state law. And the existing state law
does not protect LGBT students in the course of enrollment, or even just
maintaining enrollment in charter schools. I believe that this body
stood up for protecting those students, and we should continue to stand
up for protecting those students, and</p>

We should vote not to concur to provide our best effort to tell our
colleagues in the Senate that we value justice for all students. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Brandon.  Please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  To ask Representative Hardister a question please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Hardister does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Yes sir.  Representative Hardister you said there
were some provisions that you guys had put under existing state law.
Can you explain what state law and on the follow-up question you said
that it was going to create a broad affect.  Can you explain broad
affect when it comes to the Constitution and protecting children and
what broad effect with that actually affect.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Okay, thanks for the question.  To be a 100 percent
honest with you I’m not sure what type of broad affect but I think when
we subject our state laws to adopting into our state law, any type of
federal law bringing it into the state of North Carolina I think we need
to be very judicious about that and because I’m not an attorney it’s
kind of hard for me to explain but in the conference committee we said
this could  have consequences across the state, not just for charter
schools, but for other, other parts of the state in North Carolina and
it would be affected by  taking in the federal law. So, to be honest
with you I’m not one hundred percent sure.   I think there's nobody in
this body that wants to see anybody discriminated based on who they are
as a person.  But I think it's sensible to say that we have in the state
of North Carolina law that will protect people from discrimination that
applies to traditional public schools and has for a long time and so we
took that and applied it  to charter schools in this bill.  I believe
Representative Lewis passed out a document that everybody should have on
their desk that  touches on this and I  would say Mister Speaker  I
spoke to Representative  Lewis of  before starting debate and he said he
may want to speak to this,  he can probably speak with more authority
than I can.  What I can say Representative  Brandon is that I want to do
what's right for all children regardless of who they are and a
background in who they are as a person but when you get into federal law
versus state law, and so on and so forth  for some of us it’s kind of
hard to wrap our head around and we want to be very judicious about what
were doing so I think the spirit, the intent of where, at least I’m
coming from with this bill is the same as yours and beyond that, I would
just say that again we’re trying to take discrimination law in  North
Carolina existing and apply it to charter schools and then when we move
on to the next session, I would commit to work with anyone who wants to
take a look at can we strengthen those laws can we strengthen laws or
expand upon laws in  any way that would help protect our children from
discrimination, but again, Mister Speaker, I may see if Representative
Lewis, would like to explain the document that he has passed out. I
believe he could probably explain this better than I can.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Brandon I understand that
Representative Lewis is going to speak momentarily.   I think he is
going to address that you can either direct then or see if the question
is answered that time,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I will address,  I will not yield to Representative
Lewis to explain where LGBT folks are protected in this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative would the, does the gentleman with to
debate or has he redirected the question.  Representative Lewis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]   ?? the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Lewis does the gentleman wish to yield
to the gentleman from Guilford in response to the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Brandon I believe you asked where the
nondiscrimination language appears in this bill, and I'm sorry I was
trying to listen to what you said but  I wasn’t sure if you were going
to ask or I was going to speak. So let me just take a shot and if I
don't get where you asked I’ll try again. Discrimination against anyone
at anytime for anything is wrong.  It's against the law it’s defined in
state statute, numerous times exactly the way it is defined in this
bill.  State law in no statute, in no section of existing law and this
get part to what Representative Meyer asked in no part of existing law
does the kind of language that</p>

<p id="055:00">
You ask about appear. So this bill provides the exact same protection
that was what we as I listen to the could debate on this bill. I heard
two things I heard one we want the charter schools the public charter
schools to be subject to same kind of rules that the traditional public
school are that what this language does. This language does protect all
kids and as I said there is no other statue that speaks to the kind of
language that you have ask about. You know because you have been here
several years now we often as we draft bills attempt the manic or to
reiterate existing language in bills that's what this bill does.
[SPEAKER CHNAGES] Thank you. Can I speak on the bill?
[SPEAKER CHNAGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHNAGES] The problem is here is that we can pull from state law
as much as we want to pull from state law and we can imply that this
does protect all kids the problem in the state of north Carolina is that
the LGPT community is not a protected class. There is no state law that
protects it. We have national origin. We have religion we have sex we
have race but we don't have that protected class room. So there is
nothing we are pulling from that's the reason why we have to pull from
federal law because the state of North Carolina does it protect LGPT
students or people for that matter. A principal of a charter school
regardless of what this bill says can say because there is no protection
that we are not taking LGPT students like we just had to happen in
Wilmington day we are not taking gay students and he wanted to take
public money and he was able to say that. That same principal could not
get up and say I am not taking black children. That would be illegal but
he was able to get up and say we are not taking gay students and it was
totally legal and he doesn't have to take them and he won't and that is
the problem.
[SPEAKER CHNAGES] Representative Iler please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHNAGES] Pro panic question to.
[SPEAKER CHNAGES] Representative Brandon is the gentleman you?
[SPEAKER CHNAGES] Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHNAGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHNAGES] Okay representative Brandon in fair of channeling
former representative Luebke confused. So you're furniture school that
was gonna deny abbess to gay students it was charter school or a
Christian school what was that?
[SPEAKER CHNAGES] A private school taking public school for ventures and
the debate was city was gonna take public money from ventures. Was he
still able to discriminate against LGPT students and he decided not to
take public money so he can continue to discriminate.
[SPEAKER CHNAGES] Follow up question.
[SPEAKER CHNAGES] Does the gentleman you.
[SPEAKER CHNAGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHNAGES] Gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHNAGES] No recollection it was a Christian school not a church
school. Additional question is something changed in last few years that
we still emit students to charter school by lottery have we changed that
so we can pick and choose and by lottery.
[SPEAKER CHNAGES] Lot of charter schools start does start not even have
to have a lottery. I have charter school we don't have a lottery not a
capacity yet. The problem here is this do I expect I have been living in
this for all for 39 years do I expect a school to get up and do the
school Wilmington did know I know that as the exception but that's the
region why we make laws I don't expect may be two or three charter
school to even say such a thing but if they do say such a thing we have
to a have a law to protect it and right now we do not that same
principal in Wilmington will regardless it's a private school of it's a
private school he still cannot get up and say I don't take school
children even it's a private school he can't say that he can't say I am
not gonna say certain people because who they are because that's not
American and that's not the constitution. He still said it and there's
no protection for that student regardless of who they are it doesn't
matter if you are public private charter virtual whatever. You should
never be able to discriminate and based on anybody and we have a law and
we have a policy and in state of North Carolina that a man can stand up
and in front of his school and say I am not taking these children and
that is ridiculous it should never happen that way we have protection
for every child except the LGPT child. I am not coming back here but
what I would say is that</p>

<p id="060:00">
This policy that we have in this bill is not… I understand what
Hardister is saying, “Are we going to bring this into the charter school
bill?” I understand that argument. But the problem is is that there are
no protections. And if you really are serious about making sure that the
Constitution applies to everybody, you don’t go and select and choose
who the Constitution applies to, and who the Constitution does not apply
to.
“Oh, it’s too broad. Or it’s this, it’s that.” And we make all these
excuses on why we don’t protect people. But protections are part of the
Constitution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield to a follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I hope this is the last one. So you are, given the
conversation the answer that I heard, you are still in agreement that
the Charter school has the same protections that a traditional public
school has? These other schools are private, Christian, other kinds of
schools, are not part of this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, I don’t agree with that because we don’t have the
protection. They can say it. I mean even though we say… In order for
them to not be able to do it, you would have to have a law saying that
they can’t, and we don’t have that law. The public school doesn’t do it
because the public school it doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s not
there. We had to put bullying laws in.
We still have a long way to go with that. Just because the public school
takes them, and they have to take them, doesn’t mean that a charter
school has to take them. A charter school can deny people. And if they
go to court right now and say, “Hey look we’re not taking this gay
student.” There is nothing in our policy that says that they have to.
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
So if they went to court about this today, and said, “Somebody get up
and show me where that school would have to take an LGBT student?”
There’s nothing in our law. You could see it, you could read it, it’s
all in black and white. It tells you who it protects. And what it does
not protect is the LGBT student. It just doesn’t.
No matter how much we want to apply it. No matter how much we really
want to assert it. And no matter how much we have it in our heart that
we want to protect all students, it is not in the language. And if it’s
not in the language, anybody can do it. And that’s just where it is.
So folks, I’m not going to do this, I’m not going to go through a whole
long debate about it. I appreciate your 115, nothing vote on equality.
But the real issue here is the LGBT community is not a protected class.
You can’t draw something from nothing. Don’t fool yourself. That stuff
is not in this bill because it’s not written. And any judge and any
court will allow any school and entity to say, “We can discriminate on
that simply because it’s not protected.”
And like I said, the case in Wilmington. Regardless if it’s a private
school. Just understand this, that principal in Wilmington could not get
up and say, “I don’t take black children. I don’t take Jewish.” He can’t
say that. But he could get up and say, “I don’t take gay children.” You
deal with that and let me know if you’re OK with that. You let me know
if you’re OK with that. For somebody to stand up in front of their
school and say, “We’re not taking you because of who you are.” You all
deal with that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Langdon, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman’s recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think the question, of course, is do we have a law
in North Carolina that says public charter schools cannot discriminate?
And that is true. They cannot discriminate. And I think we’re getting
off the subject of what is really the law here. So I would hope as you
consider the Conference Report that you actually consider that very
point. Discrimination cannot be done.
I understand what Representative Brandon was saying, I don’t have a
problem, there are issues sometimes, but the state law’s pretty clear.
And I hope you will consider that when you take your vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lewis please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the adoption of the Conference Report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
House, obviously this is a very important issue to everyone in here. And
I’ve listened very closely to the debate on this issue and on other
issues that we’ve done this year. And I just want to make a few points.

<p id="065:00">
By the lady from Mecklenburg, was that it maintained a different
standard of public record inspection and access for the public charter
schools than the traditional public schools, this corrects that, this
corrects that. The point that is being discussed about contract-type
employees, this would be no different than if the Harnett county schools
were to contract with SAS or with IBM to come in and redesign their
computer system. The contract that the Harnett county schools signed
with SAS would be fully-disclosable to the public. Any contract for
management type, be it janitorial services, administrative services,
that are signed by public charter school is fully, fully-disclosable as
a part of the public record. Now, let's go back to the contract with SAS
again, while you as a citizen have the right to see the contract that
the Harnett schools may have signed with SAS, you don't have the right
to see what SAS pays its people to carry out the contract, and not only
do you not have the right to do it for the charter schools or the
traditional schools, you don't have the right to do it for any other
agency or branch of the state of North Carolina. We heard you loud and
clear, you want the charter schools held to the same standard as the
traditional public schools, that's what you said, that's what the
governor said, that's what this bill does. I also want to speak again
briefly, on the non-discriminatory language that's in this bill.
Discrimination, I said this before, but I think it bears repeating,
discrimination against anyone, at any time, for any reason, is wrong, is
wrong. It's already forbidden by state law, by federal law, by numerous
court decisions that have come down, and it's not gonna happen. This
bill, this bill, is not respectfully the vehicle to start to try and
enumerate different classes of people. This bill treats everybody the
same, every person who wants to go to a public charter schools is
allowed to go, period. And, you know, I listen closely to the debate
yesterday, and one of the things that I heard that were that we're not a
rubber stamp for the Senate. And I agree with that, that was very well
said. But this Congress report, was adopted by the Senate 45-0, I heard
the same gentleman I believe, try to differentiate between Conservatives
and uber-Conservatives, so I have to ask, which one of the minority
party in the Senate, are they just the regular Democrats, or are they
the uber-Democrats? I don't know. All I'm saying is, this conference
report that we have before us, and this motion to adopt it is a
straightforward, simple request to make a few changes in the charter
school law, and please let me reiterate two points, first of all, the
objections that were heard when this bill was first passed, is that this
objects charter schools to a different level of scrutiny and public
inspection than traditional public school, this conference report fixes
that. Charter schools are now subject to the same exact disclosure that
traditional public schools are, and I might add, every other state
agency is, very important to note, and since again, there's been, and I
respect, and I've made a statement similar to this, I respect the
passion, and I reject the past abuses</p>

And discrimination and attempts to classify people into groups and to
treat those groups differently. But this bill, this bill merely says We
don’t do that. We don’t allow it now in this State. And we’re not going
to allow it going forward. This is a good conference report. This shows
legitimately listening to the objections that were put out there. Treat
the charters the same. That’s what you said. Treat the charters the
same. This treats the charters the same. This protects the public’s
right to know. This protects the public money that flows to these public
charter schools which educate our kids. And I would urge you to let’s
adopt this report.

The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen of the House, this argument has
gone on as before this body made a, added something to this bill that
the Senate decided to take out and put something else in there. But the
argument comes down to somebody just argued the fact that it means, that
you not going to discriminate against anybody. What does discrimination
mean? Why do we have to specify those areas where discrimination is
identified. It’s because discrimination like all other wording in a lot
of instances, is not specific. It’s not specific. If you say I’m not
going to discriminate against you, why am I not going to discriminate
against you? Am I not going to discriminate against you because you’re
white? Or because you’re gay? Or because your creed doesn’t say that I
should – What does it mean? What you’re doing is saying, you are
defining. You are defining what discrimination means. And you do it
every day. You got it in here. You say a charter school shall not
discriminate against any student on the basis of ethnicity, national
origin, gender, or disability. It doesn’t say anything about sex. It
doesn’t say actually anything about color. Ethnicity is different from
color. What you’ve got here is something that this House finally decided
to do. And the Senate decided they wanted to change it and put it back
like it was. These words that you put in here have specific meaning.
Sexual orientation. Everybody shies away from sexual orientation. But if
you discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and you don’t
discrimination on the basis of race, have you discriminated or have you
not discriminated? That’s what the problem is here. That’s why you have
to be specific in what you do and what you say and how these things
operate. We need to go back to the language, and I would admit to you as
a lawyer that I’m not totally satisfied with what we passed out of here,
but at least, at least it was a move in the right direction and the
Senate now wants to change the direction that you made on that. And I
think that Representative Cotham made an impassioned prius?? On why you
should not concur on this and go back to where we originally were in
this bill. And not have the Senate run roughshod over us as they seem to
be trying to do right now. I mean if you’re going to, just get
everything back to them. Let them do it and we can go home.

House Bill 1133 will be read
A bill to be entitle and enacted to make corrections to the general
statutes and session laws
REp ??? state your purpose
To debate the bill. Recognized
Thank you members. This is a lengthy bill and ill try to do this asap
but at the same time i need discussion. members of the house rules
committee can attest that was our longest meeting yesterday, in years
past rep ?? pointed this out I remember we would get the technical
corrections bill on our desk and it was too hot to touch because it was
off the printer. I will credit two speakers, speaker ??? made it so the
thing wont come flying on the floor and sllowed it to sit around and
folks could hear it. THe good news is is it signals the end of session
which is the last thing we do, its nice we do this before the leaves
turn outside. The way this bill has been developed its been a workgroup
and central staff both in the seante and house working through trying to
find technical corrections. There are some other chagnes but this has
been the process of several weeks and many of you hav emade suggestions
on both sides of the aisle that have been lost in the shuffle. So what
you have is some ways is partially consensus and this has been a work in
progress and thank the house rules committee yesterday who gave
deliberate debate. Ex there was one provision having to do with
optomistrists caught the provision would accidentally do more. This bill
has had a lot of work and vetting and the result is waht you see before
you. A number of amendments I am fine with and some I will be oppposing.
First off I can make life simple to part 1. These are general statute
commission reccommendations. THis is section 1 to section 17 and those
are all GSE references and they are purely technical. They are similar
to rep ?? presented and some provisions are identical and ended up in
both bills so theres no harm we pass it twice. Part 2 we start out and
ill try to make it quick and I do beleive the bill summary is accessible
on your dashboard so ill be reading but i will try to</p>

<p id="080:00">
Try to cut it short when I can. Section 18 is very simply fixing an
incorrect reference to a civil procedure rule, and also spells out the
standing of legislative officers at the appellate level. We passed
legislation to give legislative officers standing at the trial court
level and it was unclear where we were on the appellate cases so that’s
what that’s about. 18.5 deals with jurisdictional amount. We had a bill
last year that change the jurisdictional amount for superior court from
10,000 to 25. This is corresponding language for that. Section 19, and I
think there’s even an amendment. I don’t know if Representative Halsey
is still going to run his amendment on Section 19 or not. I’ve heard he
is. Okay, he’s nodding affirmatively. Let me spend a couple minutes on
Section 19. Section 19 amends the provision, allowing a plaintiff to
serve a motion to dismiss an appeal on a summary ?? action, if the
defendant has failed to do specified things. What the current law says,
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham arise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just to correct the record. I’m not running an
amendment. I don’t know if anyone else is. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So noted.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Then I’ll take it from two minutes to 30 seconds, to
explain it. I think there was probably a misunderstanding what it did.
Let me tell you what it does do. Right now if somebody gets evicted and
they appeal their case for the magistrate to district court, they have
to post a bond so that they can’t just continue to live somewhere for
free. And this doesn’t affect that. What this issue does is let’s say
someone gets evicted because they’re engaging in illegal activity.
They’re doing drugs or whatever it is. One condition that can also be
imposed on the appeal is that the person not be using the house still as
a drug house. And if they violate a condition of the appeal, then that’s
a basis that it can be dismissed. But there’ve been interpretations that
had been rendered by what we’ve been hearing is that cases, people were
still being in houses, appeals still being pending, where illegal
activity was occurring. So this was causing problems not only for land
owners but also for the courts, the magistrates, and the district court
judges were growing frustrated, feeling there was nothing they could do.
So that’s what this language is about. Section 20, what we’ve done is
expanded the list of offenses that magistrates can hear as opposed to a
district court judge. We’ve done that to be more efficient with our
judge’s time. This adds open burning offences to that list. Section 21
clarifies that indigent defense services can pay for the services of a
guardian ad litem, who’s been appointed to represent a parent or
respondent in a DSS case, that they thought they had the authority,
there was some confusion about whether they did or didn’t. This just
clarifies it. Section 22, which I believe there is going to be an
amendment by Representative Martin, and I’ll debate the merits of that
later. It repeals the child vitality task force, effective June 30,
2015. And then there’s a whole session that conforms to that. I will
tell the body that there was some interest in making the repeal
immediate. The reason that the June 30, 2015 date was picked was to give
it time so that if the body next year wanted to extend the child
vitality task force, the body could do so. Because we’ll be back here in
January. This isn’t effective ‘til June but again we can debate the
merits of that proposal when Representative Martin sends forward his
amendment. Section 23 is an interesting provision that was requested by
our sheriffs. And what it does is it authorizes the jails to give or
sell vapor products to inmates who are involved in an authorized smoking
cessation program. Those are the e-cigs, they don’t have any second-hand
effects, and the jails believe, the sheriffs believe this will help them
with discipline issues and just trying to serve as an incentive that
they can use, apparently smoking is, I ?? attorneys. I can tell you when
I’ve gone to see clients in jail who are facing five years in prison,
sometimes they’re more worried about getting a cigarette than what’s
going to happen. I’ve seen it. But anyway, this is a way I guess to kind
of try to fix two problems. Section 23.5 makes some changes to the ??
statutes about who has to provide information to the national criminal
background check. Section 24 makes modifications to the concealed
handgun permits. Right now the AOC is directed to prescribe the forms.
What this does is this makes it so that the SBI’s responsible for
prescribing the forms. That was found there were some issues with that.</p>

<p id="085:00">
section 24.5, this has to do with disposition of seized firearms. Right
now under current law, the way the statute's written, you have a trial,
person's either convicted or acquitted, whatever, and there's a gun, and
let's say the police department wants to be able to sell that gun. We
passed a law, I think a year ago, to fix that. The current law says the
police agency has to submit the writing- the request in writing in order
to be able to sell the weapon. What this does, it gets rid of the
request in writing because what's happening is most time if you're in
court, if a person goes in and enters a plea or whatever happens at the
end of the trial, the district attorney'll say &quot;Your honor, this
gun,&quot; or whatever, &quot;was seized, we need to know what to do
with it.&quot; and the Judge will say, and they'll say the police
department, law enforcement's asked for it, and the judge says &quot;All
right, I order the gun be turned over to the ?? county Sherriff's
office&quot;, whoever. This conforms with the practices opposed to
something required to be written in- put in writing.
The section 26 deletes the requirement to keep fingerprint records after
expunctions. What had happened was it was found- the expunctions statute
is where a criminal charge or in some cases a conviction, but most of
the time just a charge is erased from somebody's record. There was a lag
where the fingerprint records would still show up, so somebody had gone
through the process of expunction, the court had granted it, they still
do a background check, and because the fingerprint records still show up
it still hits and would show that there was something. So this fixes
that.
Section 27 just changes who transmits records to SBI.
28 is technical.
28.3 and 28.5 are conforming to federal law with commercial drivers'
license.
Section 29 comes at the request of DOT to delay part of the
implementation of the electronic lien system, they just can't be ready.
Section 30 treats independent car dealers the same as franchise car
dealers.
Section 31 I believe comes to us courtesy of Rep. Szoka. This amends the
definition of a home loan to basically say that this has to do with
mortgage issues, that if a mobile home which is secured by- the debt is
secured by a lien against the title and it's a mobile home that's
affixed, that it's given the same protection that is accorded to a
permanently built house. And I think my real estate expert directly in
the rear is giving me the thumbs up that he concurs with that
explanation.
Section 32 clarifies the standing of a litigant in an action pending
against the decedent, and how you go about substituting the personal
representative.
32.5 is purely technical.
Section 33 is a very good thing we're doing. It probably is not getting
the accolade it deserves, but what it does is it will allow property
held by a husband and wife and tenants by entirety that is placed into a
trust to enjoy the same protection that it would have if it was simply
held in tenants by entirety. I won't get into the long explanation, I
can tell you that in our meeting we spent a very long time discussing it
and that. But this is a very positive change in- for allowing that.
The section 34 is a complicated provision that is technical having to do
the trust, if anyone would like to explain that they are welcome to
stand up and do so.
Section 36 authorizes a settlement ??- this is the one about real estate
closings. Presently there's been an interpretation, and I don't recall
who came down with the interpretation, but there was an interpretation
that came from somebody that said at a real estate closing where you-
and most folks here have bought a house before, refinanced, done
something, you have a closing, and there's a certain amount of money
that gets placed in that lawyer's trust account. And from that money,
the lawyer would pay to get the deed recorded, would pay out of it like
the survey, if you have somebody like a ?? or an engineer come in, you
know, like those engineers that make all that money, they get paid out
of the closing sometimes. The realtor gets paid, and what the law did-
what this does, it says it's legal for the attorney to pay those funds
out of the trust account. There'd been some interpretation saying that
the attorney needs to advance those funds and they'd get reimbursed. So
this is one, Rep. Hager, where engineers, realtors, and lawyers are all
on the same side. This is a good day.
The- I won't tell my engineer ??

Thank you Mr. Speaker. This amendment was contained in another bill that
come through the house several weeks ago. It was in house bill 1224
which was written in Presnell's bill. It basically puts in the evergreen
JMAC funds because we're a little worried about what may happen to house
bill 1224 now it’s been modified by the Senate. And Mr. Speaker if
Representative Presnell would like to add more I would gladly accept it.

I actually obtained a fiscal, I was concerned about the bill, I actually
voted against the bill. Although I'm glad you're introducing it to this

whether that's within the realm of reality or not I don't know, but I
did obtain that.

Thank you Mr. Speaker. It would be, have had a chance to review these
amendments. I believe the amendment would be in order that it would not
require referral or appropriations or anything. The bill is properly
before us. There is no fiscal note. The gentleman does not have standing
to request a fiscal not. But I believe the speaker pro teme is already
advised in obtaining the fiscal note realized it was no, there was no
kind of appropriation ??. I would just encourage the chair to rule the
amendment in order and roll on.

Representative Holley, recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker and this amendment does one thing and what it
does is require that we continue our state policy to allow consideration
of physically handicapped contractors, women contractor, small
contractors, minority contractors and that they be allowed to
participate in the process.  As you look at the bill, you’ll see that
that requirement has been removed from the Department of Commerce as
they do economic development and that’s something that’s required
throughout our state contracts, there’s a reason why we have that
procedure and policy and again that is to help those groups that pay
their taxes have an opportunity to compete in our contracting system.
We know state government is the biggest business in the state. These are
all small business and job creators in our community and so I’d ask that
you support the amendment out to take the exemption out and put it back
in the same footing with the rest of our state government practices.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, for what purpose does Representative Murry from Wake arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You’re recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I agree with contracting provisions that we have
and the department administration, the Department of Commerce has asked
the Department of Administration about the contracting process between
the Department of Commerce and the public private partnership that the
Department of Congress has entered into.  And the Department of
Administration readily acknowledges that this is a different contract,
this is not a procurement contract.  That Representative Holley has
referred to.  Man y of the other minority and small business owned
provisions that we have in the contracting law, this is a much different
entity.  When we passed the budget the first year the budget refers to,
the economic development partnership that has been worked on.  This
economic development partnership has made offers, job offers to existing
state employees to come over.  This would interject a relevant
uncertainty to those who have been offered jobs. We could have dozen of
people lose jobs because if this provision is adopted.  And so I would
ask that you vote against this amendment.  Allow the Department of
Commerce to move forward with this public private contracting process
and make sure that they’re moving at the speed of business not at the
speed of government.  And that’s the whole goal of this economic
development process. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does Representative Luebke of Durham arise? For what
purpose does Representative Michaux of Durham arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Representative Murry I guess a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Murry, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let me be sure in what I’m saying, this is Section 57 that we are
talking about is that right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My question to you sir, what is actually covered under Section 57?
Because the way I read it, it says that the Department of Commerce says
is authorized to contract with a North Carolina non-profit to provide
one or more of the partner’s functions.  Then the significant part of
his is, the contract entered into pursuant to this section is exempt
from Articles 3 and 3c of Chapter 143 of the General Statue.  And my
question is, Articles 3 and 3c, from 143 deal with the whole operation
of the Department of Commerce and what your doing is your exempting this
contractor from filing anything that they put in there.  That’s what is
appear to me.  Is that true?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s not how I read the section, Representative Michaux.  How I read
it is a specific, this contract that we’re dealing with is specific to
the Department of Commerce being authorized to contract with a North
Carolina non-profit organization to perform various functions.  So this
section deals strictly with that non-profit corporation. That the
Department of Commerce is contracting with to develop economic
functions. All the other actions that you’re talking about that the
Department of Commerce is engaged with aren’t subject to this section.
This is strictly dealing with the contract between the Department of
Commerce and the non-profit corporation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand that.  Which means that any contract that the Commerce
department’s enters into with this non-profit North Carolina corporation
is not subject to any of the other restrictions or anything else like
bidding and whatnot, outlined in Article 3 and 3c of Chapter 143.  It
exempts them from adhering to any of those items in there.</p>

Well, if you exempt that entity then that entity, it’s a rolling ball
that gets bigger and bigger as it goes downhill. We cannot continue to
eliminate and get around the rules of the state of North Carolina; that
rules that were set here in the General Assembly to protect all of our
citizens and to exclude or possibly keep somebody from just seeking a
contract and that’s what some of this does. It’s wrong and I vote to
take this out of the amendment because of the damage that it can do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. For what purpose does Representative
Speciale of Craven arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re recognized to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually, I’d like to ask a question of Representative
Murry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Murry, do you yield? Proceed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just wanna make sure that I understand it and
hopefully that everybody understands what we’ve got here. This is
talking about the contract that the department of commerce is going to
make with one entity that is going to assist the state in economic
development. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is not talking about any contracts that that
entity might make with other entities on behalf of the state. Correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s correct. It doesn’t impact other contracts that
the department of commerce might enter into. The operations of the
public-private partnership are governed in the contract between the
state and the department of commerce. There’s a whole host of
requirements that are gonna be between the state and between this
public-private partnership which will govern actions of the P3. The
department of commerce enters into dozens of contracts. This provision
doesn’t impact contracts that are entered into by the department of
commerce. For other aspects, this only impacts the relationship between
the P3 and the department of commerce.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, so again and I know I’m being simple here by us
going over this a couple of times but I wanna make sure that I
understand and everyone else understands. This paragraph, this exemption
only applies to the one contractor. This non-profit entity that they are
contracting to assist the department of commerce.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It applies to no other contracts that the department
of commerce is gonna have with anyone else.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does Representative Millis of Pender
arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re recognized to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I listened to debate; one thing I wanna point to all
the members here is make sure we understand; if you actually read
chapter 143, article 3 and 3c here, that we’re talking about is that
this very provision does not eliminate anyone’s opportunity to receive
this contract. The opportunity is available for all. This specific
provision which I support this amendment whole heartedly, this specific
provision that we’re eliminating by way of this bill is actually about
the promotion of one over another. I make sure you understand this isn’t
the very title here. 143-A. It says the word promotion. If you’re for
equal opportunity for everyone, then you will not support this
amendment. I wanna re-emphasize that, just get to hear a lot of rhetoric
go back and forth. Hopefully, we’re all on the same page here. Please
read the statute that we’re talking about and if you’re for equal
opportunity for all, please do not support this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does Representative Hall of Durham
arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak a second time on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re recognized to speak a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and of course what’s at issue
here, I think someone said it’s about opportunity and that this doesn’t
prevent people from competing. It just doesn’t have any requirement on
the people who make the decision to be fair in the decision they make.
So, everybody can compete. I’m just going as my buddies to do the work
and give them the funds but all ?? bid all you want, bid all night. You
can do all that, you get that opportunity but I don’t have any
responsibility to fairly decide and award the contract. That’s important
for us to understand what’s being said here because it was implied that
somehow small contractors or minority contractors or physically
handicapped contractors or women contractors who are covered under
143-48 purchases and contracts that somehow they would not have the
ability to provide the services they would be requested in.</p>

<p id="110:00">
Public, private partnership arena. Of course that's not true. I would
dare say, most of the organizations that would be in that arena would at
least have a woman in that organization. We can't say that women don't
have the ability to provide services that are needed in a public,
private partnership. I would hope we wouldn't put that label on people
who are handicapped or otherwise. The other myth that we just created is
that there's only going to be one contract. This could be done time
after time after time, there is no limitation on there being only one
contract regarding the public, private partnership initiative. I think
we need to be clear about what we are doing here and what we are doing
is skirting the requirements of 14348 in this process unnecessarily.
There's no justification being given, there's been no hearing saying
this is necessary to do as a basis they were going overturn state law,
as regards our small contractors, our handicap contractors, our woman
contractors, and requirement that we report on our utilization of those
citizens. They're citizens of North Carolina they should have the
opportunity to be fairly consider and for us, once again, to say, no
this is a honeypot for a friend of ours and what we're going to do, just
like we talked about with the charter school disclosure. What we're
going to do is set aside this honeypot for us to dip out for whoever our
friends are and may be and we're going to take any restrictions that
would prohibit that and make disclosure and fair bidding required. We're
going to take that away. You don't have to report, you don't have to go
through the procedure that the rest of North Carolina contracting go
through and you can ahead and dip out for whoever you want. This is not
just one contract, this is regarding 3P contracts or however there might
be. Please read this legislation, it doesn't limit it. Again, who does
it take safeguards away from, the people of the state of North Carolina.
Does not require the bid processes to guard their rights and supposedly
ensures we expend their revenues responsibly. I would ask that you
support the amendment. Finally, one question about our ability to move
quickly, there's no indication that we're not able to execute these
particular contracts that are referenced because we're not moving fast
enough, that people aren't applying for them, that there aren't enough
people bidding for us to have a legitimate pool for us to draw from.
That is not an issue either. What this does is once again take the
review process, take the transparency away and let these contracts be
left to people who don't necessarily have to provide the best service. I
would say this, we've been down this road, we've recently seen it in
state government where we've given contracts to people who don't provide
the services. We don't have a clear review process for it, they end up
deciding they don't want to provide the service later on and leave state
government. They somehow get a special separation pay or allowance, and
I think we're going down that road again. We need to shine a light on
this. We need to take this provision out and let them uphold the same
standards that we're trying to demand of everyone else contracting in
state government and drawing from the peoples revenue that they pay in
their taxes. I ask that you support the amendment.

<p id="115:00">
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This amendment deals with the disclosure of the
research that is done by our institutions and our state agencies that
would be available. This currently, what is proposed here, once again,
not having been fully ?? by committees in legislature here on the House
side. Currently, what this says is confidentiality of research data
records and information of a proprietary nature. These records and
research are records and research that come from state agencies, that
once again the people pay for, for this research to be done and in the
instances where the research has not been patented, published, or
copyrighted that information still would not be available to the people
of North Carolina. Now, I submit to you that if the information was
valuable and had need to be protected it could be patented, or
copyrighted, or somehow otherwise protected. The people of North
Carolina should have the opportunity to benefit, whether its a student
who is doing further research, whether it is other institutions in our
state who want to research the same subject matter, etc. That should be
available and open. There's no reason why we should in an instance where
there has not been sought to be protected, there's no reason why we
should deny the rest of the North Carolinians or other institutions the
opportunity to benefit from that research. Once again, the public paid
for it, it belongs to the citizens of North Carolina, and there's no
reason it should be under lock and key, if there is it should've been
expressed and again, preserved, patented, copyrighted, or some other way
protected. This is a lot of information data and once again we know the
importance of being able to do research.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
What purposes does the Representative [??] rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
See if Representative Larry Hall would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Hall, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I'll ask you a specific question, just to use a concrete example. We had
a study commission on the death penalty awhile back. There were
professors over at Carolina that had collected all this data, you know,
against the death penalty for murder. But, there was a professor of
statistics over there who was always asking them for their data. They
never would actually give up the underlined data. Are you saying that a
professor, for example, that has done research has got to turn over all
the research as a public record? Jean Nichols, for example, has done all
this work on poverty, so I can send him a public records request and
find out what he's done to combat poverty in the last few years? That's
my question. Is that how you would interpret the effect of your
amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
No, that's not how I'd interpret the effect of my amendment. How I would
interpret the effect of my amendment would be that if the information
was produced at a state institution, in the conduct of commercial
scientific or technical research then that information should be
available. Now, I'm not sure if the information you're talking about
being requested was conducted in those terms, I'm not sure who paid for
it. But, this would allow for research that was done at state
institutions, as the cost to the taxpayers to be denied by further use
by other citizens in the state if it was done for these purposes. So,
I'm not sure whether that fits your scenario or not, but thats the
intent of my amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
One follow up. So, for professor at the law school collects a lot of
data on the death penalty, because he wants to write some research on it
and have a lot of opinions about it. The data that he collects, under
your amendment, now to be a public record and I can get it for the cost
of the copying. Is that what you're saying we should do? I'm not against
that.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I'm just wondering if that's what you really are intending.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
My intention is that if the research is paid for by the citizens of
North Carolina and its being stored and collected, and its for these
select purposes then it should be available upon request. Yes, Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
For what purpose does Representative Avila of Wake rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]

[xx] I'm going to argue against this amendment on behalf of molecules,
and it will cost the state of north carolina a lot of money if we remove
this from technical corrections, because if you open up your early
experiments and show the directions in which your heading, towards a
discovery of a product, rather its chemical or physical and somebody
gets a hold of that before gets a hold of that before you've had a
chance to complete your experiments and go through out the very long
drawn out process of patenting, somebody can pirate your information and
say &quot;I'm not going to go through the patent process, I'm just going
to create it and start selling it&quot;, and its perfectly legal, and
the taxpayers of north carolina, will lose every bit of the money that
they've invested in that research, there are some very bad repercussions
to removing this, and I would suggest that you vote against the
amendment

[change speaker]
members, I want to echo what representative avil has said, this
provision was requested by north carolina state university, theres a lot
of dynamic research going on at that university and representative avil
touched on the point I want to make. You can't get to the point of
getting the patent until the research is done, has been approved, has
gone through that process, and prior to that period of time is when the
protection is the most necessary, my friends if this amendments
approved, there's no telling how much damage will be done to our
research universities in this state, right now the universities are not
releasing this data, but the wall is unsettled as to rather they have
to, they feel like they don't have to because it would undermine
millions and millions of dollars, hours of research they done put in. Go
look at the centinial campuses, north carolina state. Why would we want
to adopt an amendment that could undermine the research and the efforts
that are occuring there right now? My submission is that the gentleman
from Darum may not realize the deleterious effects his amendment would
have if it were adopted, I would ask the body to overwhelmingly defeat
this amendment

our research universities do, you've got unc charlotte, nc state you've
got numerous research AMT all across the state that do great research
that end up in patents that end up in copy writes, they end up in all
these things, but as representative avil has said, it takes years to get
there now lets say we publish that data this year, but its on a five
year trek, that will never be realized, those institutions will never
get the gain of that copy write or that patent so i agree with what
representative morris said, this is a devastating to our research
universities and I would ask the body to defeat this amendment

floor today emphasises what the problem is in proceding in this nature,
once again the question that comesb up and no one specified an event or
situation that happened where supposedly the scientific boogie man came
in and stole this data and used it to make money somewhere else, that
was not specified, but the problem here is, this cuts off us having a
discussion of even at what point should data be patented, what processes
should be in place to maintain any secrecy of it and what should be
available to the public, right now this just cuts it off and says you
cant get it even if it hasnt been patented published ior copywrited, and
of coarse those are protections that can be provided, representative
moore talked about the question of rather or not, if during the process
what you are working on should be available, well thats something that
should be discussed, but its not provided for this bill and theres no

There would be considered to be of concern and other items that people
want to put in the public domain, so we can have the public helps us
move forward on finding any solutions or any cures or anything else with
public research. And so again, I'd ask that you support the amendment
and if we need to come back and setup some type of structure that would
allow both public utilization of research as well as protecting whatever
level of research is being done in private, that would make sense. But
we're in the stone age if we're talking about not trying to have
information available so we can draw on the most talented minds that
have access and move issues forwards. So once again I'd ask that you
support the amendment. If we need to come back, and have some extensive
legislation provided then that discussion needs to be made. But it
should not be in this technical corrections bill.

CHANGES] You're recognized to speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, out of total respect for my
colleague over there, I don't think he has revolved the research
development tests and evaluation world. There are stipulations when
you're working within the federal guidelines of research that they
stipulate. And there are global entities and global countries out there
that actually earn a pretty good living or derive revenue from creeping
into other areas, taking good valid ideas and developing themselves.
This, to protect our colleges, our institutions of higher learning, that
the data, the research, the technologies, they create, and just on the
verge of bringing out.
We have to keep that protected. Just as independent businesses do in
their private operations, they have to have some type of proprietary
coverage, if you would, to protect that until it is ready to go public.
And I fully and wholly hope we will defeat this amendment. [SPEAKER

Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members of the house, this is a clarification,
our county contacted our delegation. This is regarding to the clarifying
the use of landfill fees. And this would allow, they've gotten some
conflicting advice about this, but it allows them the flexibility these
fees, for the collection of waste, collection of litter along public
highways. I think we're all aware that, litter among the highways is a
concern. And they have a program that they'd like to be able to actually
use for local inmates to be able to pick up trash on the roads.
They'd like to be able to fund that through some of their land fee use
and I have spoke with Representative Moore and he had no problem with
adding this to technical corrections. I do think it's a clarification.
Because they have gotten conflicting legal advice. So we just wanted to
clean that up for them. So we certainly would appreciate your support on
this. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the
question for the house is the adoption of the amendment sent forth by
Representative Jones. All in favor vote aye, all opposed vote no, the

Representative Martin, you’re recognized to explain your amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much Mr. Speaker. Members, the bill in
its current form would eliminate the Child Fatality Task Force. This
task force was established in 1991 and has been instrumental in
combating threats to our children since that time. It’s done a lot of
good work in recommending ideas to this body, many of which have been
adopted under both Democratic and Republican regimes. My amendment would
simply eliminate that section and ensure that the good work of this task
force can continue. I’d urge your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what
purpose does Representative Stam of Wake arise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re recognized to speak on
the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I support the amendment. Yesterday in
Rules I happened to be presiding because Representative Moore was the
sponsor of the bill and as we were getting to the explanation I happened
to see the repeal of this commission that I happened to sit on along
with Representative Murray and Horne and Jim Fulghum actually fought to
get on the commission, enthusiastic member. I said what in the world?
Well I read in the Insider this morning that this was a Senate
provision. But I checked with my Senator’s office because Tamara
Barringer happens to be my Senator and she takes no paternity of this
provision and she has no maternal love for it either. So it needs to go.
I support the amendment. I don’t know where it came from. This is the
last time I think in the Senate when somebody proposed to sunset this
commission, they adopted an amendment to do it 50 years later, by Stan
Bingham. I don’t know where it came from but it does good work. It makes
good recommendations. Of all the commissions I’ve sat on, it’s the
hardest working commission, where you actually have to show up and pay
attention to experts and this just sort of came forth like Aphrodite

[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re
recognized to speak on the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Y’all should hear,
y’all don’t get to hear when he doesn’t have his mike on. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] We do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You know, I rise in favor of the
motion. Just this week or last week, I read in the newspaper about the
child welfare in North Carolina and how we rank compared to other
states, and I don’t think anybody in this room should be proud of where
we fell in those figures. And you know, we talk a lot, we pray every
day. We pledge allegiance to the flag, and I think if there’s one thing
we ought to do, it’s to make sure we protect our children. And I think
this task force does that. And talking to my seat mate, Representative
Stam, he prefers Latin, I prefer English. I just can’t imagine that
repealing this is the right thing to do and I can’t encourage you more
to vote to repeal the repeal, which I guess in this case means push
green. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate. Hearing none, the
question before the House is the amendment sent forth by Representative
Martin. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk will open
the vote. [PAUSE] The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote.
86 having voted in the affirmative and 4 in the negative, the amendment
is adopted. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I’m sorry. Excuse me. For what purpose does Representative
Dollar arise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] My finger didn’t quite work on there.
I’d like to be recorded as voting no on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
You will be recorded as voting no. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose
does Representative Goodman of Richmond arise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’d
like to change my vote on the Hager amendment from no to aye. [SPEAKER

and gentlemen of the House, these are both truly technical in nature. We
have voted for them in separate bills. One of them even came back from
the Senate, but it was Christmas Treed with a couple of things that we
just couldn’t vote on. The first part of this is simply clarifying that

Agent. It was for collecting liens and not for anything else. You’ll
remember that we voted on the once before. The second part of the
amendment actually has to do with being able to get an address from
parents when they go to social services to get child support away from
you they are required to give you the obligee parent’s address, the
person who’s getting the money, is supposed to give you their address.
Well, most of the time they’re not even there in court. So this simply
says social services will provide you the address. That’s all these two
things did. We voted on the lien agent, 114 to nothing. We voted on the
second provision 117 to 1. Again, I ask for your support. We’ll put
these in technical corrections. [SPEAKER CHANGES] A little house
keeping. For what purposes does Representative Dollar of Wake arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To have my vote recorded as “aye” on amendment 5.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] So noted. For what purpose does Representative Davis
arise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, could I please be recorded as
voting yes on the Jones amendment? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Absolutely.

Amendment ATR-23, version 3. Representative Stam moves to amend the bill
on page 34, line 42. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam, you’re
recognized to explain your amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Mr. Speaker,
members of the House, I’m offering this on behave of two members who are
not here today. Representative Samuelson shares our banking committee
and Representative Blackwell was the primary sponsor last year of the
bill involving, the manager of the bill involving protection of seniors
from financial abuse. The underlying provision on page 34 of the bill
relates to production of bank account information to try to see if
seniors have been victimized. Apparently, some of the provisions in last
years bill were not really feasible, didn’t give the banks quite enough
time. So this is what Representative Blackwell, Representative Samuelson
worked out with the banker’s association as a practical way to provide
the information. I’d be glad to answer questions, but that’s what I know
about it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate? Hearing none,

Mr. Speaker. This is a pretty simple amendment. It addresses the Gifford
Technical Community College, the new facility, Donald W. Cameron campus,
out on highway 68, north of high point and near Greensboro. When that
facility first was planned, they were primarily committed to developing
global logistics studies and interactions out there with a lot of
involvement from the aircraft industry. That role has changed some what
in that they’ve broadened it into innovative resources for all types of
industry and business. Originally they were granted in the 2011 bill to</p>

Representative: …be able to rent a portion of the land and improvements

the same thing with this new group that they were allowed to do with the
other. Also, it would give them the authority to grant venue to that

Speaker: Representative Meyer you are recognized to explain your

Representative: Representative Stan and I talked about an amendment to
this provision. The provision is intended to give teachers a little
flexibility in the course of their daily duties. To just be able to keep
records using software that may fit a teacher’s needs, to help them not
have to do everything the state’s information management system, if that
is system is overly burdensome. The language was a little troubling
because it seemed that it would be possible to give teachers the right
to use something even if their local education agency, school district,
or principal, wanted to use something else. So we simply amended the
language to make it clear that a teacher can use an alternative system
as long as they are reporting the requirements to their local education
agency, the state or the federal government.
\Speaker: For what purpose does Representative Singer arise?
Representative: To speak on the amendment.
Speaker: You are recognized to speak on the amendment.
Representative: Thank you MR. Speaker. I would like to thank
Representative Meyer for pointing that out to me and the good work that
we worked on together just to make sure the language was clarified, and
made everybody comfortable. This describes something that would allow
teachers a little more flexibility in the classroom but also protects
student data, and makes sure they work with them what we are trying to

changes the language in the technical fractions bill to allow for the
new pilot virtual charter schools to still be subject to the oversight
and potential terms and conditions as laid out by the NC board of
education. Until such time that we have an approved program, not a pilot
program, it is my opinion that we would be best served by watching these
while they are in the pilot stage and then come back at a later date and
move them into the status of the other charter schools, and I would ask
for your support.

Representative Brawley you are recognized to explain your amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman of the house it's a fairly
straightforward amendment. There's a provision in the bill for a charter
school to experimentally attempt to reengage dropouts and get them back
into high school and graduated. The change here merely allows students
to be transferred to the charter school before they dropout instead of
actually having to have them dropout and then come back in. That's the
only change it makes. I ask for your support.

[Speaker Change]
Please do.
[Speaker Change]
And I am going to reluctantly but need fully vote no to this bill. I
just don't think this represents very good legislating. Know the best
pastor I ever heard speak was Dr. Vance Havner and he for a long time
back in the 70's my church at home did not have a pastor and he was
guest pastor numerous times, back when I was in college. Heard him in
person some but my mother used to buy the tape of every sermon from
church and send it to me when I was in college and I'd throw it in a
drawer somewhere and it was really years later that I've ran across
those things. And I started listening to em in my car, and listened to
him til I wore them out, it was a cassette player and I regret I don't
have em anymore. And I remember Dr. Havner saying I get a little bit
nervous about how we sing these hymns and do these different things in
church, and never really give it deep thought to exactly what we're
doing. And I think that here sometimes that we just take our eye off the
big picture that we are making the law for the people of this state in a
represent in a republic where we're elected to come here and sit on
their behalf. And I think it requires a whole lot more deliberation,
calm, reason, and good process, because if you'll look at your
constitution on article</p>

Section 12, right of assembly and petition. The people have a right to
assemble together to consult for their common good and instruct their
representatives. And to apply to the general assembly to a redress of
grievance. When we move too fast, when we do things in a comprehensive
way that all of the provisions can’t be looked at individually with the
proper deliberation, we are in effect, taking away from those people
their right to instruct their representatives. And I know even as a
representative down here who understands things work, I see how things
are moving, and I can’t keep up. With how fast things move from time to
time. Now this bill has a subject, has different subjects that run the
gamut from A to Z. It’s got subjects that are not just technical. I can
see doing this when it’s truly technical corrections, but a lot of these
are substantive provisions that lumped together in one comprehensive
bill at the end of session. Some of them are things that, are provisions
that passed as bills. Some of them are things that should be run as
separate bills. We’re bypassing the proper committee doing it this way
with many of these provisions. A lot of them were J, Judiciary
provisions. And I just hate to make the law that the people have to obey
in this manner. I just think we owe them more. Maybe all of this is
going to be good and work out. We did find some things in committee that
were taken out. I’m not sure if there’s not things there nobody’s really
noticed yet or thought of yet that we won’t find out until later. And I
just think we owe the public more. I’m sorry I have to be the one to get
up and say this, but I have been thinking about Doctor Folgum. And I
think he’s making all of us take a closer look at ourselves. And are we
the legislators, are we the people we’re supposed to be. And I think we
need to stop and take a look at ourselves a little bit here, because
this is not the way law is supposed to be made. I’ll give you another
reason why I’m nervous about this bill. We’re teeing this thing up late.
It’s going over to the Senate and how many times have we seen the Senate
wait, put something else very major in material into a House bill, send
it back over the last day of session and it’s take it or leave it. And
I’m worried we’re giving them a vehicle to do all kinds of things, And I
think that this way of doing business allows some provisions to be put
into the law that wouldn’t make it on their own but they’re mixed
together with things that we do want and the bad gets passed on with the
good. So I think we just need to slow this down. I don’t, you know how
many times have I as a member been told, Can’t that wait until next
session? Can’t that wait? I don’t see much here that can’t wait until
January. Another bad potential that comes from doing law this way is How
do you know the process? We have bill filing deadlines. We have bill
limits. We have a single subject rule. Now how many people can go to
their bill limit, Oh I’ve still got this other matter, I’ll just wait
until the of session and put it in this comprehensive- What is it?
Technical and other changes? Which does not limit the subject at all.
Some people with better connections are gonna have a different amount of
hurdles they have to pass to get something enacted into law that they
want than other members. I just wonder, I noticed NC State had asked for
something. One of the provisions we debated. How did NC State know you
could go to a member here and get something inserted into the law,
rather than go to someone who represents that area and get it introduced
as a bill? Why did the process differ for one interest that wanted a
change in the law whereas many times I’m sure you’ve had this happen.</p>

<p id="155:00">
How many times have you had somebody give you an idea or say you guys
ought to do this and you say, &quot;Well, it's too late, the bill filing
deadline's passed. We can't do that till next year.&quot; And why is
there one process for some people or some entities and a different
process for others? I think if we want to honor rule of law, and that's
what makes us different from other countries, we have rule of law, part
of that is how the laws are enacted and we need to honor that at all
times and give the public confidence that procedures are followed,
proper consideration is given to all the bills, to all points of view.
People have a notice and an opportunity to be heard before the law is
enacted. That they're penalized if they don't follow.
And we look at the polling numbers and I know so many times as
politicians, we look at them with just a view for the next election. But
over time, when the institutions that make our laws are consistently
rated terribly low, what is that going to do long term to the rule of
law? Because, and I'll close on this, if you think about it, rule of law
is voluntary. There's not enough police, jail, prisons to hold more than
even 1% of our population, so we must rely on people voluntarily
submitting to the law and respecting the law and I think we owe a very
respectable process or enacting the law at all times. And I think we
should give that a whole lot more consideration than we do. So I'm going
to vote no to this bill. I don't know it well enough. I don't like this
process and I'm just not going to be a part of enacting the law that
way.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. For what purpose does Representative Moore
of Cleveland arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're recognized for a motion. It's not what you
think.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Mr. Speaker, having voted on the prevailing
side on Amendment 10 offered by my good friend, Representative Hamilton,
and I did give her advance notice I was going to do this. I do move to
reconsider the vote by which that amendment was adopted and would ask to
be heard on the motion, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're recognized to explain your motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Mr. Speaker, members. The amendment that
was adopted had to do with the charter schools and the virtual charter
schools in the process of the assignment of who was handling the bill
and different issues. That was going to fall under the domain of
Representatives Horn and Samuelson, neither of whom were here and yours
truly was engaged in another conversation. This amendment was defeated
yesterday in the House Rules Committee under concerns that it would
essentially further inhibit the ability of the charter schools to manage
those schools. I'm prepared to let other proponents for charter schools
speak once the motion comes back before us. But I've had several members
who've come to me who were upset realizing they had voted for the
amendment when they, had they realized what the full impact of the
amendment was they would have voted no. So with that said, I do
respectfully move that we reconsider that vote. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Clerk will lock the machine and record the vote.  58 having voted in the
affirmative and 33 in the negative, the motion to reconsider has been
adopted.  Now we are back on the Hamilton amendment.  Representative
Moore, you are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I think it was Representative Murray who made
the comment the other day that this is not my dog but I'm walking it and
again put a leash on it.  And this is appropriate.  This is, members,
the language that would have been put in or that is being proposed to be
put in by this amendment would have several bad affects. Number one, it
would differentiate between the virtual charter schools and the regular
charter schools.  There have been some, and it also allows, it spells
out the State Board of Education may impose terms and conditions that
restrict even the membership of the Board of Directors of a
non-profit corporation operating a virtual charter school.  The
rationale, the reason this was defeated in the Rules Committee yesterday
was because there seemed to be no reason to treat a virtual charter
school different from a regular charter school and I see the expert,
Representative Forum, has arrived once again but this, and
Representative Samuelson did a much better job than I did explaining
this in the committee but the thought of the Rules Committee and the
thought I would take as the sponsor of this bill is that we probably
ought to treat virtual charter schools and any other charter schools the
same.  I think they should be subject to the same, the public schools,
they need to be subject to the same rules and regulations.  I don't want
to get into that whole can of worms and debate that took up a lot of
time already this morning about the charter school bill but I just see
no reason to differentiate between the two so with all due respect to my
good friend, ??Newt Hanover, I would have to ask the members to please
oppose the amendment.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
For what purposes does Representative Hamilton and ??Newt Hanover arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
You are recognized to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  And with all due respect to my very good friend
from  Cleveland County, Representative Moore, I'm going to ask that you
support this bill. And again, it is simply for the reasons that today we
do not have virtual charter schools in North Carolina and there is a
provision in our budget that would provide for two pilot programs; a
budget what obviously we have not seen the light of in recent days; we
are doing technical corrections anyway so in preparation for that I
think it's only reasonable that we vet the virtual school, charter
school process while it is still in the pilot program and then we can
again come back and change to make them consistent with other charter
schools after we have some time to evaluate how they function in the
state.
I ask for your support.  Thank you.

You are recognized to speak on the motion.

This is going to be an interesting vote.

The reason it is going to be interesting is because with our leadership
in here, you all voted for it and now leadership has come in here and
said well, we don't want this.  Now what you gonna do?

I think we all know.  The question before the House is the adoption of
the  Hamilton amendment.  All in favor vote aye, all opposed will vote
no.  The clerk will open the vote.  As that old saying goes, there is
nothing new under the sun, the clerk will lock the machine and record

First, an inquiry. I wonder if through the clerk, you could advise us,
how long we have been on this bill today?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
We've enjoyed it quite a bit.

If I may also speak briefly.

You are recognized to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
We've considered this quite a long time.  The Rules Committee

time than we typically spend on a technical correction bill even with

legislative process has fall short of actuality.

Your opinion is quite taken although most of us don't have the blessing
or curse to serve own rules so the discussion will continue. For what

To speak on the bill.

If this the proper legislative procedure then I think we need to change

at that. But I find it ?? it right, we gonna try this in a couple of
counties and for those poor subjects living in those counties, if they
don't go to school until they are 18, they'll find themselves charged
with a Misdemeanor. And I don't how we can do that in a couple of
counties while the counties next door to them and through out the state,
they can quit at 16 and not be charged with a Misdemeanor. So I think
the whole concept of it, I understand the point behind it but I think
the whole concept, the way it's written with what penalties are and
everything takes it way off course. This is just one of the problems I
have with this bill but this is a major one. Again, we are gonna be
looking at penalizing or criminalizing kids not going in one or two
counties while everyone else should they chose to not go to school,
should they choose to drop out will not get their penalties. I don't
think this is a good way of doing business. I think this whole section
here is something that needs to be looked at deliberately and possibly
in a long section and there's quite a few other things in this bill I
think that need to be looked individually in individual bills and
through the long sessions. So I'm not going to be able to support it and
I hope you don't support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does representative Stam of Wake arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Will representative Speciale answer a question or will representative
Wills prefer? I was gonna ask a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You know those provisions in the bill that are already passed to house
while the guy is sitting behind you and we have considered it in flow by
itself. I don't technically agree to that bill myself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Will it pass the senate?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, obviously not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What purpose does representative Wales arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This actually is a technical amendment/correction. This bill was passed
by the house and the senate at the request of two Catawba county school
systems, all three were asked if they wanted to pursue this program. We
have number of things going on in the community that allows alternative
for students that want to drop out. We are trying to keep kids in
school. We have already endorsed this concept as a ?? program. this
merely corrects some issues of enforcement.  Some six-eight months after
we pass the bill, the LEAs has came to me and said we have the right to
do this but we have some enforcement issues. This allows them to handle
the bill as it was originally intended. I ask you all to support the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does representative Stone arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes Mr. Speaker. To change my vote on the ?? from No to yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sum notred. For what purpose does representative Bumgardner of Gaston
arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask a question and to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are recognized to ask a question. Who would you like to direct it
to?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd like to ask representative Stam a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam yields. Proceed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Stam, how many people are on the rules
committee? How many members? Approximately.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thirty.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No. I just want to make a comment and I want to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You are recognized to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, Thank you. This bill is quite long, it's 55 pages, yes technical
corrections but there are all kinds of hidden stealth in here
Representative Stam with all due respect has said that they debated the
bill at ?? with rules, I am not on that committee and</p>

Until I got here this morning that’s the first time I seen some of this
stuff in this form.  We may have debated these in other bills, in other
forms.  That’s true.  Probably have, we’ve probably debated all of this
stuff at one time or another, but here it is all together in one big
package and I personally would like to have more time to look through
this and look at it and see what issues there are that I may have a
problem with.  I’m sure they’re some, and some of these sections of this
bill are very good.  I like some of them, but here it is a great big, a
conglomeration and again, it’s 55 pages of a bill that I have to look at
the best I can here in the time allotted which is about an hour and a
half right now and decide yes or no, is this bill more…is there more
good to it than bad and at this point, I don’t know and I would
appreciate having more time to look over this and study it before I have
to make a definitive statement and then explain why I voted for this or
that or the other thing that may be in this bill.  So at this point I’m
gonna have a hard time voting yes on this right now.  Thank you.
[speaker changes]
For what purpose does Representative Millis of Pender arise?
[speaker changes]
To speak very briefly on the bill.
[speaker changes]
You are recognized to speak on the bill.
[speaker changes]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.  I rise today not to speak negatively about this
bill.  A few things have been discussed and in regard to the process, I
appreciate the opportunity to have read this last night, I’m very
grateful that it was put out there, but I have to ask for you all’s help
on something.  I think we have an unintended consequence that we need to
possibly address in future sessions.  I don’t know if there’s a
possibility to reconsider some things, but about section 52, when it has
to do with what is not public records by our state universities.  Now, I
definitely support everything that Representative Avila articulated
about why there’s aspects that need to be protected about data and
things of that nature as we move through a process, but an unintended
consequence that we may be actually covering by way of this large
blanket that’s entered into this bill is a scenario that’s playing out
right now in our public universities.  That is that we have some
professors that are actually being hired by private consultants to do
certain data and research, and one of those professor’s have actually
released results on the universities very letter head, even though that
he has been hired in a private capacity and is actually…it’s very
unfortunate.  The language we’re passing here gives a broad blanket by
the university whenever the taxpayers ask, well if this was issued on
the university letterhead what else was done with taxpayer dollars at
the private individuals expense.   I’m all for everything that was
articulated about why this is needed, but I definitely support
Representative Hall’s amendment and I hope that we could reconsider
this.  Whether today or, I know everybody’s beat down here, but maybe in
the future.  Legislators, I hope I would have your support on fixing
this first thing next session.  We want to get at the actually root
problem, but we want to take care of the unintended consequences.  Thank
you for your time and consideration.
[speaker changes]
Thank you.  For what purpose does Representative Pittman of Cabarrus
arise?
[speaker changes]
To debate the bill.
[speaker changes]
You are recognized to debate the bill.
[speaker changes]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.  You know, a while ago I actually voted for
Representative Hall’s amendment because I considered it adverse to a
bill I voted against when it came up on it’s own and so I thought that
was a good thing to do.  I too share concerns Representative Blust and
some others have mentioned about this process of throwing stuff
together.  A lot of times we put things in these bills that couldn’t
pass on their own.  And so you kind of throw it in here and say well
maybe we’ll sneak it by.  I just don’t think that’s a good way to do
things.  I don’t mind having to explain my vote on a stand- alone bill
to my constituents, but I sure would hate to have to vote for this
because it has some good stuff in it and explain why I voted for
something that had some bad stuff in it.  So I hope next year we’ll
change this process and stop doing this and let stuff stand on its own.
Stand or fall without being thrown into a piece of sausage like this.
So I ask you to vote no.
[speaker changes]
For what purpose does Representative Collins of Nash arise?
[speaker changes]
Mr. Speaker, I have two questions concerning transportation issues.  I
guess I want to address them to Representative Iler or Representative
Torbett or whoever could…whoever feels qualified to answer them.

<p id="175:00">
Do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative
Collins, do turn around. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Torbett yields. My first question is section 56.6 on page
45. It’s called, “Limitation on Variants.” I understand I’m reading with
heightened sensitivities because a lot of us in rural areas, once we’ve
begun to see how the DOT scores a lot of our division projects, are
nervous already about what we agreed to last year as far as this three
part division of money. If I’m reading this right it looks like to me,
apparently they can already vary by 5% every five years in the way we
divided the money out. I think it was 40:40:20 or 40:30:30 that we
eventually agreed on? It looks like to me that they can miss it by as
much as 5% every five years. Now if we pass this bill they can miss it
by as much as 10% every five years which means we may be losing more of
that division money that we have allocated to us to higher tiers
perhaps. I know it can go the other way as well, but I know which way we
fear it’s more likely to go... [SPEAKER CHANGE] For what purposes does
Representative Brawley of Mecklenburg arise? [SPEAKER CHANGE] I would
like to address the gentleman’s issue with permission of the chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Wonderful. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Brawley you
are recognized to answer the questions. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr.
Chairman. It does not allow the allocation of money. It allows the
working on projects. As we are aware, when you are designing a project;
getting it ready to let, sometimes there’s an, “Oh, by the way...”,
there’s an environmental problem, there is some, perhaps a law suit, or
there is a delay. Experience has shown that only 80% of the projects
actually slatted to be begun are, in fact, begun. What this allows the
DOT to do is work on projects equal to 110% of the money allocated to a
particular area, and does not allow them to spend more than 100% of the
money. It is simply a tool to allow DOT to stay on timeline targets to
get the roads up as quickly as possible. It will not cause a rural
project not to be funded it will simply mean that a project already
scheduled to be completed quicker so that the rural project will in fact
be addressed sooner. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGE] I have
a second question. On page 59 there’s a long section there in which over
and over and over again the words “Secondary Roads Counsel” is crossed
out, and the word DOT is put in in its place, and I’m just wondering is
that a substance of change we are making? Is that something where we are
taking either money or authority or something away from this group
called the “Secondary Roads Counsel” and giving that over to the DOT as
a whole, and if so, does that any effect on the rural areas? I’ll direct
that question to Representative Moore. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative
Moore you are recognized to ease our concerns. [SPEAKER CHANGE] The
Counsel no longer exists. That's why it’s being removed. [SPEAKER
CHANGE] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGE] For what purpose does Representative
Meyer of Orange arise? [SPEAKER CHANGE] To speak on the bill, Mr.
Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGE] You are recognized to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Speaker, I’m one of the newest members of this body
and everyone here has been very kind to me, and the short session help
me get my barrings. As I sat here today and I listened to Representative
Blust, Representative Speciale, Representative Pittman, Representative
Bumgardner I found that I agreed with them. I realized that, 40 years of
being a Liberal and trusting in my governments and representing Orange
and Durham counties, nothing has made me more of a proponent of small
government than being in a House of Representatives for three months...
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Welcome to the House of Representatives. [SPEAKER
CHANGE] ...and so I stand with them in opposition to this bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGE] The question before the House is the passage of house bill 1133
on it’s second reading as amended. The Clerk will...the stations are

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Objection having been heard from Representative Luebke of Durham. This
bill. The House will be at ease.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to state his motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, Members, I move to suspend the rules the answer that the
House can take up third reading of House Bill 1133 will ask to be heard
on that motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members this ah and,and I communicated this earlier today to the House
Minority Leader. The ah[??]. We need to go ahead and get third reading
to get this over based on the way things are progressing right now with
the Senate. This bill is time sensitive and unfortunately, the only
alternative if we do not do third reading today would be to have a
session at 9 a.m. tomorrow. So that’s the practical facts. So regardless
where you are on the merits of  the bill, would ask the Body to at least
suspend the rules to go ahead so we could   vote on the bill today and
get to the Senate. I would remind the Minority that when I was in the
Minority although I voted against bills at times, I always voted for
those kinds of measures when it meant we’re  at the end of session and
we were trying to get bills back and forth to the Senate and the House.
There are, there are negotiations on going right now on the budget and
on a number of other matters. And the bottom line is this bill needs to
be, needs to go to the Senate today. So I would ask the Body regardless
of your position on this bill to vote to suspend the rules so that can
happen. Otherwise, we’ll have to be here tomorrow morning. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Larry Hall, please state your question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ask the Rules Chair a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, you indicated that the bill is time sensitive and
then if it doesn’t go to the Senate today, something is going to happen.
What’s going to happen if the bill does not go to the Senate today
that’s gonna affect whether or not we get a budget or the schedule that
we’re gonna adjourn on?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Doesn’t go today, it goes tomorrow.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And Representative Hall if I may add, depending upon the negotiations
with the Senate, there may not be any legislative session votes next
week. So the time sensitivity has more to do with the fact that if we do
not move it, it could, it could remain in this Chamber for more than a
week. And that, that is more the issue rather than today versus. Or
Saturday versus Monday.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well Mr. Speaker, to the Rules Chair another question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Should we pass this bill or should this bill come out of the Chamber
today and the Senate still not cooperate in whatever fashion that we
would want, are they obligated to do anything as the result of receiving
the bill today or tomorrow?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well the Senate. I mean. We can’t obligate the Senate to do anything. It
would be nice if we could. But can’t obligate them to do anything. But
what we. We need to have it over there, Representative Hall. This isn’t
any kind of game or anything. This is trying to have things ready to go.
Because at this point, we may have to be here next week. Everything else
that was on our calendar is cleared and it’s gone. This is the only
bill. So it just doesn’t make sense to me that we would come back
tomorrow or one day next week for  one bill. That just doesn’t make
sense. So it’s not about the position on the bill, it’s about the
expediency of getting the thing done.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, please state your purpose.</p>

<p id="185:00">
Speak on the motion and then ask you a question.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman’s recognized to debate the motion.
[Speaker Change]
I support the motion. I do remember a few years ago when Jim Black asked
us to vote on a, an actual budget before the money report had even been
passed out. And it was late at night you know, 10 o'clock and I said Mr.
Speaker, Mr. Speaker could we have 15 minutes to read this 700 page
budget you know, the conference report? And he gave us an hour, and I
felt so good I had done something. So my question to Representative
Moore if I may ask him a question.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Moore does the gentleman yield?
[Speaker Change]
I yield
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman yields.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Moore if the motion to suspend passes would you consider
a recess for lunch so those who wanna you know, explore further
ramifications of a section here, or a section there might have 20, 30,
40 minutes to peruse their law books?
[Speaker Change]
I would and one more thing I wanted to point out Representative Stam. If
you'll notice at no point today did anyone cutoff debate on this bill. A
full debate was allowed on this bill. No amendments were tabled,
everything was you know, allowed to proceed. And so yes if that's what,
if folks generally want more time to study that bill, certainly it makes
more sense to do it today if that means giving a half-hour, or an hour
where people can grab lunch and come back, that's fine. And I just wanna
address the other thing, we've tried to afford plenty of time on this
process I mean let's cut to the chase. There's been about what, four
provisions that people would deem controversial and there were
amendments run, people debated em, and had it discussed. Most all this
other stuff folks is technical. I mean you're talking about commas,
you're talking about getting where a commission no longer exists.
There's nobody trying to pull anything over on anybody. The ?? Bill’s in
a lot of ways like for example the JMAC provision was added for
Representative Presnell that's already passed this house floor. So this
is not something new that's not, that new unseen a lot of this stuff,
stuff we already sent over. But from a negotiating standpoint of a house
members would be wise to vote to suspend the rules and to support this
bill. Again if you wanna vote against the bill fine, vote your
conscience, but at least allow the procedure to go forth. Because
otherwise it puts the house in a difficult position in negations.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Luebke please state your purpose.
[Speaker Change]
To speak on the motion.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman’s recognized to debate the motion.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. Speaker and members of the house I object to the motion to suspend
the rules, and I'll vote no on that. And I urge you to do so also.
Number of members have spoken about the fact that this bill really has
many provisions in it that ought to be in the long session or ought to
be considered as individual bills. I wanna note that there was a section
in dealing with criminal justice.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Luebke teh Chair is going to keep the debate on the
motion to reconsider, or to hold the vote today, and not on the merits
of the bill. That would be done with a full and unlimited debate on
third reading at whatever time that occurs. Either later today or
tomorrow. But if the gentleman will just simply remained focused on the
merits of the motion.
[Speaker Change]
Yes sir my reference to criminal justice actually is on the merits of
the motion. Representative Moore spent at least 5 minutes talking about
the components of one section that dealt with criminal justice, that's
the first time any of us have really heard that. The substance there
belongs in Representative Daughtry's judiciary committee, it's just one
example of the way things have been rushed through. I doubt that anybody
here has read the bill, well I know a couple people said they have. But
almost everyone, no-ones raising their hand, just a few are raising
their hands. OK we've got it up to 5. That means 115 of us have not read
the bill. Also when it's referenced that the bill had a 2 hour meeting
in rules, it's important to remember that 24 members, there are 24
members on rules, I've counted it Representative Stam it's not 30. There
are 24 members on rules, so for the rest of us, for the 96 of us there
was no discussion til now. So to cut it short all I'm asking is that we
hear this bill on Monday night which was the normal process that I heard
yesterday. That's what could easily happen if we vote no on the motion,
we actually would have time to read the bill and perhaps prepare more
amendments that</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ask Representative Moore a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, when was this bill first
available for us as members of the House to read?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It was earlier in the week, Representative Collins. I
don't know exactly. There was an initial draft that was filed sometime
ago but it didn't have all of the material that's in here now. We had a
work group that met with Senate and in central staff that met for
several weeks. We've probably had 9 or 10 meetings on this. As far as
when it was...I'll put it to you this way, I had information in my
office, I had some folks who actually came by. A number of folks said,
&quot;Can you include something in technical corrections?&quot; And we'd
say yes. We've been taking those requests from both sides of the aisle
all year long. And then as far as the bill, I've had it available,
drafts, in my office. As far as members looking at it, let's see, what's
today, today's Friday, I'm guessing probably since Wednesday would be a
guess of when it was out there. But we certainly let folks know because
most folks who've had an interest have come in and said they've had an
interest and those folks have known for awhile.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have a follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would you consider it reasonable that members of the
House could have read this 55 page bill in the last two or three days
had they had the desire to do so?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would think so and I understand there's a lot going
on and a lot of things out there, but it's been made available. We sent
the draft of the bill out the night before the rules committee meeting
so that folks had that. We've tried to make it as open a process as
possible and I would just, I remember years ago, not under this speaker,
not under the previous speaker, but years ago when this thing literally,
I'm not exaggerating, you'd burn your finger on the staple. I mean it
was that hot because it just come off the printer. We didn't have the
dashboard then. And you didn't know what was in there and it was more
than this. I mean, this is, it does have substantive provisions. It does
have substantive provisions, but where there's substantive provisions,
I've stood here and I've told you, it's substantive provisions. But it's
generally not controversial except for the ones where the amendments
have run. The child task force, whatever the other things were. But the
other stuff is stuff that needs to happen for the good of the State.
It's stuff that would pass.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speaker, could I make a brief comment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'm not privileged to serve on the rules committee,
either, but I did know this bill was coming out so I did look for it and
did read it. And I would say if we haven't had time to read the bill
that maybe it's just a statement on how we treat legislation, I don't
know. It's certainly been available long enough for everybody that
wanted to to read it, get their questions asked. I had several questions
that I asked several members that were related to the various aspects of
it. I had a couple that I really couldn't get a good answer to. Nobody
seemed to know the answer or maybe I didn't ask the right person. That's
why I asked them here on the House floor. But I would say if you haven't
read the bill, I certainly wouldn't admit to that, but to me that's more
of a personal problem than it is a procedural problem on this issue
because it's been there long enough for us to read it. So I'm going to
support the motion to go ahead and vote on it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, just by way of clarification, the Chair is
actively involved in the budget negotiations and discussion and at this
point the Chair would judge it it's as likely as not that we would not
have a session on Monday. So the Chair has the decision, and it solely
the decision of the Chair, to have this on this session on Saturday to
dispose of this bill. Largely because many of our members are not near
Raleigh, they'd be going home and coming back specifically for the third
reading of this bill and nothing more on Monday night. It seems more
appropriate to take this matter up while they're in town rather than
have that occur. That would be the reason for the Chair's decision to
hold session on Monday morning for that purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Question of the Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Isn't it also true that the Senate held a skeleton
session today and is adjourned so that they, subject to receipt of this,
so the purpose of to receiving this bill today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Larry Hall, please state your purpose.
I'm sorry, Representative Hall, if you'll yield. Representative Jones,
for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ask if Representative Luebke would yield to a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Luebke. Sometimes we don't
always agree and we don't vote together, but we're friends and we have
good conversations together. And I just want to ask you, we're going
through this process, which is going to take awhile and I think most
everybody...</p>

This chamber knows how the vote’s going to end up. And you know and I
know and I think most everybody here knows that you’re not going to win
this vote. My question is would you consider withdrawing your objection
if the rules Chair agreed to an extended recess this afternoon to give
you an opportunity to consider the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir, and the reason is that to have a couple hours over lunch hour,
or an hour, is simply not going to make a difference. We do need the
weekend to look at this. To truly know what’s in the bill. So I thank
you for the question, but a lunch hour break is not enough for us
members to actually know what’s in the bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, just by way of clarification, the Chair is happy to create a
recess of hours if that fits with people who do believe that in their
judgment that if they were given that amount of time it would be
sufficient time to take a vote. Representative Lupke’s comments
notwithstanding. And again, it’s purely on the basis of the high
likelihood that we will not be here next week. Or at least a fairly high
likelihood that we will not be here next week. And that is why we will
have session tomorrow morning or later today at the Chamber’s pleasure.
Representative Larry Hall, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the motion
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and of course Ladies and Gentlemen of the house,
I think Representative Jones said it, but maybe not so accurately
because sometimes the majority votes. Sometimes they reconsider their
vote. Sometimes they change their vote. Don’t know if it’s an epiphany
or some other force moving within the Chamber that causes that to
happen. So we’ll just keep our faith in that. I appreciate
Representative Moore and others who would say that they would like to
fulfill the oath I took to represent the people of my district. And so
they will review and determine what we get to see. And ask us to just
have faith in whatever they want to do is good for the people of North
Carolina. But unfortunately, we probably all took an oath. WE probably
all have some due diligence we should perform. Some responsibility to
try to read what it is we’re going to vote on and obligate the people of
North Carolina to abide by. So even though that’s a great offer and
would probably take a lot of pressure off of a lot of people, I as one
could not accept that offer to fulfill my duty to my constituents. We
didn’t get here today. We got here through the course of this session,
so I don’t know if this is an emergency of our own creation or how it
got to be an emergency. I understand now that the Senate has a skeletal
session that has adjourned. And again, I’m not sure how any guarantee of
a good outcome happens by us rushing through and not knowing what’s in
this bill. The issue of having a bill show up yesterday in Rules, and
have several amendments in Rules, and then have several amendments today
and for someone to say they know what’s in the bill- Well you couldn’t
know what was going to be in the bill this morning when you studied it
last night, because you didn’t have the amendments. And you couldn’t
know the night before what the total bill was because you didn’t have
the amendments we ran in Rules. So this idea that someone out there
clairvoyant or otherwise knew what was going ot be in that bill today, 2
days ago, I don’t think it happened. So let’s stop fooling ourselves on
that. Now, I understand there was a workgroup out there as was
indicated. I don’t know how many Democrats were in that workgroup, had
an opportunity to come back and survey our caucus. WE certainly don’t
have a caucus director, so she couldn’t bring the information back to us
as staff. So now we’re forced, even though we vote 85 plus percent or
more time with the majority on issues, we don’t know. We been
handicapped by the flow of information, the lack of staff, the lack of
procedural regularity. And now we’re being asked to just vote and say
it’ll be OK. Maybe. So I would ask that you not suspend the Rules. Let’s
try to get back to some process so we all can feel good about what we’re
supposed to be doing. If it takes an extra day, it may take an extra
day. You seen these bills before when they run through real quick, then
we have to come back and undo something. Some major problem. Some major
faux pas that happened. Some problem with funding, some problem with
authority. Some violation of federal law. And then we scramble to come
back and get it fixed. And operate illegally in the interim.</p>

<p id="200:00">
I would ask that you oppose this motion to suspend the rules and let's
do this the right way.
[speaker changes]: The House be recessed til 2:30.
?? Speaker, ?? Please state your purpose.
[speaker changes]: For an announcement
[speaker changes]: Yeah we're in recess gentleman and any other members
may make statements.
[speaker changes]: The Republicans will have a caucus immediately in
room 1228

us, members take your seats.
[speaker changes]: ?? Discussion ?? Debate. Representative ?? please
state your purpose.
[speaker changes]: Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, we had a
good discussion before, I think I made my case as to why we should not
suspend the rules. Why it's important to look at this legislation
carefully, overnight it seems. And I would urge you without going into
detail again, just to be brief, I would urge you to vote against the
motion to suspend the rules. Vote no on the motion. Thank you very much.
[speaker changes]: Representative Larry Hall please state your purpose.
[speaker changes]: Speak a second time on the motion
[speaker changes]: The gentlemans recognized to debate the motion a
second time.
[speaker changes]: Thank your Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentleman of
the House again, I hope you would keep in mind the, precedent we're
setting here today and the effect it will have on people who will look
to us to set this example. So I hope you'll vote against the motion and
let us use our regular procedure.
[speaker changes]: Further Discussion. Further Debate. If not the
question before the House is the motion made by Representative Moore to
suspend the rules for consideration on third reading the House committee
substitute to House bill 133. This is a 2/3 vote. All in favor, vote,
Aye. All oppose vote, No. ?? the vote. The ?? machine record the vote.
69 have ?? voted in the affirmative and 26 in the negative. The motion
passes. House ?? Substitute House ?? 133, the clerk will read.
[speaker changes]: General assembly of North Carolina next.
[speaker changes]: Further discussion further debate. Representative
Larry Hall, please state your purpose.
[speaker changes]: Speak on appeal.
[speaker changes]: The gentleman recognized to debate the bill
[speaker changes]: Thank you Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentleman of the
House and those who might be listening, the procedure by which we, came
to this deal has already been discussed. And everyday we have an
opportunity, to do the right thing, usually several times a day.
Sometimes we dont like doing whats right, folks say character is what
you do, when no one is watching. Well, it might even be what you do when
everyone is watching. Ive heard a lot of people say well, you know you
could have burnt your fingers on the staples 10 years ago when the
technical corrections ??. Admittedly that has not been the case for the
last 6 years but 10 years ago, if you had been here you might have
burned your hands on the staple or the paper might have been warm. Well,
the question will be are you better than your opponent? Are you better
than your contemporaries? The question is going to be are you better
than yourself? Have you learned? Can you do better?
[speaker changes]: Mr. Speaker
[speaker changes]: And so, as usual
[speaker changes]: Representative Stevens please state your purpose
[speaker changes]: Point of order on here ?? process for speaking on the
bill itself
[speaker changes]: The chair would, the chair will provide the gentleman
some latitude in light of the prior vote, but limited latitude. The
chair would encourage the gentleman to focus on the content of the bill
[speaker changes]: And so the content of the bill is content that we are
not familiar with, and the content of the bill is content that should
not be in a technical corrections bill much of it admittedly so by the
rules chair himself. So I would ask that you hold to our rules, we voted
on them at the start of session. We created that expectation, on the
rules and so the content of this bill is really inappropriate. But the
biggest thing is that you havent had a chance to now examine what else
youve seen when you read the bill. You looked in it. You saw that you
had substance ?? issues in there trying to figure out how they affect
us.

[Speaker Change]
Representative Tim Moore please state your purpose.
[Speaker Change]
Briefly debate the bill
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman’s recognized to debate the bill
[Speaker Change]
Mr. Speaker, members. I remember when I was in the minority and there
were times when we would have some huge fights over bills, there are
times on this floor today that some of us agree or disagree and have
huge arguments. But I have truly in 6 terms never seen so much fuss over
nothing as I have today. This is a bill that has primarily technical
corrections, it has some sustenance provisions. The ones that folks
didn't like amendments were passed, pulled em out. Some amendments
passed, the majority kept them in. This has been an open transparent
process, this bill is designed to be efficient to deal with issues that
on their own probably don't warrant a single bill. But all being put in
one bill the bill was examined in the committee, it was shared with the
committee, it went out on the internet before the committee members have
had roughly 3 days at this point to look at the bill. Yes there's been
some changes with amendments, but those have been relatively minor. I
just really have never seen such a fuss over something so small. We have
complied with the procedure. The only, and the bill is now properly
before us for third reading. The bill passed on second reading
presumably it will pass on the third reading. Members this is a good
bill. We try to take provisions from both sides of the aisle. There is
language in this bill that was recommended by members of the Democratic
Party. There are provisions in this bill recommended by members of the
Republican Party. It's not a partisan bill, it's not anything. It is a
bill to deal with other issues that need to be heard. If I may be
recognized for a motion.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman may state his motion.
[Speaker Change]
Move the previous question.
[Speaker Change]
Motion having been made. And duly seconded. The question before the
House is to put the main question. All in favor vote aye, all opposed
vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock the machine
and record the vote. 66 having voted in the affirmative, 30 in the
negative. The motion passes. Ladies and gentlemen this is on the main
question therefore the minority is allocated a period not to exceed 3
minutes for a final debate.
[Speaker Change]
The gentleman has the floor.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and I appreciate once again the rules chairs
summary of the bill that there's some things in there from democrats,
and a lot from the republicans and of course with the super majority you
would expect that whatever you decide you want to do, you can do in this
bill. We heard lots of people describe the fact that several items in
this bill were items that were in legislation that we passed or
addressed. And so the question has to come back such as the issue of
license plates in this bill that was in another bill regarding license
plates for charter school vehicles. We have legislation now that is
conflicting that we passed and obviously the changes made to this bill
have been superseded by action on another bill while this bill was being
discussed and processed. And so it's not really as simple as it might
seem to say it's bipartisan because there is some information in the
bill from democrats. And again the question is not as we reached back
again what happened 6 or 8 years ago. It's not even what happened
yesterday. The question is what did we learn? How can we improve what we
do today, and how we do it? This is the record we're setting for
subsequent general assemblies. I would hope that as you reflect on how
this bill was processed, I would hope that you would say at least that
process could have been improved and made fairer and more effective. And
I would hope that as that opportunity comes</p>

again, next time we will do better.  I understand people are locked in
today, and they're gonna vote irrespective of what happens.  I guess the
idea of Saturday session is no longer on the table, and even though the
Senate's not coming back until Monday, this is to demonstrate something
that is apparent to all of us already, which is you have a
supermajority.  You can pass anything you want.  Again, do you it just
'cause you can, do you care about the institution, do you understand the
precedent you're setting?  And, do you want someone else to be standing
here saying six years ago they rammed the technical corrections bill
down our throat so we should ram it down your throat now, six years from
today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes recognized for a period not to exceed three
minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Ladies and gentlemen of the House, the bill
that we have in front of us today is one that has been debated
thoroughly.  Whether you take it as a whole, or individually, the
separate parts, I think that what you'll find is a good piece of
legislation.  I think that what we have is a mechanism to move forward
some provisions and ideas that need to be enacted into law.  I don't
think that--I can vote for this bill, and I can feel good about it.  You
can vote for it and feel good about it as well because there's nothing
in here that's going to cause you any trouble when you go home.  I think
if the people in your district were sitting here and had the opportunity
to vote yes or no on the provisions of this bill, they would agree that,
yes, it deserves a yes vote.  So, thank you for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The question before the House is the passage of the House Committee
Substitute to House Bill 1133 on its third reading.  All in favor, vote
aye; all opposed vote no.  The Clerk will open the vote.  The Clerk will
lock the machine and record the vote.  Sixty-one having voted in the
affirmative and 35 in the negative, the House Committee Substitute to
House Bill 1133 has passed its third reading; will be sent to the Senate
engrossed as a result of the amendments prior to being sent.

Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Carney, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To be recognized for a question of privilege under Rule 8.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I don't ever
really rise--and you all know me by now--to question a lot of things.
But, I do listen to the prayers when they're said or read, and read one
this morning, and have the fortunate privilege of it being on my desk
and I've re-read it a couple of times today as we've moved forward.
And, one of the lines in the prayer was in all our deeds and words,
guide our thoughts and feelings.  So I've--that's resonated with me--all
day--as we've gone through these proceedings.  And what I'm rising to
speak about today is the integrity of our proceedings.  Never have I in
my twelve years seen what happened today; and, maybe there was a good
reason, but we were never told as a body that according to our rules,
Rule 20, Section D, no one shall vote from their station, their desk, no
one shall push the button for them.  That's a rule.  And yet, we have
members that were recorded as voting aye, and they were not at their
desk.  That happened on a couple of occasions.  Now our presiding
Speaker at that point did announce that some of the members on the side
of the room would be recorded as voting aye.  They didn't stand up and
ask for that--they didn't ask previous permission.  To my knowledge, or
to collectively us as a body, that's wrong, according to our rules.  I
was a victim of our rules, and I accepted that.  I was not able to
change a vote before it affected the outcome.  I respect the rules.  I
raised my six children and am influencing my 11 grandchildren; if you
have rules, you follow them.  Now if there's  a reason to break them,
then bring them before the people [end of data]</p>

that imposed those rules and let them weigh in.  But the rules were
broken and I don't know why.  But I was called upon here at my desk just
within my conscience to bring that question of the integrity of our
proceedings from this floor today.  Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] An inquiry of the Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, in regards to the question of privilege
just stated on the floor isn't it true that the Speaker actually
conferred with the House Minority Leader prior to the votes being done
that way in order to avoid a delay or a recess at that point?
That is correct.  The choice that we had was being able to continue the
discussion with the Appropriations Chairs or to halt the session for two
hours.  If Representative Hall, and he's turned on his light, if they'd
raised an objection we would have tried to suspend the rules for that
purpose but the goal was to try to let the session continue as we were
providing staff with direction that was necessary.  We have several
members who have perfect attendance and the entire time that they've
been in the Legislature and I'm talking years and we wanted to honor
their request to be able to record the votes and also to honor the rest
of the body by not delaying the proceeding for what we estimated to be
two hours.  Representative Hall, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the question of privilege or
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think the gentleman could be, or if the gentleman
would like to state a question regarding the prior inquiry that was the
purpose, or he was recognized for a parliamentary inquiry.  Does the
gentleman wish to be recognized?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Just want to make sure the record is clear, Mr.
Speaker.  It's my understanding and my recollection that after
Representative Moore had taken that procedure you came and explained to
me why you all were caucusing and that there would be but I was not
notified in advance of it happening and did not accept or acknowledge or
agree that it would happen. But you did let me know that the reason that
you were meeting in the Chamber was to avoid having a two hour delay and
that is why Representative Moore did that.  So I did not agree in
advance but was notified by you after the occurrence happened.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And the gentleman does understand, the Chair
acknowledged at that time it was well within your rights and within the
rules to raise an objection. Noted.  Representative Carney, please state
your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak again on my order of privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized for a point of personal
privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.  Well members, this is exactly what I guess
I was referring to. The rules are collectively voted on  by all of us. I
wasn't privileged to that conversation. I was here, heard it said from
the dais,  that those members would be recorded as voting yes. I
proceeded to look up the rules.  I knew nothing about any conversation
with anyone.  So if we are going to have rules around voting for
individuals in here we're going to collectively vote on it, then I
suggest that next year we look really hard at those rules and that we
have a bipartisan committee put together to look at our rules going
forward.  I dare say half to maybe over half in here did not know that
members were voting not being at their desk. I do know Mr. Speaker that
other speakers have presided and made the comment I'm holding the vote
for members to get back in here because they do want to keep their 100%
voting record. Well, you know, that's okay, that's good, that's not in
our rules but some of us have not had that privilege of having the rules
suspended nor even able to have that privilege to vote to have the rules
suspended to protect their vote. Whether it was 100% or whether it was a
wrong vote or whatever.  I'm just saying these rules are collective
rules and going forward I think they need to be spelled out more
specifically.  But I did not know that there was anything said that
people could be away from their desk.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Carney, on two points from the Chair
related to all, I'll infer from that was another discussion could have
been phrased in a parliamentary inquiry.  There have been a number of
instances when members</p>

<p id="220:00">
from the ?? caucus have gone to their desk, and I have asked them would
they like to be recorded.  That is effectively what occurred over here.
So I don't think that the actual violation of the rule as you have
stipulated has been limited as a courtesy to other members, more as a
practical matter.
The Chair would also remind the lady that a point of parliamentary
inquiry is within the rules and after the lady had read the rules and
not found that latitude, she could have raised that rules, raised that
objection; we could have had a vote, which is available to any of the
members.
Representative Jackson, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I just want to make sure everybody knows what
Representative Carney is talking about because we played a little fast
and loose with the facts today.  For instance, the technical correction
bill has not been out for three days; it was emailed to members of the
Rules committee yesterday at 9:15, so it's been out about 30 hours.
The first time that people were allowed to vote not from their desks,
the Speaker called it out and said Members so-and-so, so-and-so, and
so-and-so will be recognized as voted Aye.  The next at least five votes
that I saw this happen, the Speaker didn't even call it out.  I assume
the Clerk looked and saw how those members voted, but they didn't even
do what the Senate does and says Senator so-and-so votes Yes.  And so I
have no idea how Representative Burr or Representative Dollar voted.  I
know they were recorded as voted green, but there's no way to know that
because the Speaker didn't call it out.
And so I take Representative Carney's point to heart.  It's
well-received.  Rule 20E is very clear; it says the Speaker shall
enforce this rule without exception.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And again, the gentleman well-mentioned...the Chair will mention to the
gentleman that it was well within his rights to object to any practice
he viewed was a violation of the rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Holley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sitting here, I noticed many of those talking in caucus did this when
they asked for the vote.  Some did go back to their desk and vote, and
I'm sorry that it wasn't seen by everyone, and I'm sorry this has come
up.  But we want to have integrity and we do have integrity, but we're
not all perfect.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Tim Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak to a point of privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I want to make sure that the body understands that the manner in which
these votes were recorded since I was in the chair at the time.  The way
it was, when we were there, we were looking over to the members, I was
and the Clerk, and the members were indicating how they were voting.
And as they were voting I was telling him, Representative Burr, Yes,
Representative Burr, No.  I wasn't doing it into the mic, but it was
being done.  But at the end of the day, the members were all here.  I
think the members who were recorded were Representative Burr who's
seated right here, Representative Holloway, Representative Dollar,
Representative ?? a few cents left, and maybe Representative Hurley, I
can't recall, and Representative Johnson.  And all those members are
here on the floor, and I believe they were all recorded correctly.  If
any of them were not recorded correctly on their vote, I hope they would
stand up and speak.  But I believe they were all recorded correctly on
their vote.  So if we want to wait for the exercise for them to walk
back over from there to keep cross back and forth or to recess the House
for that purpose, I don't...again... I don't... maybe these kinds of
debates indicate that we've been in session too long.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And the Chair acknowledges the point that Representative Carney made
about reviewing the rules.  The Chair would point out a substantial
difference in the rules in 2011.  There's been some discussion about the
rules of 2009 and 2007 that the gentleman understands the lady voted for
back in her consideration as well.

experiences that the almighty has allowed me to experience in my almost
8 years of serving. But I tell you there's been some heartbreaking
things that have happened as well. I certainly hope that as you open up
your 2015 session, that each of you, and I'm not admonishing anybody, I
just want you to know how I feel. I hope you will search your minds,
your hearts, to do, and make sure you do the right thing. I tell a lot
of people that when I came to this legislature it was because the
almighty tapped me to replace the person who I replaced. And I have
enjoyed serving here, most of the time has been good, most of the time.
I've served under the democratic leadership, if you wanna call it that.
I've served under the republican leadership if you wanna call it that.
But I know there have been times when I have said I wished we did not
know what party anybody was a part of. That you vote your conviction for
your constituents. I heard someone say yesterday as I was walking into
the chamber, it's hard to vote against or to speak out and vote against
your leadership. Well I can imagine it is, sometimes you need to keep
your thoughts to yourself, and vote your conviction, and vote however it
is that you know that your constituents would have you to vote. I hope
that you will serve as long as you feel and as the almighty feels that
you can do good for the people for which you are to serve for, or the
people who put you in to serve. My advice if I had to give advice to
anybody would be do the right thing, and you don't have to worry about
coming back to correct something that you didn't such a good job on. I
love each and every one of you because my bible tells me that if you
wanna get into heaven you gotta love everybody. I don't like a lot of
you, but I love everybody. Sometimes I don't even like my seatmate. But
basically that's the thing that we need to keep in our hearts, and our
minds is doing the thing that we were sent here to do by our
constituents. I don't know if, and I haven't done any research, but I
just wonder how many of you in here have constituents who also serving
with you in this house. That would be an interesting gesture. But I
didn't think there ?? many of you. So why is it we need to rely on what
our constituents are saying before we cast a vote?
[Speaker Change]
Representative Mobley without objection we're gonna let you to continue
past your time allocation.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you. So I guess the main thing that I wanna leave with you,
keeping your hearts and minds clear as you do the people’s business. Do
what is right for the people who placed you here, who voted you to come
in. I will come back and visit every now and then. I don't know when I
will but you might look up in the back of the room, or up in the gallery
and I'll be sitting up there sometimes.</p>

But I have you to know that it's interesting to me how God has removed
so many of us from this, from this place, not because of a vote or
because He touched and said I'm ready for you to come in.  I think back
and think about the persons who I replaced and who some of you replaced.
 A lot of us have traded this way, and a lot of us have not come back.
Even in the course of a year, you think back and you recognize the
number of people who used to be here.  It's a good place to serve, it's
a great place to serve, and continue doing the right thing for the
people of this great state and your community.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
{SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Catlin, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For an hour long speech.  Just kidding.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is out of order, but will be recognized
for a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  No, no sir, for an announcement, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Oh, for an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The committee for Environmental Regulatory Reform
will meet 15 minutes after Session in Room 1425, and we're going to be
looking at one Bill, and we won't be there very long.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Burr, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The gentleman is recognized for a point of personal

[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Yesterday was a pretty busy
day around the General Assembly, and we adjourned before I could return
back to my desk from working on budget issues to stand and let you all
know that I am trying to catch up with my seatmate in age, and we did
for a little bit, but he turned another year older yesterday and had a
birthday, and had the pleasure of spending the evening. until about
11:30 last night, with myself and Representative Lambeth and
Representative Avila and Brisson, working on the budget, so he had a
great birthday, I'm sure, spending it with us all night long, and I hope
you'll  join me in wishing him a happy belated birthday.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Grier Martin, please state your
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The gentleman is recognized for a point of personal

[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.  Members, since it
looks like we're not going to be here tomorrow, I did want to bring the
Members' attention to a significant anniversary of an important event in
America's social and military history.  On July 26, 1948, President
Harry S. Truman signed Executive Order 9981, and the effect of that
Order was to desegregate our nation's armed services.  Now, he wasn't a
magician, he didn't wave a magic wand and end all sorts of
discrimination in the military immediately, but it was the first big
step directing that the armed services do take all actions necessary to
eliminate that, and I think it's just important to say that when we
reduce barriers it makes our nation great, and I can speak from
experience that, without a doubt, one of the main reasons we've got the
greatest military in the world was this step that our nation took many,
many years ago.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Dixon, please state your purpose
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  For an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The gentleman is recognized for an announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr. Speaker, Members, in light of the announcement
that I made yesterday, that 15 minutes after Session today the House
Committee on Agriculture would meet; the Committee on Agriculture will
not meet today, and, Mr. Speaker, if there are any of the members that
are sufficiently disappointed at that, Representative Langdon and I will
remain here at our desk for a few minutes so that you can come and
chastise us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't think the gentlemen will have to wait long.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Pittman, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  For a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The gentleman is recognized for a point of personal
privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Well, I was going to wait until next Wednesday to do
this, but we may or may not be here, so I guess I'll have to do it
today.  My seatmate is a...</p>

very kind gentleman, who I have to fuss at him a little bit, though,
because he does have a tendency to be kind and share food with me and
that's help put the 20 lbs. on me that I put on last year I've got to
work to get off. But he meant it kindly and I've enjoyed sharing with
him. He is a good gentleman who is just that, a gentleman.  Even when we
disagree pretty strongly on some things we vote on around here. He
treats me very kindly and I do appreciate it. On Wednesday he is going
to be 106 years old. No, excuse me. That's right.  I lost track after we
got in that debate earlier.  It took so long.  He'll be 66 on Wednesday.
Just want to wish him a very Happy Birthday and just all the wonderful
things that the good Lord can bring along with it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Tim Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a motion if there are no further notices or announcements.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The chair sees no members wishing to rise. The gentleman is recognized
for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I move that subject to the ratification bills, messages
from the Senate, committee reports, conference reports, re-referral
bills and resolutions, appointment of conferees, introductions of bills
and resolutions, and modifications to the calendar that the House do now
adjourn, to reconvene on Monday, July 28th, 2014 at 4pm, and as a
footnote to that I believe that will be for a skeleton session only on
that day.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct for Monday. Continue to check your email. Whether or not
we can give more that 24 hours notice the chair cannot commit.  But
there will be no votes on Monday. Representative Moore moves, seconded
by Representative Lewis, that the House do now adjourns subject to
ratification of bills and resolutions, receipt of messages from the
Senate, receipt of committee reports, conference reports, re-referral
bills and resolutions, appointment of conferees, and adjustments to the
calendar to reconvene on Monday, July 28th at 4pm. All in favor say aye.
All opposed, no. The ayes have it. The House stated has adjourned.</p>
