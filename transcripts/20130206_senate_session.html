Clerk: …bill 10, government reorganization and efficiency act.
Speaker: Representative is recognized to explain the bill. Senator, you
have the floor.
Representative: Thank you Mr. President and members of the senate.  What
this senate bill does is it is for governmental efficiency and
reorganization. It specifically does dseveral things. One, it eliminates
redundant and old state boards. Second, it recognizes and modifies
compositions of some boards. Thirdly, it just makes up – what we are
doing her in following the rules and promises many of us ran on, to make
government more efficient, to downsize it, to save money, and carry out
our role as legislators. In a nutshell, that is what it does. At this
time, Mr. Speaker, I would like to send forth an amendment to that bill.
Speaker: Senator do the members have copies?
Representative; Yes.
Speaker: Send forth your amendment.
Representative :Thank you Mr. President. What this amendment does is it
goes back to…
Speaker: Senator, hold one second. The clerk will read the amendment.
Clerk: Senator moves to amend the bill.
Speaker: Senator Raven is recognized to explain the amendment.
Representative: Thank you Mr. President. The amendment specifically
addresses four parts of the bill. You all have it before you. These were
brought to us and our attention yesterday and last evening as things we
should possibly address. They have to do with the wildlife commissions
petitions board, the industrial commission, and the utilities
commission. I urge everyone to support the amendment.
Speaker: Senator Apodaka, for what purpose do you rise?
Representative: Will Senator Raven, yield for a question?
Speaker: Senator Raven, do you yield.
Representative: I yield.
Speaker: Senator yields, Senator Apodaka, you have the floor.
Representative: Thank you Mr. President. Senator Raven, my and Senator
Nesbitt’s dietician and nutrition has been calling for beign off the
board. Has that been corrected in this?
Representative: Yes it has.
Representative: Thank you and she is doing a wonderful job by the way.
Well she works by the pound on both of us.
Speaker: Further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question before
the senate is the passage of amendment 1. All in favor will vote aye,
all opposed will vote no. Ten seconds will be allowed for the voting.
The clerk will record the vote: 34  having voted in the affirmative, 3
in the negative. Senator Clark, up or down? Senator Clark, affirmative.
Here we go with a new count: 45  having voted in the affirmative, 3   in
the negative. Amendment 1 is adopted and now the bill, as amended, is
back before the body. Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator
Stein , for what purpose do you rise?
Representative: To send forth an amendment.
Speaker: Do the members have copies Senator?
Representative: I believe that they do.
Speaker: Members have copies. You can send forth your amendment.
Representative: Thank you. Members of the senate…
Speaker: Senator, one minute. The clerk needs to read the amendment.
Clerk: Senator Stein moves to amend the bill.
Speaker: Senator Stein you have the floor to explain the bill.
Representative: Thank you Mr. President. Members of the senate, the bill
is entitled, “The Government Reorganization and Efficiency Act,” and
what this amendment does is essentially convert this to the government
efficiency act. There are a number of boards and commissions whose
utility has long since past so that we do not want the whole bill to go
down. We want those expirations to go forward, and you can see them</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the Senate, this amendment addresses the conflict of interest
provisions that I hope were just inadvertently deleted in this bill as
it references two of the important commissions. First is the Coastal
Area Management Commission. If you look on page 4, on line 45 of your
bill where it talks about the appointment of that commission, on the
bottom of that page there’s some conflict of interest provisions that
are deleted, beginning on line 45.  The members of that commission who’s
qualifications are described, are described in subdivisions 3 through 5
shall be persons who do not derive any significant portion of their
income from land development, construction, real estate sales, or
lobbying or do not otherwise serve as agents for development related
business activities.  The Governor shall require disclosure of those
conflicts and the Governor by executive order shall promulgate criteria.
 And that is in reference to the Coastal Area, the Coastal Resources
Commission, I’m sorry. Which issues, handles the planning and
development for our coastal area and issues those permits.  Clearly, we
will want to provide, protect against the conflict of interest from
those on the Commission who are providing for those rules and procedures
and issuing those permits and people who are actually engaged in the
business that  will benefit from that permitting process. That’s a
standard conflict of interest provision that was provided in specific
for these particular kinds of commissions. They supplement what is
already in the set States Ethics Act as it relates to these commissions
and I would think that would be an important provision to keep in.  It
would not interrupt anything else you were doing in terms of changing
the number of the membership. Then on page 9, line 10 through 12, on
that page, it addresses the Environmental Management Commission and it
will talk about the 9 members appointed by the Governor under this
section and it just provides in lines 10 through 12, they shall not be
persons who derive any significant portion of their income from persons
subject to the permits or enforcement orders under this chapter. So that
means you won’t have people sitting on the commission who derive, who
make money from the people coming to get the permits. Again, a standard
conflict of interest provision that would prohibit pay to play, and I
think you would want to include those provision in along with the other
changes you are making.  Again it does not keep you from creating a new
team or reducing the numbers or creating the efficiencies you had in
mind. I thank you and I hope I didn’t go over the box meter limit.  Mr.
Chairman.  Senator Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate? Senator Apodaca? Senator Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate. We thank
you for your amendment but everything you addressed is already under the
existing law.</p>

Senators, we'll be in recess until ten after three. Senate will come
back to order. Senate bill ten is back before us. On it's second
reading, is there any further discussion or debate? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissik, for what purpose do
you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To send forth an amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator do the members have copies? [SPEAKER CHANGES] They do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You send forward your amendment Senator. Clerk will
read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissik moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissik, you have the floor. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Ironically enough, this amendment was circulated to you at the
beginning of session today, but addresses the same question that Senator
Hartsell has raised. When I was looking at this particular provision in
the bill that dealt with the superior court judges, the special superior
court judges, it gave me a great deal of concern because it seemed to be
the type of matter which is certain to result in litigation and that
litigation will be on going for quite some time. And I'm not sure it's
really worth it to get into that litigation, to have the courts deciding
this issue. I mean, what we have here, and I went back to try to get
some data about what these twelve superior court judges did and what
they contributed as they're related to all the superior court judges
here in North Carolina. And we looked back to the most recent physical
year, what we find is that all of our superior court judges in this
state and roughly two hundred three thousand nine hundred thirty-five
cases, roughly two hundred four thousand, of those cases, roughly twelve
percent were handled by these special superior court judges. So, they're
carrying a substantial degree of the case load. A lot of the work. They
are desperately needed. If they are deleted, which I think is the wrong
thing to do, you're gonna have a superior court system that is back
logged with cases. And it's absolutely unnecessary to do it. I think
it's not very good public policy. It's certainly appears to violate the
constitution of the state of North Carolina. And, I think this
particular provision is extraordinarily problematic. So, I would
strongly encourage you to delete this particular provision in this bill.
Avoid the time consuming litigation that will inevitably come. And the
potential of us really losing their qualifications, the experience, and
the wisdom of the twelve seated judges that are in these particular
positions. So, for that reason I've sent forth this amendment. And I
would request your support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise?[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, you have the floor
to speak on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President.
Number one, I always find it a little bit comical when I hear an
attorney say they hope we can avoid any litigation when they do that to
make a living. So, I might just lay that out there first. We had a
meeting over here of, probably would have cost somebody a few thousand
dollars for that thirty minutes, but what we heard there was no
definitive decision made upon this group on whether this is or is not. I
think one can always take issue with appointments made in late December,
when someone's leaving office the first week of January. We won't get
into that being the choice to make for jurist. So, I think in essence,
we should defeat this amendment and let's let the courts decide if they
do indeed think this is a problem. So, I ask for you to vote against
this amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate
the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, you have the floor to debate
the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much Mr. President. And
to my colleagues here in the Senate, I learned a long time ago that
participatin in acts of futility wasn't a wisest thing to do, but let me
ply one. I made a reference to try to find something that's relevant to
the conversation that's going on because part of what has been said is
we are doing this bill as well as the part of it contained in the
amendment, because it was done before. And, there was justification for
doing it before. First place, well, there's two reasons and I wanted to
point out to you. First place, I do still remember that passage in
Leviticus 24:20, I believe, that talks about, you know, if a man breach,
you breach him back, an eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth. So, I always
learned that's the worst reason to do something because somebody has
done it before, done it to you. Second thing, I don't remember anybody
doing this specifically to me, but let me tell you this, I also remember
on of the passages of...</p>

<p id="30:00">
In one of Martin Luther King Jr's speeches which helped shape my
viewpoints on obligation to each other and the whole concept of
nonviolence, and his point was that if we really believe in this eye for
an eye and tooth for a tooth thing, what we will end up with is a nation
that is without sight, and toothless. And that doesn’t serve any real
purpose to anybody either. But let me set the record straight on two
things. First, the judicial issues in 1987, when in fact the superior
court judges and specials were eliminated, was a result of an effort led
by Governor Martin who had the power to appoint these superior court
judges. And in fact had appointed most of the special superior court
judges because every governor who serves more than 4 years appoints all
of the special superior court judges, they always have, these superior
court judge terms are for 5 years, and so if they were made before the
last year of the sitting governor’s term the new governor appoints them
too. That’s simply been the case, but in 1987, the state had been sued
by the North Carolina Republican Party, by the NAACP, by the North
Carolina Black Lawyer’s Association, and the crux of that suit was that
the way superior court judges had been elected, had prevented first
Republicans and secondly African Americans from being elected to the
superior court bench. In ’87 there were 12 superior court judges I
think, either 6 or 12, and after redistricting, with the effort of all
these parties that I’ve mentioned coming together, the urban areas of
the state, specifically the big counties, were essentially broken apart
into single member judge judicial districts. There were minority
districts, majority/minority districts created. Rather than spending the
millions and millions of dollars that it would take to create new
judgeships, it made sense since you were having the same number that you
would use these special judgeships that were already funded. Governor
Martin realized that he would make the appointments, and in fact, there
was some terms that would not have expired in time for these elections.
They were extended for one year or two years, I forget exactly how long,
but they were extended so that we wouldn’t have to confront this
question; whether you could end a term while a judge was still sitting
in it? But let’s go back to the real reason that you got there. We were
talking about earlier, my good friend Senator Tillman was talking about
bringing your team in. The last place you want to bring your team in,
and make them think they're a part of a team, is to the judicial branch
of government. Everybody over time has learned that you do want to
separate decisions made by judges when they’re supposed to interpret the
law from decisions made by politicians, especially those who make the
law. The whole march of history says that you don’t want to do that, so
I hope that Senator Tillman didn’t mean that you want your team in these
judgeships. I can understand that argument and some of these
quasi-executive areas, some of these quasi-judicial places, the Utility
Commission, and some of the others, although I think that the logic
about judges applies equally well to the Utilities Commission, and the
reason these things are staggered, that is the Utilities Commission is
so that you get some continuity and you get some sense of history as to
why the rates were this at one point or why these arguments prevail
differently now, but let me get to the issue in the amendment. The
question of us getting up, and have somebody sue us, get the court, and
join this action from taking effect on them, then taking the time to go
up through the court system is a year or two years. We’ve spent the
money, and I will tell you, I doubt that you will be able to get lawyers
to do it for the cost that it will take to have the judges serving
during that term, but Governor, Governors Heredafor, and this governor,
Governor McCrory will have a chance to appoint I think either 3 or 5
judges as of June 30th, because their terms expire. Another 3 or 4 of
them will have their terms expire next year, and all but 2 of them would
expire over Governor McCrory’s term. Now you do something different in
this bill because you’ve got sense enough to know that there was a
reason to have these business courts. Now we could have set up business
courts, and let these judges run statewide, but</p>

<p id="35:00">
We made the decision, that is following the advice and lead of the
Judicial Branch, Supreme Court, to use three of these special judgeships
and designate them business for judges.  One is in Charlotte, one in
Greensborough and one in Raleigh.  And they’ve been some of the most
successful courts that the state has ever seen.  Most litigators,
especially business litigators will break their ankles to get into one
of these business courts to get their issues resolved.  Because you get
consistency, you know who your judge is going to be, but your reserving
these judges out of eliminating the special.  So even if your argument,
that you can eliminate a whole class of judges were to hold water,
you’ve now made an exception to it.  Because you’ve accepted 3 of the 15
Special Superior Court Judges from what you’re doing to all of the
others.  Now, I’m glad you did because these judges have cases spread
over long periods, the litigants again major corporations and the
businesses of this state wouldn’t know how their cases are going to end
up and wouldn’t know ultimately where they’re going to go. But I
certainly hope that you will vote for this amendment, you probably
won’t, but I hope that it will stimulate some of you to think. You
should pull this provision out of this bill and you ought to re-think
it.  Last point, I’ve been fortunate enough over the years to try cases
before dozens of judges. And I tell you, there is no difference in the
quality, and in fact, sometimes it’s better, that you get from Special
Superior Court Judges and from Resident Superior Court Judges. Early in
my legal career, Governor Holshouser had made one of the better
appointments of a Special Superior Court Judge .He had been the prize
city attorney here in Raleigh. His name was Donnie Smith.  And I want
you to know that the entire bar, or most of the bar in Wake County,
especially those of us who were younger, but the established bar in Wake
County in 1977 led the effort to have Jim Hunt reappoint Donnie Smith to
Superior Court. And Donnie held that position as long as he wanted to
until he was appointed to the Court of Appeals by Governor Martin.  And
so I tell you that the general feeling in the bar is it’s good to have
these judges around because they do as good a job as any. And I said
last but I’ll give you one last thing too. I may be arguing against the
best interest of Wake County.  We have 10% of the state’s population in
this county and among the highest case loads and court loads of any of
the counties. There are 112 Superior Court Judges I believe so just ??
would say if that’s the case there ought to be 11 or 12 Superior Court
Judges resident in Wake County.  There are 6 resident in Wake County. So
a lot of these Special Superior Court Judges end up holding terms of
court in Wake County because of the case load. We just built the most
expensive building in the history of this county that will open in a
couple of months.  200 and something million dollar new courthouse with
quarters for not only these Special Judges but for any other judges who
are visiting.  Because of the case load that we have in this county. So
it may be that these additional judges will end up as resident judges in
Wake County. But clearly you cannot reduce the number of judges without
directly impacting the Party of Justice in the state and I think that
the Supreme Court, both Republicans and Democrats on it will tell you
that, the administrative officers of the court will tell you that. And
they will tell you that the system is designed, maybe not all over the
state, but certainly in these half hour marriages.  So that the number
of Superior Court Judges that we have is the number that you need to
deliver justice in this state. We haven’t created any more residential
Superior Court Judges that I’m aware of in the last decade. At least not
in this county and we could have been one of the counties to receive it.
So I hope that you will rethink this willy-nilly manner of just
eliminating the judiciary because you think that judges of all people
want to be part of the new team. I would argue to you that they are the
last people that want to be part of anybody’s team unless they’re
teaming up with justice and fairness.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, this does move forward and I don’t
believe there’s any thought about teams. This is a matter of
specifically dealing with the Superior Court Judges that there are many
of us in the Senate and in the General Assembly that believe that a
Superior Court Judge should not be appointed at large in that manner but
more importantly, ultimately come from a designed or a Superior Court
District like the rest of them do. And this is really the first step of
moving in that direction so that the people will have the ultimate
choice of who are the judges not.</p>

?? officials. So I would hope that everyone understood that is the
purpose behind why this moves forward. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator McKissick, what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Speak a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, you have the
floor to speak a second time to the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If
indeed the long term plan is to revisit the ?? superior court judges are
elected in this state and what we need is a bill that come forward that
addresses that issue. But that's not the issue before us today. Today
the issue is eliminating 12 sitting judges that are on the bench that
handle 25 thousand cases. 12 percent of the workload. You're just gonna
fire them? What's gonna happen to those 25 thousand cases that they
handle? What's gonna happen to those litigates? Those people in your
districts? Those people from out of the state North Carolina that either
file lawsuits ?? superior court or individual criminals, some might have
been involved in pending matters before superior court judges. What's
gonna happen to those 25 thousand cases? You have now inundated an
already back law judicial system by firing 12 judges. If you wanna
revisit the way we handle our superior court judges and you don't think
they need to be special judges, you wanna revisit how we go about doing
that, then come forth with a comprehensive bill that addresses it. But
don't go out there and fire 12 sitting judges, particularly when you
know you're dealing with some potentially constitutional issues, and if
you fail, you owe all these people back pay. You're gonna end up having
to address a broad variety of other issues. So if you trying to fix a
problem, fix it in a fitting an appropriate comprehensive way, not with
this type of solution, which is only gonna put the judicial system
behind the 8 ball with all these cases that will now need to be handled
without the capacity ??, these judges that are special judges, they ??
throughout the entire state, all 100 counties, they get involved in
lengthy cases, complex cases frequently. When there's a sitting judge
that can't handle a case for some reason, they come in and do it. So
they handle a lot of the work of a system. So if we are trying to do
what we need to do in terms of helping those that are in our superior
courts, we don't need to fire 12 sitting judges, over 10% of the man
power, and leave those 25 thousand cases just to be some part of a back
law. That's not the right thing to do in terms of public policies so I
hope that in terms of this particular provision of this bill, we can
delete it, move on, avoid the litigation costs and not impact those who
have ?? the impact in our superior courts today. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? What makes you rise?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Senator McKissick would yield for a question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator do you yield for a question?  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? McKissick, thank you sir. You know, we're talking
about a very back lawed court, and all of these individual, would you
consider to help this entire process to increase the number of supreme
court justices so that we can help the entire system? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well that's a completely different issue, they take on a pellet cases,
these are the sitting judges that decide cases that are original
jurisdiction. We get the supreme court, you've gotta go through superior
court and has to get appealed up to the court of appeals and then it has
to go from the court of appeals to the supreme court. I'm open to all
types of issues dealing ?? judicial system, if they are part of a total
solution to problems that we may have. That's not the issue before us,
the issue today is deleting 12 sitting judges on the court of original
jurisdictions superior court. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up question, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, do you have the floor for a follow up
question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] In that same ??, Senator McKissick, you know
information we've received, and I'm sure you being an attorney, you know
better, but there are a lot of cases that the supreme court can't seem
to get to because of the fact of their workload, so this would help the
entire process in getting a lot of questions answered. So don't you
think that would be a good idea to expand this ?? ?? by two more
justices? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, when a supreme court hears, they're
unlike the court of appeals, whoever appeals they help court in
different panels ?? three judges. Supreme court sits as a whole. So I
don't think it's gonna help them deal with backlog cases, no. If you
want, perhaps, a different diversity of people that are part of that
court, then that's one thing, but it won't increase the speed of which
they can address cases that are backlogged. I think you ?? for more
fundamental solution to address that issue. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brock, what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak for the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator you
have the floor to speak for the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One of the
great things about our constitution it's written in plain English for
many normal people to understand. Not that I claim to be normal, but
we're all looking at, I believe the wrong section and we're confusing
the difference between regular judges</p>

[Speaker Change]
And special Judges. And there’s a large print addition for those of us
who are visually impaired. If you’ll look at your Constitution, Article
Four, Section Nine, when it talks about the formation of Superior
Courts. The General Assembly may provide by general law for the
selection or appointment of special or emergency of Superior Court
Judges not selected for a particular judicial district. We are the
General Assembly. We may or may not provide for these Judges. It’s in
the Constitution. We’re not looking at other parts of the Constitution
talking about regular Judges. We’re talking about the special Judges.
Which we, as the General Assembly, may or may not appoint or select. I
urge you to vote against the amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Mr. President.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Newton, for what purpose do you rise?
[Speaker Change]
To speak to the amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Senator Newton, you have the floor to speak to the amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Colleagues, I’ve heard the comment and arguments
so far this morning on this amendment, this question on special Judges.
And Senator McKissick, I heard you recite some statistics. That, that is
candidly show that is not my experience with special court Judges. Some
information that we’ve had, and I’ve had for some time is that these
special Superior Court Judges average less than ten hours a week on the
bench. That’s less than two days. You and I both sir know that many of
these appointments over the years have been blatantly political. And a
number of these positions that you are referring to about being fired in
a heavy case load, we all know we are just appointed here at the inter
Governor Trace Term. One fellow, I believe his name is Young. I’m, I’m
not sure what his qualifications are to be a Judge. Maybe, maybe their
good. Maybe they’re not. The point of the matter is that when you have a
new management team, which we are. And we have new government, Governor,
which we do. It is the prerogative of this Body, as Senator [??] pointed
out, to make fundamental changes to our State government. We have an
opportunity to change the system. Many of us do believe that our Judges
should be elected and not appointed, for political purposes. Or
political payoffs. Or retirement plans. It’s a nice part-time job. I
wish I had a part-time job that paid that well. I don’t. I work here. As
we all know. It’s time that we make these kinds of changes. I know it’s
not pretty sometimes when new management comes to town and says, we got
to make fundamental changes. Sometimes good people have to be removed.
New, as the analogy went, new football coach, sometimes good assistant
coaches and other staff have to go because the new team’s there. That’s
where we are today. This, this Bill, this section of the Bill says we’re
going to eliminate special Superior Court Judges except for the business
core. Part of the reason for that is because they’re not pulling that
much of a workload. Part of it is because we had a plan to have elected
Judges going forward. I urge you to defeat this amendment.
[Speaker Change]
Let the record show that Senator Brunstetter’s absence is removed. He’s
back in the chamber with us. Is there any further discussion or debate?

Four. All in favor will vote aye. Opposed no. Ten seconds will be

your desk a page that has been forwarded to you by me, and it is
entitled &quot;Cancer Prevention Study Number Three&quot;.  This year,
the American cancer society celebrates its one 100th anniversary.
Today, you have a unique, once in a lifetime opportunity to fight back
against cancer by enrolling in the American Cancer Society's new
research study, called them the cancer prevention study - three.  By
joining this study, you can help researchers better understand the
genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors that cause or prevent
cancer, which will ultimately save more lives and create more birthdays.
 You're eligible to join if you are between the ages of 30 and 65 years,
I have never been diagnosed with cancer, not including squamis or basal
cell skin cancers, and are willing to make a long-term commitment to the
study, which involves completing periodic follow-up surveys at home for
the next 20 to 30 years.  For more information you may see the sheet
that is on your desk.  Thank you very much.
