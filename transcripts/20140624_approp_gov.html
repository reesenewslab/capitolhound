<p id="00:00">
Good afternoon. I wanted to thank everyone for the House Committee on
Government today. I want to start off with an introduction of arms.
Reggie Fields. Marvin Lee. John Brandon, behind me. And Mike Clampett.
Introduction of pages, Thomas Moore III from Orange County sponsored by
Representative Insko, Hadley Nelson from Mecklenburg County sponsored by
Representative Samuelson. Carter Noker from New Hanover County sponsored
by Representative Davis. Rowley Pearson from Wake County sponsored by
Representative Stam. And Lucy Russell from Wake County sponsored by
Representative Meyer. Ladies and gentlemen, we have three bills. We’re
working steadily to shut down the government committee for this summer
session so we do appreciate your attendance today and discussion on
these bills so we can move forward. First up we’ll have is House Bill
1051. Representative Whitmire. [PAUSE] And I will remind everyone,
plenty of discussion, let’s roll. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Chair. Thank you committee. I will be succinct but I certainly welcome
questions as they’re needed. One of the many study committees that met
January through April was the food desert zone study committee. And what
we discovered, a term that often times people ask what’s a food desert
in the first place. In a nutshell, we have 1.5 million North Carolinians
in 80 counties that depend on the definition whether they’re in a rural
area or an urban area, don’t have ready access to nutritious food. And
we’re talking do they live in an urban area where it’s a three quarter
mile walk to a corner store or in a rural area where it’s 15 miles to
just a grocery store. So in the end, cardiovascular disease, obesity, so
many health maladies that are exacerbated by poor nutrition, the
American Heart Association, YMCAs, the PTAs, the alliance for health and
a host of others came on board to give us support. Certainly bipartisan,
Representative Holley was very key. And with that we found a way with
House Bill 1051, to regear government in a measure to where money that
the state receives federally can be more effectively and efficiently
used by an organization, Cooperative Extension, that’s geared to connect
agriculture, agribusiness to where people are who need their products.
And simply put, this is a way to more efficiently use several programs.
Some are feeding programs through the department of public health, that
accounts for about 8 million dollars. It’s not utilized throughout the
state, but those funds are there. And school breakfasts, which that
figure gets up to 113 million dollars, it’s federally funded. While 96%
of the school systems use them, 30% of the kids don’t participate. And
there’s many other programs to where being, using an agency that’s
geared to connect people with agriculture and agribusiness, and provide
better markets for the private non-profit and government sectors, this
bill is just an efficiency measure. It doesn’t require an appropriation.
And I ask that you support it. I’ll entertain questions if there are
any. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative. To the committee, any
questions for the bill sponsor? Representative Luebke. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, in the bill I notice that once again the contract goes to
NC State and NCA&amp;T plays a secondary role. And I’m wondering first
of all if one of the bill sponsors would address why they’re not
co-equal. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will address that question. But first of
all what we’re doing is we’re doing a system, we just transfer something
over to a system that’s already in place. And NC State has more outlets
in the cooperative extension than does A&amp;T. But this will be done in
conjunction with A&amp;T, and with some of the other entities that are
involved. We were just looking for a way of shifting monies a little
bit, for a network that was out there, so that somebody in one county,
all the counties can get the same information. And that’s basically what
this is. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Just a quick follow up. So you as bill
sponsors are happy, and Representative Holley you spoke to it, are happy
with this arrangement? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, and A&amp;T is happy with
it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other
questions from the committee?</p>

Situation has become an political hot potato and this town had
deliberately turned away town appointments to the ETJ board to represent
ETJ residents and the reason they did that is that they have the survey
where they ask the applicants do you support the town's planning and
basically they now ask for a rating. Rate from one to six I think it is.
How much you support the town and then they go and pick those people. So
there is no real representation for anybody in the ETJ who does not want
regulation and that's the folks who have come to us and have asked for
some relief from this regulation from authority they cannot elect. They
can vote for their state representative their state Senator, their
county commissioners but they cannot vote for these town commissioners
who're putting regulations on them and the real reason remember for
having an ETJ it's for expanding, expansion of the town and the school
of governments had a presentation where they said well I had an ETJ it
was for the areas that were expected to come within their corporate
limits in the near future and allow for a smoother transition from
county to municipal services. ?? has never annexed anyone except
voluntarily and if it's voluntary then the owners of that property do
not have to put those regulations put on them they voluntarily choose
those and they ask to come into the town and then meet all the
conditions of the town. We are here to represent our constituents on a
local bill that I'm sure all of you would on your own local bill to
represent the constituents that would vote for you who want some relief
from this basically the tyrannical power that this town exercises. This
town which constantly goes into private meetings closed meetings to
discuss every meeting under the sun. They are not forth coming. The
mayor that stood their yesterday has stood on the council for many years
and knew about this issue but acted like he was completely new. And
that's why we stand here today to protect our citizens and I'd hope that
you would support this bill.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you. Representative Holly.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you mister chair. First of all I'd like to say the district of
Columbia is a perpetual ETJ to nobody and they don't have voting rights
in Congress. But they benefit through all the laws and things set up
coming out of the federal government and the adjacent areas in Virginia
and the state of Maryland. And so does the town of Boon, just wanted to
put that out there.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you so much Representative Holly. Representative Fisher.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thanks mister chairmen. So I have a question for the bill sponsors so
what you want is a move from the tyrannical powers of the town counsel
to the tyrannical powers of the state legislature. ??
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Yes you may reply.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
I'd object that was completely unfounded that was not at all the
continuance of what we were discussing. They could now go and petition
they're county commissioners for protection from using such things as
high impact land use ordinance which is out there now and get protection
from people they can actually vote for.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Follow up mister...
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Follow up.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you mister chairmen, just a statement. I noted that in the remarks
today that you spoke of the mayor of the town of Boon as having been a
longtime member of the town council. And while that may be true he is a
very recent mayor and I noted from his remarks yesterday that their has
been an ongoing effort to bring folks around the table on this issue. I
would hope that that would be something that the sponsors would
entertain rather than coming straight to the legislature for relief.
Thank you.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you. Representative Bird.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Mister chair I just wanted to be recognized at the appropriate time for
a motion.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you. Representative Pippin.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
That's what I was gon' do.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Representative Ramsey, Representative Collins.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
I gotta a question would you explain what was...you at least alluded to
one time yesterday about some kinda hundred foot elevation rule where
apparently there's more restrictions on people that live above the level
of a certain transportation artery or something I didn't understand what
that was all about.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
I think what you may be referring to is what mister Templeton was
talking about what happens with Boon being lower and having the
surrounding countries around it higher that the amount of regulations
for their steep slope is vastly disproportionate the vast majority is
outside the town of Boon. So they are regulating disproportionately
people outside the town of Boon than people inside the town of Boon.
SPEAKER CHANGES:
Any other questions from the committee. Representative Lu.

Thank you mister chairmen let me start with a ...</p>

Question for staff and this is about Watauga County. Does Watauga County
have a zoning ordinance?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It does not have a general zoning or sub divisional
ordinances, is my understanding.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I guess the follow up would be if there is no zoning
protection for the citizens of Watauga County including those inside the
ETJ, would you not want to amend your bill to say that it takes effect
on the same day or the day after Watauga County passes a zoning
ordinance which clearly protects people in the ETJ.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] What I don’t like about that is the people of Watauga
County have the right to petition their county commission to talk about
zoning or not. For a contingency on something that the people have a
right to do or not seems to be a bit restrictive and one of the reasons
why from the original bill we changed the date of effect to 1st January
was that that gives us a six month window for people to begin to look at
if they have any concerns and be able to address those to the county
commissioner if they have some but that would be, once again, the people
of Watauga County making that decision with their duly elected
officials. So I think that can be covered in that timeframe and that
should be up to the people of Watauga County to decide. They can choose
at any time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Follow up. I thought I heard someone say
yesterday, it may have been you sir that along these lines of what the
Watauga County has done, that Watauga County has endorsed this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There was a resolution from the Watauga County
Republican Party. That was a local group and they endorsed this. So,
that’s what you’re probably referring to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well you implied that it was endorsed by the county
commission and I’m now hearing that it has not been endorsed by the
county commission. So.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think you’re confusing a couple of issues here. At
one point I did mention about the resolution and that at another time
another question was asked if the county commission had endorsed it and
it was clearly stated that there had not been a county resolution but
that a majority of county commissioners do, in fact, support this. That
was what was stated. I’m sorry if you misunderstood.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But, what I heard was that the county commissioners
had taken a vote in support of the SB865. That was inferable but not
what you meant?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry if you infer that is not what I said that’s
not what I meant.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Faircloth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Chairman. I looked a little further
into some of what we heard yesterday and the discussions that went on
and I think Representative Fisher mentioned, I heard the mayor
introduced as the new mayor and I got the impression that he was new to
the game and therefore haven’t had a lot of input into this. Perhaps I
misunderstood him but I was operating under the assumption he was
relatively new to this particular argument. Then I found that he’s been
a member of council for a while. I’ve also served on city councils and I
frankly think there’s a place for ETJ. I think if it’s used correctly it
can help cities and towns plan to move the way they want to move but
after looking further into the ?? situation, it looks like ETJ was used
instead as a boundary to operate within without the intent of moving the
city into that boundary. So, I think it has been improperly used. I
think this is probably not the right venue for this to be settled, it
should be settled in ?? and in that county. But nevertheless it’s not
being, so it’s here and so, I will change my vote from yesterday and
vote in favor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other questions from the committee. Representative
Berger, you’re recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Request the ?? ?? ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair I move that we give SB65 a
favorable report. The clerk will call the roll.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Adams – No. Representative Bill – Aye.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. May I be recognized for a
motion? [SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I would move that this bill be given a sequential referral to
finance, and if I may, I would like to ask if Representative Setzer
would yield for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Setzer?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for your
indulgence, Mr. Chair. Representative Setzer, do you feel it would be
proper to have this heard in Finance? [SPEAKER CHANGES] The Finance
Committee takes up annexation, de-annexations; however if this
committee’s will is to send it to Finance, we’ll take it. We take
everything else. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m going to refer to staff and ask
Gerry Cohen if he’ll comment on this for us please. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a second. If the committee can certainly make a recommendation to
the chamber that a bill be referred to be re-referred somewhere else,
but if the rules do not require it to go to the Finance Committee, then
it will be up to the Speaker’s discretion on whether to refer it to
finance or not, but the committee certainly can recommend whatever it
wants. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So this bill does not require to go to finance?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Not in my opinion under the House rules. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Saying that, this meeting is now adjourned.</p>
