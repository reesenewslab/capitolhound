Senate will come to order. Sergeant at arms, close the doors. Members go
to their seats. Members and guests of the gallery please silence all
electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer is Tribal Elder Jerry
Wolf of the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians. Elder Wolf is a guest
of Senator Jim Davis. All members and guests in the gallery will please
stand. [SPEAKER CHANGES] [PAUSE] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good morning. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It’s good to be here.
It’s great to be here. I’m from Cherokee and I’m here to do a prayer for
your session, and our grandpas and grandmas had many ways of worshiping
our creator. Many ways, they did it by the beat of the drum, the sound
carries up and the message is in that sound that goes up into the
heavens to our father. Also, smoking the peace pipe, the smoke always
goes up. In that smoke was a message to our creator. And they also did
it by dance, by songs. So we had a lot of ways of praying to our father.
So at this time, I’d like to take a moment of silence for our protectors
here on earth, armed forces, many of our men and women are far away from
home in the service, protecting us. So I’d like to take a moment of
silence for them. Let’s bow our heads. [PAUSE] [CHEROKEE PRAYER] Our
father God, we thank you for all the blessings we receive every day.
Many times we are blessed and do not realize that we are blessed.
Father, be with our leadership for our state and country. Be with them,
to make the right decisions that might have all people. Father bless
every person that is present. As we return to our homes, may we arrive
safely. Continue to be with us for we believe in your kingdom. Until we
meet again, in your name we pray and I say [CHEROKEE SONG]</p>

[CHEROKEE SONG CONTINUES] Amen. [PAUSE] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Berger
is recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President.
The Journal of Wednesday June 18, 2014 has been examined and is found to
be correct. I move that we dispense with the reading of the journal and
that it stand approved as written. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection,
the journal for June 18th stands approved as written. Senators, we have
leaves of absence granted today for Senators Graham. ?? Senator Newton,
you are going to be here the entire time? Senators Graham and Parmon.
Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
President I move that the rolls be suspended until the end to allow our
friends from Cherokee on the floor and to put aside the headdress rule.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection, so ordered. Senator Jim Davis is
recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. President. Ladies and
gentlemen of the Senate, I’m proud to have Jerry Wolf with us today.
He’ll be 90 years old in September. He grew up in Cheryl Cove on the
Cherokee Indian Reservation in Western North Carolina. The family home
sat in the middle of what is now the Blue Ridge Parkway. Jerry had 3
sisters and was the baby. And his sisters attended boarding school away
from Cherokee. On July 21, 1943 Jerry was sworn into the United States
Navy. Boot training took place in Chicago and he specialized as a signal
man. After basic, he took the Queen Mary to Falmouth, England where he
lived on a naval base until it was time to join the action. While the
men were on their way to Scotland on the Queen Mary, an announcement
came over the loudspeaker that the Queen Mary had just been torpedoed.
Jerry said it gave everyone a strange feeling because they were on the
boat and they knew it wasn’t true. In Falmouth, the men were subject to
nightly air raids that although commonplace, could be terrifying. On
June 6, 1944 Jerry was among a group of 16 men aboard a landing craft
tank LCT-616 as they participated in the invasion of Normandy. He was
unloading soldiers on Omaha Beach. Only 1 man in his group was hit, and
they landed on the beach under a storm of gunfire. Their commander,
Captain Evans, told them before they departed on the LCT that they were
to take cover and not return fire as they approached the beach because
each man was needed to work after they landed. During his naval career
he worked as an aviation repair vessel and destroyer escort. As the only
Native American in his division, Jerry quickly gained the respect of the
other men. He was able to run faster than everybody and he adapted very
well to the strenuous work because he grew up working hard. Jerry
married Juanita Bradley on January 2, 1949, a few months before he was
permanently discharged from the Navy. Within a few years they started a
family that grew to 5 boys and 3 girls. Jerry is a mason by trade and is
one of the last Cherokee stone cutters. And his work can be found
throughout North Carolina and some outside of the state as well. He
retired from federal service in 1985 and since then he’s been working at
a Cherokee museum as a greeter. He is often asked by members of the
community to myths, legends and the nuances of stick ball. He recently
led a class of men in that art. Jerry travels around the Southeast and
often asks to represent the tribal perspective on plants and animals of
the Great Smokies. He has assisted in translating documents into
Cherokee as he writes and reads using the Cherokee syllabary. He has
spent a lot of time in local schools, sometimes teaching the
fundamentals of the Cherokee language, and sometimes telling stories of
the Cherokee people. He was named a beloved man of the Eastern Band of
Cherokee in the Spring of 2013. He was also honored in 2013 for his
military service for the civilian marksmanship council. He was awarded
the North Carolina heritage award in 2002. He provided consultation to
the Smithsonian Institute for the Our People exhibit for the national</p>

?? of the American Indian in Washington, DC. In 2008, he received an
award from the North Carolina State Legislature for his contributions to
the Eastern Band of Cherokee and the State of North Carolina as a
storyteller and stick ball caller. In October 2010, he was among a group
of men that were able to on the honor flights that they have to DC, he
was honored to attend there. And he has been one of the longest term
members of the Lions Club in Western North Carolina and he continues to
support its' activities throughout the year. Ladies and gentlemen of the
Senate, I also have a long list of other accomplishments that he has
amassed in his life here, but I am honored to represent this man. He is
an iconic Cherokee and Jerry, thank you so much. I appreciate that
prayer and you're a great American. Thank you so much, sir. [SPEAKER

high points and if you have questions you may ask. There are two parts
to this bill. Part 1 clarifies changes in the Disability Scholarships
bill that we passed last session. When it was implemented there were
some concerns that arose, some technical issues with it, and so this
bill complies or clarifies those points. The second part you've already
voted on once in the regulatory reform bill that we voted on and what
this does is it permits parents who have children in non-public schools
to have before and after school programs at their school. These have all

please. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Meredith asks that you
concur. Is there any, Senator Apodaca for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] See if Senator Meredith will yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Meredith, do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes
sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can you tell me what happened in this bill when
it went over to the house? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. There was an
amendment that was added during the insurance committee by the rules
chairman and that amendment was removed. Rather the rule chairman for
the Senate. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]?? [LAUGHTER]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I have a question for Senator Meredith. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Meredith do you yield for a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Senator Meredith. I just had a chance this
morning to look over this bill and I understand that it removes a
discount that patients currently get because of a contract with Blue
Cross Blue Shield, between them and the provider. Do we have any idea
how much that will increase costs to patients across the board, by
removing that? Do I understand the bill correctly, that that’s what it
does? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for that question, Senator Goolsby.
What this does is that in the past, non-covered services outside the
policy, it was dictating if they had a contract with that provider, that
they were having that offer non-covered services that were not in the
policy to their patients. This allows them not to have to, if they have
a contract with a current health provider, they don’t need to discuss
with their patients about services that are not covered inside the
policy. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Goolsby. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Meredith do you yield for a follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Because I’m a little bit confused. Is there going to
be, so this means that patients don’t get non-covered services that they
currently get under the arrangement with the health care provider. Now
they won’t receive those, so their cost of, and again just with all the
current problems we’ve seen with Obamacare and Medicaid and all this
other stuff, it looks like there was a break in there for patients. But
is this going to actually take away currently free services or increase
costs to patients? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, if I may defer that
question to Senator Curtis, I would appreciate that if he might be able
to answer that more specifically. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Curtis, you
have the floor to speak to that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
President. The bill will not allow insurance companies to dictate fees
for non-covered services. It could potentially cause costs to go up. I
do not know how much but</p>

<p id="35:00">
Speaker :Basically the question is fairness in terms ?? allow to dictate
these for service that they do not cover,
Speaker Changes: Senator ?? what purpose you ask,
Speaker Changes: task to ??,
Speaker Changes: senator ?? you yells,
Speaker Changes: so we currently have insurance company if i go because
I'm blue course ?? under state plan and i see a doctor there reassures
their insurance payment across blue shield and currently as a patient
you are reduced to get a service for free ,if i vote ob this bill and
pas that means that as the patient wont get the service anymore,
Speaker Changes: if this bill passes the insurance company will not
allow to dictate ??,
Speaker Changes: senator ?? what purpose you ask,
Speaker Changes: Mr.president I'm afraid what the average citizens that
are,
Speaker Changes: senator ?? are you asking a question,
Speaker Changes: To speak on the motion,
Speaker Changes: senate gentlemen address the floor ??,
Speaker Changes: Thank you Mr.President I'm afraid what the ?? we
removed the potential discount that they have been getting,and i dot
think they are gonna see beyond the fact that we may or may not relate
the insurance company the dictation of this letter or the other ,I'm
afraid that i don't like this motion and I'm gonna vote against it ,
Speaker Changes: Mr.President,
Speaker Changes: Senator ?? what purpose you ask,
Speaker Changes: To debate the motion,
Speaker Changes: Senator ?? address the floor,
Speaker Changes: This bill would just a matter that would be consistent
with other ?? provider and what happened is the insurance company went
beyond the extend of the contract all the provided they need to get the
?? and or to reduce the cost to ?? that was never covered by the
contract so on ?? the contract is been abused and all this is been ??
what ever the ?? insurance company was not authorities of demand ?? and
all we are doing is eliminating that abuse of the contract,
Speaker Changes: Senator ?? on what purpose you ask,
Speaker Changes: To speak to the motion,
Speaker Changes: Senator ?? has the floor,
Speaker Changes: Members are saying,thank you Mr.president ?? this bill
pro dominantly ??  but if you want it foe one pair if you want it for
second pair ?? or if you want sun glasses something like that the
insurance company were forcing them to give a 25 percent discount ,no
idea what the mark on that for those products ?? because if you want to
continue to have this contract you have to give a 25% discount without
ever negotiating with the providing ?? if you want to become my client
if have to do this moving forward of the provision has been discussed as
?? same in the bill that have passes in the senate previously and i
would ask for our support,
Speaker Changes: Senator ?? for what purpose you ask,
Speaker Changes: To speak to the floor,
Speaker Changes: Senator ?? has the floor,
Speaker Changes: Thank you Mr.President when the senator ?? has the mi
mid o put in and the mi mid i put in said you must be able to put in
take your prescription and the ?? to buy your sunglasses and everything
the fact that even of the insurance being paid for you to have a fold to
adapt ?? place so that was really  mi mid it don't really masses with
any of the mi mid of the statue now i have been assured by the
association that ?? that anybody that goes through them can receive
their prescription or anybody that can take it with them following into
another place to get their glasses ?? if that is true will go ahead and
both of them concord some of them will be back next year but do i was
may not but anyway we can deal with it if it is turns out ?? and get
both to concord ,
Speaker Changes: Mr president senator ?? what purpose you ask,
Speaker Changes: I would like yo ask senator Richard a question,
Speaker Changes: Senator Richard he yell,
Speaker Changes: Yes sir,
Speaker Changes: Senator Richard ?? we are not applauding to the
ophthalmologist the very same thing we did for Denis earlier ,earlier
legislation,
Speaker Changes: It is exactly assisted with that and just to respond to
again spend it up back to the optometry board the rules and the law is
that description should be transfer because the patient payed for it
,they have that script,</p>
