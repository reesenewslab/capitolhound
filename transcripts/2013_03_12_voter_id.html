<p id="000:00">
from Tuesday, March 12, 2013. The following is VoterRadio.com's coverage
of a public hearing on Voter ID, presented by North Carolina House
Elections Committee. Due to technical difficulties, we begin with a
recording already in progress.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, sir.
Speaker 14, Mr. Bradford. Welcome to the Committee, sir. You have the
floor for a time not to exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Good afternoon, thank you for the opportunity to speak. My name is
Spencer Bradford. I am Pastor of Durham Mennonite Church in Durham,
North Carolina, and Director of Durham Congregations in Action, an
association of 60 faith communities in the Durham area working together
to address problems of poverty, racism, and violence for the last 40
years.
I'm coming to speak today because of fundamental principles. Two of the
fundamental principles of our western civilization, when it comes to
good governance, have traditionally been prudence and justice. I came
today to say that this legislation for voter ID requirements strikes me
as both imprudent and unjust in its affects.
It violates the fundamental principle of prudence in a time when we are
looking at budget cuts that will impact the sick, the poor, children in
schools in our state, that we would consider increasing budgetary burden
for a small problem, as we've heard reported, increasing budgetary
burden, whether it is passed on to the counties to implement, or
implemented at the state level. In order to make it just, the budgetary
burden would be disproportionate to the potential violations of problems
being addressed. And as we've also heard, there are more effective ways
through existing offices and law enforcement to address the problem of
voter fraud.
It is a violation of the fundamental principle of justice in its affect.
Prior to directing Durham Congregations in Action, I spent 15 years
working in homeless shelters and soup kitchens in North Carolina
communities, where each year I would help dozens of people who were
homeless, who were disabled to get the ID that they needed in order to
pursue employment and benefits. I know how difficult it is to get valid
ID, and I know the burdens that would be disproportionately imposed on
the poorest, on the elderly, on the disabled, on those without
independent transportation in our communities. The apostle, Paul, wrote
that it is the weaker members among us that are indispensable. It is the
less honorable among us that deserve the greater honor. When we pursue
justice in our legislation, the question isn't what is just for those of
us who are strongest, have a greatest means, who are self-sufficient.
The problem is, what is justice for the least of us? Those on the
margins. Fundamental principles.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, sir.
Speaker number 15, Mr. Roe.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee. I'm Bill Roe with
the North Carolina Justice Center, and I appreciate this opportunity to
speak to the committee about this idea of having a photo ID in order to
vote.
The Justice Center is a statewide antipoverty advocacy group, and I've
represented and worked with low-income individuals in communities in
North Carolina for over 25 years. I know I'm going to state some of the
obvious here, and that maybe my legal training is to do that, and also
say a lot of what's already been said, but since the vast majority of
North Carolinians have a government issued ID it may be hard to
understand why some people do not have one. That ID typically means you
have a driver's license, but many seniors, low-income people, many of my
clients over the years, and people with disabilities don't drive. And
many young adults, especially those in college, don't yet have licenses.
A photo ID law will disproportionately impact voters with low incomes. A
2006 survey by the Brennan Center for Justice concluded that voting-aged
citizens earning less than $35,000 a year</p>

<p id="005:00">
Were more than twice as likely the lack of government issued ID as those
earning more than $35,000 a year. Additionally, people of color are
disproportionately affected by voter ID laws. With state, other state,
and national studies finding that African Americans are more than three
times as likely as whites to not have a government issued ID. The
fundamental right to vote should be available to all eligible voters and
not restricted due to circumstances that prevent an ID. Thousands of
North Carolinians are struggling to make ends meet. Many are unemployed
and underemployed, are ill housed and sick with no health insurance, and
see little if no attention being given by their elected representatives
to improving their lives. The time and expense of requiring a government
issued ID will not address the serious problems facing those at the
bottom of our economic ladder. In fact, it appears it will not address
any problem at all. A voter photo ID will not make elections more
secure, but will certainly limit access to thousands of North
Carolinians. The general assembly should turn its attention to more
pressing issues facing the state. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. Speaker number 16, Mr. Mullanero? You have the floor,
sir, for a time not to exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Dave Mullanero, district, mighty district 106. Representative Samuelson,
you may want to block your ears during this one. First I'd like to thank
Representatives Lewis, Blust, and Ross for responding to my earlier
email message entitled “Grandma Loves to Vote.” My message today takes a
different turn. Recently colleagues and I have researched the archives
here in North Carolina of past and recent elections. This research,
coupled with some fascinating anecdotes, raises questions about the
legitimacy of your election to the House and your right to serve and
vote on this committee. So it is that we must ask for the following
documentation in hopes that you can assure each of us that you are
legitimately elected and therefore can serve and vote on this committee.
By noon tomorrow, the following documents please. Your birth
certificate, we want to make sure you're of age. Proof of residency, we
certainly wouldn't want you living in South Carolina. Proof of your
election's validity, your campaign budget, and finally your high school
yearbook photo. I know you're thinking, we're legitimate. What do you
want? Please understand the intent of this is not to impede your right
to serve on this committee or vote on this committee. We just simply
want to make sure that there's no funny stuff going on. Once you supply
the required documentation and we are satisfied that you are indeed
legitimate and that you are who you say you are, you may resume your
membership on this committee with its sacred mission. Finally, your
meeting rules will be somewhat different. Your meetings will take place
at 3am on Saturday mornings. The total meeting time for each meeting
will be seventeen and a half minutes. You will meet only two times per
legislative session, and your meeting location may change from time to
time. Again, the intent of this is not to impede the sacred work of this
committee, nor your most precious right to vote as one of its members.
Hope to see you at noon tomorrow. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. Speaker number</p>

<p id="010:00">
17. Mrs Fry. Welcome Ma'am. You have the floor for a time not to exceed
three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. Thank you members of the committee and to all the
legislatures who are here today. I want to especially appreciate you
Representative Lewis for the open and respectful way that you've carried
yourself throughout what can be a very intense debate on this issue. I'm
speaking today, I'm a resident of Durham, but I'm also...I work for the
organization Democracy for North Carolina. I think that there's one
thing that those of us in the room on opposite sides of the issue can
agree on and that's that our election system is very important, that
integrity is very important and that voter fraud is wrong. We want to
stop voter fraud. We want to prevent voter fraud and we want prosecute
voter fraud when it happens. What we seem to disagree on is how much
voter fraud there is and the nature of voter fraud and the ways that we
ought to address it. We're at a critical point in this debate that that
really matters. Where we have to separate the facts about fraud from the
myths. And I say this for two reasons.  First, if you don't truly
understand the problem it's really difficult to craft a viable policy
solution. You could end up passing a policy such as Voter I.D. that
doesn't in fact make elections more secure at all. And cost taxpayers
potentially millions of dollars. Second, more than the average public
who may have anecdotes about fraud and opinions about fraud or opinions
about fraud, legislatures have an obligation to protect the voting
rights of all eligible voters in North Carolina, even as you seek to
remedy problems with the voting process. To my first point the vast
majority of alleged instances of election fraud actually proved to be
unintentional mistakes either made by the voters or election
administrators. Sometimes their wrong conclusions drawn based on bad
research or misreading of data that looks like fraud when it isn't. For
instance, if it looks like illegal voting, or people who are not
citizens voting, it could actually be that those people became citizens
and voted before the documents were changed to prove that they were
citizens. Voter I.D. is costly and ineffective. It's a distraction from
the real solutions. I agree that we need to be focusing on maintaining
more accurate voter rolls, better using technology to administer
elections and better training our poll workers. To my second point,
impact matters here. Much more than intention. Whether it's your
intention or not the data about voters who currently lack I.D. show that
voter I.D. disproportionately impacts voters based on race, gender and
political party affiliation. That is why it looks like, to some, a
partisan trick. Where politicians are trying to hand pick voters. And
that is why in other states laws like this have been challenged and have
been widely challenged. Voter I.D. is a law that could potentially
disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of active voters in the name of
preventing something that no-one has been able to demonstrate is an
actual problem. This information should disturb anyone who is truly
concerned about all eligible voters being able to participate in the
process. I'm an optimistic person so I'd like for us to come together
and focus on the real problems with our elections. Democracy North
Carolina is willing to do that. We'll work with any legislature or group
who is also willing to do so. Thank You.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Ma'am. Speaker #18 Mr. Cal Thacker?? Welcome Sir. You have the
floor for a time not to exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. Members of the committee. Thank you for scheduling
this gathering today. As an election judge I am the front line of this
battle. I would show you my scars, but in fact I have none.  Whatever
you decide, whatever you decide here gets implemented at my front door
on the precinct. For that very reason I think it's extremely important
you have a full appreciation for who the current voters are. I'd also
like to note that I'm a Chatham County Judge. Chatham County had the
highest percentage of votes in the state. Go Chatham County. My precinct
though is very similar to many throughout North Carolina; three to five
thousand voters. And I sit there for thirteen hours and meet many of my
neighbors and friends. And what strikes me is the high percentage of
elderly voters. Many who come there on their own. But more and more are
coming with caregivers. More and more are coming with caregivers. I
brought this hat today because I had it made for my late father, a much
decorated Army Air-core pilot in WW II. And a true member of the
greatest generation.</p>

he taught me that voting was both a privilege and a duty.  I guess I
took the lesson to heart.  Ever since I was of age, I have voted, and in
the last ten years, I have been an election judge.  Now I can tell you,
I can tell you from the data available, a little bit about my voters.
For example, here we'll call her &quot;Mrs. M&quot;. She has come for
the last thirteen times.  Thirteen times.  I don't think this woman has
a driver's license, she's been brought by friends for thirteen times.
Here is &quot;Mr. G.&quot;, he's 94.  He's 94 and he's come thirteen
times.  &quot;Mr. P&quot;, he comes and he is curbside voting.  And
&quot;Mrs. P&quot; is 94, and she hasn't left the county, and she comes
all the time, as well.  I sincerely hope this committee will seek a
solution that doesn't discourage citizens from voting.  Perhaps one
method may be to cross data from the DMV and the Board of Elections,
which is very accurate data.  And I thank you very much.  In closing,
just as my dear parents, whose words live with me in spirit, so shall
the words of the welcomes I have ever received from my many friends and
neighbors who have made being an election judge such a special time for
me.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Sir.  Speaker No. 19, Miss Price?  Welcome
to the committee, Ma'am.  You have the forum for a time not to exceed
three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Good afternoon, everybody, I'm Frankie Price, and I
have been a precinct chief judge in Orange County for sixteen years.  In
2005, I co-authored the Orange County Precinct Manual that is still used
in every precinct.  I probably know more than most about the rules and
the reality of election day operations.  By the way, previous voters did
not tell you that an online voter or a mail-in voter, their ID is
checked before they vote, so we do have voter ID for those kind of
voters in North Carolina.  I run a tight but very supportive voter
precinct.  Dedicated precinct workers arrive at 6 a.m. to open the polls
at 6:30.  They stay in that room, except for bathroom breaks, all the
way through until 7:30 when the polls close.  Counting write-ins,
breaking down the room and reporting the results, means they stay there
until 8:30.  This is a long, 14-hour, non-stop day, and chief judges
like me have to drive the votes to the board of elections, and that
makes the day even longer.  But this day is rewarding to all of us
because of the teamwork and the positive relationship we have with all
of our voters.  My experience tells me that requiring voter ID's from
all voters every time they vote-think about that-every time they vote
for all voters, is a Draconian measure that will change the
relationships between the voter and the election workers.  These
checking voter ID's will create a  hostile environment when these
dedicated people are trying to match voters with fuzzy picture on ID's,
some of which are over five years old.  This will also create great
stress and more complexity for these people and we will have fewer and
fewer of them working for us.  At this point I do believe that this
legislature will now probably be known, if it passes this law, as
wanting fewer votes, and wanting less democracy.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Ma'am. Speaker No. 20, and the Chair will
apologize if I mispronounce your last name, please correct it for the
record.  But Speaker No. 20, Mr. Hennessy?  You have the floor, Sir, for
a time not to exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  All right, first of all, I'd like to thank the Chair,
?? for this opportunity to speak against voter ID.  My name is Aiden
Hennessey, I am 18, and I particularly speak out against those who are
young between ages 18 and 25 in the state of North Carolina. Statistics

had connected world, country, and state. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir, and speaker number 24, Mr. [??]. You have the floor,
sir,  welcome to the committee for time not exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd like to thank all you for being here, all the representatives. I'm a
University of North Carolina Greensboro student. I am 20 years old and I
currently have three ID's with my photo on it in my pocket. When I go to
the library at night I am required to show you my photo ID to prove that
I am a student there, that I can be there. There is no sense in saying
that minorities and everybody else cannot get a photo ID. When I was in
high school, every year that I was there, I had a brand-new photo ID and
I do not think that it is disenfranchisement, at all, and I think that
it's bogus that we're out here arguing this issue, saying that you
cannot get a photo ID. Anytime you go to the DMV, that's a government
program. The DMV can get you an ID. We're not talking about making you
pay for this. All these people over here saying, &quot;Oh well, you're
just out here to suppress the adults, the older adults,&quot; I'm not
going to call you old, you're not old. But the point is, when you go to
get your social security check, your Medicare check, you go to the bank,
you go anywhere that's public that's funded by the federal government,
you have to provide a photo ID. I am going to my post office, going to
open my P.O. box, &quot;Can I see your photo identification?&quot; Why
do I need that, that's mine? Nobody willing to tell me? That's my
mailbox, why should I have to provide and ID for that? Wow, okay, well
the point is all the people saying that we don't need photo ID or the
people saying that it's disenfranchisement of the people, prove it. You
say that people aren't voting scandalously, we can't say it's fraudulent
because I may get sued if I say fraudulent, okay, so prove it. You're
saying 66% of the people, as I heard earlier, 66% of females do not have
the proper identification. I bet you I could go through the crowd right
here and ask each individual that's a female for their photo ID and I
bet you almost every single one of you can provide one for me. So all
the people in here saying that this is just for disenfranchisement as
minorities, this is for disenfranchisement of the women, this is not
about women's rights, this is not about trying to bring back Jim Crow
laws, you're trying to say that it's partisanship. This is not partisan
at all. I believe that most North Carolinians, as the polls have shown
lately, are for photo identification. So let's speed up this process,
make sure it's diligent, make sure it's not going to disenfranchise
people, but let's make sure this process is done right. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Speaker number 25, Ms. Friend, welcome to the committee. You
have the floor for a time not to exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much. I appreciate your allowing me to be here and I
appreciate what this committee is doing. I retired from state government
a year and a half ago and now I'm a full time volunteer so I can come
and do things like this. I believe that it is important to assure that
everyone has access to voting and that we should do all that we can to
encourage more people to be involved and to vote. One inhibitor to
voting can be long lines at the polling place, as some people don't have
time or schedule flexibility to wait to cast their ballot and will leave
in frustration. I have seen this myself in Wake County. This past year
during early voting I saw people leaving at Wake Tech, at Ebenezer
Baptist, at Lake Lynn, at Optimist Park, many of the early voting sites,
because they were frustrated because of the long lines. Therefore, I
rise to speak in favor of a new voter identification card, which I
believe will improve the process. Use of a voter photo ID will
streamline and speed up the current cumbersome, and very time consuming
check-in process, which leads to the long wait. Ask anyone who has
worked the polls, especially at early voting, when people are choosing
the convenience to vote wherever they like, not necessarily at their
home precinct, and people will likely agree with this. The bottleneck is
always the check-in point. A voter identification card could enhance the
system to improve efficiency and make it easier and thereby reduce that
bottleneck so voters get their ballots faster, the waiting will be
shorter, access will improved and in addition, there will be increased
security for the voting process. I'm in favor. Thank you very much,
appreciate your time.

<p id="035:00">
You are speaker number 26. Mr. Oakes, welcome. You have the floor for a
time not to exceed three minutes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
Chairman. Committee members have my detailed analysis in the screen
shoot, I’m sure you’ve seen it. If you don’t look for voter fraud, you
won’t find it. In the 2011 City Election, I found 44 voters who had
asked for absentee ballots in very similar handwriting and whose
witnesses on the ballot envelopes were made by the same local activist
or his wife. Those are pretty suspicious. But the local board voted that
that was not worth investigating because that would not affect the
election. So if you don’t look for voter fraud, you won’t find any.
Ever. Next issue is on the SPOE No Drivers License Report, which I
downloaded in detail. I got a listing of all 620,000 voters and went
through it somewhat. I found that 150,000 voters should have been taken
off the rolls because they had codes that indicated that the mail did
not get to them. The mail was not forwardable or was not returned. Those
people should not have been counted in that 600,000 voter list. Another
46,000 voters were fairly obviously out of state students. Not that they
shouldn’t be voting, but you wouldn’t have found them in the local
drivers license files but in the Virginia or North Carolina drivers
license files. So that takes us down to 400,000 voters, potentially. In
a quick poll, I looked at some people I knew who were in that file in
the local county. All twelve of my friends who were there. I called them
all up and asked. They all had photo IDs. They didn’t understand why
they were on the list. In another instance of the files being bad, I
went through the file and tried to do an age profile and you found the
usual age distribution where you get all the way up to age 111, where
there’s 24 voters. Strangely enough, at 113, there were 14,600 voters on
the no drivers license file. 80% of those were in three counties. I
don’t know what’s going on there but there’s something strange, hinky.
In the regular voter files, there’s 12,000 voters in that similar
constraint. A way to solve the problem, however bit it is, whether it’s
600,000 or 100,000 is to mobilize the election forces. We have 1,000
full time election workers and we can call upon the reserves. That’s
election workers of about 20,000 people. In worst case, that would mean
every election worker would have to go to somebody’s house, to 30
people’s houses to get their photo IDs. That’s not impossible to do in a
year. It’s easy in fact to do in a month, probably. And finally, imagine
how short the lines would be at check-in, if you could walk up to the
voting booth, scan this card and get a ballot popped out in your hand.
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. Speaker number 27, Miss
Callie. Welcome to the community. Ma’am, you have the floor for a time
not to exceed three minutes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. I am
Sammie Callie, a proud Salem College woman, and an executive member of
the College Democrats of North Carolina. But most importantly I come to
you as a North Carolina voter. Voting should be easy, information
available, and the polls reachable. Voting is not a privilege. It is a
right. With low voter turnout, long lines and already too many rules,
the state of North Carolina should be actively working to make this
process the most successful it can be, rather than confusing it. As
someone who actively works with registration and turnout, I can say that
too many students don’t know how to successfully register and vote. The
truth is, changing rules will stop people from voting. Currently voters
are able to register at the location that they spend the majority of
their time, with intent to return when leaving. This allows for students
to vote on or near their campuses, and helps eliminate the barriers or
having to return to a parent’s address or an alternative location. Young
people are also less likely to not have a license or other form of photo
identification, and have less access to transportation. Since students
live at these locations for four or more years, it’s important that they
are involved in their communities. We want students to find their home
in North Carolina. Stopping them from voting here is doing the opposite.
Students have coursework, sports and leadership. Limiting the number of
days of early voting will affect students from exercising our rights. We
also ask that student identifications be accepted as a form of ID, as
for many of us, that’s the only way we’d be able to vote here. ?? is
already making it hard to vote on campuses</p>

<p id="040:00">
To even cut across through our dorms. Obtaining photo ID can be costly
and burdensome. For voter identification to be not considered a
financial barrier to the ballot box, a modern tax ?? essentially, the
state would have to provide free photo identification. NC voters must
also consider the 40 counties that are covered in section 5 of the
voting rights act, which protects people in the area with a history of
racial discrimination. This would require 40% of our counties to clear
their voting changes with either the Justice Department or a panel of
federal judges in Washington, DC. As a student, as a voter, I ask that
the best interests of all North Carolinians be considered. I demand that
all citizens, despite lack of resources, be able to vote. Free and
easily. Instead of directing efforts to make this less accessible, let’s
make it better. Supporters of changing voting laws are speaking about
potential harms, potential fraud. I’m speaking about real suppression.
Thank you so much for your time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, ma’am.
Speaker number 28 is Mr. Elkins. Sir, you have the floor for a time not
to exceed three minutes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank
you members of the committee. Most of us think that the struggle for the
19th Amendment began in Seneca Falls in 1848. But Kelly Foster, in 1852,
got up before a convention and said for 14 years, sisters, the way to
this spot where we are is paved with my bloody feet, because I have been
working for the right for women to vote for those 14 years. And so I’m
proud of our country that finally in 1920 we did pass the 19th
Amendment. But I’m also proud as a North Carolinian, of our state. In
1964, I volunteered to help transport people to register to vote. Out of
the more than 20 people whom I took to the registrar that day, not a
single one was able to register because they were asked to read and
interpret the Constitution. But their color was black. We have come
forward, fellow citizens. We have a state we can be proud of. But the
voter ID would be a step backward. Nd I say that as a resident of a
senior community, Carroll Woods Retirement Center in Chapel Hill, where
a large percentage of our residents in their 80s, some in their 90s, and
a few in their hundreds, no longer drive. And I’m glad they don’t drive.
[LAUGHTER]  But for them, they’re mobile, but bright as they are,
informed, getting a voter ID would be a real problem. As it would be, I
am convinced, for many thousands of people throughout our state. Our
problem with one potential fraud, in our whole state, this is a problem
we don’t need to fix. Let’s not go backward. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
sir. Speaker number 29, Miss Chivetta. Welcome, ma’am. You have the
floor for a time not to exceed three minutes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you for the opportunity to address this public hearing. I am Janet
Chivetta. I am registered as an independent voter and am a published
author. This is an issue that has captured my attention and for that
reason I have devoted many hours of research on the subject of voter ID.
I have heard the claims from opponents of this bill, that it will
restrict the disadvantaged and poor of our state from voting because of
the difficulty they would have in securing a photo ID. These claims led
me to investigate the facts regarding that assertion.</p>

<p id="045:00">
In the four states where photo id requirement was in effect during this
past election, Georgia, Indiana, Tennessee and Kansas, there has not
been any evidence of a negative impact on voter turnout including
minority voters. In fact, to the contrary, the Atlanta Journal
Constitution newspaper reported that turnout among black and hispanic
voters in Georgia actually increased after the law went into effect.
Most would agree that the poorest in our society are those who receive
public assistance in the form of welfare payments or housing subsidies.
It is impossible to cash a welfare check or open up a bank account
without a photo id. The Raleigh housing authority requires that adults
who receive any form of housing subsidy must present a government-issued
photo id before they qualify for this assistance. The spokesperson for
the housing authority said that they want full confidence that the
housing subsidies are going to the right person. One of the first
priorities for the staff at the men's Wake County homeless shelter is to
assist the residents in securing a photo id if they do not already have
one. The director of the shelter told me that they help them get ids
because they need it to function in society. For example, to open up a
bank account, to get a job, to receive government assistance. In
conclusion, the voter id mandate should not deter the poor and
minorities from voting since the vast majority already have a photo id.
Those who do not would be assisted in getting one. In fact, the mandate
would actually bring about a side benefit to our citizens. With greater
efforts made to encourage and assist all to get photo ids, the greater
number of citizens would have a better chance to achieve upward mobility
and to thrive in our society.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you ma'am. Speaker number 30, Miss Cotton.
Welcome to the committee. You have the floor for a time not to exceed 3
minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good afternoon. Thank you Mr. Chairman and committee
for allowing this hearing to take place. I'm here today to represent
myself and the 6 million people that are registered to vote here in
North Carolina. I also served 16 years on the county board of elections.
We talk about oh, there's no fraud out there. There's no fraud. Well let
me tell you, there's no fraud being reported and prosecuted because it's
not being looked for. OK? I know it, I was there. There's lots of it
going on and I think voter id is one way that we can help to improve
that situation. I have with me today my casebook - got my photo on it.
Got my driving license - photo on it. I have my credit card - photo on
it. I have my bank id card - photo on it. Did it cost $20 $30 $40
dollars for me to get these ids on these cards? No. And I think we here
in North Carolina can implement this process at a very reasonable
amount. Make it affordable. And get the people where they need to to get
voter id. There are 92 motor vehicle license offices in the state of
North Carolina that have a photo machine in it. There are 8 that do not.
We can send a mobile unit into those 8 counties and get those people
registered with a voter id. It's not impossible, it's not going to break
the bank, and it's time we got on with getting voter id here in North
Carolina. Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you ma'am. Speaker number 31, Mr. Wilson.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] My name's Art Wilson. I'm 76 years old. And according
to what I'm hearing from many of the prior speakers they would just be
in amazement I've managed to find my doddering way up here to the mic.
It's often and loudly said by some there is no voter fraud. And yet to
clarify qualification of a voter is an attack individual's right to
vote. ?? word is disenfranchised. We would have no honest citizen being
disenfranchised in these votes. However,</p>

?? legislation now allows an illegal vote to be cast and cancel out an
honest one so you are disenfranchised whether you like it or not. The
same naysayers claim if there is fraud, a small amount is insignificant.
What’s a small amount. Municipal elections in 2011 had over 35 locations
that were decided by less than ten votes. Marsville seat for the city
council was decided by 3 votes and yes, there was voter fraud in
Marsville. I’ve been on the Board of Elections, and yes there were. Only
one voter fraud act is too many. We the people consent to be governed by
our vote. This is our one personal tool which we have control over
government not government control over us. It must be a strong tool,
kept sharp and kept clean. Oppose House Bill 253 and Senate Bill 235 are
totally inadequate in accomplishing those goals. It’s a waste of time
for them. In our legal system, why do we demand written contracts?
Because its over 4000 when Jacob cheated Esau out of his heritage by
fake ID to their father Isaac. We learned that people will lie, steal,
or whatever necessary to achieve their ends. Power, wealth, as well as
our personal future is at stake in our elections. Why are we such fools
that we would give anyone a voice in our future and control like just on
his word.  A photo’s required, but a minimal of social sciences on the
plain there. If disenfranchising the poor is invalid, therefore. The
energy that gets the physically disable to the polls can now can help
those without photo ID obtain one. The latest bipartisan polls last
February show that 67% of active voters want to have photo ID to protect
their vote. Continued manipulation of the vote is the only logical
reason to not have photo ID. I believe we owe our vote to those who died
for our right to keep it. And an obligation to future generation to
protect it. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman and to the committee, thank you for this
opportunity to speak. My name is Linda Sutton. I have previously served
on the North Carolina Election Law Review Committee. We worked very hard
to improve and strengthen our election laws, not put in barriers. I
previously have worked through many organizations here in this state. A
lot of them partisan organizations working to get the vote out, get
people registered to vote and get the vote out. As a member of the
Forsyth County Board of Election for six years, we always have mostly
losing candidates who come in to yell voter fraud. I can tell you, in my
county, we’ve had the County Board of Election, the State Board of
Elections, the State Bureau of Investigation, the District Attorney’s
office and you name it. Voters alike. Candidates who are disgruntled.
Average citizens and don’t even talk about the news media, all digging
and looking and researching. But, there was not all this voter fraud
that people are talking about. Proponents of this bill says because of
fraud. Okay, how many people do you know that are actually going to show
up and vote using somebody else’s name.  Come on. Impersonating someone
else? That just doesn’t...</p>

?? How many illegal or non-citizens do you think really want to show up
and chance being deported or getting federal time? They don't do that.
You know they don't do that. Our current laws in this state work, and
they are sufficient. And they have worked throughout North Carolina's
voting history. It has been admitted by many here and across the country
that these photo ID bills and other voter suppression tactics, like
forging registrations and tearing up registrations of certain voters,
were all planned and orchestrated to reduce the voter turnout of certain
voters. And this is a fact, ladies and gentlemen. So I ask you today,
requiring a photo means you're trying to stop some impersonation because
you want to verify that person by their picture. But is the real
problem? So how can you, with a good and clear conscience, pass a photo
bill aimed at impersonation without any real evidence of such? In my
daily work I travel all across North Carolina. I've talked to students,
the homeless, veterans, senior, minorities, handicapped. And I've heard
so many stories. Stories from people who voted all their lives but now
may not be able to because of needing this extra piece of information in
order just to vote. I've spoken with people all across this state who
possess a driver's license and are in agreement with our stand that a
photo ID is not needed. So I ask you, do you believe your own election
or reelection was because of voter fraud? If it was such fraud, why have
you not recalled the election? I say this because you feel that our
current system works, our current election law works. It works, because
you were elected. And you are a testament. And you were elected without
a photo ID. Thank you ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, ma'am. Speaker
Number 34, Ms. Dunn. Welcome, ma'am. You have the floor for a time not
to exceed three minutes. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Chairman Lewis,
members of the Committee. I appreciate this opportunity to address you
today. My name is Corey Dunn. I'm the Director of Public Policy for
Disability Rights, North Carolina. We are the state's protection and
advocacy organization advocating for the legal rights of North
Carolinians with disability, and we oppose the implantation of any ID
requirement to vote. That said, we know there are many in this body who
feel strongly about this requirement, and so I wanna offer our guidance
on this issue. Voting is, as many have said today, the most fundamental
way in which we engage with our government. As such, we should aspire to
broad participation and work to facilitate participation in voting,
particularly for those who are often marginalized in our society. Many
people with disabilities in North Carolina lack photo identification.
Requirements to produce photo ID to vote would likely depress
participation among voters with disability, who already vote at 10 to
15% lower rates than the general populations. People with disabilities
already face barriers in voting, and we should be working to eliminate
those barriers, not create more. In particular, I urge you to reject any
proposal that would require voters to go through the DMV. Moreover, if
you do choose to adopt a photo ID requirement, it should be phased in
over several years. Allow voters to sign an affidavit attesting to their
identity to have their ballot counted. And there should be aggressive
outreach to those voters who so attest, to connect them with the
resources to meet the new requirement. There must be ongoing mechanisms
in place to assure that any voter who appears at the polls can cast a
ballot without undue hardship. Disability Rights is here as a resource
to you as you move forward. And whatever path you take, it must protect
the right to vote for all of our state citizens, including North
Carolinians with disability. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, ma'am. Speaker
Number 35, Mr. Tim. Sir, welcome to the Committee. You have the floor
for a time not to exceed three minutes. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you. I'm
E. A. Tim, and I am for government-issued photo ID. If we are to be a
state under the rule of law, compliance to the law has to be verifiable.
If we never had a means to verify one is speeding, one could easily say
no one speeds. With identity theft so rampant, voter fraud is
accomplished easily. I have seen on TV young men bragging they voted
more than once just to see if they could get away with it. I have heard
of others voting more than once just because they want their candidate
to win. The lawful voter is the one that is harmed by voter fraud and is
disenfranchised, as well as the candidates running for office that are
the victims of injustice. Subversive groups for socialism, like the
Communist Party U.S.A, do not want</p>

Want verifiable photo voter ID since they believe in the end justifies
the means. Recently I had to show a photo ID just to pick up a friend's
sick son at school and to enter a federal building just to use the
bathroom and to cash checks. I can remember a TV story of a blonde woman
in San Diego about, complaining about her credit card bills running high
even though she had a photo ID credit card. The authorities traced the
charges to a, the state of Washington where an illegal had his photo
made onto her credit card. That is why the government issued photo voter
ID has to be verifiable to its lawfulness, so that the illegal, the
subversive, the socialist, and the dead do not vote. Implementation
should be through the board of elections, with the aid of the police
verifying the registered voter with only one permanent residence per one
family, since people forget to take their names off the voter
registration rolls when moving, and for a family member when they die.
Voter fraud should be a felony that can be proven easily. Voter fraud is
a gross injustice to a supposedly free civilized society. It is akin to
letting the organized criminals run the country.

for time not to exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you chair and good afternoon all. My name is Robin Bradford. I'm a
resident of Mecklenburg county, precinct chair of precinct 134, and a
concerned taxpayer. I stand here on the shoulders of so many black and
white people who worked and stood together to make sure all had the
right and equal access to cast their vote. I ask, what is the true
motivation of some members of the general assembly? The point of voter
fraud has been stated as the issue, but the fraud is this bill. We have,
we have the lowest number of voter fraud, and I believe this is another
ploy to disenfranchise and create a larger gap of the haves and the have
nots. If you're concerned about voter fraud, take a look at the absentee
voting ballot. How is that process? Would you need to send in your ID to
get your vote cast through the voter, the absentee voting process? Do we
have a plan for that? I haven't heard one mention. If we have excess of
state dollars, then we need to invest our dollars in education and not
this program. We need to be able to educate our children to move forward
and be a part of this process and move our state forward. Voting right
is not a racial entitlement, but a right for all legal citizens. The
state cannot continue to tell voters they don't matter. The vote that
you are about to suppress are some of the same votes that you received
to be elected. Think fully about the crime you are about to commit.
Through the fundamental rights of voting is a true democracy. We have
the option to choose our leaders, however, only slaves do not choose
their masters. Think about the crimes you are about to commit. Thank
you.

Thank you mister chair and members of the general assembly. I am happy
to be with you today, not happy with the purpose. I think there will be
a time when each of us will submit DNA or some other proof of who we
are, and there may be some surveillance that will confirm where we live,
where we put our heads down at night. I don't look forward to that day.
We have a radical, and I brought my drivers license with me, and I
recently updated my passport. You would be hard-pressed to put this
picture together with the picture that I use to travel internationally.
Many people would say the same thing. This is five years old. My
passport looks terrible. We have a radical alternative to voter ID by
picture, which is your signature. It is very powerful</p>

about power than anything else. It’s about the retention of power and
denying people the right to vote. When we do this in this country, we
have people that become disenfranchised. This is not what you guys

the constitution of North Carolina. To make sure everyone had equal
protection under that constitution. That is all we are here today asking
you to do. Do what you said that you would do when you ran for election.
This is not about power. It is not about you maintaining power. If you
do the right thing by the people of North Carolina, you will get elected
over and over again. If you do the wrong thing by the people of North
Carolina, that same ballot box that you’re trying to impede right now
will be your undoing. It’s strictly up to you. Honor the system that we
have in place, there’s absolutely no need for a voter ID bill. Thank you
for your time.

Thank you sir. The chair has been informed that speaker number forty two
is not here. Speaker number forty three, Mr. Burns. You’re welcome sir.
You have the floor for the time not to exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you members of the committee. I’m Dennis Burns from the North
Carolina Coalition of Verified Voters. We’re a non-partisan group and I
want to remind people we were formed after malfunctioning voting
machines nearly caused our state a re-vote in 2004. The most striking
blunder being, Carterwright County where 4400 votes were lost by a
computer machine almost forcing us to re-vote. We, and other citizens
fought for House Bill 238 to improve voter integrity. We’re continuing
to fight for it and we’re concerned about the quality that it gets
maintained. Published reports, including from that radical group the
Bush Election Commission. End poll observations have shown that there
are still quality issues in terms of integrity, but voter impersonation
is not one of them. This is a government solution to things that are not
a problem. Two to three cases in 4.5 million votes? Plus, this so called
fix will impede voting integrity in a couple of ways, including the fact
that disenfranchise…</p>

A huge number of voters, whether you argue 400,000 or 500,000. If you
must proceed, we recommend three things in any bill. Number one, an
alternative ID to a photo ID. Most of us carry a new voting card. I
don't think my neighbor's gonna steal it from my mailbox. And that
should be sufficient, particularly when you sign as a witness under
felony threat in front of an election judge. Secondly, let's provide
more funding to the Board of Elections, the Board of Elections that were
cut in 2011. Let's go back to those problems in the past when you were
short of election funds. Why spend $5, $10, $15 million in a tight year
that could be done for better. And more poll watchers and more election
machine verification and testing. Third, and lastly, let's extend early
voting hours. It stands to reason, whatever you do, the lines will get
longer, and that will impede voting. Most North Carolinians who work,
and we all hope everybody can work, don't work in the precinct that they
live. So please, extend the voting hours. Those three simple additions
will not hurt voter integrity, which is our key goal, where a photo ID
will. Thank you very much for your time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
sir. Before we invite our next guest up, the Chair would like to invite
those listening in Room 544. Many of our House and Senate members have
adjusted themselves in the chairs and have freed up about 18 more. So we
would invite you to join us in 643, if you are so inclined. At this
time, we'll move to Speaker Number 44. Ms. Johnson, welcome ma'am. You
have the floor, and you have the floor for a time not to exceed three
minutes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good afternoon. My name is Linda Diane
Johnson. I'm from Charlotte, North Carolina. I am here on behalf of the
seniors in North Carolina. Some were born with midwives and do not have
birth certificates. In order to get a North Carolina ID, you need a
birth certificate. This is just a waste of time and money for everybody
to get an ID to vote. This is just a poll tax, something more for
seniors to worry about. We have enough problems trying to keep up with
every time we get a Social Security raise of $20, that you figure out a
formula to take away $10. Thank you for your time. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, ma'am. The Chair has been advised that Speaker Number 45 is
not here. Therefore, Speaker Number 46, Ms. Farrell.  Welcome, ma'am.
You have the floor for a time not to exceed three minutes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES]Okay. Thank you Mr. Chairman and House Committee on Elections.
My name is Jennifer Farrell. I'm a Wade County voter constituent, no one
really special, stay-at-home mom of twins. I do have a pretty awesome
Facebook page called Forward Americans. In my opinion, the requirement
of showing ID upon voting as a registered voter is not relevant or good
policy. I'm not the only one, as is telling from here today. Everyone
that's come out to speak out against voter ID, the two rooms that
overflow, people listening to this. There's also an active petition
circulating the state titled We Oppose a Voter ID Law that
Disenfranchises Voters. It's close to 10,000 signatures. That speaks
volumes. And the secret is out, also, it's gonna be tough for a lot of
you to hear. The secret is out that North Caroline Congressional
legislative districts were redrawn to Republicans' advantage. Wade
County's Congresswoman Renee Ellmers ranked second on The Hill's list of
top ten House members who were helped by redistricting. Make no mistake
that voter ID law is just another way for our Republican controlled
legislature to continue to try to ?? in the future. I think I've shared
with this Committee, I think there's a 24 to 13 ratio, I think a 24
Republican to 13 Democrat ratio on the Committee, which is also a little
disappointing. Out of the 4.3 million</p>

Cast the NC State Board of Election referred 310 cases of fraud for
prosecution from the 2008 election. There just seems to be some, this
imaginary concern by republicans who want to keep legally registered
voters from casting their ballots. Many of us perceive, believe and fear
that the GOP want to keep legally registered voters from casting their
ballots. The solutions being talked about, about providing photo IDs at
the state's expense because you can't require people to spend their own
money to exercise their right to vote, is ridiculous. The last time I
heard our state is very poorly ranked in public education and the other
option of being discussed of alternative forms of ID, where do you draw
the line? What's acceptable. All this back and forth. I think it should
just be a dropped issue. The state GOP's goal seems to be to get this
legislation passed through both state houses and to the governor's desk
prior to the Supreme Court's decision on the voting right act in June,
but they can't do anything about it until they make a decision in June
so they're still dependent on that Supreme Court decision in order to
even change any of this stuff. If republicans really want to reengage
their real constituency in the state and nationally they're going to
have to change the way they're approaching policy. I love how everyone's
just looking at their computers and kind of reading and not listening to
a lot of what other people have to say when they don't want to hear what
other people want to say. We are gaining national recognition across
multiple forms of media as a state enacting or trying to enact new
oppressive or supressive legislation against its residents and very
quickly. Please take a step back and really take into consideration what
we're hearing from voters on this issue and all issues in this session
as well as using facts and common sense and reasoning in your judgement.
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you ma'am. Speaker number 47, Mr.
Raider, welcome sir. You have the floor for time not to exceed 3
minutes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the
committee. I'm Steven Raider of Bedford County. Any new procedure often
brings about speculation and we've heard a lot of that today, but I urge
the committee to look at fact rather than hype and hysteria. And the
facts are available because many places in the world and some in the
United States already require photo IDs and have for years, so the facts
are available. You don't need to listen to hype and hysteria. We've
heard today one speaker had experience in New Hampshire. Another
testified about research in some of the other states that do have voter
ID requirements. I want to speak to one example I'm very familiar with
and that is Moldova, which is North Carolina's sister state and has been
for the last two decades roughly. Moldova has always had a photo ID
requirement since it regained its independence and they go as far as
requiring a stamp placed by the polling officials on the ID of the voter
that way if somebody's on a voting list at two polling stations they
can't present the same ID again. Now over the last 5 years that I have
worked with democracy and governance programs in Moldova I've been
certified by the central election commission in Moldova as an
international election observer that covered 7 elections, the local
elections of 2007 and 2011, the parliamentary elections of 2009 and
2010, the constitutional referendum of 2010 and the elections in the ??
region for the people's assembly in 2008 and for ?? in 2010. I've
observed elections and polling stations that covered the waterfront in
both of the major cities, Kishnel and ??. In rural areas in all regions
of the country in both towns and villages. In polling stations that not
only represent the majority Romanian population but all of the ethnic
minorities that comprise over 1%. I've observed in many poor areas and
from my observation the voter ID requirement has not impaired the right
to vote of anyone, in fact the poor, the minorities turn out as strongly
as the majority and the people with higher incomes. I would also point
out that there are two organizations that have done extensive election
observation and prepared written reports in English over many years. The
office of democratic institutions in human rights of the organization
for security and cooperation in Europe which has an international
election observation mission and the local civil society organization,

…their elections and that group has a representative in every polling

problems with voter ID requirement in Moldova; they do not reflect any
impairment of the right to vote of Moldovan citizens. So if you look at
the facts the system works and does not impair votes. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Sir. Ladies and gentlemen of the community, Speaker #48 has
asked that he be joined by two colleagues but that they will present
within the three minute time and the chair has agreed to that. The chair
would ask Mr. Weeks to please introduce those that are going to present
with him as well, but with that you have the floor sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good afternoon, I will be sharing my time with my colleagues Johnna
Mitchell and Malcolm Richbourg.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good afternoon, I am a student at Saint Augustine’s University and I am
Malcom Richbourg. I feel that the voter ID bill is not fair. This bill
will suppress the vote of minorities and college students as well. North
Carolina has voted for more than 200 years and we have not had any
problems with voting. We shouldn’t change anything that isn’t broken
within North Carolina. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hello everyone, I’m Johnna Mitchell, Student Welfare Chairperson at
Saint Augustine’s University also a sophomore. I have voted in many
elections, local, state, and two Presidential elections and there was
nothing wrong with the way that the polls was ran and I personally
believe that, I come from Nash county and Nash country doesn’t play
games so I think that saying that there’s a problem or that we even have
issues is just a joke to me because since I was a child my Mom has taken
me down to the polls and I’ve seen that everything works smoothly and
for 237 years it’s been working fine. I don’t see the problem, like
Malcolm said; you can’t fix a problem if there’s no problem in the
beginning. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, good afternoon, my name is Nathan Weeks. I’m a double major
currently studying political science and international relations at Shaw
University here in the great state of North Carolina. I’m a student
leader and currently serve on the SGA of my University as well as many
other student organizations and sports teams. So, I know firsthand on
engaging the student body and current political issues and affairs. I
led the initiative personally on my campus to get everyone registered to
vote going with the slogan 100% with help from common cause. The current
system in place already has a process in which you validate that who you
are is who you say you are and there is nothing wrong with this system.
We fill out documentation and in return we’re given voter registration
cards. The proposed legislation warrants that you have to show a state
issued photo ID in order to vote. Voting is a constitutional right.
There are more alleged alien sightings than people accused of voter
fraud.  I am an out of state student from Maryland and how does this
proposed legislation disenfranchise me? I shouldn’t have to go back to
Maryland to vote; out of the 12 months in the year I spend no more than
a month back in Maryland and North Carolina has become my home. Will my
college ID suffice or will there have to be valid student ID from a
state institution? There are 60 universities in the North Carolina
system, 51 private colleges and universities on top of these, the
average out of state North Carolina student debt after college is
$57,300 and the average income of bachelor’s degree for a graduate is
$47,000 a year. 46% of all North Carolina students are out of state
students and out of the 46%, 32% end up living in North Carolina
post-graduation. We are not only students but economic entities. We
invest our lives and money into the state and we should be able to
exercise our rights as active citizens seeking to better ourselves. In
classrooms we are taught our rights and we are taught how to exercise
our rights and finally we are taught how to fight for our rights, that’s
why I’m here today. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. Speaker #49 before you come up ma’am the chair would
like to announce that it was our intent at the end of each group if
someone was skipped or was not in the room that we would give them the
opportunity to speak and the members and guests may wonder why the chair
continues to call out their number we do have a court reporter here and
it’s his job to track the names of the folks that are offering
presentation so after we hear from speaker 49 and speaker 50 we will go
back to speaker 42 just to be clear.</p>

<p id="085:00">
With that speaker forty, nine, Ms. Gressel.  Welcome ma'am.  You have
the floor for a time not to exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and Gentleman, I'm a senior citizen of
Rockingham County, and a member of the Legal Women Voter's.  One of the
greatest achievements of American Democracy has been the introduction of
mass public education from children to advanced research universities.
The impact of state funding cuts to arrange of critical... I'm sorry...
critical educational investments is evident across North Carolina.  We
rank 7th worst in the country in the depths of cuts in school funding
since the start of this recession.  These cuts put the state's economy
and long term prosperity in jeopardy, and undermine our potential for
effective educational reform.  Good schools and an educated work force
foster economic growth, and we are shooting ourselves in the foot by
reducing our investment in education.  North Carolina is going backwards
on education, and has now moved to 49th in the nation in how we fund
public schools.  This being the case, how can you justify passing a law
in favor of making photo I.D. a requirement in order to vote?  According
to a study from New York Universities Brennan Center for Justice, 11% of
voting age citizens lack necessary photo I.D.  You may not think that
sounds like much, but it represents    twenty-one million citizens, and
there is no doubt that, in a close election, they could make a
difference in the outcome.  Attorney General, Eric Holder, has compared
this law to a poll tax, given that sometimes costly steps needed to
obtain the needed documents.  Today legal scholars argue that photo I.D.
laws create a new financial barrier to the ballet box.  There have been
precious few instances in which voter fraud cases has resulted in
conviction.  The New York Times reports that there were only one hundred
twenty cases filed by the Justice Department over five years, many of
which came from mistakenly filled out registration forms.  Only
eighty-six of these one hundred twenty, country wide, resulted in
conviction.  According to Rick Casson, University of North Carolina
Irvine, Election Law Specialist, there are very few documented cases.
When you do see election fraud, it invairably involves election
officials trying to change election results, or else absentee ballets,
which photo I.D. can't prevent.  Based on the experience of states,
which have already enacted photo I.D. laws, the cost of implementation
runs into millions of dollars per year, and dramatically increases the
cost of administering elections.  Even if the state decides to incur
these costs, it's I.D. requirements will be vulnerable to  successful
Constitutional challenge, causing further expense.  North Carolina is
2.5 billion dollars in the hole already, and since education takes up
over half of the state budget, education will sustain the largest share
of any further cuts.  In this difficult budgetary time, I ask you,
ladies and gentleman, how you could possibly justify spending millions
of dollars for years to come on this new and controversial election
procedure that has not been shown to improve  election security?  Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you ma'am.  Speaker number fifty, Mr. Fairanola.
 Welcome sir.  Please introduce yourself, and you have the floor for
time not to exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.  My name's Joe Fairanola.  I live in Durham
County. I want to thank you for the opportunity to be heard. This
opposed voter I.D. law is not justified by any serious or wide spread
problem.  Since the current system has not been shown to be broken, why
do we demand such an elaborate fix that would create often burdensome
difficulties to so many law-abiding, tax paying citizens?  Restrictive
voter I.D. policies threaten to unfairly exclude hundreds of thousands
of our state's eligible tax paying voters. These I.D. requirements fall
hardest upon people who have traditionally faced barriers at the polls,
the elderly, students, people with disabilities, the poor, unemployed,
and people of color. I urge you not to pass this law. However, if you
insist on instituting this burdensome law, the state must make a major
effort to put abide voter I.D. to North Carolina eligible voters who
need such proof.  The state should permit a wide range of proof, as well
as extensive training for poll workers who will be charged with
enforcing the law.</p>

law. In addition, the law should not be implemented and enforced until
all eligible voters have had multiple opportunities to obtain the
required ID. This must include providing convenient times and locations
such as local post offices, schools, libraries, and even a mobile voter
registration van, vans. Voter registration sites must have proper photo
equipment and train specialists who can provide the required ID
on-the-spot or within 20 days of application. This should be at no cost
to the person receiving the ID but they will still have to pay the
hidden cost of getting ID proof, such as birth certificates. These
documents can be hard to obtain and cost money. It also costs money and
time to get the DMV, Social Security Administration, or Counties Records
Department to obtain these documents. For low-income voters these
barriers are significant and unfair. In addition, such a law would cost
the state millions of dollars. If local election boards are tasked with
providing the free ID's, the cost of making those falls on county
budgets which are already strapped in this economic climate. Is voter ID
really worth increasing the property taxes or diverting money from
education or other needed public programs? It has been said that
democracy is not as efficient as a dictatorship but it is effective in
granting rights to the citizens, such as the right to have a voice in
how they are governed. Please don't force this law through. It is not
necessary. It is not fair. It is not democratic. No eligible voter
should be turned away from the poll because he or she doesn't have a
photo ID. Thank you for your attention.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. We'll now move to speaker number 42, Mr. Kevin Rogers.
Welcome sir, you have the floor for a time not to exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, for the
opportunity to speak today. My name is Kevin Rogers, I am the Policy and
Public Affairs Director for Action NC, a statewide policy and advocacy
organization working in the low to moderate income communities
throughout the state. It is on behalf of our members that I am here
before you today. In preparing my remarks I was looking over my notes
from the previous legislative hearings on the same topic. As best I can
recall, this will be the fourth time now that I've given comment on the
topic of voter ID. Many of my colleagues, who you've heard from before,
have given even more comment. I have used moral arguments against voter
ID. I have used legal arguments against voter ID. I have used pragmatic
arguments against voter ID. Today, I am not here to argue. While we have
been, and continue to be, firmly against any form of voter ID we
understand the reality in which we are working. I want to thank Speaker
Tillis and members of the leadership for committing to hear concerns
before the bill was drafted rather than after. We are hoping to have
some effect to that end. Our major concern with any form of voter ID is
the additional burdens,  financial and otherwise, placed on the poor and
the elderly and the impediments to voting that those burdens create. In
the past, the solutions floated by this General Assembly was a free ID,
issued by the state, for the express purpose of voting, so as to meet
the constitutional burdens of the state. I want you to understand why
that is an inadequate solution. Assuming that proof of identity would be
required for this ID, where does that individual find the documents? Our
elderly citizens, who were born at the dawn of the 20th Century, many in
rural areas at the time when birth certificates and county clerks were
not as accessible as they are today? And while many younger folks who
have easier access to these documents, many states charge money,
sometimes up to $20-$30 for these documents. It's true that North
Carolina will issue these documents for free but we have no control over
the cost to residents born years ago in other states. What happens to
these individuals who are unable to obtain these documents under normal
circumstances? We have documented cases, which we'd be happy to share
with the committee, of folks being forced to hire attorneys to prove
their identity before they can vote, a great personal expense. And how
many people face the same problem and simply gave up for want or time of
money to continue? I urge this committee to take these circumstances
under consideration as you craft the bills. Our members would be happy
to come and speak with you to tell you their concerns about how these
laws would make voting more difficult for them and their families. We
understand that you have concerns about the election process, we simply
ask for you to be respectful of ours. Thank you.

respectfully. Who worked as tenant farmers, sharecroppers, everyday to
make ends meet. As a daughter of a single teen mom, among the many
responsibilities they had was of raising to me to love God, family and
my community. Neighborly advise such as, &quot;Do onto others as you'd
have them do onto you,&quot; were powerful principles that have served
me well all of my life. I can remember a lot of my childhood in
Northeastern North Carolina before my mom came and got me and took me
back up north with my siblings, however, what has puzzled me and wracked
my brain the most since this voter ID legislation surfaced was the
voting rights of my grandparents. I'd never really thought about it
within this context until now because to me voting rights was a right a
lot of good, brave, and powerful people fought for for so many to have.
The intention was this voter ID legislation has brought has touched
sensitive moments and memories. As I said, as a little girl I remembered
things. I remember growing up in rural North Carolina, but what I never
remember is my grandparents voting. I asked my mother about this a few
days ago because my grandfather has passed and my grandmom is 98 years
young and...So I said to her. I said, &quot;Mom, did you ever see them
vote when you were little girl?&quot; And she said, &quot;Never.&quot;
She said never. I said, &quot;Why do you think it was never?&quot; And
she said, &quot;I think it was because of all the fuss being made about
voting rights. That they were probably too afraid.&quot; In a region of
the state with the largest African-American population, and with the
growing aging population, enacting a voter ID requirement will have
unintended outcomes. Our poorest and most vulnerable, our least likely
to be informed of such a law and thereby turned away at the voting both,
and turned away from exercising a right that their citizenship
guarantees. The comments of all speakers so far today opposing this
legislation does hold tremendous merit, and I am hopeful that you will
give thoughtful consideration to our position. Thank you so much for
your time.

Thank you ma'am. Speaker Number 52, Miss Montford, welcome. Please
introduce yourself to the committee. You have the floor for the time not

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good afternoon. Thank you for allowing me to come before you today. My
name is Mary Montford. I am President of North Carolina A. Philip
Randolph Institute, a state-wide non-profit organization.  My question
to you is, &quot;Why? Why are you considering a federal ID law? A poll
tax on people that are already struggling to pay their normal bills.
Why?&quot; At the North Carolina A. Philip Randolph Institute we have a
food pantry. We feed hundreds of people a month, having to make tough
decisions whether or not they are going to be able to eat, pay rent,
their mortgage, or just be able to buy all of their medicine at one time
and still have enough money to buy all the other necessities in life.
The list goes on. Monday through Friday our volunteers give them
support. Our volunteers are senior citizens, homeless people, unemployed
people, and college students. They are our brother's keepers. The senior
citizens we feed struggle everyday with health issues and food issues in
their life just to sheer survive. The homeless families have already
lost just about everything and live in tents in the woods, some of them
children. Other homeless live near the railroad tracks, or wherever they
can find a spot. There's a man that lives in a shopping center parking
lot beside the road in Raleigh. Numbers of you have probably seen this
man. The unemployment people who, by no choosing of their own, were laid
off from their jobs, or their jobs have been transferred out of state or
overseas are also juggling and trying to maintain to not become
homeless: paying their rent, mortgage, car note, utilities, and let's
not forget about the college students who run short of food.</p>

Does some embrain mandate most selfless, we see them ourselves. They
have no mandate to  purchase tools. We are again our brothers people.
Are you trying to hit the least amongst us. Are you trying to burn us
down with more financial stress bills down to us in a manner of
unemployment wanted to see in this state, curtail the Medicaid, but
truly not happened either. But yet why give big businesses more tax
revenues to do what they please and  yet impose new tax on financial
disenfranchised a politics lets reveal  the photo id row will indeed
create another financial hardship on families. You will be asking
citizens to actually determine whoever to pay bills buy medicines or
both. I oppose the undue hardship of photo id. North Carolina must look
forward not backwards. Thank you.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Madam. Speaker No 53 . Mr Yeltin. Welcome
sir, you have the floor time not to exceed three minutes.
[Speaker Changes]  I want to thank you sir for extending the number
beyond 50. I went to the Internet at 10 ‘o  clock I couldn’t start up.
Then I find out late yesterday afternoon about this being dome and I
drove almost 300 miles to get here and stand before you. And Chairman
Lewis has my written comments. And I would like to ask to take a copy of
those comments and give them to every member of the committee. Because
when you see my comments, you are not  going to see numbers pulled out
of the air are studies over here. You are going to see things that I
experienced as a democrat and as a republican. And folks the fellow
[inaudible] do you really good when a democrat DA and a democrat board
of election will not prosecute some body for voting twice. And that
happened to me in Buckingham county. I am sorry. You could have all
along you want. But that doesn’t work. So the way to solve it is through
positive Photo ID. When they used the school to put out the mail. When a
friend of mine’s daughter goes to Western Carolina and she is recruited
actively and said you can vote here at western and vote in your county.
So that’s what going on in the real world. You read my comments, I can
give you names, dates and people of the fraud that is occurring in North
Carolina. Now this is not a political issue. I have heard right here
from this podium. They want to change it because they didn’t the
outcome. But I think the current leadership entirely liked the outcome
of the last elections. Don’t you. So why they want to change that.  You
have got to stop and think. As I said this is not a political issue. My
97 year old mother had to get a photo id to cash a cheque and there was
no problem. I didn’t realize we had this many stupid people in North
Carolina. You can’t get an ID. Kids are in college and they don’t drive.
My goodness. In 1956 when that little black truck holed up the factory.
I knew I was going to get a day off. You know why I was going to get a
day off.  We had an election day. One day one town and that was it. That
create in my mind how important the elections are. We knew how early
voting, five weeks to vote, anybody can vote, what message are you
sending to the young kids that voting is not important and its just
another every day thing. So when you look at the things rules think
about a way to clarify how college students can vote. And all those
people attending this ground there that had no [inaudible] I got a real
important question for you. You don’t want a voter id, but how many of
you want an ID before I have the right to have a gun. Think about that
and what your personal motive is. Thank you very much for your time.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Sir. Speaker Number 44 . Miss Eaten. Glad to
hear Madam. Welcome. You have the floor, time not to exceed three
minutes.
[Speaker Changes] I am Roselyn Johnson Eaten. I came to prove what Dr
Barbara had said. He introduced this lady as a ninety one year old.</p>

is good to be to see all you representatives, visitors, members
[Inaudible], we go through a lot today. So, I’m here to tell you about a
living experience of voting rights, when I became 18 years old I told my
mother, “Well, sit down and let’s talk.” And she said, “Alright.” So, we
sit down and I begin to tell her that I want to register the vote. So,
she said, “Well, that’s the way. We go down to Louisburg, North Carolina
in Franklin County and we moved about 7 miles out.” So, my brother
___[01:08] and ___ who were also there. We went down to the Courthouse
and back to the Courthouse we walked in and three men sitting there and
he asked the question, “Lady, what you are doing here and what you
want?” I have told him that I came to see about register and voting and
I was 18 years old. He said, “Well, sit down over there and then I will
tell you got a lot of things to do before you get register.” So, he just
asked me to standup, to standup straight and look at them and repeat the
constitution of the United States of America. I did as he asked, I stood
up straight and looked at them and he said, “Not looking to the right,
not looking to the left but look at us, repeated without a mistake.” I
did that and he said, “Well, you are a smarter lady.” So, then he said,
“We will take her as right and legal.” Well, after that day I felt like
I was going to do something and I did do something, it was very exciting
to be register vote and a great revolution but now it has became a
___[02:58], it has become very, very shocking very, very burdensome just
think about what we are going to in the state. I pray that you will

democratic process, our ancestors ___[04:01], dad and had to read the
constitution for that right. Together our past generation moved the
moral accomplice towards a victorious and just history. Therefore,
voting has become a sacred right and privilege and certainly has become
respected. You as law makers and us as citizens know that research has
proven that there is very little or not voter fraud in North Carolina,
voter fraud idea is realistic and unrealistic, unclassified,
undocumented and unfounded. It’s just a fear or a tactic. Voter fraud is

Voter fraud. It is a crime that nobody wants to commit. As a retired
social worker for the Department of Social Services in Franklin County,
I have a great deal of experience with the elderly and their plight in
voting and trying to get to the polls. It is quite difficult for many of
them to provide the income to hire someone, whether it's a caregiver or
a neighbor or someone else to get to the polls to vote. They have to
insure that this is done, so they certainly do not want to impersonate a
living person or a dead person because they can barely get there
themselves. Voting is something that they see as a right and a
privilege. They do not take it lightly and they do not commit fraud.
Therefore, we have many problems in North Carolina that we must deal
with. However, voter fraud is not one of them. I ask that you consider
all the pleas and information that has been presented today and I ask
that you not impose this unjust law on the elderly and the young in
North Carolina. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you ma'am. Speaker number 56 the Chair will ask him to introduce
himself. The Chair is aware that he is from Fayetteville, but cannot
recall nor read the sheet. The Chair apologizes for that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In the name of God the magnificent and merciful, I am Imam Minister ??
Smith Muhammad. God's peace be upon you. I'm here today my beloved
brothers and sisters and first of all I would like to thank God for this
opportunity. For those of you who know me well, you will get criticized
when you step out of line, no matter how big or how small. For those who
do not know me well, I'll also like to get a compliment when it's due.
And for the young man standing behind me, I can call him a young man my
Vietnam Vet living by the way in America the greatest country on Earth,
that's who we are. We must step up to the plate and recognize who we
are, the greatest country on Earth. The world is watching. The young man
standing behind me, he has done a phenomenal job is making everyone
Republican, Democrat, Independent, etc. feel welcome. I've rarely seen
that among my fellow Democrats. So, those of you who call themselves
conservative, I guarantee you you're not as conservative as I am as a
Democrat. Now, clearly, how did we get to this place? How did we get to
this point in the activities in the state of North Carolina? As one of
the elderly statesmen in the legislative Black Caucus told me, most of
you stopped listening. That's how we got here. You stopped listening to
the people on the ground as President Obama says from the ground up. You
stopped listening and if you know as well, we'll come back to bite you
if don't listen to us. So, now that you've been bitten and the Democrat
lost the House and the Senate, now you will listen. But, it's not an
easy lesson. Dr. Alvin Poussaint of Harvard University put it this way.
He said it's time for activism in the street. It is time for activism in
the street brothers and sisters. Voter ID pictures, if it's not broke
don't fix it. Our universities have gone to the extreme. They let drug
dealers on campus before they let alumni on campus. That's just how
messed up and mixed up this ID problem is. It's out of control. You need
to listen to individuals such as the 91-year-old lady who spoke before
me and the 97-year-old man that's sitting in the back. He's here from
Charlotte. They have a great story to tell. Now, Ralph Campbell put it
this way. This is what we need. Ralph Campbell, the first African
American State Treasurer, great friend of mine, friend of yours. His
door was always open on the City Council and when he became State
Treasurer. Your doors are not open enough in the legislature. You are
not acting like Ralph Campbell taught you to act. That's why we're
suffering.</p>

peace be upon you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. Speaker number 57 Mr. Ramey. We're so
glad you're here sir. Welcome you have the floor for time not to exceed
three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chairman and committee. My name is
Willie Thomas Ramey III. I'm the Senior Pastor of the Ridgeway Baptist
Church in Ridgeway, North Carolina which is located in Warren County.
I've served in that position for 36 years. Our church was established in
1867. Our average membership of our average attendance is 69 each
Sunday. 65% of our membership are senior citizens. 40% of the seniors
are over 70 years old. 12 of those members receive in home healthcare
and they can't come to church. We have to take the church to them, but
they vote. 5 members are in a rest home or in the convalescent center,
but they vote. 70% of our members find themselves living at and below
the level of poverty, but they vote. Many of them have worked all of
their lives on farms and industries that are throughout our county and
they live on social security, but they vote. We do not have a motor
vehicle department in our county. A unit comes to our county once a
month for half a day. There is no place in Warren County to buy license
plates, but we vote. We have no outcome that comes into our county that
help our people. People of Warren County already feel the chill of winds
of neglect in disparity, desperation, and isolation. We are at the
bottom of the income level. We're number 5 in per capital income from
the bottom. We have no political influence. We have no sociological
influence. We have no military power. We have no political power and it
seems as if to me that we're trying to take away the constitutional
rights that we already have. We've brought people up in the haves and
the have nots. It seems to me that I should have had nots equating us
now to the Pharoah of Egypt telling us to make bricks with our straw. It
seems to me that I can hear Nebechanezzar saying tell me what my dream
was, interpret my dream but don't tell me what, but don't tell me what
the dream is. Voter id is not necessary. We said that that's so many
different disparities that's going on, so many fraud that's taking
place. Why hasn't there been persecution for them? If you got proof why
didn't you take it to court. And if it didn't take at the first level
why didn't you take it another level. If it's so bad why are we all
sitting here satisfied that we got elected. I don't understand if it is
so bad how come something hasn't gone to the Supreme Court, hasn't gone
to the Judicial level person we're not trying to say that 3/4 of a
person does not matter at all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir.  Before, before we invite our next
guest for the chair I would like to announce a little bit of
housekeeping. It's the Chair's intent to invite four more speakers to
present and then this committee will go into a 15 minute recess and then
we will reconvene. So with that Speaker number 58 Ms. Sullivan. Welcome
ma'am you have the floor for time not to exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you. My name is Virginia Sullivan and I've
rised to speak and thank you for the time to speak against the
requirement of photo id to vote. I speak for the Urban Ministry in
Charlotte, North Carolina. I'm a volunteer counselor there helping
homeless and fragilely homed people, house people with a variety of
problems. In Urban Ministry center serves 400 people per day. You and I
probably live in secure housing with automobiles that automatically lock
and thus a safe place to secure our id we carry with us. Homeless lack
those privileges. Their possessions including their id are routinely
stolen and lost as they've made their way around the city searching for
meals, warmth, safety and relationships. They are often alienated from
family members.</p>

order, I also believe in everything they spoke about, legal aided,
whatnot. I believe that a man should have IDs to represent him. A woman
should have ID in case someone should jump on you, how would they know
who jumped on you, if someone did jump on you, how would you know who
jumped on you. How would you know who broke into your home if you didn’t
have ID. If you have ID there’s a possibility that it could always be
prosecuted if need be. Now, other than that, this afternoon, they sent

still a citizen of Germany. She been here for a year in the States. She

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. Next will be speaker number 60, Mr. Mortimer. We’re glad
you’re here, sir. Welcome to the committee. You have the floor for a
time not to exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I want to thank the members of the committee for giving the citizens
this opportunity to come before you and speak on this issue. My name is
Lee Mortimer. I live at 4116 Livingstone Place in Durham. I served on a
legislative study commission for election law review in 1996. Over the
years I have advocated for fairer ways to conduct elections. I’ve spoken
about election reform at the legislature and in local settings around
the triangle region. Requiring voters to produce a government issued
photo ID in order to vote is a remedy in search of a problem. There is
very little, if any evidence, that fraudulent voting has been a problem
in our elections. If there had been, we know that a lot of candidates
would have appealed and contested, a lot of losing candidates would have
appealed their election losses and that just has not happened. There
could be some reasonable examination of voters’ identity to assure that
they are who they are and that they are at the correct polling place.
When I was coming over here ten years or so ago, Republicans were
advocating a different voter ID proposal. The proposal then would have
accepted a utility bill, a rent receipt or some similar identification.
Utility bill or rent receipt would be checked against the name and
address on the voter registration list, if everything matched, the
person would be allowed to vote. I don’t know why the proposal now has
become so much more onerous. Republicans may have wanted to appear
reasonable and moderate when you were in the minority. Now that you have
enough legislative votes to push through just about anything you want
to, perhaps there’s not so much need to be reasonable. Most of us in
this room take for granted our driver’s license or other forms of
government issued photo ID, but many people don’t have those. They are
young, they are poor, they are older people who don’t drive or don’t own
a car. They are the elderly or the infirm who don’t often leave their
residence except when someone else takes them out. I recently was
working with a lady who resides in an assisted living facility. She
hasn’t had a driver’s license in years nor any other kind of photo ID.
If this law passes, she would have an additional burden placed on her
ability to vote. For these and other fellow citizens, having to obtain a
government photo ID would be a genuine hardship. Even a free ID would
impede many people from voting and a free ID card from the government
obviously is not free. It would be one more unnecessary expense that
should not be added to the taxpayers burden. This new requirement for
voting is not fair and is not needed. I urge you to reconsider before
pushing through something that unfairly and needlessly restricts many of
our citizens from exercising their right to vote. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, sir.</p>

Speaker number 61, Miss Bun. Welcome, you have the floor for a time not

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Committee. Common sense is sometimes
common. An overwhelming majority of individuals support photo voter ID.
It is amazing the number of places mentioned by previous speakers that
you have to show your photo ID. Your vote is very precious. It's more
precious than a FedEx package. And as far as cost, this is a replica of
my personal photo ID, and it cost about ten dollars, which is about what
an ID would cost. Ten dollars. For the hundreds of people that could not
be here today, and for the millions of people and the six million voters
of North Carolina who support photo voter ID, please, please do this.
Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Lewis, and to the Committee, for allowing
voting citizens to come and speak to you. The arguments have been, and
will be made, that a voter ID law in North Carolina is absolutely
necessary, if we are to reign in the ubiquitous scourge of rampant voter
fraud, but we all know that this law will not be aimed at preventing
voter fraud, as supporters claim,
but to set up new barriers that will make it more difficult for
minorities and the poor to exercise their right to vote. The law is a
poll tax, and it will disenfranchise new generations of
African-American, Latino-American, poor, and elderly citizens. Just when
we thought he was dead, Jim Crow lurches forward like an incessant
zombie. Associate Professor of History at San Francisco University,
Charles Postel, writes, &quot;The new law and the historic poll tax
share three significant points. First, a voter restriction is like a
poll tax when its authors use voting fraud as a pretext for legislation
that has little to do with voting fraud. Second, it is like a poll tax
when it creates only a small nuisance to some voters, but for other
groups it erects serious barriers to the ballot.  Third, it is like a
poll tax when it has crude partisan advantage as its most immediate
aim.&quot; End quote. When literacy tests, poll taxes and similar laws
were enacted in 1890s, the very men who wrote them believed in and
practiced a form of White supremacy that Frederick Douglas said would
shame a nation of savages, and they were proud of it. These laws were
designed to intimidate, and ultimately bar African-Americans from
voting.
Ironically, in the case of the illiteracy tests, many of the
administrators of those tests were illiterate. And what was the
rationale in the 1890s? Voter fraud. The funny thing was that the
politicians who were in support of these suppressive and oppressive laws
were involved in fixing elections and vote-buying. Like its predecessor,
this voter ID legislation was designed to put another barrier between
Blacks, the poor, and other minorities and the ballot box. As a proud
American and North Carolinian, I am ashamed to say that North Carolina
Republican legislators are championing the political advantages of photo
ID laws that will disproportionately affect minority, elderly, poor
voters. My</p>

the North Carolina School Board Association, has voted since he was able
to, without showing any identification. I intend to follow the example
of my forefathers, and do it the same way my father still does: freely
and unencumbered by a poll tax in the form of photo identification. I
will fight this. This is said to be the people's house. A voter ID law
will make it some people's house. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir, very much. Speaker number 68, Miss Rinke. Welcome,
Ma'am, please identify yourself for the record. You have the floor for a
time not to exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Octavia Rinke, and again, I would
like to thank you for the opportunity of allowing me to speak. I am here
today, I am opposed to voter ID. Voter ID is nothing but a poll tax.
I've listened tonight to a lot of people talk about this issue. There is
a difference between a privilege and a constitutional right. It is a
privilege to have a driver's license. It is a privilege to have all
kinds of credit cards with your picture on them. All of that is a
privilege, but it is a constitutional right to vote.
This bill is not fair. It is unjust. Something happened here, so I
brought my photo ID, and it is called the African-American Journal, and
it talks about our plight from February 1778 to November of 1956. I
would challenge all of the legislature, before you do anything else with
this bill, to read this. It talks about our voter suffrage. It talks
about how we were killed, beaten, just for the right to vote. And when
you begin to institute a photo ID, let's not play games with that. It's
nothing but an illusion, taking us back to the past. And the sad part
about this is that no... It's just no offense to anyone, if you don't
know our history, how in the world can you bring forth a legislation
that is fair and just, and not &quot;just us&quot;? There's something
wrong with this legislation. We have been down this road before. We have
had all kinds of tests imposed upon us. This is just another test.
Please do not move forward with this photo ID. We have rules on the
books, for everyone to vote. As a former precinct worker, I did not see
fraud at all in our precinct. We were taught, and taught very well, and
we follow all the rules, because guess what? As a precinct worker, you
sign off too. So I am just confused at why we are here with a photo ID.
I don't understand it, but please understand that there is a difference
between our constitutional right and a privilege. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Ma'am. Speaker number 69 is not currently in the room, so
we'll move to speaker number 70, which I believe is Miss Freeman. Miss
Freeman, welcome, Ma'am, you have the floor for a time not to exceed
three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, and to all of the representatives
here, I stand very proud to be in this place this afternoon to express
myself. I stand on the shoulders of my parents and that generation.
Oftentimes, when it was election day, my parents used to say, &quot;This
is the one day that everybody is free, and equal, whether you're Miss
Anne on the hill, or Uncle Bob in the valley, everyone have a voice and
a vote.&quot; Let's not take that voice from the people. I heard the
lady say that, again the previous speaker said, that I have credit cards
with my ID, I have this with my ID, and that's wonderful. It's wonderful
for you sitting in this room to have all those things. I am a social
worker, and I know about the little people</p>

wish I was rich, and I would give people ID so that would not be an

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you m'am very much. Speaker number seventy one, miss Benne four,
if I'm pronouncing that correctly, M'am, welcome please, identify
yourself for the record, and you have the floor for a time not to exceed
three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you chair. I would like to thank you for this opportunity to speak
today. Good afternoon my name is, or good evening, my name is Sonya
Jackson Bennetone. I reside in Wilmington, North Carolina. I am the
great grand daughter of former slaves, Fanny Perkins Williams, and Henry
Williams. I am empowered to be a descendant of former slaves, because if
they can survive the worst form of inhumanity, I have no excuse for
failure. My father, the late Reverend Isiah James Jackson Junior,
survived segregation. There were restaurants he could not go to. Beaches
that were less than a mile away, that he could not take his family.
However, regardless of the obstacles, my daddy, was my hero. He had the
love of god in his heart, the love of family, and he loved his country.
And he was proud to say that I am a United States veteran. My daddy took
voting very seriously. For any of his children to forget to vote, was
worse than committing a crime.  My daddy never forgot about bloody
Sunday in March of 1965, when Jimmy Lee Jackson was killed by State
troopers. And others brutally attacked in a peaceful march while trying
to register to vote. However, god took a tragic event which had gained
national attention, and led to the signing of the voting rights act of
1965 which enabled millions of African Americans could vote.. to vote.
Some were born with the right to vote, but others, some had to die for
their constitutional right to vote. And no, we do not take this for
granted. Voting in America is a day when all Americans are equal. One
man, one vote. Passing the voter ID bill will cause the state of North
Carolina, or could cause, the state of North Carolina millions of
dollars. North Carolina has the fifth highest unemployment in the
nation, has severe cuts to public education, and I'm confused where
there's even funding for such a bill that we don't need. The voter fraud
reporting is so low that if the bill passed it would have the same
results. When one registers to vote, everything is verified. Percentage
wise, it's hard enough to get people to the polls once. More or less
than trying to do it illegally twice. Most senior citizens like my
mother, will have voted in the same precinct for over half a century.
And a precinct is just like your neighborhood, everyone knows one
another, even the poll workers know you, cause you vote in your
neighborhoods. And to tell my mother, or any other mother, or citizen
they cannot vote because of an ID, is injust. We serve a just god and
when there's an injustice, it's our Christian duty to do what's just and
right. I ask not only you to stop the voter ID bill however, I ask the
same god that was there for my great grandparents during slavery. The
same god that was there for my grandparents and parents when voter
suppression was legal, which is the same god that has allowed me to
stand before you today to ask those who are placed in office to please
stop this bill. Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you m'am. Speaker number seventy two, mister Gala goad. And please
feel free to correct the chair and the pronunciation, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman, committee, representatives, and members of
the public. I'm.. again, my name is Jake Gellar-Goad, and I'm happy to
be here today, and I come with one simple message. Have more hearings.
Have more hearings. There are so many folks who couldn't be here
tonight. But everyone who did come tonight, I think no matter what side
of the issue you are speaking on, you're glad and you agree that it's
good for people to come and to have their voices heard. So we need to
have more</p>

<p id="145:00">
For hearings. I work with a lot of people from East North Carolina, and
I was glad that democracy in Greenville and the Greene County NAACP, and
Greene County Grassroots could all make it up for this hearing. And I'm
glad they had a chance to speak out. But for every one of them who had a
chance to come, there are many more who couldn't. So please, have more
hearings. One week's notice for a weekday meeting at 4pm when people
have to work, that's not enough. Have more hearings. For all those folks
in East North Carolina where poverty is such an issue, folks who can't
afford to get the IDs, they certainly can't afford to drive up here and
tell you they can't get those IDs. Please have more hearings, have them
across the state, have them in East North Carolina. When you combine
photo ID with the tax on early voting, the tax on same day registration,
a tax with redistricting and other measures, it starts to look like it's
politicians trying to choose their voters rather than letting voters
pick their representatives, and that's not how it should be. We need to
have more hearings. So in closing, you guessed it, have more hearings.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. Speaker number 73 has already spoken. Speaker number 74,
Mr. Hobkins. You have the floor, sir, for a time not to exceed three
minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. The arguments I've heard here tonight in favor of this
legislation have struck me, as at best, intellectually vapid or at
worst, overtly disingenuous. Legislation like this has appeared in
legislatures across the country in recent years, and I think that the
political calculus that has animated the forces proposing these bills is
profoundly cynical. And any legislature and any lawmaker who votes for
this bill should be ashamed of himself. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. Speaker number 75, Mr. Brand. You have the floor sir for
a time not to exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. I'm Rick Brand and I'm chairman of the Vance County
Democratic Party and I live in Henderson, North Carolina. In the last
eight years in Vance county, the board of election has had three cases
of voter irregularity which were investigated. The current system works.
One of them was an elderly couple who had simply forgotten that they had
voted and showed up at the polls and the pollworker called them, told
them and they remembered. The second one was a chronic alcoholic who had
in fact forgotten that he had early voted and showed up at the poll and
was told he could not vote again. The third one was a pollworker who got
confused between an uncle and a nephew who had very similar names, and
so when the uncle showed up to vote, the pollworker said that he had
already voted. So, we don't need a Voter ID bill in Vance county because
the voter irregularities that have happened in our county have been
taken care of very well by the current system. However, since I
understand the political reality, if you are going to pass a voter ID
bill, it seems to me incumbent based on the vast amount of voter
irregularity in Vance County that you need to apply voter ID to absentee
ballots as well. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir. Speaker number 76 is Mr. Washington. I apologize. Mr.
Linville. I apologize. Do you know what number you are? Okay, so this is
speaker number 79, Mr. Linville. The chair apologizes. I'm glad you're
here sir. You have the floor for a time not to exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman and committee members. My name is Richard
Linville. I reside in Forsyth County. We do need a voter ID. No doubt
about it. I've worked the polls for several years, and I don't know
where the numbers are coming from as far as voter fraud. It is correct
that the voter integrity project come up with 30,000 dead people. There
was in 2012, there was 832 voters that voted absentee ballot. That was
112 years old. That's great. But there's only 330 people in the United
States. Is that voter fraud? If it's not I don't know what to call it.
I'm looking at a deal here in, where the election board, state board of
election in the Obama campaign registered 11,000 people online. North
Carolina does not allow that.</p>

That’s illegal. How did that happen? I have called the Attorney General
three time, hadn’t got an answer. I wonder if somebody’s going to be
prosecuted on this. I don’t know, but I’m not not giving up. I’ll call
him again. I had a pretty good program going until I come in 76th or
79th and everybody else had done beat all my stuff up, but anyway. I
want to also say an ID, you don’t have to have a driver’s license to go
vote. Getting an ID card, you have to go to the North Carolina driver’s
ID, to get a North Carolina driver’s ID, you go to any driving license
office and apply for it. All you’ve got to have is proof age,
identification, and if you apply and you get it, it is good for five
years. You could go back and renew it in five years. What’s the deal
about high school kids...not high school, college kids, not
getting...they don’t have to have a license, they can go get this ID.
Another thing is to, getting to the polls. I worked the polls. I worked
them for five year. I’ve watched bus after bus after bus after bus after
bus of people brought in and let out. I saw people bring them in, go in
with them, and direct them on how to vote. That really bothers me. I
cannot see how in the world we can get by. Voting is a fundamental right
that everybody has. But it’s also a fundamental right for it to be fair
and transparent, thank you very much.

76, Mr. Washington, sir. We’re glad you’re here. You have the floor for

I’d like to thank the chairman and the House. Allow me to speak on this
serious issue in Congress today. My name is Roland Washington. I’m a
United States Marine Corp veteran and a senior. I’m an advocate for the
homeless in Charlotte, North Carolina, one of the leadership members of
that group. I’m also a member of Action North Carolina as well as
Democracy of North Carolina. I’m here today to speak on behalf of the
homeless, middle class, lower class of North Carolina. Your attempt to
pass through a law that requires ID to vote will make it harder for me,
for the homeless, and all people in North Carolina to exercise our right
to vote. Please, today, let’s use common sense. Do not waste taxpayers’
money and time on needless law that airs extra hassle and burdens,
especially on the homeless in this state. Also, please do not play
politics with our sacred right to vote. Please do not let your divisions
by political party divide the people from our right to vote. I’d like to
thank you for allowing me to let you hear my voice for all people to be
heard. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Than you, Mr. Speaker. I'm Reverend Isaiah Green with Equal Treatment
Incorporated, we are a civil rights group domiciled out of North
Carolina, but we serve throughout the United States. I do appreciate the
privilege to come and speak with you, briefly. I would have been here
earlier today, but we served two federal summons on the Wake County
Court Administrators, B Colon Willoughby and also Judge Eagles
multi-million dollar lawsuit against them for what we call IMP and that
is Intentional Malicious Prosecution. Last week I got the opportunity to
talk with Sheyenne Rodriguez, WTBD 11 eye witness news in front of the
legislature here and gave her our views about a solution to the problem
of voter fraud and having to present an ID card when you go to vote.
Basically we all know that most of us we register prior to voting and
your name is already on a list. When you go to the poll to vote usually
there is several lines and most polls I've gone to there are three lines
and they go through alphabetical order probably the first nine alphabets
and then the second part and then the third part so the solution that I
offered to WTBD to be presented to the public never was aired. I was on
the noon days news, but they never gave the solution to the problem.
Now, this is the solution that I propose is that: at every poll setting
that you have cameras that take pictures of everyone that comes there to
vote and then if there is a problem with fraud you have everybody on the
camera. So when you start matching who came to vote in different
precincts if the same face shows up twice then you have the perpetrator.
Now this is the thing. All we have to do is put laws in place to make
sure that they're fined and that they are penalized or go by the federal
statutes which are already in place for fraud. Thanks so kindly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. Speaker Number 85, Reverend Gatewood. We're glad you're

the North Carolina NAACP. Now we've heard from extremists tonight. Some
referring to people as stupid. Some referring to people as if they do
not understand how they could be disenfranchised when we are talking
about laws or putting into place unjust laws. Let me just say on behalf
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People we are
here to make sure North Carolina does not take the path of hypocrisy vs
democracy.</p>

It is hypocrisy when you have race-based gerrymandering and
redistricting that stacks tax and bleaches black voters. We call that
hypocrisy, not democracy. When you have disguised voting techniques such
as voter poll taxes and voter ID. That's hypocrisy, not democracy. When
you're alleging voter fraud without evidence. We've had an escalation of
voter participation from African Americans, Hispanics, especially over
the last general elections, that North Carolina should be proud of.
Youth are turning out to vote. North Carolina should be proud. But what
do we do? We're trying now to find ways to discourage young people that
we often criticize for not participating in the electoral process. We
criticize them. Now they're willing to vote, now they're showing up to
polls like at no other point in history. What do we do? We turn around,
we come up with a new barrier to jump over, more hoops to jump over.
It's hypocrisy when you're cutting early voting and you know young
people are coming out to early vote like never before. It's hypocrisy.
When you're making it more difficult for people to vote who have been
disenfranchised for hundreds of years. It's hypocrisy to claim we have a
democracy, therefore we hear the NAACP saying maintain the commitment to
the principles of the 14th, 15th and 24th amendments and the voting
rights act of 1965. Properly applying section 5 of the voting rights
act. Making it easier to vote by allowing easy access to everyone who is
ready and willing to participate in the civic life of their community.
We need more democracy, not less democracy. We need more Sunday voting,
not less Sunday voting. We need more early voting, not less early
voting. We need democracy not hypocrisy. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
sir. Speaker 86 is withdrawn. Speaker 87, Mr. Salinger, welcome sir you

Thanks for letting me speak here today. My name is Walter Salinger and I
live in Greensboro, North Carolina and this is Tim Morlan and he does
too. I'm here to speak against the proposed voter ID law. A stated
purpose of the law is to prevent in-person voter fraud yet the number of
documented cases of in-person voter fraud in North Carolina is
vanishingly small. Indeed it's been said that in-person voter fraud and
being abducted by a UFO occur about as often as one another. Why create
a law to solve a problem that doesn't exist? One might say that even
though the problem of in-person voter fraud doesn't exist, the law would
at least give peace of mind to those who worry about the problem might
exist and the law would provide this peace of mind without any harmful
effects. Problem is that the proposed law does carry the potential for
seriously harmful effects on our democracy. It could create a barrier to
voting as a result of the long lines that would stem from new ID checks
at the polls, for example, or because a prospective voter misunderstands
the new law or because an overzealous poll worker misapplies it.
Moreover, the new law would be expensive to implement due to the cost of
providing on a timely basis the necessary ID to legitimate voters. These
costs are estimated to be in millions of dollars in North Carolina,
can't solve a problem that doesn't exist and worsen our state's severe
financial distress. A far greater concern to me and many of my fellow
North Carolinians - a greater concern to me than the financial cost
however, is that whether as a result of increasing wait times of voter
misunderstanding or the overly zealous poll worker, a citizen might be
wrongly denied the right to vote. Denying a citizen the right to vote
would be profoundly unpatriotic because wrongly denying an American
citizen the right to vote is an assault on the very foundation of our
democracy. Responding of the seriousness of this threat to our
democracy, thousands upon thousands</p>

18 and North Carolina has this card issued. Because otherwise it's
unconstitutional. So as long as you keep up and make sure everybody that
lives in North Carolina, above the age of 18, has voter ID card I guess
you can do it. But I still think it's an extra hardship. I'll worry
about it, though. I'm not going to say I believe in the literal truth of
the book of revelations, but you would think the most effective way to
do this - if you're really concerned about this - is having an RFID chip
implanted into you. Then everybody knows who you are. Now I disagree
with that, and if you look at the book of Revelation, which again I

don't think that there really is one either. So please don't

conspiracy. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir. Speaker number 92 has withdrawn.
Speaker number 93 is Miss Allison. Ma'am, we're very glad that you're
hear. You have the floor for a time not to exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker and those of us that
have stayed here. This wonderful opportunity talk about participatory
democracy. That's what it's all about. And I looked up the guidelines,
and the question was whether the requirement of a photo ID upon voting
is a good policy. No, it's not a good policy. I aggressively say that.
Enough reasons have been given already. I don't need to articulate many
more. [But that's when the] guideline was if required the impact of a
photo ID on election, what is the impact? The impact is going to be
negative. You've heard it over, and over, and over again. The record
will show that. But you know I want to change a little bit. First in
freedom, North Carolina. The republicans who are running this show now
you all have [enough] authority. You all have a new day. You're not
going to join the polluted stream all those other states. Are you going
to let those persons who have worked tirelessly to make North Carolina a
leader in the South? You all getting ready to mess up. You don't need to
join the polluted stream. Freedom. Justice. Don't give up this wonderful
opportunity to be talked about all over the world. North Carolina is
going to make the news. Do you know you are going to in fact go against.
I'm not going to call those ?? in Washington and all those other states.
Republicans you have an opportunity. I'm giving you a challenge. North
Carolina will praise you, you'll be in history, call up Abe Lincoln and
say, &quot;Look what we did.&quot; Let me stop right now. Participatory
democracy. You should be getting more people, not putting up barriers.
You have time to do it. The mainstream is polluted. And I don't want
these good democrats all of us used to be until FDR came along. You all
have a chance to attract some more folks. You're not going to do it by
doing what you doing now. You're not doing what's right. It's dead
wrong. It's not just, it's not fair. And you all are giving up an
opportunity to put North Carolina on the map. Dear Republicans, do the
right thing. Don't pass this. Look at national news. World news. And
join some of the republicans and some of the democrats who are willing
to--  no it's not compromise, it's doing what's right. Thank you very
much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, ma'am. Speakers 94, 96, and 97 have
withdrawn. Speaker 98, Mr. Brown. Welcome, sir. You have the floor for a
time not to exceed 3 minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chairman. I'm Jerome Brown. I'm
chairman of the Wake County voter education coalition. We are in
opposition to the voter ID bill. And you've already heard a ton of
information tonight so I will be brief. Why restrict and make it more
difficult to vote in North Carolina. I think you've heard a lot of
reasons why.</p>

<p id="175:00">
this bill should be reconsidered.  Point 2 I'd like to make is, the
photo voter ID is not needed in North Carolina.  I am not a Tea Party
member, I am not a Socialist, I am not some of those things that you
heard other people stand before you and describe.  What we're talking
about is basic, common sense.  The other states across the United States
that have done this and have tried this, clearly have left a path that I
would hope North Carolina does not want to follow and duplicate.  That
does not make sense to me.  I consider myself to be a very reasonable
human being, and something smells of high you-know-what to me, and
that's the way I have to describe it.  This is not rocket science.  The
third point that I'd like to make is that voter integrity in North
Carolina is not the question or issue.  The evil this hides behind is a
shame.  Point 4, North Carolina voting is at a premium.  The past two
election cycles bear this out.  Now I'm very good at connecting the
dots, and for the past two presidential elections, I've connected the
dots and it leads me right here tonight.  This was not an issue two
elections ago, it has now become an issue for North Carolina.  Connect
the dots.  Point 5, is changing the rules so that it short circuits the
people of North Carolina is a crime being made or attempted to be made
here, that is the issue.  North Carolina citizens should not be short
circuited.  And my last point is it should not stand. Changing the rules
not should not stand, it should not move forward.  The state of North
Carolina does have a problem with what you're trying to propose now.
There is no voter fraud.  Nobody has still presented the evidence to
show that voter fraud in North Carolina is rampant and out of control.
As I said, connect the dots, do not pass this bill.  North Carolina does
not need this, we can lead.  North Carolina needs to lead on this.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Sir.  Speaker Number 99 has withdrawn.
Speaker Number 100, Miss Clayton, we're so glad you're here, Ma'am, you
have the floor for a time not to exceed three minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Chair.  Thank you, members of the
legislature.  My name is JoAnne Clayton, I am a Wake county citizen and
also a Board of Elections Trustee and I am a Chief Judge, and your first
line of defense when it comes to voter fraud.  Many of my co-workers and
other chairs have stepped up here and said pretty much what I'm going to
say right now.  We haven't seen the voter fraud you are seeking.  We are
the ones who would look at that voter ??.  Let me give you a perfect
example of what happens when you have that voter ID.  The lines that you
saw, the longest lines in the history of voting, will continue to get
longer and longer.  The big lines that we saw as poll workers, the help
desk is the longest line that exists, and that's looking at that ID, and
looking at that person and telling them to go back and get what they
need.  We are not letting voter fraud get through here.  We know what's
going on, we see it firsthand.  This is imaginary.  If you want to live
in an imaginary world, create an imaginary fix, but we have a real
world.  We need to deal with real fixes, and the real fix we need right
here and right now, we need more time to vote, we need equipment to
vote, we need people to help vote.  We have such a short amount of
equipment out here, that we could have gotten these voter lines down in
half if we had what we needed.  Instead, your legislative body wishes to
cut our board of elections.  Why would you cut what you want to fix?
You're here today to say you want to fix something?  Fix it for real.
With a real healing.  We don't need a band-aid for something that's
huge.  The huge things is we have people who need and want to vote.
When I see a 103 year old lady in her wheelchair in the rain voting, and
you tell her she has to have an ID and come back?  How dare you, any of
you, any of us, to determine that woman's faith and ability to vote in
this state.  We have no right, no right at all, to turn anyone here away
from voting.  Thank you very much.  Please reconsider, and vote
&quot;no&quot;.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Ma'am, very much.  Speaker No. 101, Miss
Richardson, Ma'am, we welcome you, and</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. Thank you all for listening to what I have to say. I
really appreciate it. As a voter, one of the reasons why I don’t want to
see this ID facade, we got a problem, we got...all of a sudden, after
all these hundreds of years with all these presidents, with all these
being voted in, all of sudden now you want to see an ID. We’re going to
send you home. 2014, we sending you home so enjoy your hatefulness while
you can. But let me just tell you a little story why I don’t like voter
ID, because it reminds me of this. I remember my parents coming home
from the voting polls with heavy hearts. As my parents entered the
house, I could see tears were streaming down my mother’s face because of
the degradation, intimidation, and disrespect she and my father were
made to endure. They were asked how many bubble were in a bar of soap.
However, at that time, that poll was being assisted by a federal officer
so my parents were allowed to vote that night. Even after they came home
and I had asked my mother about the situation about what happened, she
was still distraught about it and had felt, I guess she felt more
American because she knew that by doing that, she was creating a
situation where another person would go and go through whatever she went
through to get this done. The point it, later on that night, we had to
use guns to keep people from destroying our property. Good old boys, or
teabaggers, or Republicans, or whatever you want to call them, were
trying to destroy our property because my parents voted. I’m just
putting you on notice. We’re going to get rid of you. Enjoy your time.
Make all these crazy laws that you want to make. Try to put us back into
the 50s, Jim Crow, you can try it. But I tell you what, you will leave
eventually. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The next speaker 102 has withdrawn, speaker 103 is Mr. Hollowell. Sir,
you have the floor for a time not to exceed 3 minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you sir and thank you to all of you. My name is Hugh Hollowell. I
am a minister in a Mennonite church USA. I am, by the grace of God and
the incredible forbearance of my board of directors, the executive
director of Loved Ones Ministries located 707 W. Jones St, 2 blocks away
from here. We are a 501C3 that engages spiritual care in the homeless
community of Raleigh, North Carolina. I am not an activist. I’m a
minister. I’ve got to confess, I don’t know a lot about politics. I know
a lot about homeless people. I can tell you, I can tell you lots of
stories. I could tell you stories about my friend Greg, who despite
serving in the Armed Forces for 20 years, dealing with countless bouts
of PTSD, in trying to navigate the system, who had his papers stolen,
who had the misfortune of being born in New York City where one must
have a photo ID in order to get a birth certificate so that one could
have a photo ID. I’m sure that makes sense to them. I have to tell this
man that I can’t help him. For all of the people who were willing to
help people get IDs, I want you to meet Greg. I expect a line tomorrow
at 707 W. Jones to help Greg. I could also tell you the story about a
certain day in November last year when I drove over 20 homeless people
to the polls and they voted. I know that at the time I was helping 4 of
them get their photo IDs. They weren’t in yet, but they voted. I can
tell you about my friend Nadia who was ??</p>

...Twenty-one.  And voting for the first time in her life.  You see,
what you have to understand what homelessness is. Homelessness is a
series of losses. You lose your job.  You lose your home.  You lose your
family. Sometimes you lose your children.  Eventually you lose your
dignity.
And Nadia and I are driving back.  It's late at night. We're toward the
end.  And she says; &quot;They didn't take this away from me&quot;.  I
know you're tired.  We've been here a long time.  But the tiredness and
the frustration you feel is nothing compared to the frustration my
people feel when they're being denied a fundamental right. Please don't
take that away from them too.    Thank you very much.
[speaker changes] Thank you sir.  Speaker number 104, Ms. Porter.
Welcome, ma'am.  You have the floor for a time not to exceed three
minutes.
[speaker changes] Hello. My name is Kim Porter. I am not a Democrat. I
am not a Republican. I am registered as an Independent voter. I say that
because I don't see this as just a partisan issue. I see this as an
issue of morality.  We must not pass this voter i.d. bill.
Voter i.d. is not a big problem as far as people abusing it. It's not a
problem in our State of North Carolina. It's also not a problem in our
country. It's not a big one.  What our big problems though, are things
like unemployment and under-employment. Lack of affordable health care.
The price of gas which is coming up an upwards of $4.00 a gallon.
Homelessness.  Hunger. I come from Precise County where one in four
children is hungry. Poverty is also a big issue.  How about
foreclosures? Let's do something about the foreclosures in our state and
all across our nation.  About pollution and climate change.  What about
our education system.  We know we're not number one in the country.
Let's do something to fix those problems.
Voter fraud is not a big problem. There're so many other issues that we
need to be dealing with today. In North Carolina, the State Board of
Elections reports that more than 500,000 eligible voters do not have
driver's licenses or State issued i.d. cards.  This is an issue.
They have been voting. And you know what, We don't have enough people in
North Carolina who are voting. Isn't that a problem.  How about the
problem of we need to get more people, more citizens out voting. That's
important.  Women are 54% of active voters, but only 66% of those
without a North Carolina photo i.d. Seniors are 18% of active voters,
but 26 of those without a North Carolina photo i.d.  Youth are 13% of
active voters, but 16% of those without a North Carolina photo i.d. And
African-Americans are 22% of all active registered voters, but they are
31% of the active registered voters who do not have a North Carolina
i.d.
I know that we also need to be concerned about if i.d.'s were required,
who is gonna pay for these things?  Our counties cannot afford to pay
for i.d.'s for people.  I know I come from Winston, Salem like I said
earlier. We are having a problem with out tax base. Because we have a
whole population of people whose tax base have been severely undercut.
We have people with $150,000.00 homes who are now supposedly worth
$50,000.00.  Let's fix that problem.
We don't need to end Sunday voting.  Sunday voting is very important for
churches and other people. We also need to be able to continue to have
early voting.  When over 250,000 people voting in this last election for
early voting.
And I'm just going to summarize by saying, this is the time when we need
to be encouraging people to vote. We need to encourage participation,
not discourage it. We already have too few people voting in North
Carolina and across our nation.  Let's not make this an even greater
problem.
Be honest. Be just. Be fair.  Make North Carolina proud.  Please resist
the urge to choose your voters.  North Carolina voters should be
choosing their politicians.  Thank you.
[speaker changes] Thank you ma'am.
Ladies and gentlemen, as Chair I would like to express my sincere thanks
to our staff for the incredible work they've done tonight and in
preparation for the night.  I would like to express my thanks to our
