Some of the members may have forgotten that we’ve done the prayer and
the pledge a little bit earlier this morning. We’re moving to the
calendar. House Bill 112, the clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate
Committee Substitute for House Bill 112, a bill to be entitled an act to
make technical clarifying and other modifications to the current
operations and capital appropriations and improvement act of 2013 and
related legislation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar, please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To, for a motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for a motion and to debate the
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I move that we do concur with the Senate
Committee Substitute for House Bill 112. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
may debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and
members of the House. There are basically right at 70 provisions in this
bill. This bill, [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar, if the
gentleman will yield, the clerk will read the amendment first. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Brunstetter moves to amend the bill on page 17, line 43
by [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may debate the motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I move the adoption of the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The amendment is un-engrossed from the floor, as I recall, or
maybe from committee of the Senate, and what this amendment does,
yesterday we passed the hospital transparency bill, it had some other
provisions in it. One of those provisions dealt with information coming
into the state HIE which is the Health Information Exchange. That’s not
the health benefits exchange, that’s something different. This is
something that we have. And this amendment basically was a negotiated
amendment to make sure that it was clear that the Department of Health
and Human Services would enter into some agreements with HIE to share
clinical data and the like under the appropriate constraints and federal
protections. So I would move the adoption of the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Luebke, please state your purpose. Further

amendment complete and now we’re back on the bill. Further discussion
and debate. Representative Dollar, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is

  <p>something, something related to this bill. This is our budget technical
corrections bill. For those of you who haven&#39;t been here before,
after ever budget you have a budget technical corrections bill that goes
back, and the staff figures out the commas and the periods and the
spellings and those kind of things, and also sometimes  you have left
things kind of hanging that need further clarification in the budget, in
the technical corrections, and this certainly does that. If you want me
to, there&#39;s now maybe 71 provisions, I&#39;d be happy to explain it.
I&#39;ll try to go through, maybe I can try to do this as quickly as I
can.
Section 1.1 is technical. When I say &quot;technical&quot;, staff
technical. It&#39;s technical.
2 is just a couple of month delay in the state plan amendment for the ??
program, so it&#39;s basically technical.
1.2 is technical, dealing with the master settlement dealing with
tobacco.
1.4 is fixing some things from fees, it&#39;s primarily technical
involving contingency and emergency funds.
1.5 is technical.
In the information technology section, 2.1 is making sure that Dept. of
Revenue has access to about $3 million to finish their temps program.
2.2 has to do with the state portal and some oversight issues, it&#39;s
helping the state CO with some additional authority. I think Rep. Saine
had worked on that one, if I remember correctly.
2.3 is technical.
2.4 is primarily technical, involving some federal laws and IT stuff.
In education, 3.2 we have some clarifying provisions that Rep. Stam
wanted concerning children with disability scholarships.
3.3 was making sure that local LEAs had flexibility with respect to
class sizes in grades 4-12, and this is just for grades 4-12 and this is
similar to flexibility that they have had for some time but it
didn&#39;t make it into the budget so we had to put it in.
3.4 is technical.
3.5, I think the gentleman down toward the coast will be pleased with
this one, this deals with a regional school, Rep. Tine, down in Little
Washington.
3.6 is technical.
3.7 is technical with the community colleges, as I recall.
3.8 is technical.
3.9 is some delays in some kindergarten screening in order to get the
program actually operational.
3.10 involves moving where the North Carolina Workforce Innovation
Commission is actually gonna be housed in the governor&#39;s office.
3.11 is technical.
3.12 reinstates the sunset on some UNC leasing authority which was
needed.
3.14 makes the community college system CFO and the state CFO nonvoting
members of a study involving the audit process in community colleges,
there were a number of people interested in that.
The Veteran&#39;s Connect terminology was fixed in 3.15 I believe, Rep.
Horn was concerned with that one.
3.16 deals with legislative education oversight in the NC gap program.
3.17 was some eligibility shifts in the disability scholarship program.
What it did, it doesn&#39;t cost any money, it&#39;s just making the
pool a little bit bigger for children to be able to potentially
participate in that who can participate in that.
3.18 is technical.
3.19 is technical.
3.2 deals with the low wealth schools, Rep. Langdon and a few others had
raised a question about

  <p>One of the language the Lowell schools was actually going to get a hit
it was realized the way language was written they were going to get a
hit so part of the language of some of those provisions was returned to
the language that had been there in the past in order to make sure
counties didn&#39;t get a hit on that. Health and human services 4.1
there was some provisions relating to the institute of medicine that had
just been simply left out so that was technical. 4.2 is child care
commission, that was technical. 4.3 delayed some licensing things with
some pre k classrooms, I believe that was a request of the department.
4.4 is a change to ADD, ADHD, mental health medications, there was a lot
of discussion about that and I think we got a fix for everyone, made
everybody happy. 4.6 was a clarifying thing on a CON provision that was
in the budget. 4.7 was technical. I think 4.8 was fairly technical in my
opinion. 4.9 was definitely a technical thing, that was my issue. 4.11
is a there were some delays in implementing requirements for DMA,
implementing MMIS contracts in the future. 2.12 was some operational, is
actually the agreement. I think a couple of you, Representative Earl and
maybe Representative Carnie, some of the ?? brook folks wanted some time
for ?? to come into compliance with some provisions and we gave them an
additional 3 months as we promised we would. 4.13 modified the pharmacy
provisions, trying to help them with their cash flow as they worked to
help us lower costs. 4.14 was fairly technical. 4.16 is some technical
help to the adax, the house was able to save the adax, there was still a
reduction that we weren&#39;t completely comfortable with so we were
able to get some additional flexibility and then how they&#39;re able to
make those reductions work. 4.17 was technical. In the natural resources
area 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, I think most of those were technical. 5.7, there was
one provision in here I know that there was none intended consequences I
recall that some local economic development authorities would have been
affected so we made sure to clarify that so that they were not affected
by other changes that were going on. Let&#39;s see, 5.8 through 5.10
were pretty technical. 5.12 I think is a membership adjustment on the
new water authority. 5.13 this fixes I think some, I know the folks at
Moore County, I guess Representative ?? isn&#39;t here but, not only
Moore county but I think Franklin and some others there were some
counties that you wouldn&#39;t expect to be tier 3 counties for economic
development purposes, and this was a correction at least until we can
get it figured out for next year. We didn&#39;t want some counties that
were eligible for some programs, infrastructure programs, in the like to
suddenly not be eligible so we fixed that. 5.14 is technical. 5.15 was a
fix for an issue that came up with the unemployment insurance reserve so
we shifted some of the language around in terms of how their money
flowed and also gave state budget some budget flexibility to address a
financial concern that we think may come up in the spring, they&#39;ll
be able to fix that, should be able to fix that without any problem
until we get back. 5.16 was technical. 5.17 was interesting, the
Southeast

  <p>Accent or for those of you who are concerned about that one. We gave
them authority to do their horse barn, the horsey barn, but they have to
get the money. It’s not coming from us. They have to get the money.
We’ve also put a house insisted on having a provision in there to get
them moving toward full receipt support so they’re not reliant on the
state to stay in business. 6.1, injustice in public safety was
technical. 6.2, that some of you may have an interest in, this is
transferring some legal positions in the Department of Justice back to
the agencies. Some of you who were around like I was back in the 80’s, a
whole bunch of legal positions and agencies were swept up and sent to
the DOJ. There’s been a push to get those legal resources back into the
agencies to better serve the agencies, frankly. There was an agreement
reached between the attorney general and the administration on this. So
I believe it’s about 14 or so positions that are moving back to agencies
that they essentially serve now. 6.3 is regarding some provisions with
compensation for court reporters. 6.5, 6.6, 6.7 that’s mostly technical.
7.1 is basically a technical provision. 8.1 is in transportation. This a
delay in the expansion of the highway, tax based for six months. I think
that was needed for technical reasons as I recall in capital. 9.1  is
technical. 10.1 is the actual money piece of the southeast ?? center.
11.1, this gets into some finance sections. 11.1, 11.2, 11.3 there’s
some clarification on, basically these are just dealing with equity
issues in the tax reform bill that we passed that needed to be
corrected, some items that didn’t get addressed that have been
addressed. So that is the bill in summary about as quick as I can
summarize 70 some positions. I’d be happy to answer any questions if
you’re not asleep. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Wilkins, please
state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask if my classmate from Wake
would yield to a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar, does
the gentleman yield? The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I always
yield to the gentleman from ?? county. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Speaker/g and thank you Representative Dollar. Let me take you to page
two, section 1.5. I’m seeing the settlement reserve fund. My question
would be is that the landing place for money that formally went to
Golden Leaf? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I would request staff on the
floor...[SPEAKER CHANGES] Staff is available. [SPEAKER CHANGES] ....to
come up and advise me on that one, but the provision itself, I think
your asking about the underlying purpose of that. The technical
correction is just what you see there. The words for the next physical
year were taken out and the word revenue put in, so I guess you’re
asking wether that’s more of a permanent move...is that? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, if you would like to move to someone else and then
return to me that would be fine. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. I’m advised by
staff that that is purely technical. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry, I
didn’t hear that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If the gentleman will restate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Having consulted with staff it’s my understanding that
that provision in technical corrections is purely technical. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Wilkins, so that maybe you could get more
specific, if the staff would go to Representative Wilkins and give him a
specific answer. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] If you have any questions about the underlaying provision upon
which we’ve made a technical correction, if I don’t know the answer off
hand we can get staff to explain the underlaying provision which may be
what you’re interested in. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further
debate...

Representative Moore, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for a
motion and to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Members, in the interest of time, we asked Staff to prepare a
detailed summary and I think folks received that also on your dashboard.
If when you click to the thing, if you’ll click the key that says
related documents? You’ll see a house bill summary on that, on your
dashboard. Are there any members who are having trouble accessing that,
because I’ll try to go through this just as quickly as I can and not
take too much time on it. Members, this is a technical bill, just as it
is represented in the bill title. There is, and again if there’s any
questions that may be the best way to do it, but sections 1 through 17
were, excuse me 16, were purely technical. Just truly technical.
Starting at section 17, those are also technical, and again if you look
at the summary you’ll see, I give an example like section 18, and search
the missing subject from a clause in GS-28.2A12, as amended by session
law 2013 243 and confirm, and conforms the use of commas in the
subdivision as amended. This, I’m afraid this just really isn’t a very
interesting provision. But that’s what it is. So this would be a great
debate. Representative Floyd, we could talk about the ifs, whens, commas
and everything else. This is that bill, I guess. But it’s, there’s
really a lot of that in there. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore, I
believe Representative Floyd just seconded the motion to concur.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well that’s perfect then. So unless there’s any
questions, I’m going to stop because I know a lot of folks are ready to
go home. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not,
the question before the House is the motion to concur in the Senate
Committee Substitute number 2 for House Bill 92. All in favor vote Aye.
All opposed vote No. The clerk will open the vote. [PAUSE] The clerk
will lock the machine and record the vote. 98 having voted in the
affirmative, 2 in the negative, the House has concurred on the Senate
Committee Substitute number

  <p>??  The bill will be enrolled and sent to the Governor. House bill 652
the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senate committee substitute for House bill 652.  A
bill to be filed ?? and modified the law regarding discipline for
judges.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  To make a motion to concur and debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for a motion and to debate
the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mister Speaker you&#39;ve heard you send a
bill over to the Senate, you baby it and it grows up and it&#39;s
something else.  Well this is something else but in this case it was
with Representative Davis and my consent.  The Senate sent the same
provision over in a completely unrelated bill sponsored by
Representative Glazier and Representative Glazier didn&#39;t like this
unrelated bill and I thought that was bad form for the Senate to do that
and I insisted that they take that provision out of his bill and put it
in a separate bill because he had a very good bill that was a chief
priority for the ?? Bar Association and it needed to stand on it&#39;s
own but what this bill does if you look at your committee summary
because it is a good bill separately.  It removes, it relates the
judicial standards commission and discipline of judges, it removes the
power of this commission to issue public recommends to a judge and puts
that authority with the Supreme Court.  The commission still recommends
but it goes to the Supreme Court for a public reprimand and you can
imagine that was already the case with censure, removal or expulsion but
a public reprimand of a judge is pretty severe to their career and all
those records remain confidential until it&#39;s done, in which case
then they&#39;re all opened up.  The final section of the bill repeals
7A-378 and the bill doesn&#39;t say what that is so I&#39;ll tell you
what it is.  It&#39;s that part that says how do we get rid of or
discipline s Supreme Court Justice and it puts that power in the court
of appeals.  Now just think about that for a minute.  We have the House
of Representatives and then across the way is the inferior body, the
upper body, well, the other body and it would be like saying the State
Senate would have the power to expel a member of the House of
Representatives or the House of Representatives, this might be more
popular, the power to get rid of one or two Senators.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  All in favor vote aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  It&#39;s just not appropriate and we expelled Thomas
Wright three or four years ago and there were a couple of other people
who did bad things and who knows what would have happened to them if
they didn&#39;t resigned.  So we know how to discipline our members and
frankly we&#39;re probably more embarrassed by their conduct than
somebody else.  So this just treats discipline of Supreme Court Justices
the same way as the discipline of any other Judge in the system.
Ultimately if it&#39;s other than a private reprimand it goes to the
Supreme Court and of course the Justice in question would not be able to
participate. So I recommend it to you.  It&#39;s in it&#39;s own bill
now.  It&#39;s not cluttered up with domestic relations law and I ask
you to vote yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Glazier please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  To debate the bill Mister Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill, the
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mister Speaker and Representative Stam and
I really do appreciate Representative Stam and Representative Stevens
Representative Davis and other who we worked tirelessly for several
weeks to get these bills just disconnected and it was finally done.  But
Representative Stam in talking about this bill has classically created a
silk purse out a sow&#39;s ear.  This bill and one of the reasons we
disconnected it was awful when it was presented and it was awful when
the Senate defeated it two nights ago 26 to 9. Like many skeletons I
guess it is near Halloween, it&#39;s reemerged from the grave and now
its back but you should know this exact bill was defeated by the Senate
26 to 9 the other night and let me tell you what it does and let me tell
you who&#39;s opposed and let me tell you why it&#39;s here

  <p>There’s really no reason we should be going into this on this floor, but
it’s here and people ought to have a right and the public ought to have
a right to know why it’s here. Number one what it does is two things.
We’ve set up in this state the Judicial Standards Commission to review
misconduct or alleged misconduct by all of our judges, and it has
functioned very well. And the rules of the Judicial Standards
Commission, partially the commission being setup by the legislature, but
the rules have been setup by the courts themselves, and the people who
passed on these rules including the amended rules in 2006 or 7 were
unanimously, unanimously. All of the present at the time Court of
Appeals and Supreme Court justices, all of them voted for these rules.
The rules provide one option to the commission, and it’s a good one and
mirrors what we do here, which is sometimes judges have made errors. But
they don’t need to be dragged through the mud in public. Much as
sometimes we may make errors and our Ethics Commission, Ethics Committee
has the opportunity to talk with members and issue a private reprimand
as opposed to ordering a full hearing in public for censure or
otherwise, and so judicial standards uses that and has reprimanded
privately a number of judges over the years. Judge has to consent to
that. If they want a full hearing they get a full hearing in public, but
if they don’t it is resolved that way. This removes the power of the
Judicial Standards Commission to issue a public reprimand. Still private
concept exists, but the public reprimand would be the next step up where
the judge says I don’t want a hearing. I don’t want to go through
everything. I accept the discipline. Make note of it in public, and
let’s move on. That even serves the public interest because now the
public knows there’s been an issue with the judge, but it’s been
resolved. As disciplines occur, the remedy is there. Let’s move on and
the public of the next election cycle can take that into account. This
removes the power of judicial standards to make that negotiation and do
that, and instead it sends it on. That makes no sense, and every justice
and judge voted for the standard that exists. I received the date that
this was tacked on to Representative Stevens and my bill, our bill, the
House Bill, in the Senate without notice to anyone. From Chief Judge
Marin on the Court of Appeals, and from Chief Justice Parker of the
Supreme Court, both of whom sent letters. Chief Judge Martin’s a long
letter because he heads review of this standards commission, vehemently
opposing this bill and provisions which have never come out of any
discussion of the court, never come out of any discussion of judicial
standards, and there has been no discussion as we know in any committee
including the judiciary committee over here on this. And yet we’re
proposing to change in this bill. Again a bill that the Senate defeated
two nights ago. This commission, standards. The second part of the bill
is even more scurrilous. Here, the justices had agreed several years ago
that it didn’t make sense for an appearance of propriety. Also given the
experience of what happened recently a couple of years ago at the
Wisconsin Supreme Court nor based on some recent United States Supreme
Court decisions that if there was a question about ethics or criminality
on the part of a Supreme Court justice that the Supreme Court Justice
colleagues themselves would have to vote on that. And that instead it
made sense that the six senior Court of Appeals judges which are a mix
of both parties would sit and review what happened. Now mind you there
has never been a discipline by this group of any sitting Supreme Court
justice. So there was no issue about or concerns about what had happened
in a previous case. There were no issues of someone raising a concern
about what they’d voted on because as I said the Court has never
discussed this. They all had voted for the process a few years ago, and
all of a sudden this emerges. If you want we can

  <p>Talk about the three page letter from Chief Judge Martin, or the letter
from Chief Justice Parker, but they oppose this as well. Very
definitively. What happened in Wisconsin ought to give us a clue why we
don’t want to do this. What happened in Wisconsin is they got in a back
and forth between the justices and one of the justices who believed they
were being unfairly voted on by their fellow justices engaged in a
heated conversation in the courtroom chambers with the other and they
got in a fist fight. Now talk about what happens to the integrity of
your court system when the justices’ anger at each other spills over in
that way. That’s why we don’t want to change. So why is it here? But we
can only speculate. Since this bill has been brought forward, speculate
I will. Some justices may fear that there will be a recusal motion or a
disciplinary hearing filed against them in the next year, or potential
candidates for justice having a complaint filed against them, and they
don’t want the bipartisan court of appeals panel to hear the case. They
want their own colleagues on the Supreme Court to do it, figuring
they’ll get a better deal that way. That is what’s going on here. And if
we pass this, we are a party to that process. This legislature should
never be involved in this. It is not a request of the court of appeals.
It is not a request of judicial standards. It is not a request of the
Supreme Court. It is not a request of the Bar Association. It has never
been reviewed by the courts. It has never been reviewed by the Bar. It
has never been reviewed by a judiciary committee over here, by us. And
we are engaging, if we do this, in a plot in my mind to cover up
potential claims against either sitting or soon-to-be in their minds
sitting justices and this is wrong on every level. With that, Mr.
Speaker, I’d like to be heard on a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr.
Speaker, I would move given that that this matter be referred to a
judiciary committee, and I [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry, the gentleman
wants to be recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that this bill be referred to a judiciary
committee, Judiciary B, for the remainder of this session to be reviewed
and come back in the short session with a recommendation. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Daughtry, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I did not know this bill was coming up and I had
heard that the bill was defeated in the Senate and so I haven’t really
had an opportunity to look at it but it is a change in public policy. It
changes the way we discipline our judges and I support the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would oppose the motion. Representative Glazier said
a few things that just really, he said it was defeated in the Senate.
Two nights ago. Actually that was early last week. And they
reconsidered. It was in rules. It passed rules committee over there
which they treat like a judiciary committee, unfortunately. And the
question is, did Thomas Wright get better, get some just, get some
better deal because the House dealt with him, Representative Glazier?
That’s rhetorical. Of course not. We got rid of him because he was an
embarrassment to this House. But the key thing to remember is what
Representative Glazier said at the beginning of his remarks. And that is
the Judicial Standards Commission can use this threat of a public
reprimand as a negotiating tool to force judges into agreeing to other
discipline. And it’s just not right. The Supreme Court should do it. You
wouldn’t tolerate it in this House, if you gave the power to the Senate
to discipline you. The Senate wouldn’t tolerate it if the, if we gave
this power to this House, to discipline Senators. It’s just not
appropriate. And you know, this is the last

  <p>today, I&#39;m sorry it hadn&#39;t been to a committee over here. Just
for example, Representative Daughtry, we got an excellent amendment that
Representative Daughtry proposed yesterday. The Senate passed it
although it had never been to a Senate committee. This is what you do on
the last day. I ask you to oppose the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentleman, we are on the motion to re-refer Representative
Grier Martin, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Members, let&#39;s be clear about what
this motion is. The motion&#39;s not to table the bill, it&#39;s not to
kill it. It&#39;s just to make sure that it goes to a judiciary
committee. A committee made up of folks that are used to, and, in fact,
have as their mission, to deal with exactly this sort of issue.
There&#39;s no urgency to do this on the last day of session. Or at
least no urgency that I&#39;m aware of. So let&#39;s send it to the
committee that we have set up, that we&#39;ve established in our rules
to consider and deal with this sort of issue to ensure we in the House
do rubber stamp what the Senate sends over to us in the waning hours of
session. I think Representative Daughtry, the gentleman from Johnston
has made an excellent point about what we need to do.
While I agree with Representative Stam&#39;s points about the ability of
the House of Representatives in the legislative branch to deal with its
own members, we&#39;re talking about a completely distinct branch of
government - Judicial branch. They need to have, being a different
branch of government with a different mission, a different way of
dealing with things. For those of you who were here for the Thomas
Wright matter, you&#39;ll remember that once it got past a certain point
out of our legislative ethics commission, it was a completely open and
transparent process. Meaning that even as we, the House, discipline one
of our own members, it was open for all the people of North Carolina to
see. The process that this bill here would set up in the Judicial branch
is the exact opposite of that. The bulk of it would be behind closed
doors. Not subject to the scrutiny of the people of North Carolina.
It&#39;s not a direction that I think we need to go in, but if we do
need to go in that very dangerous direction, again, it needs to go to a
committee of the House set up to deal with exactly this sort of matter.
So I agree with Representative Daughtry that we need to support this
motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To ask Representative Stam a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. What concerns me is the fact that we&#39;ve got all of our
courts who are not in favor of this. It&#39;s basically been said
we&#39;ve gotten letters and I understand that everywhere along the line
there is bi-partisan...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is not the case of these two Justice - Chief Justice Parker&#39;s
opposed, Chief Judge Martin&#39;s opposed, who chairs the judicial
standards commission, but it is not true that a majority of the Supreme
Court is opposed to this. A majority of the Supreme Court is in favor of
this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Representative Stam will yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There are going to be several, I apologize. Representative Stam, you
agree with me that there was a long letter received from Chief Judge
Martin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I haven&#39;t seen it, but I hear you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And from Chief Justice Parker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? but I hear you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You yield? My second question is, has there been any information given
to you that the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals have met as a
court, discussed this bill, and in any way, in any way, given its
support to this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not that they&#39;ve met as a court for that purpose. Or for the
contrary purpose. I understand there&#39;s two letters from two Judicial
officials that you have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And third. Do you have any letter?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
From any Judge or Justice in support of this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jordan, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, as one of the co-chairs of judiciary
committee, I would recommend we vote no on this motion. Thank you.

Representative Moore, please state your purpose.

  <p>this bill at this point. My understanding is four justices on the State
Supreme Court want this to pass. I believe Justice Newby and Justice
Martin support it, Mr. Starling was confirming that, he talked with
them. Members, I would ask for you all to vote no at this point on the
motion to re-refer the bill. It&#39;s here on the calendar and I want to
correct one bit of information. This bill did not fail in the Senate.
The first vote did, but then they reconsidered it. We do that
occasionally. We had a bill the other day, a conference report that we
reconsidered. That came out, came in and it passed. I don&#39;t remember
what the final number was, I think it may have been a party line vote
with Republicans voting for it and Democrats voting against it.
Regardless, this bill is here on the last day of session. It would seem
to be the courteous thing to do to not send it back to the committee to
kill it, but to go ahead and act on it. Again, my understanding gives a
majority of the Justices of the Supreme Court have asked for this bill.
I would ask you to vote no on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, upon the motion the gentleman from Caldwell
County, Representative Starnes, I&#39;m sure is happy to extend the
courtesies of the gallery to Debrorah Ashley and the Caldwell County
Leadership group. They&#39;re over here to my left in the blue shirts.
Please stand and let us welcome you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Martin, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would the rules committee chair yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Speaker and thank you Representative Moore. Representative
Moore we passed our adjournment resolution in the wee hours last night
and I&#39;ve been barely awake for a couple hours. Does it contain a
provision that has this body returning to session next year?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It does. And if the gentlemen is getting at would the bill be eligible
next year, the answer is yes. But it would purposes, for this long
session, kill the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, would the gentlemen yield to a follow up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;ll yield to all questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields to all question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Perhaps he and I have a different understanding of the words kill and
death. Would he agree that the bill would be alive and eligible for
consideration and passage in the short session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, would you like to redirect to Representative
Bells?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, he is the expert on death. We do have an undertaker on the floor
who can answer questions about death...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? my jobs bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah exactly. Well, Representative Martin, we&#39;ve seen a lot of bills
rise from the dead and bills we thought were doing great suddenly find
themselves on life support so we can argue the semantics of that all day
long. I think that we would agree that if we don&#39;t act on it today
for the purposes of long session, it would not be passed. Whether we
call it dead, alive, whatever, I think we can at least agree
procedurally where it would be.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, what we have
to look at with this bill we have in front of us is the underlying
policy. I agree. I wish we had the time to send the bill to the
committee to have a thorough hearing. Representative Daughtry is right,
it has not been through the House Judiciary Committee, but we just
received the bill late last night and the Senate has gone home. What
would happen if this bill went to the Judiciary Committee. The members
of that committee would examine the bill very thoroughly. They would
look at it from top to bottom and in the end, they would come to the
conclusion that this is a good bill just exactly the way its written.
They would send it back to the floor and we would have it in its exact
same form right now today. Yes, it should have gone to the J committee,
but we didn&#39;t have the time. What we have in front of us is a bill
that is good. I urge every member to please support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, should this motion pass, it is
intended the chair have a judiciary committee today before we leave.
Representative Larry Hall please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate the majority leader&#39;s ability
to forecast the future of the judiciary committee and the actions they
would take. I think the record probably show that most bills that have
come through have, in fact, been improved through the process of
examination and especially one like this. This is a policy change.
It&#39;s something we don&#39;t have to do today. If we had adjourned
last night, I doubt this bill would have been reached. We know that....

  <p>actual need for it before the short session does not exist. Again,
I&#39;d ask that we respect the institution we have, respect the process
we have. This, again, is a matter that can wait. There&#39;s been no
public outcry for it. There&#39;s been no example shown where
there&#39;s a need for us to make this change. As a matter of fact, the
folks involved at the highest levels have said in the past, this is the
way they wanted to continue to do business. It has served the public
well up to this point. Again, we don&#39;t have any instance where
someone can show that there is a need for this bill to come forward or
where the authority had been misused that we currently have. So I ask
that you support the motion to re-refer. And even in that event that we
give it a real hearing when we have in Judiciary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak a second time to the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Members, as interested in the
discussion earlier on about Thomas Wright. I was the chairman of that
committee to impeach a member of my own party and I sat through that and
I did my duty. And thought he did the right thing. I don&#39;t want to
have any lectures from the minority speaker pro tem about Thomas Write
or making comparisons. That was the worst couple of months of our lives
in this public service. There is a distinction. Number one, we set up
the rules for how we governed our own misconduct. We are not giving the
Judiciary the same consideration. Their body voted unanimously several
years ago for these rules. They have never met to reconsider these
rules. The Courts have never met to reconsider these rules. There has
never been a problem that has been bought to the public or this body
about anything happening with these rules. This is a pure matter of
ethics and credibility of this institution. You can vote the politics of
it if you choose. Or we can join together and say there is a time and a
place and you can not set up the strawman, well it&#39;s late in the
session and the bill came over and we don&#39;t have a choice, when that
was the whole purpose, that it came over late in the session. This is a
bill about the integrity of the Judicial system of the state of North
Carolina. We owe a higher obligation to ourselves and our state than the
politics of our  party, either of us. I can speak from great experience
there...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hanes please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Representative Glazier would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier, I&#39;m going to be late getting home to let my
dog out to use the bathroom so I might as well ask this question now.
Would you clarify which Martin you were discussing when you said they
opposed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chief Judge Martin of the Court of Appeals was the one that wrote the
letter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The first name of that Judge Martin?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chief Judge Martin of the Court of Appeals sent us the letter opposing
and then Chief Justice Parker of the Supreme Court sent us a letter
opposing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One more time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield? The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The first name of the Judge Martin that you referred to please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I believe it&#39;s John. It&#39;s Chief Judge Martin of the Court of
Appeals.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do. And not Mart Martin. Mart Martin&#39;s on the Supreme Court.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I understand that. Just wanted to make sure there&#39;s no confusion
with the body which Martin you&#39;re discussing.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I am. I go back to my point. This bill, whether there is merit or not,
it can be decided after a study by all of us and after we hear from the
Court, the Judicial Standards Commission that we&#39;re getting ready to
change and the Bar Association. I cannot, for any understanding,
understand why we would want to do this today. I would urge adoption of
the motion before us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The question before the House is the motion to re-refer the Senate
committee substitute to House Bill 652 to Judiciary Subcommittee B. All

please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Representative Stam would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, down on lines 13, I think it&#39;s the third page
in A5. There&#39;s some changes in there that make some of the
information on the proceedings confidential that in the past were not
confidential. I noticed in A6 there&#39;s a, it looks there&#39;s a
provision there that would make information not confidential if a
particular action is taken, if I&#39;m interpreting that correctly, but
can you - maybe you said it earlier and I just missed it. I&#39;m always
curious when we&#39;re changing, making things that were not
confidential in the past that public had access to and knowledge of and
saying we&#39;re going to hide that from the public. Can you explain how
this is operating differently from what had to do?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah. This relates to the public reprimand, not to the other remedies.
In the case of a public reprimand, it all becomes no longer
confidential, the entire record become not confidential if a public
reprimand is issued. But if a public reprimand is not issued, then it
remains confidential. We have judges all over the state who are accused
of things all the time and a lot of times its because a person, well,
they should appeal a ruling a law, but they think it&#39;s an ethics
question as opposed to a legal question. You want to have some things
confidential, just like in our legislative ethics committee, things are
confidential up to a point, but then they become public at a certain
other point.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does this mean that as a practical matter, you can have a judge that
maybe was five yards off-sides and the folks bring him in and say
we&#39;re going to give you a private reprimand, you better not do this
again. In the past, that might have been available for review, but would
not be available now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, Representative Dollar. I think for a private reprimand, that&#39;s
not changed, unless I&#39;m misreading it that it was already
confidential and remains confidential for a private reprimand. The
change here is for public reprimands.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I realize that this is a tough one, particularly considering the hour
and circumstance. The part that I&#39;m still having some difficulty
with is information that in the past, was not confidential that is now
becoming confidential. In my view, I think we want to have this
information continue to be out in the public domain for people to know
that they can continue to have the highest confidence in their judges,
because judges have tremendous power. I just have some serious concerns
about that practical impact of what we&#39;re doing despite the
assurances.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak a second and last time on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion a second time.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, for five years I co-chaired the
legislative ethics committee. When we were putting in place following
several years under a former Speaker of the House who had never let the
ethics...

  <p>committee meet for a number of years. And we had a lot of things to
clean up and we did it with Representative Stam&#39;s help actually in a
bipartisan way. And the ethics committee I sat on went after far more
democrats than it did republicans. And that wasn&#39;t easy but it was
utterly the right thing to do. And we have a bill here today that&#39;s
being proffered by several folks and not in this chamber, that is
attempting to do the exact reverse. To protect members seeking or in
judicial positions, who are republicans, from having their cases heard
in an appropriate manner. I don&#39;t know whether those cases will turn
one way or another. It is irrelevant. But, I know that the process ought
to be fair and it ought to be public where it needs to be. It ought to
be transparent and we ought not be doing this and everyone of you know
it as well. I been asked and I guess I could start naming names and
I&#39;m sure the press will ask and I may well answer to the press. But,
the dignity of this floor is about the integrity of this process and the
bill, not a particular justice and not particular candidate. And so as
much as I would want to, I will hold that but I will not hold it later.
This bill should be defeated. I had hoped it would be sent to committee
where everybody could talk about it, but it&#39;s not. This bill should
be defeated out of respect, self respect, humility, one or the other or
both. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Avila, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. To ask Representative Stam one
more question please? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam, does the
gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Representative Stam, I&#39;m having the same problem that Representative
Dollar has because I&#39;m seein in A five, we&#39;re goin to, are not
confidential, to confidential, but in A six, it becomes not confidential
again. So, can you explain what we&#39;re dong in A five and then A six?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. And it&#39;s, Representative Avila, it&#39;s very
similar to what we do at the lege, well, I, I formally chair the
legislative ethics commission and server with Representative Glazier for
many years. At a certain point, even though information is gathered
confidentia, confidentially, at a certain point when you take certain
action, all that you gathered s no longer confidential and that&#39;s on
line thirty-three. All the skeletons are there and exposed to the world.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask Representative Stam a question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Stam, does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You know, Stam, because of all the
questioning I&#39;ve been reading through, reading and re-reading and
re-reading through that same section, it looks like to me what
you&#39;re saying, I just want to make sure I understand it, is that, if
somebody brings charges and investigation done as so forth and the
commission finds that the charges really don&#39;t, are not, either are
not well founded or the error is not egregious enough to require public
reprimand, then it remains a private issue. But if it is large enough to
require a public reprimand then obviously the knowledge is public. Is
that, is that basically what it&#39;s sayin? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Right.
And the same thing we do for the member of this House. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
 The question before the House is the motion to concur in Senate
committee substitute for House bill six fifty-two. All in favor vote
aye. All opposed vote no. The floor float from the vote. The clerk will
out machine record the vote. Fifty-two have voted in the affirmative and
forty-eight in the negative. The motion to concur has, [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Torbett, please state your

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
See if Rep. Moffitt would yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Moffitt, is this the bill that yesterday we discussed at some
length and had a lot of issues that came over from the Senate that were
not very clear as to what extent we had debated them in the House?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Luebke, I think that could be said about a lot of things that have
come to us from the Senate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does this bill not just have a lot of features in it that in terms of
environmental policy are very very risky to our state and that we ought
to take more time to consider?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Everything has been through a committee that&#39;s in the spill, so I
would urge the body&#39;s support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Jackson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Luebke, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Rep. Moffitt a question.

Rep. Moffitt, does the gentleman yield?

  <p>[0:00:00.0]
…I’m told here that the Compliance Boundary Loophole was not discussed
in a committee here and just came over from the Senate un-discussed by a
committee in this house, can you confirm that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luke that’s on the House Bill 94 portion of the bill that
I represented the Senate Bill 112 part of House Bill 74 I would refer
that question perhaps Representative Samuelson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you would…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson does the lady yell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, my question Representative Samuelson is about the process and the
fact that when we debated this yesterday there were references to issue
in the bill that had not been seen before by house committee and one of
them is the Compliance Boundary Loophole and the other were the changes
regarding landfills and I’m just like you to confirm if you would that
is the case.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I won’t confirm it because it’s not exactly the case on the Senate side
they had debate there and the committee that would had discussed here
would have been the conference committee, the conferee committee did
discuss the compliance boundaries on the landfills that was a different
section I have prefer that to Representative McElraft that I was
involved in conversations on the Compliance Boundary and it was the
conference committee and then I explained it and went over it on the
floor yesterday.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But Representative Samuelson it did not go to a sustentative committee
in which the public was present, the media was present etcetera.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not on the house side.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That was a house and this is an example of in the 11th hour major
changes being made, we heard them reported yesterday but we did not hear
clearly reported that at least two major parts of this bill that a
landfill changes which could affect your community and then of the
Compliance Boundary Loophole that they did not in fact go through a
house substantive committee where there could be debate. I think we have
talked before about process and these are two major points and we should
not move forward to accept the conference report when we have two parts
of the bill that have never been discussed by our House Committee and I
urge you not to support the conference report, vote no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate? If not the question before the house
is the motion to adopt the conference report for House Bill 74. All in
favor vote aye, all oppose vote no, the clerk will open the vote.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] To the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the
House of Representatives conference report to Resolve Differences
between Senate and House of Representatives on Senate Bill 317, a bill
to be entitled An Act to Reduce in Size of the Guilford County Board of
Education from Eleven to Nine Members, Establish Revised District
Guilford County Board of Education Subject to Referendum to Provide for
Partisan Elections for that Board, in District Stanley County Board of
Commissioners, Stanley County Board of Education, the conferees
recommend the Senate and the House of Representatives to adopt this
report. Conferees for the Senate, Senator Wade, Chair, Senators Rucho
and Tillman, Conferees for the House of Representatives, Representative
Hardister, Chair, Representative Blust, Faircloth and Burr.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hardister, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Make a motion, debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for a motion and to debate
the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You may recall we had a debate
on this bill yesterday and it passed this chamber and went to the
Senate. They objected. We went to conference yesterday evening. And
essentially, what we&#39;ve decided to do is to align the Board of
Education districts in Guilford County with the Board of Commissioner
districts and we would delay the implementation of the new maps to 2016
in order to prevent existing members of the board from being double
bumped. And we would keep the Board of Education terms at four years and
stagger them to match the Board of Commissioners.
You may recall there was some debate on partisan elections of the House
PCS would have put that through referendum and conference. We agreed to
the Senate. The Senate wanted to, we agreed with the Senate on where
they wanted to go. They wanted to go straight to partisan elections. In
the House, we preferred to just go to referendum, but we reluctantly
agreed. If you looked a the progress of this bill, the Senate has
compromised with us, much more than we compromised with them. But,
personally, I support partisan elections that would have preferred to
put this referendum, but I think this is a good compromise and I&#39;ll
speak to that briefly.
I know that there&#39;s some disagreement on the merit of partisan
elections, but the way I see it, is it provides more information to
voters. I think that beneath the surface, these elections are partisan.
The political parties tend to get behind their candidates even if the
party affiliations are not on the ballot. Special interest groups get
behind the candidates. I think it would likely increase voter
participation.
I&#39;d also point out that in consultation with staff, it&#39;s 16
local board of education and local boards of education in North Carolina
do have partisan elections. Also, the superintendent of public
instruction, North Carolina runs on a partisan ticket. So I think this
is sensible. I think this is going to work good for Guilford County.
Again, this bill also relates to Stanley County. If you have any
questions on that, you can perhaps ask Representative Justin Burr to
yield. And with that, I&#39;ll be glad to take questions and I would
appreciate your support on this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Adams? Please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To speak briefly on the
conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It&#39;s actually worse than
it was. We&#39;re now saying that the citizens will not have an
opportunity to even vote on the partisan part. We don&#39;t need
partisan elections in Guilford County. And we don&#39;t need to
compromise with the Senate in this way. This is not, and I just regret
that the Representative compromised in that way. I certainly didn&#39;t
hear anything about it until today. It&#39;s no better than it was when
it left here. We should not pass this. Guilford County does not want it.
There may be a few people that the Representative spoke to who wants it,
but that does not consist of the majority of the people in the county
who should have an opportunity, first of all, to have had some input in
this in the first place. School board still opposed to it. They voted
against it.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill very briefly.

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Here we go again guys, and we get another bill that
the civic lessons does not teach us what it is about in terms of what we
do in the House and the Senate. And so I guess we’ll just have to
engross into our civic textbook that it is the Senate that gets the role
the House instead of us standing to our principles and making sure we do
what we know is right. Please vote no on this bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Harrison, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Briefly debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady’s recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
House, I don’t want to drag this out, but as it’s been pointed out the
school board’s unanimously opposed. We had a Republican member of the
school board come down to the lunch and law meeting and talk about how
bad this was going to be for the school board, that we have to be
focused on the interest of the children and not on party politics. And
she worried what a bipartisan election might do for the school board and
its policies, and one of the strongest board members is an unaffiliate
which is going to be sort of impossible to replicate now that we go on
to partisan elections. I urge you to vote no. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. If not the
question before the House is the adoption of the conference report for
Senate Bill 317. All in favor vote aye. All opposed vote no. The clerk
will open the vote. All members please check your vote. The clerk will
allot the machine record the vote. 63 having voted in the affirmative,
37 in the negative. The House has adopted the conference report for
Senate Bill 317. The Senate will be so notified. House Bill 725, the
clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Committee substitute for number 2 for House Bill 725,
the bill’s been titled an act to establish juvenile jurisdiction adviser
committee to create and pilot civil citation process for juveniles and
to raise the age of juvenile jurisdiction to include 16, 17 year olds
who have committed misdemeanor offenses. General Assembly of North
Carolina next.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Avila, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen. I
would like to ask that if you have questions if you wouldn’t mind hold
them till I finish my presentation. They may be taken care of at a later
point. Thank you for this hearing on a bill that’s been around for quite
some time, and many of you are familiar with it, in various forms. This
one is different, and the difference primarily is the fact that we have
compromised quite a bit in being able to move this forward for the youth
in the state of North Carolina. This bill will only cover misdemeanors,
16 and 17 year olds. If you will start looking through the bill, we’ll
take it by degrees, and I’d ask first of all that you pay close
attention to the juvenile jurisdiction advisory committee that is being
established, that will be in charge of the review study recommendations
from this point forward in the implementation of House Bill 725. The
first thing we’re asking them to do is to establish a subcommittee to
study civil citations in order for us to do a pilot here in the state of
North Carolina. The civil citations cover a broad range of different
types of programs that deal with the intake and disciplination of the
juveniles once they have committed an offense. The implementation for
the actual change in age is six years out to 2019, and one of the
reasons we’ve done that and one of the concerns that has been paramount
in peoples’ mind is this will be an expensive proposition. And that is
true because we’re changing and adding because of a system that’s been
cut and cut over the years and to be able to introduce new juveniles
into the system we’re going to have to rebuild it to a certain extent.
And for that reason in the year 2017 and two years before the actual
implementation, we have requested this advisory committee that’s made up
of the people that will actually be in charge of the implementation, and
the money for it is coming out of their budget. They will report back to
the General Assembly with a detailed plan of how we want to make this
change in our juvenile justice system and include in that the cost that
will be necessary to put that plan into practice. That plan will then be
presented to the General Assembly for us to take action on in terms of
will the plan work, is it good, and

  <p>More significantly for many of us in here, can we afford to pay for it?
That is the stop measure that I felt like was necessary. Because I have
vowed from the first day I took this project to own, that I would not
ask that it be implemented if it could not be funded correctly. And,
lest you think that North Carolina that is starting down some radical
rash path, we are only one of two states that still puts 16 nd 17 year
olds in the adult court system. 48 states recognize 16 and 17 year olds
as juveniles. 38 of those states actually recognize their misdemeanonts
as well as their felons as juveniles and treat them accordingly. A
couple of states I can give you recently is Connecticut. They took it in
a measured step, just as we’re planning to do. Their first step was
their 16 yr olds, but they included misdemeanonts and felons. That was
successful. Their plans came in under budget, and they made the decision
to move to the 17 yr olds. In just this past July 8th, the state of
Illinois added their 17 yr old felons to their juvenile system. The
system, in doing this, must work because I cannot see that if it’s a
failure and if it’s not successful that states would continue to move
forward in their plans of moving 16 and 17yr old from their adult system
to the juvenile system. In committee we’ve had a lot of  issues, and
this has been studied in committee. Contrary to a lot of the complaints
around here, this has been studied “out the whazoo” for a cliché kind of
a talk. We’ve talked about it in a governor’s crime commission study.
We’ve put up a youth accountability task force that studied it and came
out with recommendations which has led to the progression we have
reached at this point which has led to the legislation before you. The
bureau institute of justice did a study of our North Carolina system in
2011 and all of them have reached the conclusion that it’s the best way
to go. Contrary to the horror of it being expensive, it is a savings.
It’s not always in tangible ways, but it is a savings. One of the
reasons is just simply a recidivism rate. I can give you a quote. It
said, “Conclusions from a centers for disease control and prevention
task force suggest that recidivism rates for youths who have been sent
through the adult system are far far higher than those of similar youths
who remain in the juvenile system. Through a comprehensive review of
every published or government conducted study on transfer policies, the
CDC found that the youth was %34 more likely to be re-arrested after
going through the adult system.” Everybody talks about the cost. Here
again this bureau reports states, “In 2011 the bureau institute of
justice performed a cost benefit analysis of North Carolina’s proposed
plan to raise the age of juvenile jurisdiction from 16 to 18. Concluding
that the economic benefits of the plan to raise juvenile jurisdiction in
North Carolina outweighed the economic cost.” And lest any of you brush
this off as the results of some soft on crime liberal research, I placed
on you desk (I think it was either yesterday or the day before
yesterday. I’m totally confused on the days here) a spotlight from that
other bastion of liberal think our local John Locke Foundation. They in
fact referenced that study in their spotlight article. Stating, “the
2011 study estimated that raising the age of juvenile jurisdiction from
16 to 18 for those charged with misdemeanors, and at one point low level
felonies was included. They’re no longer including those as I said.
Re-state it again: only midemeanonts. This would generate 52.3 million
dollars in net benefits for North Carolina. But, here’s what’s critical:
that number factors in the combined perspectives of tax payers, victims,
and young offenders. Leven said, “these net benefits include savings to
taxpayers and reductions in the human cost…

  <p>crime, such as lost or  damaged property, medical costs, and pain and
suffering. In addition to avoided costs to victims, the state would
benefit form an increased rate of employment and earnings from formerly
troubled young people who do not end up saddled with a lifetime adult
crime record. The &quot;Levin&quot;  that was quoted in this article is
Mark Levin, and Mark Levin is the director of the center for effective
justice at the Texas Public Policy Foundation. And that name may be
familiar to a lot of you, because the Texas Public Policy Foundation was
instrumental in the movement that North Carolina made in our justice
reinvestment act of 2011. Ladies and gentlemen, we worry about the cost.
But we&#39;re paying and we&#39;re paying dearly for these juveniles. An
example is actually a requirement from our own justice reinvestment act,
which states it requires most misdemeanors to serve their sentences in
jail. The new law requires that all felony sentences and misdemeanor
sentences require a confinement of more than 180 days be served in DOC.
The law retains the rule that sentences of 90 days or less should be to
the local jail. The law establishes a new program for misdemeanants
other than impaired drivers, the statewide misdemeanor confinement
program, administered by the North Carolina Sherriff&#39;s Association.
The Sherriff&#39;s Association will place covered inmates in jails that
have volunteered space for the program. The cost of housing and caring
for covered misdemeanants will be paid by a statewide fund pursuant to
the terms of a contract between DOC and the Sherriff&#39;s association.
Yesterday a request was made for a fiscal note, and a fiscal note has
been turned in, and as everybody knows, there&#39;s no impact for the
first 5 years. There will be an impact, and I&#39;m not going to cover
it up or try to hide the fact that it may be significant. But we&#39;re
already paying, as I&#39;ve already said in the examples. In North
Carolina,  Mecklinburg county in 2012, they payed $659,243 for 16 and 17
year olds, a total of I think it was 680 16 and 17 year olds who were
sitting in jail waiting for their trial. Durham county, in that same
year encouraged $265,588.64 in expenses. Two counties, in one year, a
million dollars. That&#39;s a million dollars that should be in the
credit column for this cost, the program and there is no telling how
much more that we could add as far as the money that we can save. These
kids are sitting in jail, and they&#39;re cut off from their families
and their education, in many cases unfortunately.
The data shows, and I think all of you in here knows how critical data
is to me, and for that reason I would like to thank Rep. Daughtry for a
handout that he sent out. It&#39;s a section from the North Carolina
department of Public Safety, division of Juvinile Justice 2011 annual
report, in which it states for those of you who do not have copies, that
for the fifth consecutive year, the juvinile delinquency rate, juvinile
crime in the state of North Carolina has decreased. Over that 5 year
period, the state has experienced a 28% decrease in juvenile
delinquency. This alone is a great achievement, but when one considers
that at the same time, the courts have been committting fewer and fewer
youths to long term stays at the division of juvinile justice&#39;s
youth development centers, these numbers are truly exciting
accomplishments. Last year, only 307 youth were committed to youth
development centers. This is th lowest level ever recorded and
represents a 14% decrease from the year before. Over the last decade,
commitments have dropped almost every year and since 2000 they&#39;ve
dropped about 670 committments, or 69% overall. These 2 tremendous
accomplishments, reducing

…Crime and reducing juvenile commitments. Our achievements that can
enlarge measure be attributed to the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 1999
and to the hard work of the carrying and competent juvenile justice
professionals in the division of juvenile justice and their community
partners. Ladies and gentlemen the argument has been made we need to
move our juvenile to assistant networks and I ask for your support on
this bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What purpose does the gentleman from Wake Representative Stam rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker and members of house I don’t really think this is a matter
of money but it doesn’t save money. If you look at your fiscal note when
it goes into operation it will be 17 million the first year, 63 million
after that in four years what it does is set the assembly on automatic
pilot so it would take another act to the assembly to avoid those costs
but if it’s a good policy I will be willing to pay that much but it’s
not good policy. We all want transparency the matter of fact the last
bill 652…The bill we have passed recently 48 people voted against it
because of transparency concerns and I’m sure the people who voted for
the transparency concerns but let me tell you what this bill does to
transparency because there are couple of features about Juvenile Court
that you need to know, one is that there is no transparency it’s all
confidential, it’s confidential for allegations of sexual battery
assaults on handicap persons, assaults inflicting serious injury,
assault choosing the deadly weapon, assault on a female, assault on
children under 12, assault on the state officers employees, assaults on
inflicting serious injury, assaults choosing the deadly weapon in the
presence of a minor, assaults by pointing the gun, taking in these
celebrities with students, yeah that allow to come confidential, the
public won’t know about it. Those are serious that we call things
misdemeanors and it sounds little but misdemeanors also includes serious
things. There is another feature of Juvenile Court that you need to know
and that is if you are innocent you don’t wanna be in Juvenile Court,
there is an entire different model in Juvenile Court, it’s how can we
fix your problem whether you are guilty or not? Now, they have to
adjudicate the ___[02:40] to deal with and guess what you don’t have a
right to a jury trail in Juvenile Court but according to this bill you
could be accused of a misdemeanor in cases where he said or she said,
she said the case and you can be convicted and you can be kept in lockup
to your 18, 19 or 20 years old never having been convicted by jury
that’s the effect of the bill. It was mentioned that conference of DAs
opposed it, the ___[03:16] Association opposes it, it’s just a bad
policy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What purpose does the gentleman from Randolph Representative McNeill
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, fellow representatives. Let me take just a second
to start this by reading in a title to this bill because I think this is
very important and I think you need to understand what you are fixing
___[03:50]. An act to establish a Juvenile Jurisdiction Advisory
Committee to create a pilot civil citation process with Juveniles and to
raise the age of Juvenile Jurisdiction to include 16 and 17 years old
who have committed misdemeanor offenses. This is not a study on whether
you should raise the age to 16 or 17 year old, if you vote for this bill
today you will be voting to raise that age of 16 or 17 years old to
Juvenile. So, it is not just a study if you do it, it happens, it sets
in the motion. I know ___[04:34] in the session and everybody has ___ to
hear allow the rhetoric and allow the things we talk but this is a very,
very important and is a very, very complicated issue and I hope each and
everyone of you will take a time and you would actually read this bill
and you may already have and ___[04:53] you haven’t. But anyway I beg
you to read…

  <p>bill 725.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Guilford, Rep. Brandon rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a very quick question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Randolph yield to the gentleman from Guilford?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will treat him like he treated me earlier. When I&#39;m finished.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman does not yield at this time, however if the gentleman
wishes to ask a question later he will be recognized for such purpose.
The gentleman from Randolph continues to have the floor to debate the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
This bill makes sweeping changes of the juvenile justice system
disguiesed as a study bill.  After the first 2 pages, the remaining 9
pages makes numerous changes on how the criminaljustice system deals
with 16 and 17 year olds by classifying them as juveniles. It almost
seems like the bill calls for a study, but then goes on to tell you what
the results of the study is going to be. The main thing this study does
do is it does study a civil citation and how much all of this will cost.
 Well you know you&#39;ve heard Rep. Stam talk a little bit about what
the expected costs are going to be. I don&#39;t know a whole lot about
this civil citation part of it, that might not be a bad thing to study
but only as it relates to the juvenile justice systems and maybe 15 year
olds and those younger.
Let&#39;s look at page 2 for a minute,of the bill, lines 30-39, and that
talks about the comitte and what it&#39;s gonna do, as you see it says
&quot;advisory committee shall develop a specific plan for the
implementation&quot;. Implementation of these changes in the juvenile
justice system that would be required to extend jurisdiction in
delinquency matters, and preceedings toinclude 16 and 17 year olds
charged with misdemeanor offenses within the juvenile justice system.
The plan shall include cost for each portion of the plan, including
capital cost, operating cost and staffing cost. As the expansion of the
jurisdiction of the  Division of Juvenile Justice to include persons of
16 and 17 year olds who commit crimes or infractions becomes effective
persuant to this act. So even this own bill tells you it realizes a lot
of this act is going to become, and a lot of this is just how are we
going to implement this policy. But make no mistake, you are changing
the policy and I think that in the following section it talks about this
pilot program to be developed in 3 to 6 different counties on this civil
citation program. And I assumemost of you know what a civil citation
program would look like, you know a juvenile would get a civil citation
which might include a fine or some other type of punishment. I won&#39;t
speak a lot to this because it hasn&#39;t been studied and I don&#39;t
claim to be an expert on civil citation programs.
But I just kinda wonder exactly how that would work and if that&#39;s
really a good idea on how to deal with our juvenile problem, whether it
be 15 year olds, or 16 and 17 year olds.  Let&#39;s be clear on what
we&#39;re talking about here.  Most of your ideas, I&#39;m sure, are
sitting in this chamber today about 16 and 17 year olds is maybe your
own children, maybe your grandchildren, maybe the kids in your
neighborhood, maybe your child&#39;s best friends, maybe the children
you see at the football game or the basketball game, but there are a lot
of other juveniles that are 16 and 17 year olds that belong to gangs. A
16 and 17 year old looks a lot different, and maybe not quite so
innocent when they&#39;re holding a gun on you and aksing for your
wallet. Or when they&#39;re breaking into your car at midnight stealing
your stereo. And as far as Illinois passing this, maybe it&#39;ll be
like the 8 juvvenile girls in Chicago within the last week that mugged a
lady there for her cell phone. So I don&#39;t know that Illinois and
Chicago, especially with their murder rate in Chicago, and a lot of it
amongst juveniles, would be a good model for North Carolina anyway. Over
the past last several years state laws dealing with juveniles

  <p>North Carolina and I&#39;m talking about current juveniles, has been
watered down a lot by Federal guidelines that threaten to cut of Federal
dollars if you don&#39;t do this, if you don&#39;t do that. You know
judges now  can&#39;t even do anything that shows contempt to the court,
they can&#39;t really do anything with them. Their hands are  pretty
much handcuffed, and I have had judges in the juvenile justice system
that have called me that very very frustrated about how they are able,
how they can&#39;t deal with juveniles anymore because a lot of the
power has been taken out of their hand by statutes. And now we&#39;re
going to add 16 and 17 year olds to that group of juveniles that judges
can&#39;t do anything with? And let&#39;s make no mistake, there are
gang problems in North Carolina. If you don&#39;t believe there are gang
problems in North Carolina then you&#39;ve got your head in the sand.
Most of your law enforcement officers or agencies now have a gang
investigator ro a gang unit as part of their agency.
And who do you think that most of the people in those gangs are? The
biggest part of them are juveniles. I hope you all realize that gangs
recruit juveniles. Why do they recruit juveniles? Because juveniles can
go out and commit crimes for the gang and basically face no punishment.
You realize that a 15 or a 16 or 17 year old gang member can go out and
commit 20, 30, 40, 50 crimes before they&#39;re ever caught the first
time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Iredell, Rep. Brawley rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Since I hadn&#39;t turned him down, I thought I&#39;d try Rep. McNeill
for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Randolph yield to the gentleman from Iredell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please let me finish. I actually??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
?? continues to have the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But anyway, can commit a lot of crimes before they&#39;re actually
caught the first time. And then when they&#39;re caught the first time
they&#39;re not going to get any real punishmen if they&#39;re in under
the juvenile system. And this bill will now allow them 2 more years to
commit crimes before they&#39;re really punished. By then the gang will
recruit other juveniles. Pass this bill, and the bloods, the crips, and
maybe MS-13 will send you all a thank you letter. Also in page 4 section
3, when you&#39;re talking about holdover facilities, you know, and I
know this bill just defines holdover facilities, but please realize that
under these new regulations of what a holdover facility is,

Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the assistant rules chair, Rep. Floyd rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Inquiry of the chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In according to the rules, the- are we using 10 or 15 minutes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well under the rules, the gentleman has 15 minutes to speak on the
question and under our adjournment resolution I guess we could be here
until midnight tonight.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, how much time is left?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
5 minutes and 26 seconds, and I assume that the other 13 people want to
speak too, so, maybe a little while.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, followup?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his further inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If we continue at this pace, will we be allowed to get a lunch and
dinner break?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Maybe we&#39;ll have to order breakfast.
The gentleman from Randolph continues to have the floor to debate the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, but I would like to make a point that I sit her patiently
last  night while everyone debated about things that were important to
them, and this is important to me. So if you think I&#39;m taking too
long I apologize. I haven&#39;t spoken a lot this year, and when I did
I&#39;ve tried to be brief, but this is a very important to me, and I
will finish up as quickly as I can. Thank you.
But anyway, It&#39;s an unfunded mandate. Your local jurisdictions, your
local jails are going to have to make serious changes in their jails
because of the provisions in this about how the juveniles now the 16, 17
year olds have to be sight and sound separated and everything like
that. And those of you who are familiar of how jails - it could be a
great cost to those countites. And that&#39;s not even part of the
fiscal note that we&#39;ve already seen. But anyway, let me skip a
couple of things.
You know this whole philosophy of dealing with juveniles is supposed to
involve the family. 16 to 17 year old

  <p>
Persons are much different than the younger juveniles we&#39;re talking
about. One big difference between a 15 year old juvenile and a 16 year
old juvenile is they have a drivers license.  Lets be clear juvenile
problems have always been around and there has always been the
disagreement between how do we best deal with those problems do we
incarcerate them? Do we fine them? Do we give them community service? do
we give them probation? Gangs use juveniles Gangs started in the US in
the 1820s in New York and in the 1860s in Chicago, So gangs is not
something that just started, its been around for hundreds of years and
people have been trying to figure out how to deal with them for a long
long time and I really don&#39;t care what other areas of the country
are doing. The one other state does not, that keeps juveniles 16 and 17
year old&#39;s is New York and probably one of the most liberal states
out there.
I don&#39;t think just because other states have changed it means that
its the right thing for us to do. Make no mistake we buy things on
credit but
there&#39;s always a day that we&#39;re gonna have to come pay for it
you&#39;ve see the fiscal note on it that is millions of dollars it
costs. Representative Avala wanted to tell you that the 1 million
dollars cost of incarcerating those people in Mechlenburg and Durham
county, I hope you don&#39;t realize that just because those 16 and 17
year old&#39;s aren&#39;t sitting in jail they aren&#39;t being dealt
with in the juvenile justice system.
You&#39;re not really gonna save a million dollars just because
they&#39;re not incarcerated. If Juvenile justice people are dealing
with them there&#39;s gonna be a cost too, its just not gonna go away.
Crime nationwide is trending down across all age groups, this includes
juvenile crime, This bill goes too far; If crime is trending now then
I&#39;m not sure why we really need this. You heard representative Stam
talk about what some of the misdemeanor crimes are
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker? For what purpose-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;m about 30 seconds from finishing-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Union
Representative Hornrise inquiry the chair? The gentleman may state his
inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  If, Whatever action we take on this bill, What
happens next to the bill according to the rules of the legislature?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The bill is on for its second reading for today.
Should it pass and any member objects a third, the bill would have to
carry over to the next short session. Should the bill pass second and
third readings today the bill would still have to carry over to the
short session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  So under any circumstances no matter how we vote on
this bill it goes nowhere this session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct sir
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from Randolph continues to have the
floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  I understand its late and everybody wants to go home,
I do to. But anyway I skipped alot of it and maybe I have been long
winded but anyway I finish by saying this, Our district attorneys are
against it, our law enforcement is against it. We can&#39;t pay for it,
vote against it and I will be objecting to third.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  For what purpose does the gentleman from Rockingham
Representative Jones Rise-
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Floor motion
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman may state his motion
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you mister speaker, I move that this bill be
re-referred to the judiciary committee
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  The gentleman has properly moved that the bill be
removed from the calender and referred to the committee on judiciary,
Discussion and, the gentleman was recognized to speak to the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, Mr. Speaker
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  And I would ask that the members who do not wish to
debate the motion, please turn your lights off and we&#39;ll deal with
the motion and come back to the bill if the motion fails. The gentleman
from Rockingham has the floor to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and ladies and gentleman of the
house I think you just heard the Speaker&#39;s explanation and I was
waiting to, in deference to my friend who is the bill sponsor and also
my friend who is speaking and we&#39;ve heard  eloquent speeches on both
sides today but as has been pointed out, there&#39;s not gonna be any
action during this session. Now unlike the bill we took up before, the
senate has not voted on this bill so certainly they will not be taking
up action and  we&#39;ve already heard the gentleman will be objecting
the third. I think we&#39;ve heard enough debate today to re-refer this
to judiciary and take it up in the short session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Daughtry please state your purpose
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you mister speaker, speak on the motion
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;m now owing one on the motion to refer, I hope I
can make it to  at least one in one in the motion to refer. Its a good

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and gentlemen, upon motion of the members from
Durham County, Representatives Hall and Michaux, the chair is happy to
extend the courtesy of the gallery to AOK Summer Outreach Program and
their coordinator Mr. Daniel Brown. Please stand to let us welcome.
Ladies and gentlemen, the chair is going to allow not more than seven
minutes to debate this motion. So, we will take a vote at 11:20.
Representative Avila, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
debate the motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Lady is recognized to debate the
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] By making the motion ladies and gentlemen, the
motion-maker has intimated, like many of you on the other side have,
regarding things that have been stuck in our bills over here, that it
hasn&#39;t had a justified hearing. Let me remind you, that in the 2011
session, this bill went through a judiciary policy committee, was
discussed, recussed, lot of public input by opponents and supporters,
and passed favorably from that committee. This session, the same thing
happened. It went through a judiciary committee with the same level of
discussion, for and against, and passed. It went through a rules
committee because of some parliamentary changes. Same thing happened.
Heavy discussion among the members of the committee, public input, for
and against, and passed unanimously. There is no reason, no reason, for
those of you that object to this bill, to sit here and push a yes button
to refer this to a committee at all. You are being dishonest in what you
are trying to do. Stand up and let it be heard. Let it be voted and put
your no when we vote on the bill. Do not use parliamentary procedure
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Collins, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If Representative Avila would yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Avila, does the Lady yield? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I will. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The Lady yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila, I would love to be able to vote on this bill.
Would you be willing to call the question on this and let us vote if we
were to vote down this motion? Otherwise, I&#39;m going to vote for the
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I will call the question to go directly to the
vote on the bill if I&#39;m allowed to defend some of the arguments that
have been made against it. And, Mr. Speaker, I&#39;d like to be
recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The Lady is recognized for a
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;d like to call the previous question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The previous question is being called on the motion to
re-refer. If the Lady&#39;s intent was to call the question on the main
matter, the bill itself, the most expedient way to do that would be for
the Gentleman who introduced the motion, to withdraw that motion, after
the Lady who introduced the motion for the previous question, withdraws
her motion, if that is her intent. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Whichever way gets
me the closest to being able to discuss the bill and honestly vote our
convictions on it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The Lady&#39;s motion for the
previous question has been withdrawn. Does the Gentleman wish to
withdraw his motion to re-refer? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Mr. Speaker, and
if I may, briefly, I&#39;d like to explain. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
Gentleman has withdrawn the motion. The Gentleman is recognized to
debate the bill a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker,
and particularly to the bill&#39;s sponsor, who is my good friend, I
want for you to know that I did not make that motion to kill your bill.
I do intend to vote against it, but that&#39;s not the reason I did it
either. The fact of the matter is, it was made very clear that it
wasn&#39;t going anywhere until the short session. And, in deference to
the members here, who I know have heard the debate today, and will
continue to hear the debate, I felt like the most prudent thing to do
was to go ahead and move forward. I&#39;m happy to withdraw my motion so
that you can call the previous question and we can vote on it. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Now, the Lady is recognized for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
make a motion to move the previous question. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila moves the previous question. All in favor vote aye.
All opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote.

SPEAKER CHANGES:
Thank you mister speaker. Ladies and gentlemen you&#39;ve heard a lot of
opposition and you&#39;ve heard a lot of reasons for the opposition. And
I took notes as we went along and I will try to refute and educate you
where knowledge is lacking with why the arguments are not valid. We hear
first of all hype about significant violence in the crimes well you must
understand that North Carolina&#39;s justice system is pretty smart and
they understand violence and they know that it doesn&#39;t serve the
public well to have a violent person out among us. And the court has
flexibility in dealing with a person who commits violence against other
individuals. We can talk about other misdemeanors, shoplifting which is
much more prevalent I think than some of the violent crimes that
Representative Stan referenced. Representative Neele referenced the gang
impact and all of this in transparency but even the state of North
Carolina recognizes that there needs to be some type of handling of our
juveniles and why I realize that is because of an expunction that was
passed a law that was passed and put into place for our juveniles who
commit misdemeanors and our connected with crimes have a two year period
in which if they keep their nose clean. Those records can be expunged so
that the children in North Carolina can have an equal footing against
children in other states as Representative Stan said whose records
aren&#39;t seen. Representative McNeele seems to have a little bit of a
misunderstanding about the study. We&#39;re not studying raising the age
in this bill. We&#39;re saying raise it and I&#39;m very open about that
because as I&#39;ve explained we&#39;ve studied it to death so far. And
his concern about the fact that it&#39;s on that path and we can&#39;t
stop it. This general assembly can&#39;t direct any future general
assembly by actions that we do in the statue and why? For the same
reason that the members of the other side have ranted and raved about
some of our legislations come through because we&#39;ve repealed things
that they like. This can be repealed in twenty seventeen if it&#39;s not
needed or it&#39;s not popular or it&#39;s too expensive and people
don&#39;t want to go down that path. Many of you have been highly
pressured by your sheriffs. Representative McNeele talked about the
costs. They&#39;re getting paid now. They won&#39;t get paid under this
bill. Pria costs federally fix your jails. There&#39;s gonna be a cost
if they keep the juveniles. Ladies and gentlemen there&#39;s a lot of
misinformation. All I&#39;m askin&#39; is that you look at the facts
that we&#39;ve got a juvenile justice system that works and works well.
Please vote yes for my bill. Thank you.

Thank you mister speaker I&#39;ll yield my three minutes to

SPEAKER CHANGES :
Thank you mister speaker. I want to start my remarks by saying, how many
you would not want your child to have the best of education and the
support that they can give. That anybody can give. I want to ask a
question. How many of you know what the age of the youngest child in the
state of North Carolina can be prosecuted in a judicated delinquent.
It&#39;s age six. We want the best for our children and a dollar
won&#39;t stand in the way for most of us who are parents, grandparents.
It doesn&#39;t matter what the cost is when it comes to protecting our
children. I want you to think about that. I can&#39;t believe...

…That there are some of us talking about we wanna do…16 and 17 year
olds, I have been in juvenile system for a longtime, I’m a mother and a
grandmother but I have you to know that I will fight for not just much I
could remember when I was a Court Council, the judge who is quite for
that particular day took a 15 year old in custody and turn the child
over to me and I was kind of new in the process and I said, “What am I
gonna do with this white girl?” I took her home to my mother who
eventually became a foster care parent and we live right next door to
one another. So, I have been parenting not just my children but other
children like you and like me for a longtime. I don’t have a problem
with hugging and embracing another child. The experts tell you that the
brain is not developed in the child until they get to be about 25 years
old. We know we are gonna start this process of looking out for our
older teens this is just the beginning if I had to make a law I would
say 21. Let’s start and let’s start now with voting yes on this bill.
Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The question before the house is passage of the House Committee
Substitute number two to House Bill 725 on its second reading. All in
favor vote aye, all oppose vote no, the clerk will open the vote. The
clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. 61 having voted
affirmative 37 in the negative, the House Committee Substitute number 2
to House Bill 725 is passed his second reading and without objection…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Objection.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Objection having been raised by Representative Setzer, the bill remains
on the calendar, ladies and gentleman that completes the calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And last night at about 12:30 the rules chair came to me and said that
there are people who wanna to just ___[02:46] through the calendar. I
think if we had added the lack of productive dialogue that happens after
midnight if we had done that we probably be finishing about right now
anyway. Representative Jackson please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I had a motion as put to the last bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I knew that we set the rules decide to the end so that we may have third
reading today on this bill and get it over to the senate, let the people
inform and against and work on it during the ____[03:20] and let the
senate take it up when the first comes back in session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Daughtry will yell for a moment, Representative Jackson
the practical affect of the objection is that the bill remains on the
calendar for third reading. Therefore, when we comeback in May it will
be on the calendar when we return. So, the Chair will be happy for you
to discuss that the Chair is not sure where we go but I think ultimately
if we get to the other chamber it would be a matter of one day or two
days, once we comeback if the votes were there when we return.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Inquiry the Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would like to a motion that we have third reading today and maybe I’m
just unclear and how we are supposed to make that happen?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The house…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
[Inaudible]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If the gentleman wishes to make that motion it will require two-thirds
president voting to support the motion. The gentleman’s motion is
actually to suspend the rules to the end.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Under rule 58B…Yeah, 58B, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the gentleman’s motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is about to channel his ____[04:50]?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, members of rules I don’t think we have done…

We suspended this any of this year I think Dr. ___[00:03] want us to
suspend it, he wants before and we didn’t, we have not suspended the
third reading rule where there is objection, often there are bills that
are not controversial and off course will let those bills have their
third reading and go forward. This is obviously the bill that is
controversial, if we have third reading I imagine more lights will come
on, there will be more debate unless we call the question which the
minority has been critical every time I have call the question this
year. However, I would point out that, this is a major Sub-Senate Bill,
it’s not gonna go anywhere right now, it’s not like by objecting the
third that you keep it from being passed in the law where the Senates
already acted, it can go through the normal channels next year and go
through but at the end of the day members I would ask you Chairman that
we not suspend the rules that we disclosed with the reminder the
calendar and we go home.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And this is the last ___[01:00] calendar, Representative Larry Hall
please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and even though this is suspending the rules we
know that under the rules we have laid items on the table 30 times this
session and call the question 31 times this session. So, I understand
this maybe a suspension of the rules but we have had…The fact is a
suspension of the rules at least 60 times already to ___[01:35] a
degree, I think this is an important matter and people will only be
asked to just vote their opinion, I think that’s what our sponsors have
asked for vote whatever it is you decide to vote like give it the vote
and let them move on to do whatever else it is they need to do. So, I
would ask you to support this motion to suspend the rules.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Grier Martin please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just like to point out that under the definition of dead or kill
___[02:08] that propounded by the rules committee chair if we don’t vote
this bill on third reading it would be dead. Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ___[02:18] please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
___[02:20] Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his ___[02:22]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The point of clarification rule 58B ___[02:26] takes two-thirds of
votes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct and based on the count I believe that would be 66 in the
affirmative, further discussions further debate on the motion? If not
the question before the house is the motion to suspend the rules, all in
favor vote aye, all oppose vote no, the clerk will open the vote. The
clerk will lock the machine and record the vote, 44 having voted
affirmative and 52 in the negative the motion fails.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.

Representative Torbett please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I want to start off by thanking a few folks, first off I
want to thank you as our- I want to thank you and the services that
you&#39;ve given us as our speaker, you have allowed plenty of debate,
have done an excellent job in your second term as speaker and just on
behalf of all of the members of the House I want to thank you for the
time and sacrifice that both you and your family have given in allowing
you to be here and just think we would like to express that.
And I&#39;d also like to thank the person that really runs the house,
and that&#39;s this young lady seated to your right, Ms. Weeks and her
staff, if we could all thank them.
And with that Mr. Speaker, just also to the members I hope everyone has
a great summer, I know we&#39;re going to start working in the interim
members on study committees, you know we did not have a study bill, we
looked at one in the Rules, we talked to the Senate, it just seemed a
waste of time to go through that process to pass it so I want you to
know that we&#39;re going to continue working on LRC studies, of course
the speaker, the President Pro Temp will have an opportunity to appoint
those as well as the other committee, so those folks who have an
interest should probably direct their interest, feel free to send those
to my office as well as the speaker&#39;s office if there&#39;s subject
matters you&#39;re interested in serving on during the interim.

The other day I announced that the World War II exhibit was open, it
wasn&#39;t yet. I got told wrong. But now I have been informed that it
is open on the third floor of the history museum, I realize you may not
want to take time to go see it today, I&#39;m going to try to, but I
just wanted to let you know that it is open on the third floor under the
name &quot;A Call to Arms&quot;.  And one other thing, if I may, I have
a house for sale in Concord, as long as you don&#39;t run against me I
invite you to consider buying it. Thank you.

Thank you Mr. Speaker, and I&#39;ll be brief, there&#39;s been a lot of
thanks that have been expressed to you and to the staff, I wanted to add
one more if I could.  There are many of us in this room or in this
legislative compound and whatnot who very well may not be here when
spring arrives, one of those folks who has announced his intention to
retire is Stanley Moore. And Stanley&#39;s not with us here on the floor
just now I don&#39;t think, I wanted to commend him for the dilligent
work he has done for

  <p>For, I think for nearly 30 years in paying close attention to safe
guarding the important things, like the state employees retirement
account and what not. I did want to share one brief story, my first term
here, which was in 2003, I had had a concern. It was much like it had
been in the last few days, it was towards the end of the session and
everybody was busy and tired. I called ??, and I said, Mr. Moore, I have
a concern. I wanted to address this particular policy issue with you.
His response was, well, Sir most people go through their legislator.
When I had to tell him, well I was one of them, we&#39;ve been really,
really good friends since then. Stanly&#39;s service to the state and
the institutional knowledge that he has brought, and continues to bring,
and will bring until I&#39;m sure his lay day, will be missed. I&#39;m
sorry he is not here on the floor, but I did just want to publicly thank
him for his time here.
[Applause]
