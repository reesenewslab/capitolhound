Thank you, Mr. President. This bill simply is an act that requires
release of property taxes in any area that was part of an annexation
that we de-annexed for six months or less. It does expire pretty soon;
it goes until July the 1st 2016. It basically lets the Monkey Junction
area in Wilmington not be taxed. I was contacted by the mayor and the
city council, who asked that we run this bill because they did not want
to cause anymore ire to the residents of that area since it was
de-annexed. I’d be happy to take any questions you might have. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate?</p>

&quot;Senator Daniel what purpose do you rise?&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;Explain senate bill 42.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;You have the floor senator.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;Thank you Mr. President, I'm a little hoarse tonight but I'll do
the best that I can. The genesis of this bill probably started in the
last session, when former senator Wes Moreland was involved with the
creation of a charter school in Cleveland county. Where I now represent
and realized that if a county entity wanted to convey property to a
charter school there was an issue and you would have to have a local
bill to authorize that to be done. So we thought we want to encourage
the creation of charter school and we don't want come back and local
bills every time a county or another governmental entity wants to convey
real property to them. So this bill is basically just enabling
legislation that allows a governmental entity to do that at their
discretion. Either for full consideration or less than full
consideration. I think it makes alot sense and would ask for your
support.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;Thank you senator is there any other discussion or debate? Hearing
none the question for the senate is the passage of the committee
substitute to senate bill 42 on it's second reading. All in favor will
vote aye, opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the
voting, the clerk will record the vote. 42 have been voted in the
affirmative and 3 in the negative. Committee substitute senate bill 42
passes it's second reading with out objection will be read a third

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;North Carolina [INAUDIABLE] acts.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing none all in
favor of the committee substitute senate bill 42 on it's third reading
will say aye, opposed no. The aye's have it and senate bill 42 will be
sent to the house. Senate bill 122 the clerk will read.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;Senate bill 122 sex trafficking, sex offender registration.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;Senator Goolsby is recognized to explain the bill.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;Thank you Mr. President, this is a simple bill. All it does is add
sex trafficking, it's listed as human trafficking. We happen to be one
of the top 10 states in the country for sex trafficking. We're actually
number 8. This bill starts to take a bite out of that by adding sex
trafficking as a re portable sex offense. So when you're convicted under
our law and as it states it's a very simple bill only a few lines. The
offense is committed against a minor who is less than 18 years of age or
the offensive is committed against any person with the intent that they
be held in sexual servitude. I'd be happy to answer any question, I'd
appreciate your support in this bill.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;Thank you senator, is there any further discussion or debate?
Hearing none the question of the senate is the passage of committee
substitute senate bill 122 on it's second reading. All in favor will
vote aye, opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the
voting, the clerk will record the vote. Herrington aye, McLaurin aye,
Woodard aye, 45 have been voted in the affirmative and zero in the
negative, committee substitute senate bill 122 passes it's second
reading without objection will be read a third time.&quot;

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
&quot;Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing none all in
favor of the committee substitute senate bill 122 on it's third reading
will say aye opposed will say no, the aye's have it. Committee
substitute senate bill 122 passes it's third reading and will be sent to
the house. At this time we would like to take a moment to introduce the
pages for the week..&quot;
