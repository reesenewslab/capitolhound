on many important issues. For example, after her personal upbringing in
China, and a high school experience in Korea, she continued to have
compassion on the people of Asia and she encouraged her husband to
visit, and later accompanied him during his historic visits to the
People's Republic of China. It was Ruth Graham who dissuaded her husband
from launching a campaign for the US presidency. She told him, and the
family can negate this if it's not correct, she told him that she would
leave him if he quit his ministry and the American public would not
accept a divorced man as president, she warned. Actually sounds like
something I might say, but in a statement released from the Wheaton
College president Dr. Dwane Lifton, it was remarked, strong, steady, and
dauntless, Ruth Bell Graham was the glue that held the many parts of
their lives together. While understanding the importance of his calling,
Ruth joined Reverend Graham willingly in his ministry. Though, and as
the author of 14 books herself, she preferred her role to be behind the
scenes. But still Mr. Graham recognized her powerful influence in this
preferred role when he said, &quot;only God himself fully appreciates
the influence of a Christian mother in molding the character of her
children.&quot; And then this funny little story that I thought I could
also relate to, from the Los Angeles Times on her passing. Ruth Graham
was once driving and hit the accelerator instead of the brake, sending
her car crashing through a fence. No one was hurt, but in the phone call
from California, Billy Graham demanded that she surrender her driver's
license. Ruth argued with him, standing her ground, and according to an
account in the Asheville Citizen Times, after a long moment of silence,
Billy Graham said, &quot;I don't recall reading in scripture that Sarah
ever talked to Abraham like this.&quot; She continued to drive, and I
urge you to support the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bill Brawley is recognized to debate
the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. A few years ago I watched a
program on Billy Graham which was on PBS, which I thought was really
surprising, because I didn't know that they would cover a subject like
that. And the thing I walked away with was a meeting that he held early
in his ministry where he and his key leaders sat together and said what
has called evangelism ??. And they came up with three rules. Number one
is young, single, charismatic men traveling across the country without
their families. They would never be alone with a woman to whom they were
not related to by blood or marriage, above the age of six, or below the
age of 86. Not in a car, not in an elevator. That they would never touch
the money. They would hire professional staff to handle all the money.
They would take a salary and that's the only money they would have at
their disposal. And last, they would not criticize anyone who claimed to
be in service. They might not work with them, but if you claimed
service, they would accept your claim and not criticize you or argue
with it. Those are simple rules that even a simple man like me could
follow. And the thing that I particularly liked about it, we've heard
how great Billy Graham was, and yet he showed the humility as the Bible
tells us. This is what the Lord requires of you: do justice, love mercy,
and walk humbly on the path of the Lord. Amend the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Pittman is recognized to debate the
resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I hope I can make it through
this. When I was born, my dad wanted to name me Billy Graham. And my mom
said &quot;well you ought not to marry kids after people they're not kin
to.&quot; And so they compromised and named me Larry Graham, and I've
always wished my dad had prevailed in that argument. Being a pastor
myself, I do often think of Dr. Graham and look to his example, though I
don't think I'll ever live up to it. But whenever I sign my name, I
don't ever sign Larry Pittman, it's always Larry G. Pittman. Because the
G is there to honor the man who many of us have come to think of as
Brother Billy. And I want to say the Lord tells us in the 5th
commandment honor your father and mother</p>

so proud of them and thankful for them on behalf of Dr. Graham and Ms.
Ruth. But these are people who mean a great deal to me even though they
don’t know me from Adam’s house yet, and I’m just so grateful. I never
thought I’d ever be in this body and I’m so grateful to be here today to
be a part of honoring Dr. Billy and Ruth Graham and their family, and
God bless you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Carney, please state
your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak to the resolution. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the resolution. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and members of the House and visitors in
the gallery. I rise today to speak to this resolution from several
aspects of my life. Sometimes we don’t all know the influences that have
happened to each of us up here as we have grown in our lives, but I grew
up Raleigh, and my grandfather was a Baptist minister and someone I
looked up to. He lived four blocks down from me, and my grandmother was
the rock for my granddaddy, and so when I was approached about
co-sponsoring this resolution I said certainly, for honor and
recognition of Ruth Graham for all she did to lift up and support the
great man that we all know, Billy Graham. He was a famous – is a famous
Baptist minister, and my grandfather didn’t have the famous name by his
side but he was an infamous Baptist minister from many of his wonderful
sermons. But I will never forget as a child, my other grandparents lived
in Roxboro, and we would drive from Raleigh on Sunday afternoons, every
Sunday after church at my granddaddy’s, drive over to Roxboro, but on
many of those trips in the fifties, the Hour of Decision radio show was
on, and I grew up in the car listening to that radio show a lot, and I
remember my grandmother in Roxboro was afflicted with polio as a young
woman, so she was bedridden most of her life after bearing nine
children, giving birth to nine children, and one of her greatest wishes
in life was to go to one of the Billy Graham crusades. Well she never
got to go to that, but I’ll never forget my uncle buying her her first
TV, and the family marveled at the joy in her life when she could be in
her bed and watch the Billy Graham crusade on TV. So it’s been a guiding
force in my life, the influence from my religious upbringing though my
family, and certainly the influence of the Grahams in my grandfather and
grandmother’s life. They did come to our church. I remember as a young
child just there was this famous man come at our church, and granddaddy
wanted to be just like him, and of course I was a child and we didn’t
realize that until many, many years later in life of what his impact has
been on many ministers throughout this country and indeed the world. I
recommend the resolution to you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Ramsey
is recognized to debate the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Mr.
Speaker. Thank you. Montreat is not the biggest town in the state of
North Carolina, but I know some of us, especially from the mountains,
believe when you go up the hill you’re a little closer to heaven, and
for the past 70 years, Dr. Graham, and up until the last 5 years ago
when Ms. Graham was called to go home, that Dr. and Ms. Graham have
lived in Montreat. There’s many reasons that it’s appropriate to honor
Dr. Graham, but Dr. Graham would not be here in the position to touch so
many lives if it weren’t for Ms. Graham and I think his mom, Ms. Morrow
Graham. Ms. Graham one time said when they asked her “Did you ever
consider divorce?” and she said “No, I never considered divorce. I
considered murder at one time.” But Mr. Graham’s parents were medical
missionaries in China, and when they came back to the United States they
settled in Montreat, and shortly thereafter, Dr. and Ms. Graham</p>

Representative: …except god and the family who shared in that sacrifice.
For that I am profoundly thankful, as many others are, for the impact
the Graham’s had on lives they will never know this side of [xx].
Speaker: Representative Jones is recognized to debate the resolution.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to join briefly
with my colleagues. Only god truly knows the number of lives that have
been impacted by Billy Graham and his family. I stand before you as one
of those. As an eight year old boy, I attended one of those crusades
preached by one of his affiliates in his ministry, and made a public
profession of faith, and recognized that I was a sinner who needed a
savior. I continue to follow the ministries of Billy Graham and his
family, even today. I want to share with you one of the quotes
attributed to Billy Graham, that is something I think we can remember
here often on the floor of this house. Billy Graham said that when a
brave man takes a stand, the spines of others are often stiffened. Billy
Graham was a great man that took a stand. I just want to leave us with
this because I believe that it is the sentiment he would have and that
his family has as well. In the sermont of the mount the lord said to let
your light shine before men so that they may see your good works and
glorify your father in heaven: that is what Billy Graham and his family
have done. So I would just say praise god and thank god for Billy Graham
and his family. I commend this resolution to you.
Speaker: Representative Starnes is recognized to debate this resolution.
Representative: Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentleman of the
house, it certainly is a privilege to stand up and remember the late
Billy Graham and his wife the late Mrs. Graham. Isn’t it interesting to
see how  a man started a world wide industry, yet he touched so many
people personally here at home – and for that we are grateful. I grew up
in Granite Falls. I owned a dairy farm and there were 7 of us children.
In the summer time we would be playing – of course you would play til
dark because you did not have air conditioning, so you did not sit in
the house. I remember one time my momma hollering at us to get in here –
we thought something good must be happening. She said for us to sit down
and listen to the television. It was Billy Graham. I said momma, we got
to go to church Sunday morning, Sunday night and Wednesday night: why in
the world we got to listen to preaching again here on the television?
She said because she said so. You know, sometimes, I think, Dr. Graham
learned to use the media to reach people for Christ. I don’t know that
it had been used in that way until he began to use the radio and
television and know, the internet. I use to think, who would ever listen
to a radio program and have a life changing experience – of coming to
know Christ as their savior? There was a fellow who lived on the farm
next to us that did not have a television, but a radio. He was in high
school and doing his homework one evening and the hourly decision came
on. He said you know I was doing homework, I really wasn’t listening,
but the more I listened, the less homework I did, and before long I
realized I was a sinner needing a savior, and so I gave my heart to
Christ. Now, even today, he has the 106.9 in Black Mountain, saved on my
computer. I like to listen to it here in Raleigh – I bet many of you as
well. It has been wonderful that the Grahams have been able to
administer to people around the world and yet never lost touch with the
people here in NC. Even today, Dr. Graham is planning today to have one
last evangelical mission. It is my hope that it is being prepared for
right now. I know that you have an opportunity to click on it and
participate. I have signed up and others have as well. He has not quit.
He is ninety something</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Just briefly my mother has always said and many
others that behind every man there's a great woman. So we know she had
to be a great woman to stand behind such a great man. However, I can
remember when I was a little girl and most of the time you weren't
interested in a program such as this one but you wanted to see cartoons.
My brothers wanted to see a cowboy and those are the things that you
remember greatly. But the thing that I remembered most about the Billy
Graham crusade was his teaching that I enjoyed. Surprisingly yes, we
enjoyed it. But what I enjoyed most of all was the closing and the
singing of the hymn Just As I Am. And as you sat there and you watched
people coming from it seemed like miles up walking down to the alter for
prayer, that's what I remember most and I do commend the bill to you.

of education you require one arts education credit for graduation.
General Assembly of North Carolina, enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Carney, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
House, this bill got a good hearing in education yesterday, and I shared
with those on the education committee that I was reminded of Abraham
Lincoln's quote, &quot;I will study and get ready and perhaps my time
will come.&quot; Well there are a lot of us in this chamber, both in our
chamber and in the Senate chamber, that for the last seven years have
been working on arts and arts education in our state. And I really thank
you all for those that voted in committee. The bill simply says, and we
have moved to the support of DPI, the association of administrators, we
have the support because in requiring arts as a graduation requirement,
you have to take one arts course between sixth grade and seventh grade.
Between sixth grade and seventh grade, one arts course, that's all you
have to take. Seventy-five to eighty percent of our students in this
state are already taking an arts course. There are some that are not
getting it because it's not required and it's not in their county. But I
ask for your support and would welcome any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Adams, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, ladies and gentlemen of the House. Like
most human endeavors, art is what's right for the greatest number of
people. And if it pleases one ?? individual thing, but when it appeals
to many by its own nature, it is a greater force. I'm pleased to support
this bill because of all I know about how the arts impact our society.
Most especially how it impacts our children. Clearly the arts are
avenues for expression and communicating all we feel and do. And
sometimes through singing, sometimes through writing, sometimes through
dance. And like in my own work as a visual artist, sometimes through the
manipulation of two and three-dimensional mediums, whether in painting
or drawing or print making or sculpture. And while the arts bring
special meaning to communities, when the arts flourish, communities
flourish and thrive. Today's knowledge-based economy requires workers
who can think creatively and who can solve problems. Individuals who can
reason and analyze and have complex thinking skills. I've been an art
educator all of my life. I've worked with children and prepared teachers
to work with children in the arts. And I know that they are basic and
absolutely essential. And while they are nice, the arts are necessities
for not only academic growth and success of our children, but
participating in the arts, whether studying art history or making it in
a studio, it helps children learn more about themselves while gaining an
awareness and an appreciation and acceptance for other people and
diversity in this world. There's plenty of evidence out here that
supports the fact that the arts help young people score higher on SAT
scores and it decreases the dropout rates and it enhances attendance.
Involved in the arts and education does help enhance communication
skills. It does a lot of great things. This is a wonderful bill. It's
been a long time coming, and we would certainly appreciate your support
on the bill. And I certainly commend it to you. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Adams, the chair would recognize that
may be the coolest hat that you've worn in the seven years I've been
here.
[laughter][applause]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, may I, thank you so much for that
complement, but I also wanted to mention that because it is arts day and
I love hats, I want to acknowledge Chuck Davis who brought this hat to
me today. He is the founder of the African-American dance ensemble
that's internationally known and actually has performed in this chamber,
performed all over the United States and China and Japan, and like many
of the non-profit arts organizations, do a great work for North
Carolina. So, I'm happy to wear this hat today and add it to the 780
that I have. Thank you.
[laughter]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Larry Hall, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd just ask if the Representative from Guilford
County will yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'll yield, Mr. Speaker.

Yes sir. He is from the great city of Durham.

Rep. Blackwell: To see if Representative Carney would yield for a
question.
The Speaker Pro Tempore: Representative Carney, does the lady yield?
Rep. Carney: I yield.
Rep. Blackwell: Thank you, Representative Carney. I wasn't able to be in
the Education Committee when the bill was being discussed, so you may
have responded to this question; I apologize if I'm being repetitive.
But can you tell us again if you know, how many of our 115 LEAs will be
required to begin offering arts courses that they do not currently
offer?
Rep. Carney: Thank you, Representative Blackwell.
I failed to say, in the excitement of this bill finally being on the
floor, that this bill does not take effect until 2016. It will start
with the 9th grade class and move them forward with documentation of
between 6th grade, I need to correct that, until 12th grade, I put 7th
grade earlier.
The DPI -- the state board, rather -- is going to be charged with coming
back and establishing the procedures and timeline for the phased-in
implementation of this arts education requirement. They're also going to
establish the minimum requirement to meet the arts education
requirement, and they will report back to us within the next three
years.
So many will be impacted at this point, no, I do not have a definitive
answer to that.
Rep. Blackwell: Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the lady would yield for a
further question.
The Speaker Pro Tempore: Does the lady yield?
Rep. Carney: I yield.
The Speaker Pro Tempore: The lady yields.
Rep. Blackwell: Representative Carney, will this report back from DPI, I
take it telling us what we will be mandating, will it also include some
estimate of the cost to be incurred by the local system in finding arts
teachers and creating the facilities such as pottery shops or art
classes if things of that sort may be required, and how that will be
funded?
Rep. Carney: Yes, sir, that is also in the bill on line 15, the
reporting that process. This bill also gives a lot of flexibility to our
LEAs with this being offered, and that was where we found the magic
bullet was to move this out of high school, this requirement, to now
incorporate grades 6 through 12, and there's a lot of leeway and
potentially not a whole lot of cost to our schools systems. So that will
be within their reports as they come back.
Rep. Blackwell: Mr. Speaker, may I address the bill?
The Speaker Pro Tempore: The gentleman is recognized to debate the
resolution.
Rep. Blackwell: It pains me to decide that I am probably going to vote
against this, because it suggests that one is maybe not in favor of the
arts. In fact, I consider myself a strong proponent of the arts, but I
have tried to be, as consistently as possible, a supporter of, one,
avoiding unnecessary unfunded mandates, and giving flexibility to our
school systems.
We've tried to do that, especially in recent years, as we have cut back
or had to limit the funds available to local schools. To now add this
requirement, without understanding what the cost implications are first,
in this context in which local school systems can have an art
requirement for graduation if they choose to do so, but we would simply
decide that Raleigh knows better, and regardless of the local
circumstances or local opinions, we're going to make you require your
students to take something that somebody in Raleigh will decide meets
the requirements of being an arts class.
I don't think that's the direction in which our state education policy
ought to go, and I would recommend that we maybe do some sort of study
to support the arts, and maybe to encourage it, maybe to even try to
come up with a way of supporting it financially. But I urge us, in this
time in the financial health of our state, not to impose this additional
requirement on all of our 115 LEAs.
The Speaker Pro Tempore: Representative Johnson, please state you
purpose.
Rep. Johnson: To speak on it.</p>

The lady is recognized to debate the bill the house will come to order.
The state board of education will establish is the part of this bill
helps you to understand what in talking with the North Carolina
association of school administrators and the superintendent of public
instruction they believe with mastery and beginning this credit to be
carried over from middle school that there will be no cost in
accomplishing this we already do this process with algebra one and their
reasons for having this as a requirement house bill 127 will give all
students the skills that are required for 21st century schools and 21st
century jobs two of these schools are creativity and critical thinking I
have some reports that I did not distribute today but I wanted to read
you a little bit from proven reports that have proven these actual
account of students receiving an arts rich education perform better on
assessments of creativity than do students receiving little or no arts
education critical thinking studies find that arts education develops
students critical thinking skills. skills such as comparison
hypothesizing and critiquing. Skills that are necessary for a students
ability to apply knowledge and visual solutions. I'm asking you to help
accomplish this effort and preparing our students for the real world.
I'm asking for your support on this legislation for no educational
organization that is against this. SPEAKER CHANGES Representative please
state you purpose SPEAKER CHANGES To debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you Mr. Speaker. I understand that this bill is full of good intentions,
However maybe when we have good intentions we still may have some
consequence we did not intend. I know for one that if I had be required
to pass an art course in order to be able to graduate high school I'd
say that I would still be there. It's great to have art and I think we
need to support it. I have great admiration for people who have artistic
talent. Like I tell some of these tall folks around here I am not
prejudice against tall people and I love to enjoy the art my mother was
great at painting drawing stuff You can come to my office see something
she painted, beautiful. I got none of that talent I have got none of it.
And there are a lot of those students out there that are probably like
that. and I think the unintentioned consequences of passing this bill
will be to subject a lot of students who have no talent and no interest
in art to hours in class of utter frustration and feelings of inadequacy
that they don't need. To have to go through before they graduate high
school. I think we have to support the arts. Keep that as an elective or
something available in the program seek out students who have the talent
and encourage them to go in that direction I know it will be helpful to
those students but to  lot of our students it would just be an exercise
in futility to which they should not be subjected top as a requirement
for graduation Algebra II and chemistry almost did me in and art would
have. So on behalf of other untalented people like myself I would
appreciate if you would vote no on this bill thank you. [SPEAKER

debate but a part of whether or not we come back tonight has to do with

shows us the future ready core and what credits are needed 4 in Math, 4
in English, 4 in Social Studies, 3 in Science, 1 in Health and Phys. Ed.
and then that leaves 6 elective credits to go.  My amendment addresses a
couple of problems.  First of all, you may have a student that comes
from another State and in case of my amendment I say in 11th or 12th
Grade who is on track to graduate but may need these other required
things and just doesn't have room for that credit in order to graduate
for Arts.  So, that's the first part of the amendment would allow for
that student to be accepted from this, and we could put on their diploma
that they grew up in North Dakota and that's why they don't know the
Arts.  The second is probably more significant.  That is, many students
have lots of Arts education outside the curriculum.  They may be every
year in the school play, they may have been in the orchestra since they
were five-years-old, they may sing in a chorus and so there would be
another exception that if that student can demonstrate that they have
had as much actual arts and the attention there's as much times in the
arts as one credit hour would cover anyway, then they would be exempt
from that.  I hope you'll agree to the amendment and vote for it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Further discussion, further debate on the Amendment.
 Representative Carney please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you Mr. Speaker.  I welcome the distinguished
gentleman's amendment with a lot of apprehension but I want to speak
against this simply because what the Bill says is that the State Board
will determine all this flexibility play within what they have to work
with.  Certainly students that are transferring in here they're going to
bring a transcript with them from their previous schools.  I am sure it
will be worked out within the next two to three years with our State
Board developing the criteria and the plan of implementation that these
types of flexibilities will be built in.  I ask that you let us move
this ahead and let it work its way through the system as we have been
for the last six years so that we can move this Bill forward.  Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Representative Johnson, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I would like to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Thank you Mr. Speaker.  In discussing this same
circumstance with the Department of Public Instruction and the
Secretary, I asked for some assurance and they assured me they are
allowing them flexibility for determining how the requirements would be
met.  For example, with the new emphasis on mastery based learning,
there may be out of school experiences that could be used to help
fulfill the requirement.  North Carolina Department of Public
Instruction will work closely with the schools to determine flexible
options that would not create undue hardships on schools.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Ladies and gentlemen of the House.  The Chair is
happy to extend the courtesies of the Gallery to a very large group of
students on either side of the Gallery.  A group of students, teachers
and chaperones from Cotswold Elementary in Charlotte and a group of
students, teachers and chaperones from Midway Elementary in Lexington.
Welcome. Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Speak a second time on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment
a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  The sponsors say the State Board will give
flexibility but if you read the Bill the flexibility doesn't extend to
waiving the requirement for these people.  You could have a real
go-getter person who has been in orchestra all her life, whether at
school or at a non-school event, and that person just really wants to
take two years of French or three years of German or two extra career
technical education and that person just may not get to do that without
this flexibility.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill a
second time.[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, I'm sorry i have to
rise a second time but i forgot to read this the first time around I did
wanna share this letter from as teacher in Cabarrus county and it is
concerning different bill but i think it's appropriate to this
discussion because he's expressing concern about change in Cabarrus
county concerning band being an interference with opportunity for
students to pursue careers in technical education and I'll just read you
a portion of this letter. He says, band offered in the 6th grade means
that most students will be starting  band will have seven years of
instruction in band and learning to play just one instrument and only a
very small number will actually use any kind music in their future
careers and even fewer will use the instrument they learnt in their
vocation. Most of the instruments used by these students we'd put in a
closet or attic at graduation never to be played again and significant
portion of the letter says this much effort to teach something that ends
at graduation seems to be a waste of resources, but is especially
wasteful when it shuts these students of from more productive
opportunities like those offered by career and technical education
courses. I simply contend sir that art as wonderful as it is, is not
essential, is not a necessity  and should not be required. Thank you.

the Arrest and Conviction of Fugitives from Justice.&quot; General
Assembly of North Carolina, enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McNeill, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker and fellow House members, after that last
debate, I reserve the right to call this a simple bill until after you
vote. This House bill is to amend General Statute 15-53 and 53.1 to
increase the amount of a Governor's reward from $10,000 to $100,000.
There's two different ways a person can get this reward. And one is by
apprehending a fugitive and the other one is by supplying information
that would lead to the arrest and conviction of a fugitive. There is no
physical impact to this. There is a physical note with it. It all
depends on how much the governor authorizes for a reward or his
proclamation. And it depends on how many rewards are requested. So there
is no physical impact. If there is, the money comes from the contingency
and emergency fund. Placed on your desks, if anybody has any questions
about how these rewards are often awarded, placed on your desk, the last
one was awarded, or excuse me, the last one was proclaimed on January
18, 2013 by Governor McCrory. And that was for a double homicide that
occurred in the county of Rockingham. Prior to that, I think the last
one, on March 10, 2010, Governor Perdue issued a proclamation in the
amount of $5,000 for investigation ?? it happened by the Knightdale
Department of Public Safety. And in that case there was an arrest. I
stand ready for any questions if you have any, if not I recommend that
you support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I will be brief, I know the
time is short. I just could not let the opportunity go by. You saw the
handout on your desk, the Governor offering a reward in the murder in
Rockingham county. These two victims of this crime were very close
friends of mine, and the family is very close to me. And I just want to
express, really on behalf of this family, their appreciation to Governor
McCrory...</p>

For offering this reward. This is a good deal and I commend it to you.
But I just wanted to basically say in memory and in honor of my friends
that were lost here, that these are the type of crimes that I think it
behooves us to be able to offer such rewards. Thank you.
