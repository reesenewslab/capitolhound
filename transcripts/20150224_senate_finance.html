  What time is it, Senator Ford? [SPEAKER CHANGES] 1:02. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
1:02. I am going to call this meeting of Finance to order at this time.
And we have a list of pages here. The first one must have been written
by Senator Rucho. It cannot be read. Number two is Nick Mills from
Raleigh. Sponsored by Senator Stein. That was all you could find, sir?
Where is this kid? I don’t, there he is. I’m proud of you. You’ve,
hopefully Senator Stein will help educate you and I hope he’ll buy you
lunch one day like I do all of mine. Mary Grace McConnell from
Harrisburg, sponsored by Senator Hartsell. And K-A-Y-L-D, is that Kyled?
Kaled? Kayla? Well that’s K-A-Y-L-A, not -D. Kayla. Is it K-A-Y-L-A? All
right. From Raleigh. Senator Hartsell again? Stretched all the way down
here to Raleigh to pick up. Sergeant at Arms who always do a superb job
around here and we truly are thankful for them. Senate Finance Sergeant
at Arms, we’ve got Canton Lewis, Charles Jeffries, and Steve McCaig.
Today, since I don’t have a copy of ?? We’ve got one bill and it is a
PCS and we, Senator Rabin moves the PCS be adopted. All in favor?
Opposed? Okay, it’s adopted. And at this time, on the revenue laws,
technical changes. Most of these, you’ve seen before. Senator Rucho is
recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No, Senator Rabin. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rabin is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I’ll call on Senator Rucho if time allows. It won’t. Okay. [LAUGHTER]
Members of the committee, Senate Bill 19 is a rehash of a potpourri of
three bills that we had pre-bill, have already been voted on and have
passed the Senate. I will draw your attention to two sections of the
bill, one being Section Four and one being section 24. Section 24 was
the reason for the PCS and that’s all and I’m going to ask Miss Avery if
she will explain the bill. Then if there are any questions or any
clarifying statements, either Senator Rucho or I will help with those.
So Miss Avery, if you will explain the bill as needed, please? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Senator Rabin. The bill that you have before you, as
Senator Rabin said, is the technical changes that did not, were not
enacted last year. They’ve just been put forth. They were in Revenue
Laws for three meetings. We have not had any comments on them. Section
Four of the bill is a section that was recommended to you by the Revenue
Law Study Commission and Heather will explain that provision in just a
moment. The other change made by this PCS is the addition of section 24.
This is something that was brought to the Finance chair’s attention. It
is something we’ve been in discussions with the Department of Revenue
about. There’s some time sensitivity to it. And this is, the purpose of
it is to prevent the double taxation of some funds that were allowed to
airline employees that were part of an airline bankruptcy to roll into
an IRA. Right now they are subject to, the rollover amounts have been
subjected to state income tax. The federal, Congress extended the
federal statute of limitations to allow a taxpayer to deduct that from
gross income. However because our statute of limitations had already run
for these taxpayers, they could not file a companion request for refund
at the state level. The double taxation comes into play that when they
take those subsequent distributions at both the federal and state level,
they too will be subject to tax. So section 24 is just trying to conform
our law with some changes that the federal government made, in a very
narrow situation for a very few taxpayers. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
As Cindy mentioned, Section Four was a recommendation of the Revenue Law
Study Committee and this section deals with the income tax reductions in
the Tax Reduction Act of Session Law 2013-16. As you recall, the General
Assembly enacted many tax reductions in that act. As part of it, they
repealed the franchise tax on electricity and piped natural

  gas, and they also lowered the corporate income tax rate. In May, 2014,
the Utilities Commission took its first action related to this act, and
it directed the utilities to adjust their rates to reflect the repeal of
the franchise tax, and to also adjust their rates to reflect the
reduction in the corporate income tax. That order was appealed and on
October of 2014 the commission reversed its first order. After that
order, both of the natural gas public utilities in the state continued
to flow that reduction in the corporate income tax to its rate payers,
and two of the electric utilities in the state, Duke and Progress, also
continued to flow the reduction in the corporate income tax to its rate
payers. However, one, Dominion, did not pass those reductions on to rate
payers. What this section does is clarify the General Assembly&#39;s
intent and make it clear that all of the reduction in the corporate
income tax should be passed along to rate payers, and that&#39;s what
section 4 does. It also tells the commission that it must look at the
matter of interest, and it must add interest to any over-collection that
resulted from not passing on these savings to rate payers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Questions from the committee? Again, this
is a straightforward bill. Other than the section 4 and the section 24,
we had discussed, rehashed, and this has been around for over, for a
year now. Senator Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, I know the staff has been working with
the public staff from the Utility Commission. I see Mr. Ayers here.
Would you, can we ask a question of him, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. If Chris Ayers would take the mike back there?
Turn the mike on. Please, sir, state your name and who you&#39;re with
again for us?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My name is Chris Ayers. I&#39;m Executive Director of
the Utilities Commission Public Staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, can I have
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Ayers. I know you&#39;ve had an
opportunity to speak with our staff, but having looked at this
provision, are you, as Executive Director of Public Staff, comfortable
with the direction we&#39;re moving in this, and does it clearly
delineate the intent of the General Assembly to be sure that the rate
payers are the ones that should be receiving a benefit by the lowering
of the CIT?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, Senator Rucho. I have looked at the language. I
have vetted it with my staff. And I and the Public Staff are fine with
the language as it is presented here in the bill. We believe that this
does clarify the issue of whether or not the corporate tax decrease
should be passed on to rate payers through a reduction of rates. The
commission&#39;s order, or series of orders, last year, looked at the
specific language, concluded one section was clear, the other one was
not, and this clarifies that intention, we believe.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? No, sir. Senator Stein, I believe it is ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Two questions. One is do any
of these provisions have a fiscal impact and if so, is there a note that
shows whether they will have positive or negative impacts on our state
revenues?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, Jonathan Tart may want to add to this,
and we did not have a fiscal note. There are known revenue impacts.
Section 24 may have a slight revenue impact, but it would be
insignificant. We don&#39;t have any idea what it would be, but it would
be a very small amount, and Jonathan, please correct me if I&#39;m
wrong.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] These figures had no
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That&#39;s correct. It should be ?? impacting.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. One more question, Mr. Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up. Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Some of the members are new to the legislature this
time. Some of us are not on revenue laws and there are some of us who
may not remember everything we voted on last year. It would be very
helpful if staff could just give us a two-sentence on what each section
is so we know what we&#39;re voting on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right. Staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I will be happy to start that, and we have other
finance team members here. So if I get stuck on for a question,
they&#39;ll be happy to help me. As you recall, last year there were
changes made in the sales tax laws as to how the sales tax should apply
in retail contractor situations, such as Lowe&#39;s and Home Depot,
whether it&#39;s an installment purchase and that type of thing. Not
installment purchase, but a retail sale plus installation, or if
it&#39;s a performance contract. This is just some changes to the
effective date language to try to answer some of the questions that came
up after that legislation was enacted, and there&#39;s continued to be
conversations between the parties as they&#39;ve implemented that
legislative change. Also, as you recall last year, there were changes
made to the sales tax application of when the sales tax and

  in a court and the occupancy tax as well applies to the rental of homes.
That was the Southern Times, the golf tournament change. Section 2 is
just a clarification of that. Section 3 just repeals an unnecessary
provision. It was repealed in two different bills last time and this
just repeals one of those. Section 4, Heather has already explained.
Section 5 had to do with the new tax that this body put onto
E-Cigarettes, and this just makes a change that allows the manufacturers
to collect the tax on internet retail sales. The effective date is June
1, 2015, because that&#39;s when that law will come into effect. Section
6 has to do with the renewable energy tax credit, and right now
there&#39;s a difference between federal and state law as to when
something&#39;s put into service, and there is also a difference as to
who this right now is specific as to who puts it into service. I believe
that there&#39;s been sort of a misunderstanding of how that is supposed
to work. So what this does is just say the property has to be placed
into service. It doesn&#39;t really matter if it&#39;s the lessee or the
lessor. Section 7 is just correcting a codification problem. Section 8
just, out of, let me look at that. I&#39;m gonna ask one of my staff to
look at that and some other folks. Let me go to section 9. This just has
to say that if there has been an under-withholding of a tax or an
over-withholding of a tax because of the tax rate changes made in 2014,
that there will not be a penalty for that. This had to do with who is
allowed to take a standard deduction. The purpose of the legislation in
2013 was not to change who gets a standard deduction. If you&#39;re not
allowed a standard deduction at the federal level, you wouldn&#39;t get
one at the state level. And so that was the conforming change that was
made in House bill 1050. However, we didn&#39;t, the intent was that no
one would be penalized if they under- or over-withheld any wages, any
income tax, in that situation, and that&#39;s just making that change.
Section 10. This had to do with several of the changes that we made in
House bill 1050 as it has who is the retailer. And basically says that a
person, whoever has to collect the tax, is considered to be the
retailer. Section 11 just makes some conforming changes. Section 12 puts
in, clarifies that the exemption for piped natural gas, that it is, the
exemption from the sales tax includes piped natural gas. That is one of
the things that we incorporated into the sales tax statutes in 1050, so
these are current exemptions that are on the book, and the intent was
that fuel would include piped natural gas, and so this is just making it
clear by putting the words in so there was no misunderstanding. Section
13 has to do with the farm agricultural exemption. As you recall, there
was a $10,000, one of the changes on the farmer exemption is that you
have to actually have $10,000 of income from farming operations to be
eligible for the exemption. One of the things that we learned last
session is that gross income is based upon your net sales. So you could
have a situation where a person sells $20,000 worth of cattle, but they
had $15,000 in the cattle, so their net sales was only $5,000. But most
people would think that if a person sold $20,000 worth of cattle, they
would be a real farmer. So what we did in that section was to clarify
that gross income is your gross sales plus all other income. And we also
made a change there to address a situation where there is a person who
has a contract with a farmer to build their building and things. Under
the prior law, if there was

  <p id="15:00">
  the building being built, whoever was building that building, such as a
facility, was eligible to get the sales tax exemption. They did not have
to be a farmer. But when we began to put on this income restriction,
then there became some question, particularly like with a company such
as Hog Slats. It&#39;s building the facilities. It&#39;s a performance
contract. How do we handle that? So what the bill says on page 7,
beginning on line 39, is to say that if you&#39;re building this
facility for a farmer, and that farmer has an exemption certificate,
that contractor who is providing that building as a performance contract
for that farmer is entitled to the exemption to the same extent that the
person with whom he has the contract is exempt. Section 14 does two
things. It provides that a retailer who has an agreement with a food
service contractor, and this has to do with your meals that are provided
in your colleges and universities through your meal plans. That if a
retailer has an agreement with a food service contractor to collect and
remit the tax, that then that person, the retailer&#39;s not liable. One
of the two. There&#39;s an agreement that can be made between the
retailer and the food service contractor. Whoever agrees to collect the
tax is the one responsible for collecting and remitting it. Section 15
just makes a change as to who may apply for a certificate of
registration, so that it&#39;s consistent with changes made in other
legislation. And I will say by far the majority, if not all of these
changes, did come to the body through the Department of Revenue as it
looked to administer the tax laws. Section 16 is just making sure that
the statute is codified in the way it should be. This is truly just a
codification correction. Section 17. As you recall last year, through a
revenue law&#39;s proposal, the body changed how the central assessment
of mobile communications property would be assessed for taxation. Prior
to this change, it was assessed for tax at the local level. But that
area is becoming more complex as to how to assess that property.
It&#39;s very mobile. So what it did was put the assessment up to the
Department of Revenue level, up to the state level. The intent
wasn&#39;t to shift any revenues around, but just to change who assessed
the property, and that is just making sure that that intent was carried
through. And Section 18 has to do with the privilege license tax. Trina,
I&#39;m going to let Trina explain that one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is language that was in the privilege license tax
statute as it existed, and the utilities industry had relied on this
language in an issue that had nothing to do with privilege license tax,
but rather rights of way and fees, whether cities can charge fees for
rights of way, and they asked that this language be preserved. And what
it is is it says that in fact no fees or license tax can be imposed. So
the language is identical to the prohibition that is actually in the
current law, before the repeal takes effect. So it&#39;s just being
moved to another statute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Section 19 deals with the repeal of the franchise tax
on electricity and pipe natural gas. As you recall, that was repealed
and put in the sales tax base. The distribution for the last fiscal year
actually occurred in this fiscal year, and so this clarifies that the
Department of Revenue can use those sales tax revenues to make that
distribution. Section 20 just conforms to the federal law and codifies
the current practices by providing that the same standard deduction
amount for a surviving spouse is the same as for a married couple filing
jointly. And that you will see through section 20. Section 21 is just
putting in the definition of a related person that was repealed in a
different section. And section 22 would remove the reference to a
repealed statute and clarifying the personal income statutes of the
income of a partnership that&#39;s apportionable to multi-states is
allocated and apportioned according to the apportionment

  ...formula that we have. Section 23 is trying to address when the items
used for a service contract are exempt from tax and when they&#39;re
not. If the service contract is subject to tax, then the parts used are
not. However, with our one percent-- In subsection B  we are moving that
over to the one percent excise tax statute. If there&#39;s a service
contract on something that was subject to the one-percent tax, that
service contract is not subject to tax because the underlying product
was not subject to sales tax. So, in that instance, the repair parts
continue to be subject to tax and we put that language-- We wanted to
clarify the exemption -- what it applies to -- and we moved it into that
statute so that it would be, hopefully, clear to those who were
administering it. And then section 24 we&#39;ve gone over today.

Senator Stein, you&#39;re good. Senator Ford, you&#39;re okay. Now, that
segment of the law means &quot;favorable report&quot; where I come.
Well, I like where you come from. We have a motion for a favorable
report. We&#39;ve got a second over here by Senator Ron Rabin. End of
discussion? All right. All in favor aye.

Aye.

Favorable report to the PCS. Yes, sir, Senator [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. All
right. We&#39;ve got that. I don&#39;t see any nays so the bill is
passed. Members, tomorrow at one o&#39;clock we will have a discussion
of J-DIG and the ramifications thereof and therein. We&#39;ll get you an
annoucement out. Thank you.
