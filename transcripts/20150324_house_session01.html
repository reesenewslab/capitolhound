Allegiance.  Representative Martin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.  Please join me in prayer.  Dear Lord, thank you for this
day.  We are grateful for the opportunity to come before you with
thanksgiving for the many blessings you have given to each of us and
poured out on our great state and nation.  We are grateful also for the
opportunity to bring our requests to you.  Thank you for the gift of
your word, which provides truth and wisdom to guide us.  Isaiah 6:8 says
&quot;Whom shall I send?&quot; and the response. &quot;Here I am, Lord,
send me.&quot;  Romans 13:1 states &quot;We submit to governing
authorities because all authority comes from God.&quot; Esther 4:14 says
of a person placed in a position of influence, &quot;...that perhaps you
are here for such a time as this.&quot;  Lord, each of us has accepted
the call.  You have placed us in our current positions of authority.
Help us to recognize that we are here to serve your purpose for your
people.  As we face difficult situations, controversial decisions, and
divisive attacks, I pray that you will unite us through your Spirit.
Give us wisdom and discernment to take necessary actions in such a time
as this.  Help us to forgive as you have forgiven.  Let your Spirit so
fill us that our thoughts and actions reflect evidence of the fruit of
your Spirit, according to Galatians 5:22:  &quot;Love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and
self-control.&quot;  Lord, help us to do all that you require of us,
according to Micah 6:8: &quot;to do what&#39;s right, to love mercy, and
to walk humbly with your God.&quot;  We lift up Bob Brawley&#39;s wife
[??] and her family and ask that you, the Great Physician, be with them
at this time.  We lift up our families who are sacrificing to allow us
to serve, our military and their families, our government leaders at
every level, and all the people involved in any way in the work we are
trying to do here.  Bless them and keep them safe.  Thank you for the
privilege of praying in Jesus&#39; holy name.  Amen.

  —the Civil Service Board has been charged with reviewing and approving
appointments, promotions, and disciplinary actions involving sworn
police officers and firefighters in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police
Department, and the Charlotte Fire Department. One of the
responsibilities of that seven member Board is to conduct appeals
hearings in the event of disciplinary actions resulting in suspension,
demotion, or termination. There is an objective within the—or a stated
period of time—for the conduct of those appeals hearings being thirty
days. But that Board, given the requirement to have about a two or three
day hearing in each case, has a significant backlog of hearings, and the
waiting time to have the hearing concluded has become quite extended.
So the city of Charlotte requested a bill that would increase the size
of the Civil Service Board from seven members to nine, and empower the
City Council to further increase the Board size to eleven, if it should
choose to do so in the future. And the purpose is to bring that
time—that waiting time to have your appeals hearing concluded—down to a
more appropriate level. Mr. Speaker, I would be glad to answer
questions, but I yield back.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and this is just a conforming amendment because
the two amendments passed in the night, One [1] and Two [2]. When 1
passed before 2 did, it had the old number, this makes it conform to the
Cunningham Amendment, so there&#39;s no change, it&#39;s just a
conforming amendment, and I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s any
opposition. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

  <p id="015:00">
  Mr. Speaker, we have had some good amendments to this bill. There&#39;s
been a lot of good debate about this bill, and it&#39;s been a little
while before we talked about it before. But I did want to sort of remind
the body of some of the potential problems that are inherent with this
legislation. One of which is that we know that there was a figure that I
think Representative Leubke stated in the debate last week that spoke to
the fact that there are probably 4% of students who are without their
health care assessment, at the 30-day point into the school year. So
they&#39;re already in school, they do not have their health assessment,
and we risk the possibility of their being put out of school for this
now 60-days, until they can get the health assessment. And so many of us
are concerned, and when I say many of us I would suggest that all of us
are concerned about the ability for achievement levels to be reached
within a school year, and what we are essentially doing is making it
that much harder for our students to meet these deadlines learning
achievements levels all through the course of a school year. So
there&#39;s one hurdle. Another one is that we are looking at making it
difficult for poorer children to comply with this requirement. We know
that there&#39;s a backlog at the Health Department right now, today,
for children looking to get that health assessment done in time to meet
what will be this new requirement in the law. And so I stand here today
just to tell you of my reservations about this legislation, and ask you
all to think about whether or not you might have some reservations about
this legislation, and to let you know that based on these question marks
that I have, I will have to vote no on this bill. Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. If not, the question before
the House is the passage of the House Committee Substitute for House
Bill 13 on its third reading. So many favoring passage of the bill will
vote aye, those opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the vote.
[PAUSE] The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. 92 having
voted in the affirmative and 23 in the negative, the House Committee
Substitute to House Bill 13 passes its third reading. The bill is
ordered engrossed and sent to the Senate. House Bill 173, the clerk will
read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representatives Stam, Faircloth, Glazier and R.
Turner, House Bill 173, a bill to be entitled An Act to Amend Various
Criminal Laws with the Purpose of Improving Trial Court Efficiency. The
General Assembly of North Carolina enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what
purpose does the gentleman from Wake, Representative Stam, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
has the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and
gentlemen, I believe it was last Wednesday we passed this on second
reading. I believe 116 votes. Representative Glazier has worked with
Representative Bishop to offer an amendment which I consider relatively
technical and they know a whole lot more about it than I did, anyway. So
I encourage you to vote for it, and if you have further questions I had
a couple of questions from other members about a particular section and
I believe we&#39;ve got that resolved so any further questions, I&#39;ll
be glad to answer. And I would ask that either Representative Glazier or
Bishop. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from
Cumberland, Representative Glazier, rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To set forth
an amendment, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized
to set forth an amendment. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier moves to amend the bill on page 8, line 34, by
rewriting the line to read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman from
Cumberland has the floor to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and credit to Representative Bishop who caught
this. This is a change in the rules of evidence in North Carolina in
both civil and criminal cases and we were trying when this was drafted,
to track the federal rule but the federal rule used a term called
certification that there is no North Carolina equivalent to directly.
But we call what amounts as close to certification, a document under
seal. So you&#39;ll see

our terminology, and we also ran it by several evidence professors at
law schools to make sure about this. I know of no opposition, and I
appreciate again Representative Bishop catching this. Thank you.

Representatives L. Johnson, Glazier, Holloway, and Horn, House Bill 29,
a bill to be entitled: an Act to Make Organizational and Technical
Changes to the Courses of Study Statutes, Johnson of North Carolina

[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
For what purpose does the lady from Cabarrus, Representative Johnson,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Johnson]
To speak on the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
The lady has the floor to debate the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Johnson]
Ladies and gentlemen, about last October, Representatives Glazier, and
Holloway, and Horn, and I realized that we hadn&#39;t had a cleanup of
our Course of Study statutes in twenty years. So we decided that since
we were in the interim, we would work on that. And that&#39;s exactly
what this Bill is, just a cleanup, and I wanna thank all of those who
did not add their amendments to it, so that we could clearly call this a
technical bill. And, Mr. Speaker, I think Representative Glazier has a
couple of bullet points to speak to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland, Representative
Glazier, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Glazier]
To briefly debate the Bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Glazier]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and, again, thanks to staff. This, actually,
really is pretty important. It&#39;s all technical but it consolidates
in one place in the statutes the substantive contents of all the
curriculum. Issues, and directives that we have had in multiple
different statutes to school systems, so now you can tell your
constituents, and we can tell our school boards, that there&#39;s one
place in the statues that you can find everything. It does three other
things, though. One: It eliminates the reference to the Basic Education
Plan, which has long been defunct, and ought not have stayed in the
statute— but does still keep in the requirement that the state put in
place, whatever the curriculum will be, whenever that&#39;s decided, so
that that&#39;s clear. It also keeps our commitment, as we have to
constitutionally, to fund as needed schools to make sure we meet our
constitutional mandates, so that language hasn&#39;t changed. And then
you&#39;ll see some clarifying language that isn&#39;t substantive
change, but where we&#39;ve changed terminology over the years and the
statute hasn&#39;t caught up with it? That change is made consistent all
the way through the statutes. I know of no objection to the BIll, it
really has been a work by staff, and Representative Johnson,
Representative Horn, and Representative Holloway, and Representative
Stam as well, I want to thank because his office read through the Bill
as well. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Gilford, Representative
Brockman, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Brockman]
To ask that my vote be recorded as aye on the last vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
The gentleman will be recorded as having voted aye on the previous Bill.
For what purpose does the gentleman from Craven, Representative

[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Speciale]

[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Those oppose will say no, the ayes have it, and the House Committee
Substitute for House Bill 29 passes its third reading and will be sent
to the Senate. House Bill 82, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representatives Stevens, Zachary, Glazier, and Jordan, the House Bill
82: A bill to be entitled an act clarifying the manner in which a law
enforcement officer may take custody of a juvenile when executing a
nonsecure custody order under the laws pertaining to abuse, neglect, and
dependency. The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the lady from Surry, Representative Stevens raise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, the members of the house I think the first thing
I found in the committee is I needed to explain about a nonsecure
custody order is, a nonsecure custody order is when the Department of
Social Services has found that a child is in danger of continual abuse,
they go to the judge and the judge then issues an order to have that
child picked up and move to place of safety, the first thing they are
supposed to do is social services tries to work with a family to give a
safety plan, and they say, “Would you be wiling to put them in a foster
care or would you be willing to put them with another relative?” So they
explain that when they don’t get any satisfaction in that way they go to
the court and get a nonsecure custody order. This statue amends that to
say that as part of that nonsecure custody order the judge if they hear
evidence of exigent circumstances, emergency circumstances can direct
that law enforcement go into the house even by forcible entry and
physically take the child, to take the child to a point of safety, but
it has to be again specifically authorize by judge, it’s not been in
statue before and apparently they have had some situations particularly
in Cumberland County where this became important to be able to go
immediately and get child with somebody ??. So I would ask for your
support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion further debate? If not, the question before the house
is the passage of the House Bill 82 on its second reading, I will call
on the gentleman on third reading with the question. The passage of
House Bill 82 on its second reading, so many favoring passage of the
bill will vote aye, those oppose will vote no, the clerk will open the
vote. Representatives…

  The members wish to record on this vote? The clerk will lock the machine
and record the vote. 113 having voted in the affirmative and one in the
negative, House bill 82 passes its second reading. The, does the
gentleman from Craven wish to object to third reading to debate the
bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just want to debate. I don&#39;t want to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman&#39;s objection to third reading is noted with, without
objection the speaker, the, strike that. The bill is on for third
reading. The gentleman from Craven, Representative Speciale is
recognized to debate the bill. Clerk will read the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
General assembly of North Carolina and acts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Now the gentleman from Craven has the floor to debate the bill a third
time, from the third reading.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;d like to ask a question of the bill sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady from Surry yield to the gentleman from Craven?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I didn&#39;t fully understand the answer to this question in committee,
so I&#39;m gonna ask it again, okay? Officers have the authority already
in exigent circumstances to go into that house and take that child. I
don&#39;t understand what the purpose of this bill is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I respond? Exigent circumstances can be very different things in a
child abuse case, and it can be that this child has been seriously
injured and that they&#39;re simply hiding them. That can be the basis
the judge finds for it to be exigent circumstances to allow law
enforcement to go straight in. In committee, we talked about exigent
circumstances, you get there, somebody&#39;s screaming. You get there,
and with children, sometimes you don&#39;t know if their screams are
play or if their screams are fun, but you&#39;ve got a pretty dramatic
situation already, and it may be that the family&#39;s just hiding this
child and refusing to come to the door. It may be that one parent has
the child physically held captive while the other parent refuses to come
to the door. It could be any number of circumstances, but we can&#39;t
define all those circumstances, which is why we leave it to the judge to
determine that there&#39;s something especially a problem in this case
that you need the authority to go in and get them right away.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland, Representative
Glazier arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill, mister speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker, and I agree completely with Representative
Stevens but would add this point. The law is, as Representative Speciale
suggested, under the domestic 50A law. That is, the provisions we&#39;re
looking at are under 50A-311, but they were never added to the juvenile
code, so it&#39;s taking what we have in one area and saying it&#39;s
got to apply here, and that&#39;s just been sort of a gap that&#39;s
existed, but it is exactly the provisions that we allow in out of state
custody orders being transferred to the juvenile court. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Craven, Representative Speciale
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To request to change my vote from a no to a yes on that one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman will be recorded as having voted yes on the second reading
of House bill 82. Further discussion, further debate? If not, the
question before the House is the passage of House bill 82 on its third
reading. So many favoring passage of the bill will say aye. Those
opposed will say no. The ayes have it, and House bill 82 passes its
third reading and will be sent to the Senate. The chair would just
remind the members, once the question is put, I&#39;m supposed, the
chair is supposed to end debate at that point, but the chair has a
couple of times noticed where folks have turned their lights on right as
the chair was putting the question. I would request members if members
know they&#39;re gonna debate the bill to go ahead and have their lights
on so that we&#39;ll know. House bill 106, the clerk will read. Strike
that, the bill&#39;s been removed from today&#39;s calendar. House bill
146, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representatives Lambeth, Jones, Conrad, and Ross. House bill 146, a bill
to be entitled an act enabling the need to have advanced health care
directives to health care power of attorneys signed in the presence of
two witnesses and acknowledged before a notary public and instead
allowing the execution by either signature, the presence of two
witnesses, or acknowledgment before a notary public. General assembly of
North Carolina and acts.

For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake, Representative Stam rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have an amendment. Perhaps you might want to recognize a sponsor
first.

We&#39;ll do that. We&#39;ll come back to you, Representative Stam. For
what purpose does the gentleman from Forsyth, Representative Lambeth
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.

  <p id="035:00">
  Advanced DIrective is also known as the Living Will, in which a person
specifies which actions are to be taken regarding their health if
they&#39;re no longer able to make decisions on their own. Because the
documents are essential for effective planning and end-of-life
decisions, North Carolina, like many states, has statutory forms which
can be completed by laypersons. North Carolina is one of only four
states that require a notary AND two witnesses to execute the document.
In North Carolina, among other conditions, a qualified witness may not
be a relative of the person signing the document, a member of the
signer&#39;s medical team, or an employee of a treatment provider or
nursing facility where the signer resides. Because conversations
regarding healthcare planning often occur in hospitals, it can be
extremely difficult to find two witnesses who are non-family members or
healthcare staff and a notary public— especially if the patient wants to
complete the documents at night or during the weekend.
In the 44 states that do not require a notary, there does not appear to
have been a pattern of abuse. I have a number of support letters across
the state to support this change. This Bill simply allows the word
&#39;and&#39; to be changed to &#39;or&#39; so it allows an individual
to use a notary OR two witnesses. I know Representative Jordan has some
concern with this Bill, and I want to allow him an opportunity to make
those comments— and then I recognize that Representative Stam has a
Amendment that I do support, by the way. I encourage you to support this
Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
Members, on the motion of the gentleman from Rutherford, Representative
Hager, the Chair would like to extend the courtesies of the gallery to a

For what purpose does the representative from Ashe, Representative
Jordan, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Jordan]
To debate the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Jordan]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I have the greatest respect for the sponsors of
this Bill. I want to start with, first of all, I don&#39;t know why he
said it would be a simple Bill. What we&#39;re dealing with here today
are documents called Advanced Directives. They are extremely important
documents that convey certain important rights that we have to others,
to our agents. If you will look at the Bill, itself, you can see some
statutory forms of what these documents look like. I&#39;m gonna point
to—
[crosstalk]
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
??... if the gentleman from Ashe would please suspend. I&#39;m noticed
some rule breakers so, in that case, we&#39;re gonna suspend Rule 12.
The gentleman has the floor to continue debating the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Jordan]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Some of the language that are in these
Healthcare Power of Attorney or Living Will, which are both Advanced
Directives, set out how important this is. One of them, the Healthcare
Power of Attorney, says, &quot;This document gives the person you
designate as your healthcare agent, broad powers to make healthcare
decisions for you when you cannot make the decision yourself, or cannot
communicate your decision to other people. You should discuss your
wishes concerning life prolonging measures, mental health treatment, and
other healthcare decisions, with your healthcare agent.&quot;
The other document—you may have heard of it as a DNR, Directive for
Natural Death or Living Will: &quot;You can use this Advanced Directive
to give instructions for the future if you want your healthcare
providers to withhold or withdraw life prolonging measures in certain
situations. You should talk to your doctor about what these terms mean.
The Living Will states what choices you would have made for yourself if
you were able to communicate. Talk to your family members, friends, and
others you trust about your choices. Also, it is a good idea to talk
with professionals such as your doctors, clergypersons, and lawyers
before you complete and sign this LIving Will.&quot;
This is not a simple bill. Advanced Directives are extremely important
and if you have not seen the language in these documents, and you do not
have these documents for yourself, I would plead with you to get these
documents in place, for you and for your families. Get them in place.
You never know when something might happen. I&#39;m an attorney in a
small mountain community and I do several dozen of these actual
documents ever year. And when this proposal came up, it struck a nerve
with me, and that&#39;s why I immediately responded, that&#39;s why
I&#39;m standing—

  <p id="040:00">
  here debating what has been claimed to be a simple bill.  It absolutely
is not.  These documents are executed to protect important decisions
regarding life and health, made by an individual while they’re in full
control of their capacity to make such decisions.
A secondary reason/purpose is to protect from liability any healthcare
worker who follows these directives.  So these documents are to protect
folks.  They are to protect the people who are executing the documents
and they are to protect the healthcare workers who are dealing with
these situations and dealing with these documents.
As such, it is in the best interest of the individual as well as the
healthcare profession to make sure that such directives are done in a
complete and voluntary manner.
You’ve heard the bill’s sponsors say what we are given here is basically
a choice.  The current law says that you have to have two things at the
end, a notary, which tells you that the person signing this document is
who they say the are; you also need two witnesses to sign.  Well, the
two witnesses are there to say yeah, this person wasn’t completely
raving and out of their mind, that nobody took their hand and made them
write their signature, and that it doesn’t seem like they were being
coerced by anyone.
And that’s what’s important about this choice here.  You need both of
these things.  You need a notary and you need two witnesses, both.
That’s why this state has it because it protects everyone.  And I really
don’t care how many other states don’t do it.  It’s irrelevant to me.
The right thing, the thing that I’ve seen in my practice over years is
that you need both of these because you never know when a healthcare
worker is going to be faced with a document that was not signed by the
person it purports to have been.
Having a notary there helps to protect against that.  Nothing guarantees
stopping fraud, but having a notary making sure that person is who they
say they are.  The two witnesses give you some objective people who are
they, who are not part of the healthcare facility, who are not relatives
of the person, who can say this person seemed like they were rational,
they were in their right mind.  And so I think they were not being
coerced, they did it voluntarily.
Notary is a pretty easy thing to get.  It’s a two-day course or two
evening course, a book and then your stamp is good for five years.
Attorneys can become notaries without passing the written exam, although
when I took mine I was in law school, so I did have to pass the exams.
And it’s not hard to have a notary on staff of a large healthcare
facility or any healthcare facility.  I think most of your admitting
personnel could be a notary.
Finding two witnesses is sometimes complicated, as you heard the bill
sponsor say.  Coming from a small law office, I agree, it can be.  But
we’re dealing with something that’s very important and so you plan and
you get those in place.  I’ve been to visit people at their homes in the
mountains, and taken these things to repair, extra copies of the
document, bring a notary, make sure their witnesses are available, some
neighbors.  So these things can be planned for.
What I do not want to see us do is change something that may not have
seemed important to you at first.  I hope I’m explaining that it is
important.  I do not want to see us change this for the convenience of
anyone.  This is a protection for the people who are executing these
documents.  We need both of these.
They serve completely different requirements.  And I would say make it
some of the most protective language in the country.  Do you want to see
yourself strip the protective language away from our elderly, our sick,
our infirm and see fraud occur more often than it already is without
having a notary requirement, without having two witnesses.
From my small county, I’ve actually seen this kind of fraud.  You
wouldn’t believe the kinds of family situations you might see.  And I
know there are family members who would take Momma or Daddy to get him
to sign some document at the bank--just sign this thing, it’s not
real--it’s not a big deal, just sign it and have it notarized.  And it
gives away very important, valuable rights.
This is just the DNRs, just the advance directives.  So to strip it back
around, this is not a simple bill.  This is a bill where we’re deciding
if you pull away protections for our citizens.  We can plan for having a
notary.  We can plan for having two witnesses to get these things
signed.  People ought to really, to come down to the bottom line, they
really need to get these things done before they’re in the hospitals,
before they’re in healthcare situations.  That’s why I want you all to
start by making sure you do it and tell your constituents to get it done
because then you can visit an attorney and it doesn’t cost much.

Let&#39;s leave the law the way it is. There&#39;s no compelling reason
to change it, the only reason I&#39;ve seen is convenience, but the
downside is dramatic and I hope I&#39;ve led you to understand that. I
hope I&#39;ve led you to read some of these documents. If you&#39;re

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Johnston, Representative
Daughtry, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members, this bill came through Judiciary I. It
was unanimously voted in favor, everybody voted in favor of the bill. We
had witnesses who testified that everybody should plan for their demise,
we all are going to die, but there is something about that that we
don&#39;t do. So we wind up in the hospital, in critical condition on
some occasions, and that person who is sick wants a living will, he
wants to plan, and while you&#39;re in the hospital you&#39;ve got to
find a notary and two disinterested witnesses. That is sometimes
difficult. The hospitals say it&#39;s very difficult. All this does is
let you have a notary or two witnesses to make the instrument valid. It
is, I know of no opposition to it in our committee and I strongly urge
you to vote for this very common sense bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the lady from Randolph, Representative Hurley,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask the bill sponsor a question, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Forsyth yield to the lady from Randolph?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, I&#39;m over this way. As a clerk, a Deputy Clerk in the
Clerk of Courts Office, we have seen where it has been forged and there
are other things happening and with people printing today we don&#39;t
always know that it is the person. I just wondered if you could pull
this and maybe have discussion. I&#39;m sorry, I have not had a chance
to really look at that, I&#39;ve been a little bit busy. I just felt
like, you know, I&#39;m not doing anything disrespectful, I just
wondered if you could possibly pull it and maybe discuss it. I think it
may be a good bill and it may be convenient but I&#39;ve seen things
that can really happen bad in this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My suggestion would be, if you object to third reading and we&#39;d have
an opportunity to discuss it further, but I&#39;d like to go ahead and
get a vote today if we could.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland, Representative
Glazier, arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
First, to see if Representative Lambeth might yield for a question and
then perhaps to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Representative Lambeth, when I first read it,
and I certainly understand the reason for the bill, but I am real
concerned about the point that Representative Jordan makes and that now
Representative Hurley&#39;s made, and from my practice as well, because
I used to do some of this work, and I do think Representative
Jordan&#39;s made the point about the two distinct issues between
witnesses and notaries, so my question first is, what&#39;s the
protection if we take the witnesses out for the sort of, for lack of a
better term, sanity or competency determination? Because the notary
doesn&#39;t give that. So I&#39;m wondering what the substitute would be
in that circumstance if the witnesses are out of the picture.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I&#39;d have to tell you that I&#39;ve worked in a hospital where
this actually was a real issue and I would attest that the witnesses
don&#39;t necessarily do that either. They often, because this often
happens late shifts, early mornings, which really is hard to find a
non-employee witness, that they will approach someone walking down the
hall and they asked him to simply come in. So, while I know from a legal
standpoint that may be a concern, the practical side when witnesses are
often asked, they don&#39;t do that. They&#39;re just simply looking at
a signature that know that that person who actually signed it signed
that document.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Thank you, Representative Lambeth. This is a tough call
because I think Representative Lambeth makes the oint about, and
Representative Daughtry did, the Speaker did earlier on convenience, but
I&#39;m really concerned here that there&#39;s no

so if you have your advance health care detective done  in 46 other
states it&#39;s but not in north Carolina so you know i agree a lot ??
Representative Jordan said and one thing i would certainly agree with is
that everyone should have  living will it is best for the person in

  and I can see that you care deeply about your clients who may come to
you to fill out these forms. Is there anything in this bill that would
prevent you or any other attorney, even though it would not be mandated
to have both witnesses and a notary, to perhaps advise your clients that
that would be a safeguard. Is there anything in this bill that would

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. May I also debate the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. This bill has really come at the request of those
institutions, as Representative Lambeth mentioned, hospitals, hospice,
where individuals don&#39;t do as Representative Jordan suggested, plan
for the future, but it&#39;s a crisis situation. And with so many people
omitted as being qualified to be as witnesses, whether it&#39;s the
doctor, the hospital personnels, or relatives, there are often very few
other options in a hospital or hospice situation to find those
individuals. More often they may be visitors of someone else who&#39;s
sick. So they are not people that would actually know the patient, to
know about the situation that their in, and their dealing with their own
crisis with a relative and to impose on them to be a witness in a
different situation, sometimes it&#39;s very difficult to approach
people. So I would ask for your support for the bill and that, as
Representative Jordan said, if there&#39;s any attorneys that have
concern with it and wanted to advise their clients to take extra
precautions, that&#39;s certainly justified.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Cabarrus, Representative
Pittman, arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I&#39;m going to speak to you a moment from
personal experience. When my Mother, when we realized her mind was
starting to go I managed to get her power of attorney but she never
would give me medical power of attorney and by this time, it has been
long since, that she&#39;s not competent to give it. It would be really
convenient for me if I could get it without her approval or that sort of
thing but I wouldn&#39;t want to take that chance and I&#39;ll tell you
why, I know of a young man and his wife who, when his Grandmother was
declining, getting near the end of her life, managed to move in with her
and proceeded to rob her blind, stole all kinds of stuff out of her
house and sold it and spent a lot of it on drugs, not legitimate drugs.
Medication that was intended for her they took and sold. A lot of food
that was brought in, it was intended for her, they ate, and virtually
starved her to death. His Grandmother was my Uncle&#39;s wife. So it was
my cousin that did that. I shudder to think, with me living five hours
away from my Mother, what he might have done, he and his wife, if they
could have gotten in with my Mother, gotten a hold of her. I don&#39;t
want to make it any easier for anybody to weasel their way in and do
something like this and so I ask you not to vote for this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake, Representative Pendleton,
arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I stand to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have been an estate planning ward for 38 years and also happen to have
served on a hospital board but I am opposed to this bill, if for no
other reason than the people in this room, for you and your families. If
you go in to a hospital and you don&#39;t have a living will or power of
attorney, whatever, you go in to a hospital and they go get two people
in the hall to sign this is you, well first of all the patient&#39;s not
going to have any ID, most likely the patient will have no ID, so these
people are signing this thing not even with proof that that is the real
human being. This is greatly increase fraud among people who have been
married two or more times, two or more times. So I would encourage us
not to change the laws that now exist. It protects you and your
families. Thank you.

question, if I many? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jordan, do you
yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;m
particularly interested in this subject because I had health care power
of attorney for my father before he passed when he was 96, and I
encourage people in doing future planning every day when I work with
them to put these in place. Health care directives and advanced
directives and those kind of things. And I wanted to ask you, do you
know how often financial exploitation and fraud occurs in the states
that have passed this type of legislation versus North Carolina?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t. I only practice in North
Carolina so that&#39;s the only state, and of course my portion of the
state is the only portion of the state I could speak to. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Would you give [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You
yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Could you give a couple more specific examples
of how fraud and financial exploitation can occur if we pass this bill,
because I&#39;m concerned about it too? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you
Representative Farmer-Butterfield. My explanation would be related to
what Representative Michaux was discussing. If someone is able to get a
power over someone to be their health care agent, and they were not,
they did it fraudulently, while that person was under anesthesia or
undergoing some procedure, and the doctors discovered other episodes,
other things going on, that health care agent makes the decision whether
they should proceed with those other items or bring the person out of
anesthesia. And someone who is wanting to move along to the estate
portion of someone&#39;s life could make a decision based on that
self-interest. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman
from Gaston, Representative Baumgartner, arise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask
Representative Jordan a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Jordan, do you yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield to all inquiries.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jordan, did you just say that you
don&#39;t know what other three states have laws similar to ours?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That&#39;s correct. I do not know the other states.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You don&#39;t know whether Florida [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, sorry. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It&#39;s hard for me to ask you a
question to ask him, sorry. But follow up. You don&#39;t know whether
Florida&#39;s one of those states? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That&#39;s right, I
do not. [SPEAKER CHANGES] That&#39;s my question. I happen to know they
have a lot of practice in this area, and a lot of expertise and you
know, this bill to me is a, can I debate the bill now, sorry? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] You have the floor to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you. This is close and this is not that easy a decision to make on
whether to say it&#39;s okay to lessen the requirements for getting this
done. And so if what we&#39;ve been doing is working, then we might be
making a change for the sake of change. I understand that some of the
hospitals may want to change it and make it easier because it could be a
problem for them if it&#39;s so easy to get a notary then maybe they
want to keep one around on every shift, just in case they need one. I
don&#39;t know. It&#39;s just a thought I had. But I don&#39;t think I
could support this bill at this time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker?

Yes sir. I don&#39;t want to delay the debate any longer than we need

discussed would not change, if you want to have fraud, you can create a
situation where there will be fraud. I do believe this is a change that
would make it easier for advanced directives in a hospital or other
healthcare setting environment. But because the debate has gone on and

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill at great length. To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The person has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, members of the House, the almost definition of democracy is
the acts of the majority are the acts of the group. A Supreme Court--a
North Carolina Supreme Court case cites Jefferson Manual,
Jefferson&#39;s Manual of 1801, for this proposition: &quot;The voice of
the majority decides for the lex majoris partis is the law of all
councils, elections, et cetera, when not otherwise expressly
provided.&quot; So that, for example, you all remember the huge tax
increase in 1993, passed by two votes in the U.S. House, and one vote in
the U.S. Senate. The IRS will collect those taxes as vigorously as taxes
which passed unanimously. Democracy with a small &quot;d&quot; is what
we have. But, because we&#39;re also a republic, we have protections for
the minorities, to protect their fundamental rights. So, for example, if
we want to do away with the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution,
those who don&#39;t like the decisions therein, they realize that they
have to have a constitutional amendment, proposed by two-thirds of the
U.S. House, two-thirds of the U.S. Senate, and ratified by 38 states. In
North Carolina, to pass a constitutional amendment, is three-fifths
here, three-fifths in the Senate, plus a majority of the voters. North
Carolina law requires a majority vote for the approval of a special or
conditional use through quasi-judicial proceedings. So we can amend our
constitution, approve special uses, with a substantially smaller vote
than what one individual or two individuals or a group of individuals
can trigger for a rezoning. I shared a true story with the local
government committee. I&#39;d like to share it with you as well. When I
was seven or eight years old, I lived in Greensboro. A couple of blocks
away, I had a wonderful tree house that I really enjoyed playing in
every day. And I came home one day to find the tree cut, a house being
built. For those of you in Greensboro, this was the corner of Edgewater
and Homewood, right by Friendly Shopping Center. And I came home,
bitterly complaining to my

  mother, that they had taken down my tree, and that this should not be
allowed to happen. And she very wisely told me that when I grew up, I
could buy my own tree, and be in charge of my own tree, and that until I
was able to do that I should stop crying about it and grow up. Which I
did. People always like to control other people&#39;s property. It&#39;s
a universal tendency. And there&#39;s ways to control other people&#39;s
property. Restrictive covenants, easements, half a dozen other legal
ways to control other people&#39;s property. But to do that, you have to
have a legal right to do it, and it&#39;s precisely because neighbors
often have no legal right to control other people&#39;s property, that
they want to do it through this super-majority requirement that&#39;s in
our protest petition law today, that&#39;s been there about 90 years.
But whatever may have been the reason 90 years ago, it no longer
applies. For the last 26 years, property owners have been able to tailor
their rezoning requests as a conditional use, to provide a better fit
within the specific environments of their site, and many city councils
require that, and just won&#39;t pass it without that. Many local
governments now require applicants to meet with not only adjacent
owners, but also those within a large area, to inform them of the
request and to solicit their input, which can be addressed in the form
of conditions. If the protest petition 90 years ago was envisioned as a
means of leveling the playing field and assuring notification of and
input from adjacent owners, then current practices more than suffice.
Rezonings today don&#39;t take months, they take long, long periods,
sometimes years. Which sometimes cause the projects to fail, not because
the property owner doesn&#39;t want to do it, not because a majority of
the elected council members don&#39;t want to do it, but because a
minority of the council don&#39;t want to do it. That&#39;s not
democratic government, that&#39;s rule by minority. If you were going to
have a different vote for a rezoning than a majority, it would make more
sense to say that it shall be rezoned unless three-fourths of the
council supported it. Because the property owner actually has the
fundamental right to use the property, whereas the neighbors do not. If
they had wanted to have a fundamental right with regard to the property,
they would have bought that right or inherited it or traded for it,
which, by definition, they hadn&#39;t. Our state supreme court, a couple
of years ago, in High Rock Lake Partners vs. NCDOT said this: To confirm
that we all enjoy &quot;due process rights that protect property owners
from state delegations of power that give neighbors the authority to
regulate the way another person uses his or her property.&quot; The
protest petition law we have flies in the face of this principle. Now,
the bill itself was before this body two years ago, and as part of
another bill, passed by about 85 to 25 or something like that. I think
that this bill is an improvement on what this House has already passed,
because in the first part of the bill, on page one, we make clear that
not only adjacent owners, but anybody in the city can protest a zoning
change, and that that protest will be brought to the attention of the
council if they just get it two days early. Not just the people who
happen to border it. What it doesn&#39;t do is allow this minority of
the citizens to change democracy into something less than a democracy by
saying that you have to have a three-fourths vote to do it. In
section--on page two of the bill, repeals the sections about giving the
three-fourths vote. Section 3 is just a conforming change. Section 4 is
what it is. Section 5 fixes a problem. This only applies to cities, by
the way. Counties, 99 counties don&#39;t have this protest.

  vote provision for their zoning, but cities also have a very strange
provision, and it&#39;s on page two, line 31-34, &quot;in all other
cases a failure to vote by a member who is physically present in the
council chamber or who has withdrawn without being excused by majority
vote of members present shall be recorded as an affirmative vote.&quot;
That is weird. To say that just because you stepped out to use the
restroom or you decided to leave early that you&#39;re in favor of
whatever somebody happens to put before you. That&#39;s giving a power
of attorney like nothing you&#39;ve ever seen before, it doesn&#39;t
have to even be for the benefit of the person giving it, it&#39;s just
whoever wants to use it. So I didn&#39;t dare to take that sentence out
for all purposes, because I didn&#39;t want this bill to be about that
but we say that in case of re-zonings that that rule doesn&#39;t apply.
The reason I say that is if we&#39;re going to go from a 3/4 vote to a
majority vote, it ought to at least be a true majority because,
theoretically under current law if it was a majority vote, actually one
person could be in favor, two could be against, and the motion passes
because two people happen to walk out. So that&#39;s part of the
improvement of the bill, section 5 in the beginning parts. I urge you to
vote for it and am looking forward to the debate. Thank you, Mr.

For what purpose does the gentleman from Catawba, Representative Adams,
arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sometimes it&#39;s helpful to hear a real world experience related to a
bill, and I&#39;ll give you mine. In 1997 in Hickory, North Carolina I,
together with partners, built an office building, a three-story office
building just north of town. People said, &quot;Why are you doing that,
there are no other multi-story office buildings there.&quot; We said,
&quot;That&#39;s why we&#39;re doing it, because there are no office
buildings there.&quot; We built it and we filled it up fairly quickly.
In 1999, because of the growth that Catawba County was experiencing, I
was appointed to be on a committee called Hickory By Choice, and for 30
months, for nearly three years, we worked on a land development plan
that would outline how our city would grow. We came up with a quadrant
plan for big box development where big box development would occur in
the perimeter of our city in the four quadrants. The area across the
street from my office building was specifically designated as a
neighborhood core for retail development that would address the needs of
the local neighborhoods, that was in 1999 through 2001. But
unfortunately, in the beginning of 2000, we began to see a decline and
by 2007 a developer came in and wanted to rezone the property across my
office building for a big box development, specifically what we had
denied in our development plan. Of course I was upset about it, but
because of my relationship with my partners I did not file a protest
petition, however another neighbor did. He filed a protest petition, it
was going to hold up this project. For a number of months there was a
big debate, lawyers were involved, and finally the protest petition was
withdrawn after a six-figure check was written, high six-figure check
was written. So the protest petition served to put a lot of money in one
man&#39;s pocket, it delayed the project for a period of time, but it
was ineffective. I&#39;m going to support this bill. This is the right
thing to do. Protest petitions are ineffective and have been
misconstrued.

You have the floor to debate the bill, thank you. Another real life
example, back to 10 years as a Mayor I dealt with this issue twice and
I’m gonna one use one example that someone maybe to the one that you
just heard that this one is a little different and I think I really it
underscores the problem with the super majority vote, we had a piece of
property that was located in my city, on the other side of a double
sided highway, double sided highway with a median, and a developer had
come in to develop this property and to what the process had determined
because it went through planning and zoning, it went through the whole
process, and eventually it went to the city council, it met all of the
land use requirements. So it was justified in the rezoning request that
came up that we had one neighbor across the highway that follow protest
petition and stop the project. And here where the problem comes in, we
had a five member council, we had one council member that had developed
a serious illness and was out for roughly nine months with his illness.
So we had a protest petition which meant that we had to have 100% of the
remaining four of those on the council in order to move forward. We had
to count the empty seat because he was still an active council member
even though he was I don’t know at the hospital and not present.
Ultimately, that member, we lost that member, he died the next year and
process to replacing him went on and this whole process goes so long
that ultimately the development drive up in one way, we lost it. The
second time this happened when I was elected to come down here and they
are trying to replace my seat and a similar answer, very similar to the
one I just described. Now, I have received a lot of communication from
people that have been telling me that they are loosing their ability to
protest and that’s not exactly true in all of our cities where you have
planning and zoning boards, these are open to the public and the purpose
for these planning and zoning boards is to hear comments from the public
that’s what it’s all about. And then if they don’t like what the
planning and zoning boards says they don’t like the decision then they
can go before the for council and in that point in time the majority of
the council should be able to make a decision if they don’t like that
then obviously they have an election coming up the next term around but
the process of requiring a super majority when there are circumstances
that come up like we had just makes it impossible and for that reason I
will be supporting the bill.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, it’s often said that my freedom ends where your
nose begins and I think this is a clear example of what we are talking
about, we have an issue where a landowner has bought of his property and
he had developed it whether it’s for business or a home, as you have
heard here, and he’s been allowed to do it under certain set of zoning
conditions then years later on the joining neighboring landowner comes
along and wants to develop his property but he wants to rezone it
because he’s got a different idea about what he like to build on his
property. And 92 years ago, the elective officials in this state
recognized two things—they recognized they needed to have a process
where the first landowner had the right to defend the value of his
property and defend it loudly, and they also recognized a common human
feeling that our founding fathers recognized when they drafted our
constitution and that’s the human nature that we are all born with and
the conditions when we get into business, we build power basis and we
build networks, and sometimes those worker gives the little, the one
landowner…

  The two landowners, maybe at the joining property, and what I&#39;m
offering today because you&#39;re saying this is such an egregious
hindrance to development is an amendment that would remove the
requirement for a small percentage, five percent, to two-thirds. And
moving from a super majority to a two thirds vote of the council, and
I&#39;d like to give you some statistics, because I have quite a bit of
experience with this particular issue. I have been alongside
constituents in my district for two years as they have defended their
neighborhood from a very large retail development that is going to
impact their neighborhood in very unfair and in some cases, I feel,
dangerous ways, not just for their property values but also for the
traffic that it&#39;s adding to their area. In defending their right to
a protest petition, they did some research here in Raleigh and just to
give you an idea of how terrible protest petitions are, in 2014 there
were 22 rezoning requests in Raleigh, and only one of them had a valid
protest petition filed. In a five year period from 2010 to 2014, out of
119 rezoning requests, 104 were approved. That&#39;s more than 87%. In
Charlotte, theirs were only denied 3% of the time. I would like for you
to support the amendment simply because it gives power to the people who
develop their property, thinking that one use and one value would be
assigned to it for their entire lifetime, but because of people coming
in and things changing, they no longer have that assurance. Please
support the amendment. Thank you.

the question is, who decides? Is it a majority of the council or is it a
small minority of the council that decides? I could give plenty of
counter examples in other cities, but I&#39;m not gonna call them out on
the floor of completely irrational decisions that were made because of
the protest petition. If you force me to do it, I will, but please
don&#39;t. Let me give a couple of practical reasons why to defeat, vote
no on this amendment. First of all, in many cases it&#39;s gonna be the
same thing. Take, take a five member council, for example. What&#39;s
three fourths? Four votes. What&#39;s two thirds? Four votes. So
you&#39;re putting yourself in the hands of the minority of the council
either way, but worst yet, Representative Avila&#39;s amendment actually
strikes in lines 10 to 13, the language regarding absent members or non
counted members. So in some cases it will actually be worse. A two
thirds vote violates majority rights of other citizens and other
property owners, the citizens being those who elected the majority of
the council just as much as a three fourths vote does. It&#39;s just a
different fraction. And I will note that virtually almost the same
amendment was offered on the floor two years ago by Representative Meyer
and was defeated on a vote of 72 to 39, and then the bill was passed 85
to 26. That doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t have a change of heart.
I&#39;m just reminding you of what you did two years ago. So I ask you
to defeat the amendment and pass the bill.

  ?? property for the highest value as they see fit but I do wonder about
people who in a municipality buy property or improve property, relying
on the zoning that is currently there and they may buy not believing
that a 10 story office building  could go up across the street from
their house.  Do you not see any need to have some protection for people
to be able to rely on what the city has done in regard to zoning in the
past when they invest in their property whether to purchase it or
improve it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]. Thank you for the question, and yes there’s a way to
get absolute reliance on what will happen and that is by buying  a
property right in the property next to you.  Either by what’s called a
negative servitude or restrictive covenant or easement or something like
that .  But whenever you buy on reliance on a zoning, you buy on that
reliance knowing that zoning is legislative and is not guaranteed for
the future.  But to put this in the opposite context, I could give you
horror stories for people in a city near m:  Someone owns a property for
20 years and pays taxes on it for 20 years.  The land use plan that has
been there for a long time, calls for this property to be in this case
medium density residential.  The land on this side is a certain density,
the land on that side is a certain density, the land on that side is a
certain density.  The staff reports to the planning board and the city
council that yes, it completely fits within the land use plan.  There’s
not a deleterious effect, there’s not a traffic issue, but a neighbor
files a protest petition and as a result, the rezoning which is
completely unremarkable, completely legitimate, fails.  And the people
who have owned this property and have paid taxes on it for decades, get
no significant use out of their property .  Zoning is legislative if you
want to control forever the property of somebody else and what they can
do about it, buy an easement, buy restrictive covenant, buy a negative
servitude.  Don’t rely on minority rights to enforce your wishes on
other people

[SPEAKER CHANGES] What purpose could Representative Lucas please arise
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman has the floor to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the House, we had this bill in local
government committee last Thursday.  And at that time I offered an
amendment that was a lot more favorable to the neighbors than is the
amendment offered by Representative Avila.  We had a voice vote on that
amendment, and it certainly seemed to most of us that it had passed.
The chair is within his rights to make a call.  The chair voted, made
the call that the amendment failed.  The point I wish to make here,
first of all, is that there was bipartisan support for that amendment.
The way the committee is constructed there’s no way for that voice vote
to have happened as it did, and you can hear it on the committee tape if
you wish .  But that it was inter-party, that both parties, it was
bipartisan.  So we did have that in fact last time.  Now what we have
this time is raising the question really of whether there should be a
protest petition because Representative Avila’s amendment makes two
changes, really three changes to the situation.   First of all it
raises, drops from 3/4 to 2/3rds.  Now no city council in this state is
5 members.  I know Representative Ross…

  <p id="095:00">
  Ross has talked about his situation in Burlington, but almost all the
rest of them are more members than that seven or nine, and when you drop
it from three quarter requirement to two third requirement, you change
the situation. It is a lot easier for the protest petition to be denied
by the membership of the city council. The second thing that I want to
mention in this amendment which is different from the amendment that I
offered and also is more favorable to the property owner and not to the
protesters is the fact that the bathroom break that Representative Stam
referenced or the member that Representative Ross mentioned, his
councilman that was ill, both of those situations are eliminated in this
amendment. In this amendment, it makes clear on page two line 12 that if
you&#39;re out on a bathroom break, your vote is not considered to be a
yes on the protest petition. You have to be present and voting, so the
concern that Representative Stam had and that Representative Ross had
are, are not there any longer, and what you&#39;re really just asking is
are we allowing the protest petition to continue. And the reason it
should continue is stated well in a letter from one of my constituents
in Durham. She writes, when neighbors file a protest petition, it is a
signal that the proposed rezoning deserves special attention by elected
officials. And the examples could be something like the Sheetz  which
wants to come in right behind the neighborhood of $150,000 homes where
people&#39;s entire equity is really in that house. All they own is in
that house, and Sheetz  wants to put in a 14 pump gas station. I got two
Sheetz  going in within two miles of my house in Durham, and they are
not appreciated by the neighbors. And that&#39;s one reason why we
should have the protest petition, so that the neighbors say these are
special circumstances, and given these special circumstances, it is
appropriate for us to protest and to require a higher vote than simply
50%. The amendment makes it 67%, two thirds, and that is quite
appropriate. Let me say on the other point and why I&#39;m actually
surprised that Representative Stam opposes this amendment is that this
idea of the, in the Avila amendment was proposed by Representative Bill
Brawley, who cannot be here today because, as we know, because of family
illness, his wife&#39;s illness. He proposed this in the committee, and
I told him that I thought that deserved serious consideration, and
that&#39;s what Representative Avila&#39;s amendment is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;ll yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke, Representative Brawley is home. His wife is in
the hospital. Would you like me to explain to the House what
Representative Brawley actually thought about that amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
About the two thirds?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I do not want to hear what he has to say right now. I do not yield.
I have the floor and I want to finish my remarks. The point is,
Representative Brawley came to me and said, I think it is completely
reasonable if you&#39;re gonna make the vote on the city council two
thirds that you increase the number of property owners who are
protesting from 15%, which was in my amendment, to 67%. That&#39;s an
extraordinary difference. What we are preserving here in this amendment
is the right to have a protest petition is will be extremely difficult
for any group of neighbors to be able to get it to two thirds. So when
you vote yes on this amendment, as I urge you to do so, it&#39;s a good
amendment because it allows the protesters to say to the city council,
this is a special condition. The fourteen pump Sheetz , the asphalt
factory, whatever it might be that the neighbors feel is really a threat
to their financial investment in their house, in their home. It&#39;s a
reasonable amendment, and in fact it&#39;s one that almost makes the
protest petition impossible to carry out because of the high bar of 67%
of the homeowners. It is nevertheless a good amendment, a fair amendment
to keep the protest petition intact, and I urge support of the
amendment.

  <p id="100:00">
  —Representative Blust brought up a very good question, and
Representative Stam had a response to that question, but I wanted also
to provide from further response to Representative Blust&#39;s question,
and that was—and I hope he forgives me if I paraphrase it wrong—is that
if an individual has a property that is under a current zoning, is that,
does not he or she preserve the right to actually have some type of say
in what actually changes in regard to if a zoning was to change and,
therefore, to affect the actual change of the said person&#39;s
property. And Representative Stam gave a very lawyerly answer, and
I&#39;m gonna give you a little more of a simple answer. And that is, is
that one thing we have to remember, is that even if the actual re-zoning
is approved—and all we&#39;re debating here by way of this Bill is
actually if the re-zoning is approved by fifty-one percent [51%] or if
the re-zoning is approved by a supermajority. Now, I&#39;ll argue that
most everything we do dealing with liberty and property rights here is
51%. But also to add further protection to Representative Blust&#39;s
concerns is that if a property is re-zoned and there is a different in
uses between a residential or a commercial property, or a residential in
a multi-family development, the difference in uses, they actually have
buffer requirements, setbacks, there&#39;s requirements for the
vegetation or there the [abatements] by way of fences, how far that a
building can occur from the property line. So, you as a property owner,
you are further protected not only by way of the ability to actually
protest in a majority fashion but also you&#39;re protected by way of
the ordinances of having different uses come next to you, and to make
sure that it&#39;s not visibly, or actually encroaching too much on the
property that you have. So I believe the rights are definitely tilted to
the private property owner by the way of who&#39;s there, existing. I
have a tremendous amount of respect for Representative Avila, by all
means, but I oppose this Amendment, and I most fully support this Bill.
This definitely would actually— We need to get away for this aspect of
the first individual there being able to control everything above and
beyond the private property rights to those who have purchased the next
door property. The individual who has paid for that piece of property
[adds an] increased value to it, and that individual should have just as
must rights as the first individual who&#39;ve paid for the property
that they live on, but did not pay for the property that the other
individual resides on. So, out of— With all due respect to
Representative Avila, I would ask that you oppose this Amendment, and
fully support the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Speaker]
For what purpose would the gentleman from Mecklenburg, Representative
Jeter, arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Jeter]
To debate the Amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Chairman]
You have the floor to debate the Amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Jeter]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I&#39;m opposed to the Amendment, but perhaps
for a different, unique way. If the Amendment passes, under the 6767
Apples to Apples Rule, seems logical to me. I don&#39;t have a problem
with that. However, it does not take into factor what I think the second
biggest problem with the protest petition is. Which I saw a lot on City
Council in Huntersville. Where someone would file a protest petition,
and then they&#39;d get a new fence, and their protest petition would go
away. So, for me, this doesn&#39;t take away the incentive to file
protest petitions from bad actors. Let me be clear: I&#39;m not
suggesting that everyone who files a protest position is a bad actor.
But I&#39;m saying in my tenure on City Council, designing— doing zoning
issues, we saw it more often than you would think. So, unless
there&#39;s a provision that says once you file a protest petition you
can&#39;t receive anything of tangible value in order to withdraw, then
even with this Amendment passing, you&#39;ve created a bad situation.

[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative Meyer]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. When Representative Stam repeated his story for
us today about his treehouse, which he also used in last year&#39;s
debate, it reminded me of when I was six years old. My parents had
bought a house in 1974, in a working class neighborhood in Cleveland,
Ohio. They paid fifteen thousand dollars [$15,000] for that house. It
was all the money they had, of course, they were trying to live up to
the American dream. Well, when I was six years old, a McDonalds was
built directly behind my house. And I thought, then, that we had really
found the American dream!
[laughter]
I remember falling asleep at night with the windows open in those days
before air conditioning, with the gentle sounds of &quot;Grbxlmcrff!
Gxrbmlmrcff! Welcome to McDonalds, can I take your order please?&quot;

  But I realized it wasn’t all that much fun when my mom’s favorite chore
for me on the days when I had not been such a good boy was to have me go
out and cleanup all the trash that was thrown over the fence from
McDonalds into our backyard.
My mom might have been a bad actor in making her son go and clean up the
trash, but I think the real issue for my mom, and my dad and the other
neighbors in that neighborhood was when McDonalds decides that they want
to build in your backyard, they’ve got lawyers, and architects and
engineers who’ve been working on that plan for a year.
And we’ll bring this into current times, in NC, most cities that have
zoning statutes, their statutes are about a thousand pages long, some
even longer.  And when a neighborhood says we don’t want McDonalds and
they’re trashing our backyard, a neighborhood like the one I grew up in,
we didn’t have engineers or lawyers to help us figure out what was in
those zoning regulations and how we should fight back.
And even more of a problem is most zoning regulations only give the
neighbors 10 days, 10 day warning, guaranteed warning to express your
objections.  And after McDonalds has been preparing for a year, to
expect my parents and the other full time blue collar working class
parents around them to figure out how to protest to the city council
within 10 days, they weren’t gonna be able to do it.
And I think that’s the case with many neighborhoods there now.  So this
is just tipping the scales a little bit, and we have laws that protect
the majority.  And we also have laws that protect the individual.  And
this is one of those laws that protects the individual.  Does it
sometimes make things a little more difficult for the majority?  Yes.
Does it sometimes make things more difficult for developers?  Yes.  Are
there some unfortunate side consequences like maybe my mom could have
had McDonalds build a higher fence?  Yes.
But given the tradeoffs between individuals and corporations, this is
one thing that’s worth keeping.  I will support this amendment as a
compromise.  I wish the threshold wasn’t as high as two-thirds.  I’d
rather see the amendment that we debated last year with lower
thresholds, but we need something for those people who don’t want
McDonalds trash in their backyard and I support this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Pender arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Rep. Meyer a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you yield for question, Rep. Meyer?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Meyer, I definitely appreciate your story in all honestly, I just
wanted to see in the story that you actually articulated, in the
difference of Rep. Stam, the ability for a rezoning to occur and for a
McDonalds to be built behind your house, what part of that rezoning
allowed McDonalds to actually litter, what part of that rezoning
actually gave them the ability to break laws about refuse on your
property?  I’m just a little bit confused about how a rezoning has
anything to do with breaking the law and allowing somebody else’s trash
to be on your property?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The issue is what type of environment do you want to live in and what do
you want in your back yard.  That’s the issue.  It’s not necessarily
about the McDonalds trash.  It could be about whatever’s coming into
your backyard.  But on the other side of my neighborhood were
stockyards.  They smelled horrible.  I wouldn’t want those built to my
house either.
This is a piece of regulation.  The protest petition, right to protest
petition is a piece of regulation that protects the property rights of
previous investors.  And if we get rid of these, we undermine part of
the regulatory environment that gives people certainty that if I invest
my money there, whether I’m a homeowner, or a business owner or a
property developer, if I invest my money there, I can expect that my
investment will maintain its value because what’s around me I can
relatively expect to stay the way that I thought it would be based on
the current zoning at the time.  We need that for all kinds of
investment.

For about 30 years until we restored it back in 2010 I believe and it’s
been an important tool for the neighbors and neighborhoods in
Greensboro, there have been several proposals to reason some parts of a
major ?? from residential to commercial and it’s because of the protest
petition that the neighbors of those proposed property changes have the
ability to sort down and negotiate with the developer, I don’t think
it’s any secret that boards of zoning and adjustment and many city
councils are dominated by development interest and I think this just
tips the stay on favor of the property owners that are affected by these
rezoning changes. So my preference would be not to repeal it but I
believe that Representative Avila’s threshold is way too high that I
think it’s a nice compromise and I wish that this body just have a study
committee and say if we can come up with the state for a recommendation
that we could all agree to but in absence of that I would like to urge

For what purpose does the gentleman from Richmond, Representative

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
First to ask Representative Stam a question and then to debate the

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, is it possible for one person to have the
two-thirds protest petition?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, thank you. Just listening to all this debate and by the way one
other point the City Council in Rockingham does have five members so
they are city councils with only five members but to get to my main
point, this two-third thing sounds really good I mean if you look at the
Congress of the United States, they pass a bill and then President
vetoes it and with two-thirds vote they can override the President’s
veto but the interesting thing there is that the President is given this
veto power because he’s elected by all the people of the United States
and it is a safeguard but under a protest petition we are given one
person in lot of cases veto power over the elected officials in a city
and to me that just seems unbalanced and city councils are given the
power to rezone and they generally try to way the interest of home
owners and property owners against the interest of the community as a
whole and I think generally they make those decisions appropriately.
Now, if we pass this bill today, there will be cases where a protest
position may have been appropriate but in the vast majority of cases
overwhelmingly it will eliminate the opportunity to abuse something and
for one person to be able to hold the gun at the head of a developer and
stop something that will benefit a community. So for that reason I’m
gonna vote against the amendment and vote for the bill, thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess probably to help illustrate why I feel I do about this and why I
interpreted the way I do, I have to use my personal experience like a
lot of you and you will have. It involves subdivision on ?? Road, one of
the largest, busiest North-West quarters in Wake County, there is one
major entrance to the subdivision and inside that main entrance on the
right is a small portion of land where a proposal was made for 50,000
square foot grocery store, one main light entrance into a subdivision of
thousands of homes, it will share the sight with a day care center and
at that point 6,000 additional cars a day into that neighborhood. It
will bring in anywhere between 15 and 18 transfer trucks a day to a
store of that size. Through the protest petition they have negotiated
and worked and begged and pleaded to be able to scale it down, they have
now decided they can go to 29,000 square foot organic grocery store
which will only mean 5,000 cars additional rather than 6,000 under the
original. These are the sorts of egregious types of subdivisions like
the?? developments that we have the protest petition for. Representative

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, I should begin by noting that the request for
this bill did not come from any of my local municipalities and so they
have taken no position and I don’t want anybody to infer that I speak
today in favor of this bill because of that instead I speak today in
favor of this bill because of my beliefs, my personal beliefs in
democracy and think requiring 75% of a board, a legislative board to
approve a rezoning is just unfair and anti-democratic. I want you to
picture in your mind what this body would look like with a 75% threshold
vote. As 90 members, we would get nothing done, nothing; we would be
worst than the U.S Senate, if we had to get 90 votes on everything. So
either trust your local officials or you don’t these are the people on
the ground, these are the people who run city wide and now I will use
Raleigh as an example only because I’m most familiar with it, there are
eight members of the council to get the vote on every issue, two ?? so
every person in the city gets to vote for those. The Mayor ??, everybody
gets to vote for her then they had their individual member. So every
subdivision already votes for 50% of the town council, the city council.
So their rights are already protected and if the City Council is not
doing what they should be doing and not working for the best interest of
everyone then they can be voted out the next election. Since
Representative Stam didn’t refer to the?? McCord, I will go back and do,
I will do a little bit of history for you, there is a debate I know many
of you are constitutional scholars and do a lot of reading on it but
there is and I mean it and all sincerity, I know from what people have
things that used on the floor and everything, they do a lot of
constitutional reading, there is a debate between Jefferson and Hamilton
and usually honestly I fall on the Jefferson side on most issues but
Alexander Hamilton had a right in Federal Assembly 5 when he said, “Our
provisions would require more than a majority of anybody to its
resolutions had the direct tendency to embrace the operations of the
government and an indirect one to subject the majority to that a
minority.” I don’t think I could say it any better, I just ask when you
think about this bill when you vote, ask yourself we would be like 90
vote threshold.

  But as I&#39;ve listened to this debate, I&#39;ve decided that I ought
to support this bill. The rationale goes like this: I think we&#39;ve
been discussing encroachment from one perspective, and that is from a
majority of citizens opposing a supposing minority of citizens, and
sometimes the inverse proportions get lost. I&#39;ll cite you an example
of why I feel that we ought to support the bill. Imagine a small
landowner, say three to five acres of property, who&#39;s owned it for a
number of years, and has decided that, well, I don&#39;t want urbanity
to encroach upon me. Cities have encroached upon small landowners that
way over a period of years. And as they&#39;ve encroached, subdivisions
have been developed. I don&#39;t know if they consider that little five
or three-to-five acre plot of property or not. But they develop all
around it. And then whenever this gentleman who&#39;s owned it, who
superseded them, decides that, well, I have an opportunity for my family
here, and perhaps we ought to take advantage of it. And he complies with
all the areas of zoning, and then there&#39;s a group who gets together
who actually came after he did, and decides that they want to control
what goes there on his property. I think we ought to consider that
aspect of the debate. Sometimes we just look at one side of it and we
don&#39;t favor the other side. I wish--perhaps if he had had some
say-so in that urbanity development, or even being annexed into the
city. ?? he probably said you guys, stay where you are, I&#39;d like to
leave this property as it is. But we know that as cities grow,
conditions change. And as they change, we ought to be cognizant of that
little small plot owner. And so I support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake, Representative Martin,
arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Members, I rise in opposition to this
bill, and I want to address a few of the points that have been quite
eloquently made in favor of it. I&#39;m going to resist the temptation
that asks my colleague from Wake County, though, if the tree in his back
yard was in fact the tree under which the Magna Carta was signed back in
the 13th century. And I&#39;ll also resist, even in light of the debate
in committee this morning, to see if that tree was that tree, if it
could be designated historic. We&#39;ll save that for a later day.
Supporters of this bill have argued that the protest petition is somehow
antidemocratic. And it seems to me as they were making their arguments,
and I won&#39;t rehash them, but in the end, if a protest petition, by
requiring a super-majority is antidemocratic, then our U.S. Constitution
is antidemocratic, then our state constitution is antidemocratic, then
some of our procedures here are also antidemocratic. Everything a
legislative body or group or municipal government does should not be
subject to a supermajority. Absolutely not. Certain things should be,
where there is good reason to be, and I think in the case of a protest
petition, there certainly is. Let me also address my other friend from
Wake County, Representative Jackson&#39;s argument, that if we required
supermajorities nothing would get done. We have a protest petition
procedure in Wake County and in Raleigh, where my district is. We are
one of the fastest-growing cities in the entire country. Clearly, we are
getting things done with protest petitions in the city of Raleigh and in
the county of Wake. We&#39;ve heard some folks talk about horror stories
on both sides of this issue. I think it&#39;s safe to say that without a
doubt, there are neighbors out there who have gotten their unreasonable
demands met on developers as a result of the power they have with a
protest petition. I absolutely agree to that. I practiced commercial
real estate for several years and in fact saw that happen. I think
it&#39;s also safe to say that on the other side, there&#39;s no
shortage of horror stories of neighborhoods who have really almost been
destroyed by the city council in the end allowing a development to
occur. Where the balance lies, horror stories on either side, I
can&#39;t say for sure, I don&#39;t have statistics on that. But I can
tell you that in my experience, where in the end most protest petitions
result. Where they&#39;re filed, usually what happens is that it brings
a developer and a neighborhood to the table. The neighborhood says what
they&#39;d like to see, the developer gives their pitch, and in the end
  </p>

  <p id="125:00">
  [SPEAKER CHANGES] And some compromises made. It&#39;s probably some
burden on the developer, but also it&#39;s just as likely that the
neighborhood is making concessions too. So in the end what I&#39;ve seen
happen more often than not in protest petitions is that the development
moves forward, the developer makes money, the neighborhood makes some
concessions. But in the end the growth occurs, the development moves
forward. That&#39;s what&#39;s happening in Wake County with protest
petitions. I think it&#39;s premature to throw it out arbitrarily like
this. This is the sort of thing I think would be better subject to a
study bill, give it a good look. I&#39;m not set on the numbers, I
don&#39;t know if the numbers in Representative Avila&#39;s amendment
are the right one. I don&#39;t know if the numbers in current law are
the right numbers. I&#39;ve got an open mind about where the threshold
should be. But one thing I do know is the neighborhoods in my district
have spoken with one voice and said that they view the protest petition
as a way of giving them a voice in helping Wake County and Raleigh
continue to get things done.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Mecklenburg,
Representative Alexander arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You have the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. I have been sitting here and
reviewing in my mind a concept called majority rule, minority rights.
We&#39;ve talked a lot about democracy and supermajorities, but it seems
to me that one thing that&#39;s been missing from this discussion is the
rights of the minority. I came to the General Assembly direct from a
stint on the Mecklenburg County Planning Commission. And, so I saw this
whole thing kind of operate from a different perspective. I saw
developers who had wonderful plans to do things propose developments
that neighborhoods felt might be not in their best interest. Sometimes
it was based on traffic, sometimes it was based upon the height of a
building that would be immediately adjacent to somebody&#39;s backyard.
Sometimes it was based upon the fear of the development and whether or
not it was going to generate more trash, or you know, just a lot of
things that could have bothered folk. Sometimes it was something as
simple as the design of homes in a neighborhood as opposed to what they
feared would be the design of the new project. Nine out of ten times
though, what happened was because there was this threat out there of a
possible protest petition. The neighborhood leaders and the developers
were brought to the table to discuss before a city council meeting,
before anything got as formal as-some folk seem to fear everything moves
to, the ability to do exactly what I&#39;ve seen us do here in the
General Assembly, which is to have stakeholders come together and
discuss a proposal and come to some meeting of the minds. I think they
call that compromise, where something can move forward and everybody can
agree to it. The same thing with projects. By having neighborhood people
and having the developers be able to talk to each other, probably nobody
was 100% satisfied, but at least some things happened to get good
project to move forward. And I do admit that my experience with this has
been more positive than negative, and you&#39;ll hear me using
constantly the term neighbors and neighborhoods. The actors that
I&#39;ve seen haven&#39;t been extortionists, they have been people who
have had genuine concerns about the quality of life that they were going
to experience after a project, and were looking to try to do something
about it. Sometimes they wanted to stop it. Most of the time that
didn&#39;t happen, most of the time what happened was a compromise.

  A realization on the part of the developer that they had to accommodate
the neighborhoods, and a realization on the part of the neighborhoods
that progress couldn&#39;t be stopped. You could slow it down, but you
can&#39;t stop it. Now, I&#39;ve been surrounded by the eloquence of
members of the legal profession, and as a simple urban undertaker, I
can&#39;t attempt to be as eloquent as you learned gentlemen, but I can
tell you that in reading my emails, I have yet to see anybody from my
neck of the woods tell me that the protest petition is something that
needs to disappear. And because of that, I have problems supporting the
bill as it is currently presented. I&#39;ve got to go back to my branch
of the crick and deal with, with my folk, and my folk are just not in
favor of losing their minority rights. My professor back at the
university was a fellow named Protho who at that time was one of the
leading political scientists in the country. In fact, he had written a
book with a guy named Irish, and Irish and Protho used to be the
textbook that was used to teach political science, and after class I
used to enjoy sitting around and talking to him, and he kept drilling in
that majority rule, minority rights issue. Well, don&#39;t forget it
when it comes time to vote, because at some point, you&#39;re gonna be
sitting in that minority position too.

For what purpose does the lady from New Hanover, Representative Hamilton

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister speaker. I probably have the sole honor here in this
room of having been a city planner in my early career for several years,
and have actually participated on the staff side of reviewing a protest
petition and working with the project through the process of a rezoning
or a special use permit while the protest petition was active. Every
action that a city council takes, whether it be legislative or quasi
judicial requires the public hearing. So by eliminating the protest
petition, we are not eliminating the voice of the public in this
decision making process, but we are however, giving a super majority
voice to unelected officials. And as has been stated more eloquently by
others earlier in the day, I don&#39;t agree with a super majority set
up for our local city councils when dealing with future development
within their city limits. So for that reason I will be supporting this
bill, and I would encourage others to think about that. We are not
taking away citizens&#39; rights. We are not taking away citizens&#39;
votes or their voice, but we are protecting landowners that are adjacent
to existing developments. We are protecting their property rights. So
with that in mind, I would ask for your support for this, this bill. I
think it&#39;s long overdue, and I submit that to you. Thank you very
much.

appearing. And I would recommend, to me this is common sense. To me,
again, this is a liberty issue. Everybody has their say, but the private
property owner gets his day in court. With a super majority, it usually
never comes. So I ask everybody, please, vote for this bill.

The gentleman from Lake has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES to Representative D. Hall]
Members, I&#39;m a primary of this Bill as well, so it&#39;s obviously a
friendly amendment— something that we, inadvertently, missed when we
sent this in the Courts Commission— and all of the primary and the
Conference of DA&#39;s are onboard is that if we&#39;re gonna outsource
the blood and drug tests? We need to make sure we use in state
laboratories. And the reason is obvious. If a toxicologist has to
testify, we don&#39;t want him coming from out of state to have to do
that. So what this amendment does is it simply adds the words &#39;in
state&#39; between the words &#39;private&#39; and
&#39;laboratories&#39; so that line 10 reads: &#39;private in state
laboratories.&#39; I hope you&#39;ll support the amendment and the Bill.
