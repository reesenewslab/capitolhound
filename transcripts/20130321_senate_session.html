[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein is recognized, explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. I'd like to thank Senator Bingham, Senator
Newton and Senator Goolsby. We discussed this bill in committee and it
has to do with extending the date when all labs should be accredited.
It's in everybody's interest and the interest of the justice system to
have accredited labs because you're more likely to get the right
analysis done, which will make it more likely we can get convictions
when they're guilty and we don't wrongfully convict people who are not.
There are a couple labs that need more time, but there was a consensus
that seven years was putting it off too long in the future. This dials
it back 2 years to a 5 year extension. Hopefully they will work hard and
get accredited as soon as they can. We ask for your support.
