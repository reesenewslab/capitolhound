Our kind Father in heaven, we pause before the beginning of this General
Assembly session with the desire to thank Thee, Father, for the many
blessings that Thou has bestowed upon us.  We thank Thee for the
wonderful freedom and liberty that we enjoy in America.  We're grateful
individually and collectively for the opportunity that we have to come
together here and to represent the people of North Carolina.  We're also
thankful, Father, for the work of others in this Assembly and around
these buildings.  We thank Thee for the good work of the Sergeant at
Arms and his staff.  We're grateful for the dedication of the Principle
Clerk and her staff to serve this legislative body.  We thank Thee also,
Father, for the custodians and the others who care for this building,
and those who care for the grounds and keep the building and the grounds
in such good condition.  We thank Thee for each representative here
today.  And Father we ask that Thou would see fit to bless us with the
necessary wisdom and discernment to make decisions that will benefit the
people of North Carolina and be pleasing in Thy sight.  For this, I pray
for in the name of Jesus Christ.  Amen.

<p id="020:00">
...to condense Representative Cunningham's service into just a few
words.  However, I will try.  What I will share with you is he grew up
poor, and fatherless.  Although I am quite a few years younger than he,
we have a lot in common.  We were survivors of where we come from.  I
grew up poor; he grew up poor. He grew up fatherless; I grew up
fatherless.  And almost motherless, as well.  But we made it out of
financial poverty by the way of education.  I met Representative
Cunningham in 1996.  He was working on a project with the Anita Stroud
Foundation, and I was a nurse at the time; had been for quite a while.
And, he was working trying to raise money for a paralyzed young boy who
had broke [sic] his neck playing football for West Charlotte High
School.  He was paralyzed from the neck down, he couldn't move himself
around; his mother needed a lift to move him from his bed to his
wheelchair.  So, the Anita Stroud Foundation got together and raised the
money for that.  In addition, they needed a van to transport this
individual, because he was a big guy, probably close to 300 pounds, and
he wasn't easy to move around.  So they got together and they raised the
money to purchase a van to take him places so he wasn't confined to his
home.  And I consulted with him, and we got all that done. And he was
known to work on several projects at one time.  When Hurricane Katrina
hit, that was another big event that had came [sic] about.  And, we got
together, and we raised almost 50 to 60 thousand dollars for the Katrina
victims and he was the spearhead behind it. And lots of that money came
to the Black Legislative Caucus here, because that's what he wanted to
do with it.  And some of it stayed in the community helping people that
were displaced by the hurricane to start their lives over.  He was a
very big part of that.  Representative Cunningham's conversations were
never about people or their misdeeds, but were always about how he could
help others.  He did not waste his time hurting anyone.  He spent his
life helping others.  About two months prior to him passing, I was on my
way, putting my clothes on, going out the door to check on my mother,
and he was a very independent and a proud man.  And, he said, wait a
minute, I want to talk to you about something.  I said, well, you know,
okay.  And then he said, well, no go ahead, because my mother was sick
at the time.  He said, go ahead, I'll be all right; we'll talk about it
when you come back.  And I said, no, sat down and then I said we can
talk about it now.  And he looked at me and he said I'm not gonna [sic]
be here in two months.  He said approximately two months.  He said I
know I'm not gonna be here.  And he said I want you to know right now,
you've been a good wife to me and I love you. And I told him--I looked
at him--and I knew he knew what he was talking about when he said it.
And I looked at him and I told him the same thing; you've been a good
husband to me, and I love you too.  And I went on to take care of my
mother.  But I knew he knew exactly what he was talking about.  You
know, when the Spirit comes, it's no doubt in [sic] what you hear and
what you feel.  It will speak to you.  So I knew he knew.  So, after he
told me that, of course I was worried about it all day but you know
God--God has a way of fixing things.  My life wasn't supposed to stop
when he stopped, my life was supposed to pick up and move on.  And, he
gave me what I needed while he was here to do that.  And that's why I'm
here today.  I say this to each of you that serve in this chamber, take
the time to express daily to the most important people in your life that
you love them. Pete called me every night while he was in the General
Assembly.  I knew that phone was gonna [sic] ring.  Every night he
called me, and let me know, everything all right, and am I all right.
And he did that before he was my husband.  After his passing, strangers
approached me in public places and they would ask me was I his daughter.
[laughter]  And I would say, no, I'm his widow.  And then they would go
on to say, well, you know he helped me do this and he helped me do that,
and I was really surprised.  Because I didn't come down here that
often--[end of data...]</p>

<p id="025:00">
But it was the little things that he did for common people.  And they
would walk up to me, and I didn't know who they was.  I could be in the
post office, I could be in the grocery store, and they would just walk
up to me and say, &quot;Are you so and so?  Well, I remember your
husband helped me do this.&quot;  And I say, &quot;Really&quot;?  And
they say, &quot;Yeah.&quot;  Man, I swear that was good.
He did a lot for people.  A lot for average people from right up here in
Raleigh.  And I think sometimes we don't realize the impact we have on
people's lives back home, but it's huge and people don't forget.  He
loved his family.  He gave to many.  He treasured his service, and he
worshipped God until his eyes were closed.  I would close with one of
his favorite poems.  &quot;Anyway&quot; is the title, &quot;People are
unreasonable, illogical, and self-centered.  Love them anyway.  If you
do good, people will accuse you of selfish ulterior motives.  Do good
anyway.  If you are successful, you will win false friends, and true
enemies.  Succeed anyway.  The good you do today, will be forgotten
tomorrow.  Do good anyway.  Honesty and frankness makes you vulnerable.
Be honest and frank anyway.  The biggest man with the biggest ideas can
be shot down by the smallest men with the smallest minds.  Think big
anyway.  People favor underdogs, but follow only top dogs.  Fight for
some underdogs anyway.
What you spend your years building maybe destroyed overnight.  Build
anyway.  People really need help, but may attack you if you help them.
Help people anyway.  Give the world the best you have, and you'll be
kicked in the teeth.  Give the world the best you've got anyway.&quot;
Mr. Speaker, I commend the resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative of Farmer-Butterfield, please state
your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The ladies recognize to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Ladies and gentlemen, I want
to tell you that I first met Pete Cunningham in Charlotte at the
Excelsior Club, late 80s in my day.  I befriended him and he befriended
me when I came to the legislature.  But prior to that time, I met his
date, Carla Cunningham at the Excelsior Club.  He was telling me once
when I was asked to run for Secretary of the Black Caucus, and I said,
&quot;Why do they want a woman to run for the Secretary of the Black
Caucus?  Let the man do it.&quot;  He said, &quot;Jean, opportunities
come seldom.  You better take this one from Wayne Wright since he wants
you to be his secretary.&quot;  So I took that role, and I indeed
learned a lot about the Legislative Black Caucus, and how the
legislative process works.  There was another occasion when Pete
Cunningham came to me and he said, &quot;I want you to be on my military
committee.&quot;  And he said, &quot;I served in the Navy, and I served
in the Army and I was a paratrooper.  You need to broaden your scope
Jean and not just ?? or helping human services.  You don't need to be a
one issue person.  You need to be a broad individual in legislature.
Learn all you can.  So I indeed served on his legislative committee.
Then, he was a floater going from many committees as a floater.  And I
loved to see him come into the meetings.  Especially when I had a bill
because I knew that would increase my numbers and get my bill passed.
And finally, he was special assistant to the Speaker when I came.  And I
used to constantly ask, &quot;Pete, what is your role in special
assistant to the Speaker&quot;?  He would never answer that question.
To this day I never understood, or knew what a his role was as of a
special assistant to the Govern, I mean to the Speaker.  But he felt
that it was very important, and I did too.</p>

<p id="030:00">
I was especially impressed by the fact that Pete increased the diversity
in the state hiring practices with my governor, Jim Hunt.  And finally,
my sister, who was a victim of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans; Carla
talked about the fact that him and several of his friends donated  funds
for the victims of Hurricane Katrina.  Well indeed, my sister was a
beneficiary of those donations that they made.  He finally got to meet
her and she was able to thank him personally.  So I say to you, Pete
Cunningham put his money where is mouth was.  He loved his family, his
Children, his grandchildren, and his great grands. And I commend the
resolution to you.

Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Ladies and gentlemen, it was my pleasure to

that poem by Representative Cunningham, I think, describes Pete to the
'T'.  He was caring. He was concerned.  He was enthusiastic and he was
knowledgeable.  It was a real pleasure to serve with him, debate,
discuss issues.  Sometimes he saw my point of view, sometimes I saw his,
but we enjoyed the exchanges.  I am proud to stand in support of
Representative Cunningham and say that I think if you'd have gotten to

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker and Members, I want to start off by saying that I can't I've
always enjoyed serving with Representative Cunningham.  I was the first
black female to serve in this legislature from Mecklenburg County and
Pete never let me forget that he was my senor and that I should be
looking up to him.  He never, ever allowed me to forget that.  And on
many occasions we had a back and forth because I didn't come to him and
ask his opinion before I made a move.  Also, as you  well see,
Representative Cunningham liked younger ladies.  I was out with two of
our colleagues, Senator Danley and Jim Richardson, who had served in
this body, and Pete. We had been to an event.  Pete and I were  walking
together, kind of hugging each other, and  the two behind us  said,
&quot;Oh, you two make such a nice looking couple.&quot;  I said,
&quot;No, I'm too old for Representative Cunningham.&quot;  So that got
to be a joke for a while, that I was too old for Cunningham.  But in all
seriousness,  Representative Cunningham really enjoyed serving his
constituents and serving in this institution.  He respected the
institution and he was well respected here.  He would always  get up,
and talk, and tell about his humble background.  He talked about being
raised by a single mother, and all that came with being raised in Union
County.  He was very well respected in Mecklenburg.  In fact, when I
would go out with Pete and Senator Danley, everybody recognized them.
As long as I've been serving, sometimes I'm wondering if people know
that I'm still here.  But representative Cunningham and Senator Danley,
everybody recognized them right away and knew that they were serving.
It was a pleasure serving with him.  We did come to be much better
friends and I guess at some point the started respecting my ability and…</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Adams, state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker, to speak briefly on the
resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The lady is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I guess where you start out in life, doesn't have to
determine where you end up or how far you can go. Pete Cunningham was an
example of that. He was very proud of the fact that he had humble
beginnings. He would tell us many times on the floor about his mother,
about the fact that he was poor. He would even say from time to time
that he was even on welfare. He wasn't ashamed of that. He was proud of
the journey he had traveled and how far he had come. He was a dapper,
well dressed gentleman. He always had information for you whether you
wanted it or not, and representative Earle, he pretty much treated me
the same way, and I wasn't from Meklenburg. I was very pleased to serve
with him, he was a very knowledgeable person. He was proud of the work
that he was doing here. We fussed a lot. We didn't always agree, but we
certainly agreed to disagree and we respected each other for that. I
think he thought i talked a little bit too much. He may have told me
that a time or two. But one of the things that I do remember, and
representative Cunningham, Carla Cunningham, helped me to remember that
for just a moment, the fact that he did support, not only the
legislative black caucus but the foundation, and did some great work in
Charlotte to help people who were victimized by the hurricanes, and not
only helped people in the state but, victims elsewhere. I served on a
couple committees with him and I was here as well as he was a floater
and he helped me get a few bills through as well. I am privileged to
stand in support of this resolution today, he was a fine gentleman. I
admired his intellect, and the commitment that he mad to this general
assembly and i commend this resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Luebke, please state your purpose.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members of the house, I have
fond memories of working with representative Pete Cunningham on this
floor, and in committees and particularly the house finance committee.
We always sat right down from one another. I always appreciated, always
did both in that committee and here on the house floor, that
representative Cunningham would speak a lot about the perspective of,
from the perspective of, and on behalf of the working families and
working people of North Carolina. And as has already been indicated, he
was open in telling people about his roots, and how he came up the hard
way, and he reminded all of us that he grew up in a segregationist Union
county, and that it was not an easy place to grow up as a young African
American. He was on point time and time again. My favorite story was
when he and I were debating, or discussing, I think we were more
discussing than debating, he thought we were debating the one aspect of
the Bill Lee Act, which those of you that have been around a while know,
it was the first great business incentive program. Again as was clear as
we looked at the Bill Lee Act, it provided more benefits to areas like
Meklenburg county, Durham county, than it did to the small counties,
that was one of the problems in the way it was structured, and I was
pointing it out and representative Cunningham was upset with me because
he thought I was not aware of the fact that there were zones of poverty
within counties, and I think representative Michaux remembers this
conversation we had, and in fact that we had been working to put into
the bill that... (speech ends)</p>

zones of poverty within the major metropolitan areas including Zonesman,
Greensboro, Winston, it said they would be exempted from the general
rules for the metropolitan area. And once he got frustrated with those
points so he just turned to me and said the proffessor doesnt really
know what hes talking about. And I always just remember that line and
appreciate it. I commend the resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Carney please state your purposes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Go straight to the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
speaker wants to go straight to the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank
you Mr. Speaker, I rised to make a few comments about my friend Pete
Cunningham. When I first came here ten years ago Pete was in my
delegation, and I didnt really know Pete personally other than to have
seen him at events and around Charlotte. But he came over to my office
and at that time when you were first elected you were given the office
of the person that was going out. And as a freshmen I was given the
office of the person seat, I was at here office and she was giving
preperations. She had one of the big rooms by the apprepiations meeting
room and the first person that came in and shot straight and honest with
me was Pete. He walked and said well how you doing in here and I said
well nice its big, but Im learning my way. He said well dont get used to
it because you wont be in here but maybe a week. I relly appreciated
that, and true to what Pete said that I was moved the next week to the
office that I currently have, and its a wonderful location. But if its
anything that I could sum up about Pete,I did serve up hi request that I
would meet up with a strong foundation board, and I got to really see
him at his best, and small meetings at the board. And really digging
down deep to find the money, and where is it going to come from, and we
as board members werent always able to raise it. Pete always found that
money to be there because that money was not going to anybody but young
people, and it was a passion of his. So I would sum up about Pete
Cunningham, and we can all aspire to have these things said about us, he
was passionate, about his service community, family, and his country. He
was compassionate about people who werent upmost fortunate as he was.But
he respected those who had much, and lost of all he was loyal. He was
loyal to the causes that he stood for, he was represented up here, and
if he was your friend, he was loyal. I commend the resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Speciale please state your purpose.
[SPEAkER CHANGE] To speak on the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGE] The
gentleman is to debate the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Pete Cunningham,
oh boy, what can you say about a good guy that hadnt already been said.
But let me tell you how I came to really know Pete, when Pete Got here,
Jim Richardson and I had been here for a while and Pete sat right
between us. And Pete would sit where Speciale was sitting and Jim
Richardson would be on the other side. That was the first year and then
we came back the second session and Pete had found his old spot at that
time. He knew he was cathing on to what was going on and introduced a
bill and I really dont remember but I can go back and tell you what the
bill was, it really dont make any difference. Pete introduced this bill,
it got up to the committee, and it hit the floor. Pete got up to argue
on the bill, and he started arguing on the bill. And he talked for five
minutes on the bill, then he talked another five minutes on the bill,
and then he talked for a third five minutes on the bill. Then something
hit me and Jim Richardson on the head at the time. Jim looked at me then
I looked at Jim, then Jim came around and said is he doing what I think
he is doing. I said that it sounds like it to me. He was talking against
his own bill. He had gotten so wrapped up in it that he had gotten so
off course on that bill. Well I reached over and grabbed his coattail
and said Pete you talking against your bill, he looked at me and said,</p>

Folks please pass my bill, and sat down. And the bill, the bill got
passed. Now that really, Pete was an individual that you could have a
lot of fun with. But Pete was a very serious individual. The Anita
Strive Foundation I know was one of his big things because he always
talked about Anita Strive Foundation and what it could do for the kids
that he was trying to help. Pete also was an astute business man, and
the reason I know that is because my law firm one time represented Pete
in a couple transactions. And we know how Pete came out on those
transactions. But the other thing about it was Pete, You know Pete owned
the Excelsior Club, the historic Excelsior Club in Charlotte. And
legislature black caucus was going to have a meeting in Charlotte one
weekend.  One weekend, and Pete invited us to come to the Excelsior
Club. Well we said well we'll go down there and we'll help the brother
out. We'll show up and lend his establishment a degree of glory.
Legislative black caucus is coming to him. We figured that ok we're
going to grace his establishment with out presence and that Pete would
like it so much that we wouldn't have to pay for anything. Well you can
imagine when the bill came, what we said. Pete said well you know I'm in
business, I gotta make a living. But the other thing about Pete is that
when you were his friend, you got to be his friend, you were his friend
for life. And I say that because I know he stuck by Jim Black in spite
of all the trouble that Jim Black got into. The one friend that Jim
Black could count on was Pete Cunningham. Pete worked even to the point
that he would ask members, unabashedly ask members to write Jim a letter
while he was in prison and that type of thing. So when he got to be your
friend That was it. I'm reminded, Pete reminds me of two things. There's
a little passage from Dante's Inferno that speaks well of Pete. It says
the hottest places in Hell are reserved for those who take a position of
neutrality in the face of a moral crisis. Pete never took a position of
neutrality. You know where he stood. Whether you liked where he stood.
Whether you didn't like where he stood, he always took that position.
The other one is my favorite, which I think epitomizes the life that
Pete lived. It's Dean Alfanses creed. It goes like this: I seek
opportunity not security. I do not wish to be a kept citizen, humbled
and dulled by having the State look after me. I want to take the
calculated risk to dream and to build, to fail and to succeed. It is my
heritage to stand erect, proud and unafraid. To think and act for
myself. To never cower before any master, nor bend to any threat. This I
stand here, here I stand, I can do no other. Pete Cunningham: we miss
you, but we relish in the glory that you left us. I commend the
resolution to you.

Chamber. The Chair is happy to extend the courtesies of the gallery to
Kamisha Small’s daughter and Valerie Rustin, long time assistant to Pete
Cunningham. Please stand and let us welcome you. House Resolution 696

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House Resolution 696. House Resolution ?? Lewis and Mattie Thornburg
while observing the 60th anniversary of Thorlo the company they founded,
the House resolves.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Turner, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To request the Resolution be read in its entirety.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The resolution will be read in its entirety. Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Whereas Thorlo was founded in 1953 by Lewis and Matte Thornburg, who
operated the business in a hand built building next to their family home
in Statesville, North Carolina and whereas the Thornburgs started out as
a small subcontract knitters for other mills, notably making socks for
the United States military; and Whereas in the 1960s, the company moved
to another location in Statesville, where it still maintains offices and
warehouse space.  And whereas in 1970, Lewis and Mattie Thornburg’s son,
Jim became resident of the company.  And whereas, during his early
leadership, Jim Thornburg purchased a dyeing and finishing operation,
which allowed Thoro to become a fully integrated manufacturing
operation. And whereas a few years later, Thorlo moved away from
contract knitting to manufacturing finished and packaged socks for
several famous brands.  And whereas in 1980, the company introduced the
innovative athletic sock, Thorlose.  And whereas in 1983, the company
constructed a new 60,000 square-foot state-of-the-art manufacturing
facility, allowing the company to increase its production. And whereas,
for over 30 years, Thorlos have been the industry standard for food
protection and comfort for sports, health and leisure activities and is
available throughout the United States and over 33 countries around the
world. And whereas, Thorlo remains one of the last 100% “Made in USA”
textile brands. And whereas, Thorlo maintains an outlet store in
Statesville, which attracts thousands of people each years. And whereas
Thorlo has been operating for 60 years, growing from kitting on military
style sock to a line of over 54 patented and engineered activity
specific sock products for essentially all consumer lifestyles. And
whereas Thorlo currently employs almost 300 employees and contributes
approximately $10 million in salaries and benefits per year in the
greater Statesville community.  Now, therefore, be it resolved by the
House of Representative. Section 1. The House of Representatives honors
the memory of Lewis and Mattie Thornsburg for their role in founding
Thorlo, a company that has a tremendous impact on the textile industry.
Section 2.  The House of Representatives congratulates Thorlo on its
60th anniversary.  Section 3. The Principal Clerk shall transmit a
certified  copy of this resolution to James “Jim” Thornburg, owner and
CEO of Thorlo, Incorporated Section4. This resolution is effective upon
adoption.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Turner is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Ladies and gentlemen of the house, Lewis and
Mattie Thornburg were innovative people and we were so fortunate that
they chose to locate in our Iredell county in the Statesville area to
develop their ideas.  Lewis Thornburg believed that your life is
worthwhile to the extent that you strive to become the acknowledged best
at something. And he instilled that in his family.  The Thornburgs did
just that. in the 50s, 60s and 70s, they were in the business of
contract knitting. They earned the reputation for making the best high
quality socks for other well known apparel brands.  But their dream was
to develop their own brand. They wanted to make the best made product
that people would value to the point of asking for.</p>

By name, they have accomplished just that. Lewis and Mattie's son, Jim
Thornberg, continued the family goals and invented Thorloughs. It was
originally concieved to be the most protective sport specific athletic
sock. The Thorloughs brand was so successful, and the company received
so many letters, emails from satisfied consumers, healthcare and sports
medicine professionals, that Jim realized that people were getting more
than just the best athletic sock. They were getting foot protection,
comfort, and foot health benefits. Congratulations to the Thorloughs for
60 years of operation. I proudly sponsor this resolution with Mr.
Brawley and ask that you support and I commend this resolution to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Bill Brawley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the resolution.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I actually received my first pair of Thorloughs
without knowing what they were because they were given to me by my
uncle. Uncle Sam issued me green socks made by Thorlough to wear inside
my boots, but they were extremely comfortable and I wore those until I
literally wore them out, for several years after I was in military
service. I was grateful to learn that those same socks, and even better
looking ones, were available in Statesville, North Carolina. The phrase
technical socks sounds kind of strange, but I will tell you the main
reason, those of us as we get older, discover something. Our feet hurt.
And when you walk or you stand, your feet hurt. And the reason that is a
problem is, if you want to stay young, if you want to stay active,
you've got to exercise. And walking is some of the best cardiovascular
exercise you can do. And if you have plantar fasciitis, and you put on
Thorloughs with your walking shoes you can walk and your feet don't
hurt. So, yes, they're manufacturing in the United States. Yes, they are
competing on a worldwide stage when so many others fail. Yes, they are
providing jobs. But more importantly, they are providing more life to
those of us who are at a point in our life where we can't get parts, and
things are starting to wear out. Because after all we don't get old, or
we don't stop playing because we got old, we get old because we stop
playing. Those of us with grey hair who are still young owe that in part
to our Thorlough socks. I commend the resolution to you.

at the Thorlough Outlet and pick up a couple extra pairs. I'm sure I own
at least 200 pairs of Thorlough socks. I've got some on today. I commend
the resolution to you.

As we discussed last night, this bill would allow in-stand beer sales in
professional venues with a seating capacity of at least 3,000. This only
applies to professional athletic teams. This bill would direct the ABC
Commission to adopt rules on suspending alcohol sales towards the end of
an athletic event. We also noted last night that servers would not be
allowed to shout the sale of beer, and vendors would be responsible for
training their employees to properly serve alcohol.
It's also worth noting that our surrounding states allow in-stand beer
sales at professional athletic events, and with that I commend the bill
and appreciate your support.

but one of the things that didn't come up, and I wanted to pose a
question to Representative Hardister.
The Speaker Pro Tempore: Representative Hardister, does the gentleman
yield?
Rep. Hardister: I do.
The Speaker Pro Tempore: The gentleman yields.
Rep. Adams: Thank you, Representative Hardister. What provisions are
made right now for people who have disabilities, who go to these events,
who may be in the stands?
Rep. Hardister: I don't know a hundred percent for sure, but I don't
believe there are any, to my knowledge.
Rep. Adams: May I speak on the bill?
The Speaker Pro Tempore: The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
Rep. Adams: Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, I think it's a good bill.
I've looked at a lot of correspondence that have come from clubs across
the state, including the Grasshoppers in Greensboro in my district. But
I think I understand that currently you can go and purchase the beer,
you can leave the stands do it, but to bring it back, you're still
bringing it back up there, so I just really don't see what the fuss is
about. I think if it's going to help, I don't think convenience is a bad
thing, especially when you...</p>

Speaker changes: To speak on the bill.
Speaker changes: The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
Speaker changes: Thank you Mr. Speaker, we ran through the three
sections of the bill last week and I won’t do that again, but I do want
to add that over the last two and a half years the General assembly has
really worked to make a lot of improvements, in early childhood
education. You know in previous years it’s been study after study and we
tried to take action and actually move the ball down the field towards
the goal-line. And I believe we have done that and this is one step to
continue that to make sure again we are focusing on children who are at
risk and xx should improving early childhood education which is why in
the last two years we have taken high quality pre-K curriculum that we
are talking about at [xxx] and moving that over to the subsidy to the xx
programs ; there are many kids who may not even qualify for the Pre-K
program but in another four year old class private childcare facility
and receiving the same hard curriculum in those class rooms. There are
many children in the state receiving this opportunity either through
assistance of the state or through their parents paying but it is an
opportunity they have. We leave intact the quality, some we have had
subsidy dollars that go out into the community, the Federal dollars xx
which is why we have seen a rise in the number of high  quality of early
childhood facilities in the state. We are taking steps, we are serious
about doing that and we working to put early childhood education back on
track in the state making sure it is focusing on literacy, on health and
quality. This bill will continue us down that path and it helps us to do
that to working with the private sector in the childcare facilities and
I would respectfully ask members to support the bill and Mr. Speaker, do
you mind an amendment, I would like to amend the bill; an amendment I
would like to bring forward.
Speaker changes: The gentleman is recognized and the clerk will read.
Speaker changes: Representative Bryant wishes to amend the bill on page
five line 45 by rewriting the line to read..
Speaker changes: The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
Speaker changes: Thank you Mr. Speaker this makes a change on page five
that you can see again our intent is to make sure we are covering
children who are truly at risk, who is at the 100 percent Federal
poverty level  and this I send in for those, I have heard some concern
about the ability to cover the kids really at the, what the Governor
says, a  hundred and thirty percent. This amendment will do that, will
allow those counties who have concerns for members will allow to cover
up to 130percent and for more children to have access when the funds are
available. But the important piece here is to make sure we are covering
kids who are really at risk and this would do it and I would ask for
your support of this amendment and for the bill, thank you Mr. Speaker.
Speaker changes: Further discussion further debate on the amendment. If
not the question before the House is to pass it to the xxx and for the

alternate means for addressing their needs, again this would give a
period of time of approximately a year for everyone to get the
information and take whatever measures were necessary.</p>

I talked to the bill sponsor and tried to make sure the information was
available to other persons for their response, not sure of what the
bill's sponsor opinion is on this amendment is but certainly it is one
that gives people fair opportunity to find other measures to address the
needs that we know we have. We have the need under this bill we know
we're not meeting and all of the need as we've had in the past and this
would provide some additional time for folks to get resources in place
to meet the needs of the children of our state. I appreciate your
support on the amendment.

[speaker changes]
Gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[speaker changes]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I do appreciate Representative Hall bringing the
amendment forward, but I don't think its necessary. I can tell members
traditionally changes like this, early childhood education and others
are included in the budget, and these are changes that become effective
July 1 of that year, and traditionally, the budget passes at the end of
June and sometimes if not after that sometimes during July, so this is,
by passing this bill, we are giving folks additional notice beyond what
they would traditionally get, making sure they are aware these changes
happen every year and never seems to be an issue when eligibility has
been changed in the past or something of that effect, so I really see no
need in this change in the date, so I would ask that you oppose the
amendment. Thank you.

[speaker changes]

[speaker changes]
The gentlemen is recognized to debate the amendment.
[speaker changes]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I rise to support the amendment in part because I
raised I think one of the people raised the question on the date of the
original discussion of the bill. With the switch to the fact we have 45
administrative units that now are controlling, to be able to tell them
that they are going to have to switch in a matter of weeks, I think has
raised enormous problems in the field. I'm talking with folks back home,
and I know talking with other folks over the weekend across the state,
there are some partnerships that simply aren't ready to take this
administrative burden, they may be ready in a year, but they're not
ready now. There are others that really probably aren't in a position to
do so, with adequate resources to do so with administrative capacity,and
this really is a good measure to at least give time for that section of
the bill to come into play. As to eligibility on the bill, as it relates
to the amendment, again because we are making eligibility changes and I
really appreciate Representative Burr's amendment that moves to 100 to
130, lets not forget that we're still down from 200 percent. We're still
eliminating eligibility of tens of thousands of kids, recognize that
we're not going to fill those slots, when you change the eligibility,
it's not as if there's an automatic conversion list. The conversion list
won't happen in what my district tells me at least based on the 100
percent figure,is that given the change we're making, it will not be
able to fill all the slots, and we have a long waiting list, that they
will only be able to identify only 75 percent of the spots. We really
are affecting a lot of children who are not only eligible and are now
receiving the benefit of the program, and so I think Representative
Hall's amendment solves both those problems in at least the terms of
time to make sure we get all the kids we want to get, and that the
administrative capacity exists and I support the amendment.

think its a preparedness matter, preparedness of administration, it's
not, that's  not something you do over night, that's not something you
do by ripping the page of the budget document. Folks, I think we're
getting ready to make the mistake of passing this entire bill, if you're
gonna make that mistake, at least, soften this blow, because there's
some folks out there who are not going to be ready in a couple of
months. Thank you Mr. Speaker.

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Ladies and gentlemen, this amendment is designed to secure the concealed
carry permit for those who have gone through the laborious task.  My
concern is that by allowing someone who is determined necessary for
involuntary commitment, either to an in-patient or out-patient facility,
having subsequently gotten treatment and gone through the process to
have their rights restored, I believe a medical determination as well as
the judicial, that this person can then immediately go out and apply for
a concealed carry permit. My personal feeling is that it’s a little bit
of a rush and that we should have a waiting period.  My amendment
suggests a 7-year waiting period. Thank you.

Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Members, the amendment that I’ve sent
forth really is to do with the university provision.  In the bill, as
you may recognize as it exists now, it provides for bars and restaurants
to say, as I recall, that they don’t want to have carry conceal
entities.  They can post a conspicuous notice and prohibit that from
occurring. This is simply to ask, or would allow the institutions of
higher education, public and private, to do the same. That is, if their
boards don’t want carry conceal on their campuses, they can post a
conspicuous notice that says no as well. It seems to me if we’re willing
to protect bar and restaurant to that extent,…</p>

Mister Speaker, Linda Fisher, please take your purpose on the sticker
for the latest they were going. I also come in order Mister Speaker,
ladies and gentleman
and I really am concerned about what were doing it this afternoon on we
always like to set a good example, especially for the pages here each
week and I think that what we're seeing here is what you are witnessing
after name is not the way through the debate happens. I think the is a
way to reduce later point in order to recognize how important is that I
would like to see a loud that they continue on these amendments, rather
than to have them lay on the table or cut off that it may thank you
recognize   your purpose
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
, you were to respond to someone who weighs one order from mining is the
point of personal privilege, you must recognize members of the physician
members. I was super for the November matters to every concerns to rule
sixteen, a rules page one fourteen of your book motion. the table was an
order is, it is a motion of higher precedence. it is one in which the
numbers are allowed to make one in which the speakers allowed to take
any point and would just point out to the member that this motion is
being made. they are contemplated by the rules and just for my life
forcibly following our rules
and represented Fisher, just by way of clarification, you may notice
that in some cases, an amendment has been sent forth, and a sponsored
event is an opportunity to speak before the motion was taken in another
instance, the most was taken immediate after the date immediately after
that member recognizes them for the amendment. the difference being that
in the cases where of the motion was made by the rules chair without
explaining amendment at amendment was not introduced are allowed to be
reviewed by the chair until the moment that the minimum set forth in
other words to sponsor the event requested that the content of the
moment not be disclosed until the point in time when the chair
recognizes Mister the fourth, which means that there was literally no
time until that point versus take a position on the amendment is for
that reason I've taken many rules chairs advice on a disposition that
using today and I will be made up and well be the case in instances
where the chair and a quarter carcass, Adam possession the chair and the
roles jurors had an opportunity to see the amendment sponsor of the
amendment will have an opportunity to speak with forwards those of the

...marked out the good guys and bad guys on my copy, and it says
&quot;law-abiding citizens with guns versus criminals with guns.&quot;
And to answer my colleague's question, &quot;Well, how do you tell the
difference?&quot; with a law-abiding citizen with a gun, is someone that
has a gun not to commit a crime, but to protect himselfs and their
families from a crime.  It can be a defensive weapon as well, you know.
Criminals, on the other hand, would be defined as those that choose not
to obey laws for whatever reason.  They're carrying a weapon for the
purpose of committing a crime.  And it is the opinion of many, and I
think it is the opinion of the majority of the people in this state,
that passing more gun laws and passing more prohibitions against
citizens carrying guns is-- part of the reason that that's not the
answer is because a criminal, being defined by someone who's not going
to obey the law anyway--
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would representative Jones yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones, I heard you say just a moment
ago that you do not think people of this state want any more gun safety
measures.  Did I hear you correctly, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No sir, I didn't say that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I thought you said something along those lines.  Could
you tell me what you did say about gun safety amendments, et cetera?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Will member please restate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, I was just asking, as a follow-up if I might.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, Representative Jones, I heard you say that you
thought the people of this state do not want more amendments,
legislation, et cetera, in the area of gun safety.  Are you telling me
that I did not hear you correctly?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I don't believe that's exactly what I said
Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Would you then kindly-- I'll sit down if you'll kindly
state-- restate-- what you said.  I understood you to say that people
did not want, the people of this state did  not want more gun safety.
Because I was going to point out the majority of people of this state of
all political parties do support banning assault weapons, according to
the latest public opinion poll.  Wondered if you could elaborate on your
point.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir.  I don't believe I mentioned assault
weapons.  People define those in different ways.  I believe what I said
if I can recall exactly what I said, was that law-abiding citizens with
guns were citizens that carry guns for the purpose of defending
themselves and their family.  They're not carrying those guns for the
purpose of committing a crime.  And I believe that I pointed out that
criminals as I would define it are people who are interested in breaking
the law and are carrying guns for the purpose of breaking the law.  And
I believe that I pointed out that it was my opinion that the majority of
people in this state happen to believe that-- they believe in Second
Amendment rights, they believe in the right to carry a weapon and defend
oneself, and I believe that they do not want to see us passing more laws
that most people don't think that criminals are going to obey to start
with.  So if that helps to clarify my position, I would like to say that
I think that the majority of the people would agree-- probably all the
people would agree-- with every legislator in here.  We don't like
violence.  We don't like gun violence.  And if, I believe if you'll read
your history you'll find-- in American history, in world history, all
the way back to the beginning of time-- we've seen tremendous acts of
violence, terrible acts of violence that I don't even think we want to
go into today, long before the gun was ever invented.  And so I think--
I know that the left generally drives this debate, and any time there's
an act of violence that's committed by a gun, the left wants to pass
more laws against carrying guns.  And I would simply point out that I
think history proves otherwise.  I do recall, and this was before my
time, but as a student of history I believe that one of the reasons that
Japan did not invade the United States of America, at least what they
said after World War II, was because they believed that the American
people were the largest fighting force in the world because the citizens
of this country had the opportunity to have weapons.  They didn't want
to invade this country.  And all I'm saying is that if you don't like
good guys with guns versus bad guys with guns, maybe think about
law-abiding citizens able to carry guns to defend themselves versus
criminals carr...</p>

And guns to commit a crime. And that was the point that I believe that I
was trying to make and I would encourage your passage for this good
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lucas, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. To give you a little bit of
background on where I, from whence I come, I believe strongly in the
second amendment rights. I’m a long time member of NRA. I’m a long time
hunter and I believe in guns. I was taught to handle guns by my father.
When my own son was of height, I taught him how to handle guns. My son
has taught his son, which is my grandson who served as a page here a
couple weeks ago, how to handle guns. So I believe in guns, and I
believe in gun safety. But as I’ve listened to this debate, I’m almost
like King Agrippa, when he was approached by the Apostle Paul. Almost
have been persuaded. But now my heart’s heavy, because I’ve witnessed
debate on this floor that’s been curtailed, channeled, cut off, on
amendments that I think could make this bill better, so that many of us
could vote on this bill. Because we do believe in keeping our families
safe. And so that bothers me. I want this state to be safe. We all want
that. I don’t think there’s anybody doesn’t want this state to be safe.
We all believe in gun safety. But whenever we cut off wholesome debate
that could be utilized to make this bill a palatable bill, I’m very
gravely concerned. I would have to vote no as this bill now stands. And
the primary reason, if you will look on page 2, line 1, it states that
even if you have a concealed carry weapon and you have that in a public
place, you’re breaking the law if you open that glove compartment. Now
what good is that gun in a locked glove compartment if you’re being
accosted? I’m breaking the law if I open that compartment. It says at
all times, it has to be locked up. So think about it. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
be recognized to send forward an amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk will read.

1, line 27 by changing the period on that line to a semicolon and adding
the following. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For a
motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, point of order. [SPEAKER CHANGES]

Representative Michaux, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. Speaker, I do not have an amendment to send forward
so they won't have the privilege of knocking down an amendment I might
have had.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman continues to be recognized to debate the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, lots of things
have been tried in order to get some things done in here. But you know a
couple of weeks ago I spoke to you about an oath that we all took to
support the Constitution of the United States and to support the
Constitution of the State of North Carolina as long as it was not
inconsistent with the United States Constitution. That was the oath that
you took. That was which you placed your hand on the bible to do.
So what I want to do today is simply to call your attention to the
Constitution of the State of North Carolina. Article 1, Section 30. An
oath of one look it up. Article 1, Section 30, of the North Carolina
Constitution. The first phrase in that section sets out Article 2 of the
United States Constitution, which you call the right to bear arms, which
shall not be infringed.
Second part of that section also sets out another constitutional
amendment which says about, talks about standing armies. But it is to
the last phrase in that particular section of the North Carolina
Constitution that I will call to your attention. That phrase says,
&quot;Nothing herein shall justify the practice of carrying concealed
weapons or prevent the General Assembly from enacting penal statutes
against that practice.&quot; That's our constitution. That's what it
says. So in order to be sure that I was on some kind of firm ground, I
went back to check to see whether or not there was any pieces or
anything involving this particular section of the Constitution. And I
did find something and to show you the Constitution we're reading from
is the Constitution of 1971. Well the case, and only case I found
referring to that particular section of the constitution was in 1921,
which meant that that same phrase was in the constitution even before
1971. And here's what it said, &quot;For case stating that the last
clause of this provision constitution exception to the first,&quot;
remember the first clause was the right to bear arms. The last law was
the one against concealed weapons. It indicates the extent to which the
right of the people to bear arms can be restricted. That is that the
legislature can prohibit and prohibit the carrying of concealed weapons
but no further.
Now what I have told you ladies and gentlemen today is what the
Constitution of North Carolina says. And of course, there's that old
saying that goes around, &quot;What's the constitution among
friends.&quot; Well, you want to be friends? I think the constitution
means a lot, but it's there. That's what it says. And you can go on and
continue doing what you're doing but you remember that you placed your
hand on the bible and swore to uphold the constitution.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Ballins, please state your purpose.</p>

we'd seen last night and this afternoon has not been democracy at work,
I'm not sure what word should be used. But I would just simply say that
it's wrong. And I think the people of North Carolina would agree with me
that it's wrong that amendments to a bill that are sent forward in good
faith, that are representing  the views of each of us who send forward
an amendment, and I'm including that- my Republican colleague whose
amendment was tabled. When each of use sends forward an amendment, ??

added to that bill,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Daughtry, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of order, he's supposed to be arguing the bill. He's talking
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Chair was providing latitude, but the Chair was about to arrive at
the same point from Rep. Daughtry which was well taken. Rep. Luebke,
we're debating the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, I'll move back onto that track.
When we had those amendments they should have been heard. Up or down
votes for each of us to be able to report back to our constituents. Why?
Because it is my belief that particularly the two items that were
raised, added to the bill, and I believe Rep. Jackson can correct me if
wrong, but I think in his, the committee in which he was, judiciary
committee, the item to allow for weapons to be carried onto campuses,
Can we cut the chatter a bit?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House will come to order.
The gentleman is debating the bill, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir, I certainly am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may proceed.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Talking about the amendments that were added in the committee, one
having to do with whether guns can be carried onto
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Jones, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ask if the gentleman would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Luebke does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You yielded for me, I'll yield for you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative, I appreciate that. I've enjoyed our dialogue
today. I just wanted to ask you in the spirit of- I know that you're
upset about the fact that these amendments have not been heard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You were here back in the good old days, so to speak, when your party
was in the majority and this bill could have been written so that the
entire bill could have been in the title and no bill could have been
offered. Was that the right thing to do Representative?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I think you would know if you knew me and my all my 23 years
that're here, I've often not agreed with the reasons that leadership of
the Democratic party might have made. I happen to like, as I told the
speaker last night, the fact that we can change the title on the floor.
So I happen to think that is one of the innovations, that was a good
one. I will acknowledge that. I do think though, going back to the bill,
sir, and ?? regarding process Mr. Speaker. On the bill, being able to
bring a weapon onto a college campus. In response to that action by the
committee, the President of the University of North Carolina, each of
the chancellors at the 16 campuses, and as I understand it, each of the
chiefs of police on the 16 campuses requested that that item within the
bill, that portion of the bill be removed from the bill.
Rep Adams brought forth an amendment, or tried to last night, to get a
vote on the amendment to do just that, which not just average citizens
but actually fairly prominent citizens of our state were asking this
general assembly, this state house to do. I completely agree with all
the chancellors, with the President, with the chiefs of police that guns
do not belong on campus. I'd bet you if PPPB does a poll, they'd find
that the majority of North Carolinians agrees, the majority agrees with
me on this. But the fact is, we were denied a vote on something that is
of great importance to the leaders of our education institution. I just
think that's a mistake, it's a mistake in policy, but it's also a
mistake that we couldn't show the leaders of our education institutions
where we stand on this item.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And secondly, on the item ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Horn ?? if the gentleman will yield.
Rep. Horn, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'd like to ask the gentleman a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Luebke, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will, it might be faster if I just didn't but go ahead, as you wish.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Brief question. Do you really believe that there are no guns on college
or university campuses today? Do you really believe that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would say that under current law, if there are they're in violation of
the law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That  wasn't my question sir.

...We have contract employers who frequent the campus as well.  The
safety of visitors, students and staff and faculties at the universities
is provided by trained law enforcement personnel. And that is the way it
should be. I know we have heard that the Sheriff's association supports
firearms on campuses, but sheriffs do not provide the protection and
security to these campuses. They arrive usually after instances have
occurred. All of these schools have said to us that they prefer to keep
the number of weapons allowed on campus to a minimum. I have had the
privilege of serving on a college campus for forty years, and I know
that students often engage in risky behaviors, and to add the legal
possession of weapons as a possibility could very well lead to
disastrous consequences that none of us really want.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Arp, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I ask Representative Adams a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Adams, does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I may finish, I will be happy to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields at the end of her comments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As I said before, college students engage in risky behaviors, and we
really shouldn't be adding to those possibilities. I think if we are
going to error today, we should do it on the side of making sure that
campuses are safe, that they are safe environments for our students, for
our employees, for visitors including young children who are on the
campuses. The potential for tragedy having weapons on college campuses
far outweighs any potential benefit or convenience to carry concealed
permit holders. And having said that Mr. Speaker, I would like to send
forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Adams is recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk
will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Adams moves to amend the bill on page one, lines nine
through eleven by rewriting those lines to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Moore, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a motion, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Move that the lady's amendment to lie upon the table.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Second.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The motion, having been made by Representative Moore is seconded by
Representative Burr to lie upon the table. The amendment sent forth by
Representative Adams, for the house committee substitute to house bill
937. All in favor vote aye, all opposed vote no, the clerk will open the
vote.
[silence]
Clerk, the machine will record the vote, 71 having voted in the
affirmative, 44 in the negative, the motion passes. Ladies and Gentleman
of the house, just from  Representative Wilkins' question earlier
prompted me to do a better job of explaining the process we were going
through there, when someone is recognized to send forth an amendment,
they have the floor. If some other member, just as you sometimes do, to
ask or interrupt a member to ask the floor to ask a question. A member
can also be recognized to offer or to be recognized for a motion of
higher precedence. There is only a limited number of them, the motion to
table is one of them, and it is a non-debatable motion. And in that
particular case, the member was recognized for that purpose, and that is
why the sequence of the debate goes as it did, and as it just did with
Representative Adams' motion. Representative Adams, would the lady like
to be recognized a second time to debate the bill? Representative Larry
Hall, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Mr. Speaker, a question on procedure, based on what you just
explained.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, when a member sends forward an amendment, isn't it correct
that the member is the first one that has to be recognized after the
amendment, prior to anyone else being recognized?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not necessarily, Representative Hall, in fact, the member could have
spoken the first word had another member interrupted as sometimes
happens here and has happened today, and at that point in time, the
member could have been recognized  for that motion, or for that matter
could have been recognized for a motion to adjourn, which we would have
also taken a vote on.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his second inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, you indicated that some of the motions were not heard
because they were not disclosed in advance, and this is the first that
members have heard, is there a specific period of time that motions to
amend, or amendments have to be disclosed?  Is there a specific period
of time so that we know going forward?</p>

<p id="145:00">
How much ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think your point is well taken, representative Hall.  I think as a
professional courtesy to the members on either side that if an amendment
is going to be brought forth that the first time that it would occur and
in fact before the dashboard you would have at least had the length of
time between the time the sergeant at arms sends forth an amendment and
reading it.  So, what we're trying to do is just simply say there's
really very little or no value to kind of a lash on the dashboard at the
Point I'm going to debate it.  If you intend to debate the amendment, if
you intend be extened the courtesy to explain and debate an amendment,
then extend a courtesy to the members to have an opportunity to review
it before they're both having to listen to you debate an amendment and
read the amendment for the first time.  So I think as a general rule,
not in every case, there could be amendments that are consensus
amendments that the chair would direct members to get the amendments
before the body as early as possible so members could be at their desk
and review them before they're taken up and recorded vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Final question, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his third inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Appreciate the indulgence and of course the question I have is when
members decide an amendment on the floor as the result of the debate
that we have on the floor.  Does that mean that those amendments that
are drawn while we're on the floor will not be entertained, or will
there be a delay, or will the bill be displaced?  Will we have that
courtesy, it will be automatically displaced?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I actually do believe that there is merit to the idea of having the bill
temporarily displaced, particularly for more complex amendments.
Technical amendments, I would argue are probably not one that we need to
worry about.  But if there are contentious amendments, I do believe that
there's something to be said for temporarily displacing the bill, so
that members can take a look at the amendment and be prepared to have a
debate on the content of the amendment.  Representative Brandon, please
state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wasn't gonna speak on the bill, but this debate is not organized in
any kind of way.  But I do notice that we talked, and I think on both
sides of this issue, and we've really do have an issue here going on,
and I think that we talk around each other and people are not really
listening to what each other is saying, because there's so much
rhetoric.  I have a lot of my friends that really support this bill, and
I've tried to get them to understand where they're coming from when they
say that they support this bill, and it really does come down to a
matter of protection.  And I get that.  At first I did not think it was
the number of people that actually supported that view, but it was all
my friends that was a conglomerate of them that had this view of I have
to be able to protect myself.  And I thought that, you know, the whole
notion that another country is going to come and take over our country,
and we're going to have a shootout in culdesac that is totally, I didn't
get that, I didn't foresee that as happening.  But there are people that
have that notion.  Then there's other people that have a different view
of protection, and they're saying I just want to protect myself from the
people that might just be in the community.  And I certainly get that.
And I understand it.  I don't think that some people on our side
understand that when we're talking about that's where the essence of
where comes from.  This is on the other side, I don't think that you
guys get when we're talking about these gun laws that we're talking
about a gun culture that we're trying to stop in terms of the way that
the criminals use it, and I know that you guys feel like everybody that
has a gun, especially in this law right here, that everybody's going to
intend to use it the way that we want to use it.  But at the end of the
day, we know that the fact that we are 5% of the world's population, and
we've got 50% of the world's guns, that that seems to be a little
excessive.  And when you have that, you have a gun culture.  And that is
the reason why we also have the highest number of murders, and gun
related incidents.  And we cannot ignore that to be fact because it is
just fact.  There's no other way to put it.  There's no other statistic
that you can come up with.  It is factual.  We have the highest number
of gun balances that anybody in the world.  And we can choose to ignore
that.  We can choose to ignore it just like we can choose to ignore the
fact that there's an elementary school sitting there, helpless
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Brandon does the gentleman yield?  The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.

Do you not agree, sir, that we can't change a gun culture by taking guns
away from the people who observe the law first</p>

<p id="150:00">
And see, thats my point, in sensationalism, nobody's trying to take
anybody's guns away. Its one of those sensational arguments that we use
just so everybody can get scared and jump up and down at the county
convention but its not even close to being true. Nobody's trying to take
a gun away. What we're simply saying is that there has to be a way that
we deal with culture. The same way that we dealt with smoking, and I'm a
smoker. But the because we passed laws in this body and because the
country decided that we wanted to break down on it, it changed the
culture of smoking. So the people that are coming up at the same age I
was coming up are less likely to use cigarettes and to be addicted to
cigarettes. That what a culture change can do to the way we think about
it. The way we...
[Speaker Changes] Follow up.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Warren, does the gentleman yield to a
follow up?
[Speaker Changes] Absolutely.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Brandon, in 1984, we enacted a seatbelt
law, and at that time I resisted to put on a seatbelt. But now I find
that I can't pull out of the garage unless I put my seatbelt on. We
changed that culture. But nobody ever tried to beat me to death with a
seatbelt. I understand what you're saying, i think. But i disagree with
the premise. We do have a gun culture, I'll agree to that, Ill accept
that. But we have a gun culture because we've done a lot other things in
our society that kind of facility that culture. We've removed some of
the self disciplines that come into the normal socialization process of
our children and in our society. We've done it through mass media, we've
done it through our institutions. And now we have a gun culture. But we
also have a gun culture because we have more freedom than any other
country in the world. And its gotten to the point that, where as
pathetic and sad as it is, if youre going to go to the 7 eleven at ten o
clock or eleven o clock at night, you might want to be armed. We have
people who are getting killed in burger kings and mcdonalds, its a gun
culture.
[Speaker Changes] Speaker.
[Speaker Changes] Is the gentleman going to state his question?
[Speaker Changes] Yeah, so can you tell me how passing laws that
restrict an individuals opportunity to carry a gun for self protection
is going to help change that culture without killing that person?
[Speaker Changes] Representative Warren, I didn't disagree with anything
that you said. I didn't disagree with one thing. But my point is, that
the culture that we have, this is a comprehensive way that we have to
deal with this. We also, I look at it from our standpoint, and we
sensationalize it, talking about these mass tragedies that happen. These
gun laws don't effect that, and we've gotta be honest about that. It
would not protect the kids in Connecticut if we passed these laws. And I
am a believer that somebody has to be in that school to stop that
gunman. So I believe in doing it in common sense. What happens is, when
we both talk at each other, and we don't listen, the kids at the school
don't get protected and we still have more guns and nothing ever gets
fixed because everybody's yelling you're trying to take my guns away,
and yore like oh protect the kids, and its not even the argument.
Neither one. Neither one is the argument. The argument is that how do we
have...
[Speaker Changes] Mr. Speaker.
[Speaker Changes] Representative Wilkins, please state your purpose.
[Speaker Changes] It is with great trepidation that I am going to make
an inquiry of the Chair.
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[Speaker Changes] Mr. Speaker are we still on the bill, or are we
wandering around just a little bit?
[Speaker Changes] The gentleman's point is well taken.
[Speaker Changes] I thought we were talking about gun laws, are we not?
[Speaker Changes] If the chair would just indulge this chair over here,
the chair would appreciate it. But we're allowing a bit of discussion
because the chair does recognize that there was easily 6 or 7 amendments
that still easily be being debated right now, before we got to what the
chair believes is the final debate. So I'm allowing a little more
latitude than normal out of deference to the members who may have
referenced some of this in the process of debating some of the
amendments. The gentleman's point is well taken. The gentleman would ask
members to try and tighten their comments just because the hour is late
and the chair intends to get through the entire calendar before we leave
today.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. Speaker, I was responding to a question
that was asked to me. But I do think that the whole entire question has
to do with everything that part of the bill, which is my point. This
bill did not address all of the issues that we wanted to do, so
therefore I believe, and I'm gonna conclude with my comments, but I do
believe that at some point when we're heaving the gun debate, that we
would stop the sensationalizing of this debate, stop yelling you're
taking away my guns, stop yelling that we gotta protect people that the
law doesn't really, if we did it, its not gonna really protect people.
Lets have a really good debate on what's going...</p>

Those 49 victims of that crime from the ability to carry a gun, because
they were law abiding citizens. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my opinion
that if they had had the ability to have conceal carry and to be
carrying a weapon ion that campus at that time, many of those victims
would be alive today. That’s what this debate is all about. I understand
that there’s differences of opinion. The University President is
entitled to his opinion and you’re entitled to your opinion and I’m
entitled to mine, and the voters of this State are entitled to their
opinions. But, it is the opinion of the majority and I believe that the
reason this will pass today. It’s what I said earlier, had there been
conceal carry had those students at Virginia Tech had the ability to
defend themselves. Had that shooter known that those victims could have
been carrying a gun even if they weren’t, I believe that many of them
would be alive today. And ladies and gentlemen for that reason, I will
be voting for this bill. Representative Blass/g please state your
purpose.
[Speaker _change] Speak on the bill.
[Speaker _change] The gentlemen recognize to abate the bill.
[Speaker _change] Mr. Speaker, members of the House, really it is a sad
day for this House when I’ve got to get up an explain a simple stickman
argument that is self-explanatory, but it does go to the heart of this
bill, the explanation. In the first frame, the good guys have guns and
the bad guys have guns. The bad guys don’t use those guns, because they
know the good guys have guns. So, it restrains the bad guys and it makes
the use of any gun unnecessary. That’s what this bill is designed to try
to do. In the second frame, the good guys don’t have guns. The bad guys
know there aren’t. There’s gun free zones. There’s easy pickings so the
bad guys take a step toward the good guys with their guns out. That’s
what we don’t want and this bill, it should be pointed out and
emphasized  it deals only with concealed carry permit holders. It’s not
letting everybody and their brother come on a campus, go into a
restaurant or do anything with guns unless they have a concealed carry
permit in which they are thoroughly vetted and have a great history of
law abiding practice form our concealed carry holders. In the original
conceal carry debate, there was prediction from the same quarters of gun
fights at high noon at the Okay Coral, same thing we’re hearing now and
it did not transpire. You can trust the law abiding people. Some of the
representatives are right, there are already guns on the campuses. There
are already guns on the walking trails. There are already guns in the
park. This puts some doubt into the minds of  would be criminals that I
could get resistance and the criminologists and the law enforcement
people tell ya’, they look for easy pickings. They’ll move on if they
think someone is gonna put up resistance. So, it’s common sense as far
as park schools, it’s only in a car, it’s not, you can’t carry the
permit holder, can’t carry the weapon around campus. It, it’s common
sense because it makes it easy to drive up, you don’t have to drive home
first or drive somewhere else and leave your concealed carry weapon if
you’re somewhere else.  If you are taking a class at night, you can just
drive from work to the, to the campus. So, it makes it easy to…
[Speaker _change] Representative [inaudible] please, the gentleman will
yield. Representative Ford/g please state your purpose.

Are allowed to leave their guns, locked in their cars on campuses.  That
they would be the source of increased crimes and violence. I reject that
notion. Analyses
properly laid on those criminals and those who would do harm, not on the
law abiding citizen.  I would say that that’s a result of a biased
against concealed carry permit holders.  Where ever else do we limit the
rights and freedoms of law abiding citizens because of the possible
actions of the criminals?  This bill affords law abiding, properly
permitted concealed carry permit holders to carry their weapons in a
proper and lawful manner.  And I reject the notion that any crime or
violence associated with that should be laid at their feet, rather than
the criminals who have perpetrated crimes.

Representative Martin, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And Members of the House, I am happy to tell you
this is a very straight forward bill.  I do, however have 15 minutes of
materials prepared.  In the essence of time, I will be try to net it
out, but happy to answer all of your questions.  As the title indicates,
this bill will repeal the death tax. That is it.  Prior to this year, if
we had repealed the death tax, it would not have benefited our tax
payers in North Carolina because of the federal law. With the fiscal
cliff deal that was made in December, that law has changed and so now
the federal law for the death tax does not take a full 100% credit for
what they would have paid in North Carolina. So in essence, if we do not
make this change, we will have a tax increase for those people who are
affected by the estate tax. This is brought forward mainly for those
folks in agriculture, and as you know agriculture is the number 1
industry in North Carolina and our family farmers are hard-working

F tax Tennessee has one that is going off the books in 2016. Otherwise
none of our neighboring states have this tax. Very simple to eliminate
it we've gone through a lot of proposals on tax reform that we will work
through that are complicated it will be nice to have something simple
where we can take the cost of having to deal with this off the table
from the state I commend the bill to you and ask for your full
support[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Lucas please state the
purpose[SPEAKER CHANGES]speak briefly on the bill[SPEAKER
CHANGES]gentlemen has the floor[SPEAKER CHANGES]thank you Mr. Speaker,
members of the house first of all, this should not be referred to as a D
tax it is an estate tax furthermore it is to be exact it is a tax on a
estate with value of over five million dollars if you were a single
person and a tax on an estate more than 10 million dollars if you were a
couple So let's be straight on how few people in NC will be affected by
this. It is not accurate after reading this with my colleague
Representative Martin it is not accurate to say this is about saving NC
farms if you do any research on this tax you'll find that this tax on 10
million dollar estates was only paid by 23 families last year 23
families and these 23 families were so wealthy that they paid the state
of NC 50 million dollars so when you vote yes on this bill you are
giving 23 families 50 million dollars and just for one think about that
pre K bill that we just passed[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Speaker will reduce
eligibility and what it was one of the[SPEAKER CHANGES]representative
thank you[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Stevens please state your purpose[SPEAKER
CHANGES]gentlemen ?? I'm trying to be brief thank you thank you .....
arguments made on Thursday we were told one of the reasons why we
couldn't maintain the wide eligibility to help more people young people
with the Pre K program was because we didn't have the money. Well
friends here is 50 million dollars right here per year all you got to do
is send this bill back to committee and we'll have 50 million dollars
more in availability the bill should go back to appropriations where it
can be part of the general budget debate as how much tax revenue we need
fee revenue and how much appropriations we want to make it's a mistake
to have the bill on the floor but certainly it is important and I'll
stop with this remember you are giving 23 families 50 million dollars
and if you can defend that to your constituents I love to hear it thank
you urge you to vote against the bill or support this motion to send it
to appropriations thank you</p>

[Speaker changes.].....state your purpose?
[Speaker changes.] Wanted to see the gentleman would yield for a
question?
[Speaker changes.] Representative Queen, do you yield?
[Speaker changes.] I will.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Queen, when these people...if they are
massive landowners and they're getting this exemption when they have a
death...during the course of their life, haven't they paid a lot in
property taxes?
[Speaker changes.] You do pay property taxes to your county government
year after year.
[Speaker changes.] Follow up?
[Speaker changes.] Representative Queen, do you yield?
[Speaker changes.] I do?
[Speaker changes.] And, as these individuals have earned income and
purchased property and bought things, have they not been taxed on that
income?
[Speaker changes.] I don't...I think every dollar any of us spend is a
after-tax dollar so, if I buy stocks today, or if I buy a car or
anything ...anybody in this room, only spends an after-tax dollar so
they're no different...rich people from anybody else in that regard.
[Speaker changes.] Correct but in...?
[Speaker changes.] But if they buy a equity-building asset, like a stock
or a bond or property...and it appreciates over time, they get to defer
the income gains until a sales event or if they make more than they
spend for their whole life and they die, then that is the sales event.
So they pay their taxes on that gain like anybody else does and they
have had the entire, year-after-year of tax-deferred benefits that
working people who are just paying for their hourly wage or whatever,
never receive so it's a benefit of managing wealth that many regular
wage earners never get to participate in and that's one of the reasons,
the rich get richer and the workin' man just pays more taxes. Because if
we give the rich people these kinds of exceptional...two million dollars
a piece...tax break, somebody else has to pick up the freight for this
early childhood bill we just worked on this afternoon or funding our
universities or economic development or any of the other things that
require revenue so, whenever you give the wealthy a &quot;buy&quot; on
their taxes, somebody else picks up the freight or they drop the
services and benefits.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Chairman, would the speaker yield?
[Speaker changes.] I will.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Queen yields. Representative Ramsey,
you have the floor.
[Speaker changes.] Repre...Senator Queen, are you familiar with a little
organization in North Carolina called North Carolina Farm Bureau?
[Speaker changes.] I am...I'm a member.
[Speaker changes.] Follow up?
[Speaker changes.] Gentleman yield?
[Speaker changes.] Yep.
[Speaker changes.] Do you understand what North Carolina Farm Bureau's
position is on this bill?
[Speaker changes.]  I think they're in favor of it.
[Speaker changes.] One more follow up.
[Speaker changes.] Gentleman yield?
[Speaker changes.] Would it be the position of Representative Queen that
North Carolina Farm Bureau only represents the rich and wealthy in this
state?
[Speaker changes.] In this respect, I would say yes. I am a member and
they have met with me and I have an estate tax problem and they've
explained to me that they can definitely take care of me, not to worry.
That's one of their member services. That's why I don't know of a single
farmer who can aff...who's ??????? five million dollar estate that can't
afford an accountant.  My accountant told me whatever it is, we can
shelter three times the amount. Just plan on that but you oughta' make
the plan ahead of time and most wealthy people who make plenty of money,
have plenty of accountants and they make plenty of plans ahead of time
to shelter income.  We, as a legislature, just need to be fair that
everybody pays their fair share of taxes...that's all I am saying. This
is unbelievably unfair when you give one group of the wealthiest, most
successful citizens who the whole economy works very well for...a two
million dollar break and the poor kid who can't get...the poor citizen
who can't get his child in daycare....early childhood development
services is cut because there's no revenue. So I just try to add a
little common sense to this. How many people would twenty-three out of
nine million be?? I mean...that's....
[Speaker changes.] ?

[SPAEKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members this is a bill long

bill. This is something that will do a lot to help folks in this state,
the family farmers the middle class those who work hard and playing by

according to the rule the minority leader or the majority leader has the

put the question there were no lights on for the minority carcass.
However the three minute allocation is still available by rule.
Representative Hall please state your purpose.
[SPAEKER CHANGES] Speak for three minute.
[SPAEKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to speak for three
minutes.
[SPAEKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker and I would have yield my time
to representative Moore but he is busy right now so I will go ahead and
speak for these issues of before so as we talk about what is gonna be
1st of all whether or not folks of middle class who would be taken
advantage of this tax cut we should be so lucky that the average middle
class family of North Carolina whatever the definition is would
constitute a family that had a 5 million plus dollar in state there will
be a transfer from 1 generation to next. Second of all when we think
about money over 50 million dollars and revenues that would come out of
the funds of North Carolina the question becomes how many teacher
accessed how much free care how much teacher's assistance how much
access to education of we allocate. How much are we losing as far
accessed to Medicaid? What is its costing is because we certainly half
cut up budget down as much as we can do. I am sure that everyone will
say that it was there the effort of last cycle to cut the budget as much
as they could. So now there is an additional 50 million dollars as you
saying is gonna be this place from somewhere and we have already taken
the teacher out we have already taken the earned income tax credit away
thousands of North Carolinians and now we gonna say we have
comprehensive tax reform but we say before we do that thus people have
little been here on the side are 5 million dollar plus States that are
middle class North Carolinians but at what price again how many teachers
how many teacher's assistance how many people accessed the health care
where are we gonna passing this from and who will needs this as a
benefit and I am sure everyone will say let's not have any taxes at all
this all come here for free this let it free for everything no one pays
the roles no one pays the traffic signal all just have or for free and
we know it's not that way so again I urge you to vote against this if we
have gonna do comprehensive tax reforms let's do that let's not do it
piece meal and single out individuals don't have the stand the tax rest
of North Carolinians and get a special exemption for paying their fair
share.

can all be in the situation when they were were facing a substantial
estate, but I think it is your mistaken when you say that these are all
very wealthy people looking like it, and how some of the people in this
state have accumulated wealth. all they're doing is they have worked
hard. they've saved they've accumulated a home were some Land or farmer.
perhaps they've made some investments in some stocks and over a period
of years, they've accumulated in value while there we want to punish
people for being thrifty and for saving and sacrificing. we were winning
to reward these people who are just trying to get ahead and then they
just won't be able to leave some of their assets to their children. they
worked hard for their families, not from the state of North Carolina. I

Representative Jackson, section one and three go together because both
of them, section three also repeals a statute that says how you appeal
from district court to superior court. What we're doing is if the person
in district court's probation is violated--revoked--instead of giving
them three bites of the apple, we're giving them two bites of the apple.
In other words, under current law they have the right to appeal the
court of appeals, another to appeal to superior court. Here we're
cutting out the superior court. And they do have recording equipment, if
you'll look at lines 22 and 23, the district courts in fact do, are
courts of record. You can get transcripts, they have court reporters in
district court--just not in all court rooms at all times. But with the
change of this bill, instead of having that action occur twice and then
having the court report to superior court and then going up, it'll go
straight from one to the other.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You're of the opinion that all district courts, every
county has a district court that is capable of preparing a proper record
on these probation violation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All district courts do, not all district court rooms
do. And the reason I say they do, is if you look at subsection C, they
have to be able to do that for civil actions, they have it for family
court, and they have it for juvenile court, where they have the record
prepared from district court directly to the court of appeals.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Like in a county like Wake, where the civil actions
are held in court rooms that are full Monday through Friday with
recording devices, they would actually have to go add these recording
devices to whatever courtroom does probation cases. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That's right. They'll have to hold these hearings in
one of the courtrooms where they do have a tape recorder, but they would
have to do that anyway in a superior court later. We're just cutting out
one step. But they may actually have to change which courtroom they send
district court probation revocations to, that is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Michaux, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House, my
remarks on this go to what Representative Jackson just raised. In the
committee meeting I asked for a report from the court of appeals about
accepting directly from the district court, appeals of probation
revocations. The first thing they wrote back was that requiring a direct
appeal from the district court to the court of appeals will require a
record--that is a transcript of the testimony to be made in the district
criminal court which has not been a court of record and could prove to
be costly. Since the court of appeals would have to review the
sufficiency of the evidence to show a violation. And then they further
said, &quot;Requiring a direct appeal to the court of appeals will have
a financial impact on the appellate defenders office, since that office
will have to provide counsel for the appeal.&quot; In terms of what it
would cost, what the court said was this, at this time they could not
make a, they were unable to estimate the number of additional court of
appeals judges and staff that may be necessary  to handle the number of
probation appeal cases that would now be eligible for appeal directly to
the court of appeals from district court under this bill. They further
go on to say that if the additional appeals filed in the court of
appeals were such that additional staff was required to process these
cases, three judges and their accompanying support staff, one executive
assistant and two research assistants per judge, would need to be
created since the court of appeals sits in panels of three judges. This
expansion would have a total first year cost of $1,327,425 and
$1,254,000 recurring annually thereafter. So, what this is doing is it
is adding an additional layer. Now, it works very well the way it is
going now. You go to district court, you have your revocation hearing.
If the person wants to appeal it, he appeals it to the superior court in
that county. If it is heard in, when it is heard....</p>

In Superior Court.  The record is made and then that person can appeal
it if they want to or if you know they think they have the grounds to
the Court of Appeals where the record will follow them. In this
instance, and what you have to understand is that in District Civil
Court there is a record of appeal and in District Criminal Case there is
no record of appeal.  I have a question as to this part of the bill and
Mr. Speaker, I would object to third reading in order to prepare an
amendment to take out that section of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, Representative Michaux having indicated that we will carry this
bill over.  Indicated objection, therefore we will carry this bill over
to third reading.  I’d like to make a, just a point for the remainder of
the evening.  I’ve  instructed the clerk to reduce the voting time from
fifteen seconds to ten  seconds. We’re going to try to move through the
agenda as expeditiously as possible and at 6 p.m. depending on how well
we have done it, we’ve already carried one bill over that we know is
going to be controversial tomorrow I believe, or at least will require
debate.  So we’ve got more bills to be covered tomorrow that’s why I’m
trying to get through as much of the calendar today. So at 6 p.m. we
will determine whether or not we will adjourn or recess based upon the
progress we make between now and 6 p.m.  Further discussion, further
debate on the second reading for House Bill 217? Representative
Harrison, please state your purpose.

The question for either of the bill sponsors so Representative Faircloth
or Stam. I’m just trying.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, I’ll be brief. I’m just trying to understand the impact on
juvenile proceedings because I know we’ve had several debate on raising
the age for which a juvenile can be considered accountable and it looks
like in this bill we’re lowering it. And 13 seems awfully young, I’m
just wondering if you could explain that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will, it’s not being lowered to 13. Age 13 is currently there for
first-degree murderers.  That’s not affected by this bill. This bill for
15 year olds has another procedure, but only for those accused of B1 and
B2 felonies.  And let me clarify what that is, because most B1, B2
felonies can’t even be committed by a 15 year old due to age but it does
include second-degree murder, first-degree rape, and first-degree sex
offense.  That’s really what we’re talking about. Some of the very most
serious crimes. And the problem with juvenile court for those folks, is
not that the juvenile courts are not wonderful or have just as good
judges,  just as wise judges as anyone else.  The problem is, that at
age 21, a juvenile judgment expires and they have to be set free. And a
commitment in juvenile court is to an indefinite term, and it’s not even
the judges setting them free,  but the Department of Public Safety.  So
you have no idea when they’ll come out for murder or first-degree rape.
So the bill, as amended in Committee, and this was Representative
Glazier amendment, is limited to those 15 year olds who commit the very
most serious crime and the DA wants to seek more punishment than the
juvenile court can possibly give. Let me clarify one other thing if I
could.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On Section 1, this does not add an additional layer of appeal.  It
reduces a layer of appeal. There is no extra appeal cost.  There’s
reduced appeal cost because there’s one less appeal.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate? If not, the question before the
House is the passage of the House Committee Substitute to House Bill
217.  All in favor, vote aye. All opposed vote no.  The clerk will open
the vote. The clerk will let the machine record the vote.  92 having
voted in the affirmative, 25 in the negative.  The House Committee
Substitute to House Bill 217 has passed its second reading and the,
Representative Michaux has stated an objection to third reading.  There
is a possibility that an amendment will be drafted and he will remove
that objection if that’s necessary so that we can dispose of it today.
For now it remains on the calendar.  House Bill 402 the clerk will read.

...supplement for flexible compensation plans offered by the state.
General Senate of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Szoka please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ladies and gentlemen, bottom line up front this bill will save some of
our eligible state employees money on their monthly health insurance
premiums and potentially can save the state twenty million dollars or
more every year. TriCare Primary is military insurance that all military
retirees receive when they retire from the military. Active duty receive
it upon retirement. Reservists receive it at age sixty after twenty
years of service. Many military retirees have second careers as state
employees. In the year 2007 approximately four thousand military
retirees were serving the state in a second career. TriCare supplemental
is an optional supplemental insurance plan that must be administered by
the employer and pays virtually one hundred percent of all deductibles
and co-pays not covered by TriCare primary. Prior to 2007 North Carolina
did offer TriCare supplemental to its employees who were military
retirees. Due to a change in federal law in 2007 we're not able to do
that. As I said approximately four thousand state employees use that
option of TriCare and TriCare supplemental as their primary health
insurance and they had to drop it in 2007. Recent change in federal law
allows us to offer that again. And as I said we'll be able to save
employees much money. An example a military employee and his spouse
currently paying on the eighty twenty plan six hundred six dollars a
month with TriCare primary and TriCare supplemental would pay a hundred
and thirty two dollars for savings of approximately four hundred and
seventy five dollars a month. So I think that's very significant for our
employees who are eligible for this. Additionally when you roll up the
numbers if we have at least four thousand it's about twenty million
dollars in savings for the state healthcare plan. Nobody knows right now
how many military retirees are actually state employees which is why
there's not a fiscal note with this bill. There is no opposition to this
bill. There is however a friendly amendment and Representative Jeter
will present that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jeter please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Send forth an an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment. The clerk will
read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jeter moves to mend the bill on page one lines fourteen

the following.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
As someone who operates a trucking company for a living I've never
understood the severity of the difference between may and shall.
Spending time in a chamber with attorneys you learn that difference very
quickly. This language actually enforces I think what Representative
Szoka said. It mandates it versus allowing it. Without the mandation of
the shall I think the bill loses some teeth. As Representative Szoka
said he supports the amendment and I would encourage its passage.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion further debate on the amendment. If not the question
before the House is the passage of the amendment sent forth by
Representative Jeter for House bill four oh two. All in favor vote aye.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Waddell is recognized to debate the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Members of the House, I know
we've had a long debate today, and I promised my fellow Representative
up here, Floyd, i wouldn't bore you with all the details, but I do
appreciate the chance to speak before sunset.  House Bill 505 is an
attempt to simply codify an existing program by the Division of Soil and
Water Conservation.  The present program was started as a pilot in 1997
to stay the feasibility of having the Division of Soil and Water do the
annual inspections of all concentrated animal feeding operations, in an
area to be determined by the Division of Soil and Water.  It was also in
conjunction with North Carolina Department of Water Quality.  It was
briefly assigned to 2 counties, Pender and Columbus, it was expanded to
include Jones and Brunswick counties. The Division of Soil and Water
Conservation has always been provided the technical expertise as to the
best management practices which include conservation measures and
nutrient management along with lagoon design, they are responsible for
design of nutrient management plans or animal waste plans.  The thinking
was, and still should be that the Division of Soil and Water did the
operations review in preparations for the annual inspections and they
would be in a better position to make suggestions to changes or
improvements of ongoing swine operations.  If North Carolina DWQ did the
annual inspection, a farmer would have to go to the Division of Soil and
Water for help, or be knowledgeable on their own for making required
adjustments or mitigate the violation.  The bill in no way.</p>

temporary shelters, even if they are accompanied by a parent or legal
guardian. This bill would allow minors to stay at a temporary shelter,

is narrower than the one I introduced. Representative Harrison made a

Members of the house, I'm gonna oppose this, I'm gonna vote no because
there is a larger issue that we're talking about here. And the issue is
how we're going to in the future transition public notice. This has the
potential, if we don't do it properly, to hurt a lot of small town
newspapers and rural newspapers and rural North Carolina. I guess i'll
use the cliche and say that this is an attempt to get the camels nose
under the tent. I think we need to look at the bigger issue and be ready
to seriously debate how we're going to transition to public notice and I
do not think that this is the way to do it. And I'm gonna urge you to
vote against this bill. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative
Avila, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]  To debate the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill [SPEAKER

Not really because of the newspapers and the loss of income to them
which is a factor. What we're actually doing here is becoming very
insular, on one hand we talk about transparency with government and
making everything visible. But here we're having the department report
on its website and to a select group of people who may be following the
issue more than the general public does. Whereas when you put a notice
in the newspaper, whether deliberately or accidentally people see those
notices who might not go to the deener website nor would they be signed
up for email notification. I think its a bad president when we cut the
press out of the publics access to knowledge. Its not something i feel
like should be taken lightly. The issue of saving the state money or
cost of newspaper are valid arguments however i feel like the public's
right to know through notice given by watch dog organization is
necessary to eliminate any unforeseen unintended consequences, could
cause damage in un-speculated upon locations at this point in time. And
I sincerely ask that you oppose this legislation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The

[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Members we all know that abortion is a subject that
often brings up a lot of debate and discussion. However, abortion for
the purpose of sex selection seems to bring no debate. Over 75% of the
people who were polled on this question believe that abortion for the
purpose of sex selection should not actually even be legal. So what this
bill does, is it simply says that, if a doctor knows the primary purpose
or a significant reason for the woman seeking an abortion is sex
selection, he or she is not supposed to perform the abortion. If this
bill passes, abortion will still be legal, abortion will still be safe,
abortion will just no longer be discriminatory. Mr speaker,

1 lines 15 through 36 by rewriting those lines to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker, as representative Samuelson
said, this amendment really clarifying amendment to answer some of the
questions that were raised, the concerns that were raised in the
committee, and to really reflect what the intent of this bill is. I'll
draw your attention first to lines 4 through 7 some of the changes
there, really clean up some of the language. There were some concerns
about the word &quot;recklessly&quot;, we are focused on the knowledge
of the doctor or his reason to know whether he knew or should have
known, so we are restating that. As for subsection B there, lines 8
through 10. What we have there is in response to a concern that this
bill would place an affirmative duty on a doctor to ask his or her
patient why she is coming in for an abortion. What this does is it says
that there is no affirmative duty. Again, this bill is simply based on
the doctor's actual knowledge or whether he or she had the objective
reason to know. The rest of the changes there are simply conforming to
the rest of the amendment, so we urge your support in this amendment.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The members who have their lights on, are they to speak
about the amendment or the bill? Representative Wilkins, please state
your purpose. Representative Deborah Ross, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The lady is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you very much Mr. Speaker. I appreciate this
amendment. There are other things that I wish would get amended in this
bill, but some of the issues that came up in JA are addressed here, and
so I encourage folks to vote for the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Adams, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The lady will be recognized in turn for the further
discussion and debate on the amendment. If not the question before the
house is to pass it to the amendment sent forth by representative
Schaffer for the house committee substitute of house bill 716. All in
favor vote aye, all opposed vote no, the clerk will open the vote. The
clerk will allow the machine record the vote. 118 having voted
affirmative, none in the negative, the amendment passes. We are back on
the bill, representative Adams please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Speak on the bill Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The lady is recognized to debate the bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]First of all may I ask the bill sponsor a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Samuelson, does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you representative Samuelson, I saw the survey
that you sent out but I have a question; how many legal abortions are
performed in North Carolina, based on gender discrimination. Based on
the woman indicating that she needs an abortion because she's having a
boy as opposed to a girl, or vice versa?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I have no way of knowing that, because we do not keep
track of those, nobody records those sorts of figures.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
house, the issue of sex selection abortion is a legitimate concern I
suppose, but in other parts of the world, not in North Carolina. As a
matter of fact, you have a survey, but of course if you've done any kind
of research at all you know that you can skew the data and you can set
up a survey to basically get back what you want. But in this case, there
has been no evidence, and I heard this bill in committee, there's no
evidence that there's any kind of...(speech ends)</p>

Representative Adams, I have looked the bill carefully and my question
is where in this bill do you see anyone or any particular group
targeted? I just can't; reading the bill I just can't find it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, representative Blust, I think the bill was heard in your
committee, and there was discussion about that. And when you talk about
discrimination if we're talking about making sure that we say the fetus,
babies are not discriminated because they are male or because they are
female. That's what, I've heard the bill sponsors ?? use that language
so I'm using it as well.It was used throughout the committee. We say
that we want to protect women. This bill does not do that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Deborah Ross, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill as amended.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you very much mister speaker. I have two primary objections to
this bill, one of them was made a little bit better by the amendment we
all voted for and again I'm grateful for the amendment and for the bill
sponsors working on that somewhat. But this bill does something that
most of our other medical laws don't do and that is permit a whole bunch
of different people to be able to sue a doctor based on hearsay. Based
on something that might have happened in a doctor-patient relationship.
And this bill allows parents and guardians and spouses to sue, in the
past it had siblings so like I said it got a little bit better but still
in most of our medical situations, we do not allow all these other
people named out in statute to sue based on a conversation where they
may not have been there particularly, when the statute itself says it
doesn't have to be the sole reason. It could be a partial reason and
that I think opens up malpractice and fines way beyond the scope of how
we've ever dealt with medical situations and again I find that to be
tremendously ironic because last session we closed down litigation
against doctors, but here there's a particular type of doctor that this
general assembly doesn't seem to like, so finding more ways to sue that
kind of doctor seems to be perfectly ok. I don't think that that's
right. I don't think that that's fair. And I don't think bringing in a
whole bunch of other people who weren't in the room to be able to sue is
appropriate. So that's the first reason. The second reason is that it is
true that this will result in racial profiling. And I will tell you why
in part to respond to representative Blust's question, though I'm
astounded that he has it after hearing the debate. First of all, one of
the proponents of the bill, in particular said, it was to go after the
Asian community. She stood up and gave it as a justification. One of the
people who wanted the bill from the audience said that. And then we had
two women from the Asian community who came up and said how offended
they were by this bill. That they came to this country, that their
families were in this country because of this country's respect for
gender equality. And to have their motives impugned in the country of
freedom they found to be tremendously offensive. One was a South Asian
woman, one was a Chinese woman. And  on your desk you have the statement
from one of those women. And so i'm just going to read you a couple
sentences from it. She says, and this is from Gina Dillan &quot;make no
mistake in some cultures outside of the United States son preference is
a real problem. Banning abortion however is not a solution to the
problem either here or overseas. We cannot fight inequity  by imposing
more inequity. Moreover abortion bans are ineffective and will neither
treat the symptom nor cure the disease of sexism. Indeed it is a
perverse and cruel irony of this proposal and others like it that its
supporters would report to combat societal gender bias by imposing
additional restrictions on the rights  and freedom of women. This is
where the  ?? will be most affected. I think it is important to
understand where they're coming from and understand...</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I ask representative Ross a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ross, does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Ross, we've been hearing a lot about this accusation of
the racial profiling.  You were in a committee, you heard the heartfelt
comments that you just quoted.  However, I will ask you, did you
personally hear any of the sponsors of the bill bring up racial
profiling, specifically the type of racial profiling that those women
highlighted?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I heard Miss Holt bring up this issue when she testified in favor of the
bill, and I heard you talk about the race of your children.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, may ask her a question again?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
When I brought it up, was it not in response to a question by someone
else explicitly, and did we not say that at the time our intent had
never been to bring up racial profiling, nor did we initiate that
subject as sponsors of the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Samuelson, I am 100% certain that you were very, very
careful to personally never bring it up.  However, the issue was raised
by people who testified in favor of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fisher, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Ladies and gentlemen, I rise to oppose this
legislation, and I will tell you why.  The issue of sex selection
abortion is a legitimate concern, but abortion ban is not the solution
to that concern.  I am not on the J committee, and was not able to
attend that meeting, but I actually watched the testimony on Legislative
Week in review over the weekend, and I was struck by the bill's sponsors
testimony about her own child who was a girl who was born of an Indian
mother, and it was touching, a touching piece of testimony.  But, what
concerned me the most about that, and I have a lot of respect for people
who will adopt children, either in this country or in foreign countries,
to make sure that their lives can be better.  But, the thing that I'm
having a problem with is the fact that we would use another culture to
drive another agenda.  And I believe that the agenda here is that of
limiting a woman's right to choose.  I can't abide the using of another
culture in such a patronizing way.  It is certainly admirable that we
would want to create a culture that does not exercise gender bias.  That
is an admirable thing.  But there are other ways that we can do that.
And I don't believe that sex selection abortion happens in this country
to the extent that it does in other countries.  And while I applaud
representative Samuelson's efforts to combat it in India
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stevens, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if the lady would yield for question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You said twice now that this bill is not needed to avoid abortion for
gender selection.  You said that there's another way to do that.  How do
we do that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I didn't save there was another way.  I said there was another
reason that this is happening.  And the reason that it's happening is to
limit a woman's right to choose.  What I said, Representative Stevens is
that there are other ways to combat gender bias.  And I would suggest
that one of those ways is to vote for a family leave bill.  Vote for an
equal pay amendment.  That's a really good way to combat gender bias.
This is not the way to do that, and I urge the body to vote against this
legislation.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.

bill for very different reasons.  One, the same but in part different,
another</p>

<p id="255:00">
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Completely different. The first thing I start is the same comment I mad
when we had an enormous debate on this floor on the Right to No Bill, or
two years ago. And that is, like everyone on this floor, I hate getting
in the discussions of abortion. It is always difficult for each side to
hear the other. It is a circumstance where those who are prolife fail to
acknowledge the incredible psychological pressure on women and their
choices. Where those on prochoice side fail to acknowledge the passion
that exist and the religious bases that often moral bases that the other
side has and we end up talking over each other, you know, as a country,
and rarely find common ways.  But having said that there’s no doubt, in
my mind, the vast majority of women make this decision make it for
enormously different circumstances. They make it as the most important
moral and spiritual decision they will ever make. They make it often
when they feel they have no other choices. And the last place I think
the government should ever be is in this most private and spiritual
decision. My opposition to this Bill is because we not only invade that
again, we do so in two ways that we have never invaded before. The
first, as Representative Ross has indicated, we now turn the doctor
patient relationship into an adversarial one, in part. This Bill, for a
woman who is facing this choice, will most assuredly lead to poorer
medical care and poor choices because she will know any longer be honest
with her physician. The physician will no longer ask the questions they
have to ask. Indeed the Bill, as amendment, says they don’t have to. And
the physician patient relationship is absolutely damaged. This Bill
gives new rise to don’t ask, don’t tell. Because now the doctor will
never ask and if I was the doctor’s lawyer I’d tell him to never ask.
And the woman will know quickly never to tell, and what have we
accomplished? Except to harm the healthcare of the woman, truly good
information being given back and forth. And we invade, in an incredible
way, the physician patient discussion. Secondly, look at what we’re
doing. We are creating a crime here, but not for the woman, for the
doctor. I teacher criminal law. I practiced it many years. We are now
overturning what amounts to hundreds of years of criminal law in this
Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would Representative Glazier yield for a very brief question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will not yield now but I will yield at the end of my comments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman does not yield at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank you Representative Stam. A crime requires
two things, a criminal act and a criminal state of mind. And that
generally requires that they concur together. Well here the woman’s
decision to abort, her abortion itself is not illegal. The act is legal
is done, if it’s done in the first trimester and its done, as it should
be, under all the other rules and regulations we have. Her mind is what
we’re after. That is, does she have criminal intent by making a decision
that is dominantly based on sex selection? So her act isn’t criminal,
but her mind is. Now that may or may not get us to a place but we’re not
putting the penalty on her. Even if she makes the decision to sex select
and abort, she doesn’t have the penalty, it’s the doctor performing it.
And so we are not even dealing with the criminal mind of the actor,
we’re going after the criminal mind, downstream. Now in a conspiracy,
you have to have two people to agree on a bad act. And then an overt act
and further so the conspiracy to be convicted of it. Here one of the
conspirators, if you will can’t be convicted of the conspiracy cause
she’s not listed as a criminal actor. Only the other one and he’s
supposed to be, he or she as the doctor, telepathic to know what’s in
the mind of the woman. I don’t know of another criminal law that we
have, that comes to that conclusion. And I think eventually this Bill
will be struck.</p>

Down as a result of that.  As a fundamental in my view violation of due
process of law of the criminal law in the history of this country. That
having been said, because I also believe that the only way it could
possible y pass is to be co constitutionally constricted, so narrowly
construed and because I believe is a pragmatic factor of Don’t Ask,
Don’t Tell, that’s implicit in this Bill, and that has to be followed,
the majority creates a Bill and in effect will never have real world
application feel free in my view to relegate this Bill to the further
recesses of your mind because it ‘s situation it addresses will never
occur any longer if it had occurred previously. It can’t because there
won’t be practical information for it and the Bill will be so
constitutionally restricted if it is upheld at all, that there would
never be but the most extraordinarily egregious situation that we can’t
even image that would meet the criteria. What a Bill is trying to do,
and I understand the sponsors attempt assuming good faith and good
motivation, I don’t think will be helped at all. This Bill doesn’t help
the womans health. It doesn’t help the woman decide. It doesn’t help if
the doctor, the ability to make good healthcare decisions. Because we’ve
in fact taken away information the doctor might need to know to help the
woman with the psychological impact of the decision she’s making. Then
on top of which it hardly helps the fetus in this circumstance. I can’t
figure out who’s going to benefit from this Bill. It is a check off the
political list to say we passed it. But it either will have no real
world application or it will be struck down. Because it violates
centuries of criminal law. And for those reasons among many, I will vote
against this Bill and recommend this body do so. This is an incredibly
complex area and this is an incredibly disappointing Bill to try to deal
with any of those issues. Thank you.
[Speaker change]: Mr. Speaker.

[Representative Galzier]: Thank you Mr. Speaker.
[Representative Stam]: Representative Glazier, the bottom of page one I
see a reference to the civil contempt and injunctions, I don’t see a
reference to a crime anywhere in the Bill. Would you point out to us the
page and line number where any crime is declared?
[Representative Glazier]: You’re correct. Not a crime in that regard. So
the contempt proceeding would be eventually getting you there.
[Speaker Change]: Representative Duane Hall, please state your purpose.
[Representative Hall]: Speak to this Bill.
[Speaker change]: The gentleman is recognized to debate the Bill.
[Representative Hall]: Earlier, Representative Adams mentioned that most
abortions are performed before the sex can be determined. I just wanted
to point out how enormous of an understatement that is. In fact 93% of
abortions are performed well before we can determine what the sex is.
Which makes you wonder what the real purpose of the Bill is.
Representative Ross also mentioned or talked about all the new people
that this opens up standing for and one is obviously the husband. I kind
of try to logically think through how this might work. And the way the
Bill is written obviously most married couples, they both discuss this.
They talk about what’s likely to happen. What they would like to do. So
the way this Bill is written, a husband could convince forth his wife to
have an abortion, and then turn around and sue the doctor for performing
that abortion. Representative Glazier mentioned that this will never
have a real world application for this. I’ve also done lots of courtroom
work and the evidentiary problems of asking a doctor to determine
subjective motives would be just impracticable and impossible. I urge
the body not to do this to doctors and vote against this Bill.

That culturally this is historically been an issue for them and this is
a very very personal gut wrenching decision that I think a woman who
wants to have a child even if it’s a son would not make lightly. To then
possibly be stereotyped because of her ethnic background and questioned
is also again another insult to women and to people of color. So I ask
that you think carefully when you vote on this you know nobody seeks out
an abortion. Nobody says, I’m going to go get pregnant and go have an
abortion today! It’s not a decision that is made that lightly by anyone
and I want in particularly something that has ethnic ramifications and
implications to be considered because it’s not a good thing. Thank you.
[New Speaker] Representative McElraft please state your purpose.
[New Speaker] Speak on the bill.
[New Speaker] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[New Speaker] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and the members and body. It has
been brought up here that this only happens in foreign countries but
I’ll let you know that there are four studies and you can look them up
for yourself all you have to do is Google them and there not
conservative studies they are from the University of California Berkley,
University of Connecticut, Colombia University 2008, University of
Texas. Sex selection abortions are happening here in the United States
whether we will admit it or not. Pennsylvania has a law very similar to
this was not enacted last year, was not enacted five years ago, it was
enacted in 1982. Has not been ruled unconstitutional, has not been
challenged. It was put there because sex selection abortions are feared.
They are happening here in the United States. This is a very simple
decision if you believe that a baby should be aborted just because it’s
a boy or just because it’s a girl no other reason than vote against this
bill.
[New Speaker] further discussion, further debate Representative Adams
please state your purpose
[New Speaker] Thank You. Would Representative McElraft yield the
question?
[New Speaker] Representative McElraft does the lady yield?
[New Speaker] I would be happy to
[New Speaker] The lady yields
[New Speaker] Thank you thank you very much can you tell me what places
you said it’s happing and the studies but what states were identified in
that study?
[New Speaker] It’s happening all over. It was happing in Canada also and
they now have laws against it in Canada so they are coming to the United
States to have these abortions.
[New Speaker] while what was speaker
[New Speaker] and if you will look on the internet and search the
internet you will find in all of these studies they will show you with
census studies and all that these abortions are happening here in the
United States
[New Speaker] Does the lady yield to a follow up?
[New Speaker] I will yield
[New Speaker]They lady yields
[New Speaker] So Representative Adams so you don’t have any states that
you can identify in the United States and would North Carolina be one of
those?
[New Speaker] We in North Carolina have not taken that data because we
have not been keeping up with that here
[New Speaker] Thank you. Speaker second time speaker
[New Speaker] you ladies recognize the debate, the bill the second time
[New Speaker]Thank you Speaker,  you know I  just believe that if we had
some data about North Carolina you would have it before you today that
would be a part of the presenters of this bill that would be a part of
what what what would be said but I do remember that part with the
appeared to be the rational when this bill was presented in committee we
were talking about it was talked about what’s happing  in other cultures
and other parts of the world and I still think that’s what we’re talking
about but we’re talking about North Carolina folks it’s impossible for
an outside party and family member’s other people even doctors to know
all the considerations that have entered into a woman’s mind during her
decision in this decision making process and it’s a difficult one as we
have heard this bill is you know it has a lot of negative implications
for women it has</p>

Line of negative implications for doctors. It's going to create, as been
said, an adversarial position. It's going to create distrust. What
you're really likely to see is a greater demand for unsafe procedures
that will place a woman's health and her life at risk. Representative
McElraft, I believe we're going to find desperate situations, where
women will find those dark houses to address this concern. This is a
very bad, offensive bill and we need to vote no on it.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative ??, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I have actually Googled sex selection abortions
and the only thing I find is a study in Great Britain. Regardless, this
bill will have a chilling effect on abortions and that's the intent of
the bill. Anything that can take that right away from a woman and ignore
the real basic needs, and I happen to agree with Representative Frazier
that we don't talk to each other, we talk at each other on this issue.
It is a very serious issue and we ought to be, we all agree that we
would like to reduce abortions. We ought to be agreeing on how to find a
way to do that, instead of making up bills that will only reduce access
to a legitimate health concern.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Samuelson, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To debate the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The lady is recognized to debate the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Members, we've heard a lot of debate and one thing we haven't heard a
single person say, is that they think its a good idea to have an
abortion when the primary purpose is because the paper is a boy or a
girl. We all seem to agree that that is not a good idea, so let's pass
this bill and make it not permissible in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Further discussion? Further debate? If not, the question before the
house is the passage of the house committee substitute House Bill 716,
as amended on its second reading. All in favor vote aye, all opposed
vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will now proceed
recording the vote, 80 having voted affirmative, 39 in the negative. The
House Bill Substitute 716 as amended on its second reading . . .
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Speaker? It's me.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Carney?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I would like to be recorded as voting no.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The lady will be recorded as voting no. Members the member may change
any vote by the end of session, not before the next bill is called. Now,
further discussion? Further debate? If not, the question before us, or
without objection the house committee substitute of House Bill 716 will
be read a third time.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
General assembly of North Carolina and ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]

house is the passage of house bill substitute, House Bill 716 on its
