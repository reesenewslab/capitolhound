<p id="15:00">
is from Tri-County to the College of Albemarle, from Murphy to Manteo,
from Cherokee county to Dare County.  And in Buncombe county, AB
Community College is one of the largest colleges in western North
Carolina, serves over 8,000 curriculum students and almost 30,000
students overall. The last several years we’ve had a lot of leadership
transitions at AB Tech, but the one face and the one constant at AB Tech
was Mona Cornwell. Mona did a great job supporting our community college
and providing the opportunities and getting the word out so students and
those who have gone through a career transition could come back and have
the skills to support their family or be able to join the college
transfer program and other things. And she did a wonderful job with
that. Her service was recognized in 2012: she was named the state
employee community college Person of the Year for all of the community
college system and received a reward for that. Her work is just
emblematic of the over 13,000 employees of the state community college
system beyond our faculty who do every-day work to make sure that often
times we talk about we have the best in the country or best in class –
world class – but North Carolina’s community college system truly is one
of the best in the country. And that’s because of people like Mona. So I
commend this resolution to you. I also want to note that one of the
things she was very proud of is that we had an officer who was killed
around 2004-2005 with an individual that had mental illness. And she
worked with our local law enforcement agencies, she was heavily involved
in NAMI and helped obtain crisis intervention training.  So many of our
officers have gone through that training on how to work with those that
have mental illness; that improves the safety  and reduces the risk for
the officer but also is appropriately dealing with those with mental
illness. I know her family is here and I know President Ralls and others
from the state community college system are here. And we thank her, we
thank her family for what she contributed to our state and we thank all
those who work with our state community college system to truly help
make the dreams of all North Carolinians come true.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Fisher, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
speak on the resolution, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is
recognized to debate the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I could not say it any
better than Representative Ramsey has just said. Mona Cornwell was just
a real asset to the Asheville – Buncombe community and she had a really
wonderful effect on all of the communities that she touched. She helped
to create a program at AB Tech to train law enforcement in their
approach to people with mental illness or to homeless individuals and
her influence could be felt throughout the community. I think that it is
particularly sad when we lose folks before their time and she was one
who we lost way too soon. It’s really sad when anyone leaves us but this
was a particularly heartfelt loss and I commend the resolution to you.
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Insko, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady is recognized to debate the resolution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Speaker, Members. Mona Cornwell’s influence is not felt only in
Buncombe county or across her community, it really is felt all across
the state. Because she was one of the leaders in getting crisis
intervention team training done in all the counties to all of our
deputies, our local police officers and our school resource officers,
teaching them appropriate ways to talk down persons who are coming into
a mental health crisis. And because of that, we’ve been able to divert
many people from the emergency rooms and from our jails. That’s also led
to a greater awareness of how mentally ill people end up inappropriately
in our judicial system and our Mental Health Committee continues to work
on that. And I have been honored to work with her and to know her and
David and the great contribution they have made to this community and to
this</p>

while the tellers are out of the Chamber, without objection we will move
to the local Bills where we simply have voice votes. We will begin with
House Bill 1246. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Committee substitute for House Bill 1246, a Bill to be
entitled an act to provide that a law prohibiting weapons on campus or
other educational property does not apply to an armed detention officer
when the officer is discharging his or her official duties on the
Cabarrus county or Forsyth county. General Assembly of North Carolina
enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Conrad, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, to speak to the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Armed detention officers is a
relatively new job classification for Sheriff's departments. They are
certified to carry firearms, but they are not sworn officers. One of
their primary duties is the transportation of inmates and therein lies
the problem and the purpose for this Bill. One of the places where we
often take our inmates for medical treatment is at Wake Forest
University Medical Center. That is an educational campus. At this
present time, according to statutes, the armed detention officers would
be committing a felony if they had their firearm on their possession
when they were taking the inmates into the hospital. This just rectifies
that situation and I believe Representative Stam has an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam is recognized to send forth an
amendment. The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam moves to amend the Bill on page 1,
line 5 by rewriting that line to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, members of the House, Wake county is
pleased to host Central Prison. We also have WakeMed, which is a
teaching hospital so we need this Bill as well.</p>

Further discussion, further debate on the amendment? If not, the

Representative Stam for the House Committee Substitute of House Bill
1246. All in favor say, Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed, No. The Ayes have it. The amendment is
adopted. Now we're back on the bill as a minute. Further discussion,
further debate? If not, the question before the House is the passage of

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed, No. The Ayes have it. The House Committee
Substitute for House Bill 1246 as a minute has passed its second
reading. Because the amendment changes the title, it will remain on the

[SPEAKER CHANGES] House bill 1250, that bill to provide that air rifles,
air pistols and BB guns are not included in the definition of dangerous
firearms for certain purposes in the following counties: Anson,
Cleveland, Harnett, Stanly and Surry. The General Assembly of North
Carolina unites.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Speaker. The current definition of
dangerous firearm are not allowed to be knowingly used by a child under
the age of twelve, whether it's loaded or unloaded, unless they have
specific permission from a parent. And the second part of this is air
rifles, air pistols and BB guns are not dangerous weapons, but if you
read the next sentence, except in seventeen counties, and there are five
of us that would like to be removed so our young children can have their
own BB guns. The counties that will remain in, where BB guns will be
dangerous weapons are: Caldwell, Chowan, Caswell, Cumberland, Durham,
Forsyth, Gaston, Haywood, Mecklenburg, Stokes, Union and Vance. Thanks
for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Harrison, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the
House, I understand the merits of this. This is just equitable treatment
of these counties, but, just as a passing matter, I just realize in
opposition. I did some research on this, and there averages about twenty
thousand injuries a year in our country, three-quarters of whom are
children, from these air guns, pellet guns, and BB guns. There are many
states that regulate this as the same as firearms, so I don't know that
this is a good policy for us. I understand the need for this for these
counties that want to be removed from that list, but I would just
encourage you to vote no. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative Harrison would yield for a
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think so.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Harrison, did you know and understand
that Guildford county is already exempt under this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, I realize that, and I think that if it were up to
me, I'd probably classify all these as dangerous firearms. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not, the
question before the House is the passage of House bill 1250 on its
second reading. All in favor say, Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed, No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Ayes appear to have it. The Ayes do have it. House

commission is an agency who pin the cit of Sherlock and to extend the
Sherlock Douglas international airport over side committee by one year
Speaker Changes: representative Samuelson please state your purpose,
Speaker Changes: to debate the bill,
Speaker Changes: the lady is recognized to debate the bill,
Speaker Changes: members we all recall that last year we made a bill ??
and created a new commission that provided over the airport as soon as
that happened there was a lawsuit and from the lawsuit the judge said
that he would to F I A to issue a document and stating the committee
that who holds permission around the airport,
Speaker Changes: Representative Samuelson just to make sure that the
matter is probably before us the chair understands the before the make
bill motion to conquer,
Speaker Changes: Sorry Mr speaker i do,
Speaker Changes: The chair apologizes ??  the lady is continued to
debate the motion,
Speaker Changes: thank you,so after the judge told that The F I A said
that it needs to clarify that ?? ownership and over side of the airport
under the city.The age's office issued a letter on august of last year
which they thought clarify that issue and thought that they make it that
the city clearly makes the airport provides the over side of the
commission.However that didn't result to hit that point in the mean time
senator ?? and i come through the city council members ?? in the mean
time the North Carolina went o the F I A would you please just decide
this ?? on result.So the F I A didn't respond so after that
Representative ?? i guess that he is not ?? send a another letter to F I
A stating that would you please resolve this issue so the F I A send
back the letters that is on your desk and on the back of the letters
you'll see they need the clarification that whether the commission is
agency of the city or independently second district and secondly was
responsible for the key roles in the sponsor and operator so since the
original letter from the GAD officer didn't seem to ?? clarify the
language that we were ?? so what we have before you is simply
clarification about in the language and clearly you'll see and words
like half of the city ?? this is still done by the city and override by
the city of the commission.The only change we made was to add one year
change  ?? given all of that i want to restate that we still have the
work intent to continue to work with ? even we have some schedule to do
so.Is our intend to do all we can resolve this in the meantime nobody
wants shipment court over question to clarify with the simple
clarification.You all notice that during last week our delegation did
work together and the number of cities ??  we continue to work together
but on this particular issue we have difference of opinion that urge
your support,
Speaker Changes: Representative Corney please state your purpose,
Speaker Changes: to speak to the conference,
Speaker Changes: The lady is recognized to debate the motion
Speaker Changes: Thank you Mr.Speaker ladies and gentlemen of the house
here we go I'm sorry that this is bad before us,i thought it was gone
last year we all did our city council thought that it was and it went to
the court we knew that is gonna happen.We all stood on the floor and
senate chamber and said that it gonna happen all it did.Well the courts
are designed to stop this differences,</p>

Speaker: This is a local issue the unsettled within the courts for local
jurisdiction.I will say that member Seth last year this was not taken
away from the city.They said that in presenting the bill then to you and
now we need to clarify it is not taken away from that city where I'm
standing at you asking away today to know that conference reports is
because of the process.Yes representative Samuelson spoken that she has
stated with in the mayor but it was after the fact it was after the bill
found and the have been talking both the ?? could pull this bill today
so that further discussions could continue and it's till before us in
the letter that you have if you read soon in the forth paragraph it's
have ?? the airport sponsor or the state authority considering the
creation of the airport authority will ?? the F I A comments on ?? draft
legislation prior to ?? the observer the ?? on June 10th ?? but the
agents have heard advice to the bill.Now i know that you can stand up
and defend and state comments that  about who did work plan.The matter
of the fact it is we don't need this clarification if the bill indeed
last year you have voted fro stated clearly then that it was not under
the ?? not losing the authority level airport.So i have ask you to
please vote no at concord and let the court work this out, I'm  afraid
that we are gonna be back here again if the court say we need another
question and answer well whose answering at them, this in the bill will
also have section 9 you heard about and i know even many of you not
concerned about this,you probably would have following the closely the
people in the ?? county and the city of Sharl-ow have,it's a sore and it
would go way and let the court decide,let's let them put it debate ??
let's stay out of continuing to get into these local issues now we are
dealing with many of them now some one know that ?? I'm not gonna go
down that road but I'm asking you today not to concord ,our ages office
our mayor and our city council and the court continue to decide this to
ask you to vote NO to the Concord,
Speaker Changes: Representative Alexander please state your purpose,
Speaker Changes: The speaker on the motion,
Speaker Changes: The gentlemen is recognized to debate the
motion,
Speaker Changes: Thank you Mr.Speaker, ladies and gentlemen i have been
unusually quite during the short session,i stand today to ask to not to
vote the concord.The people of ?? county opposed what happened last year
the continue to purpose this city council  opposed this last year they
continue to be opposed and seems hat it only a small ?? who are pushing
this at this particular measure is as motion in search of a problem
because indeed if the city of Sharl ow is on control of this airport as
this measure would propose to  re affirm that is nothing that the courts
will discover presently or we discover depending upon the point of view
but this is one thing ladies and gentlemen i thin that we all are being
cognitive.We are now with the general assembly meet we do have the power
to become ultimately ??  in the local affairs of every jurisdiction in
this state, it is a power that we should be extremely careful of
exercising,</p>

...this particular measure that is before us today we do not need to
exercise. This is a day when we should have restraint, we should allow
the judicial process and the FAA process to move forward and we should
relegate this particular measure to the ash bin of history where it
belongs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To briefly debate the motion, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and although this is very much
a Charlotte issue, I rose last time to talk about it from a legal
perspective. I don't plan to say much except the prior two bills did
result in the lawsuit that was predicted and I'm afraid that we now are
getting ready to engage in the litigation hat trick.
And because I think, in reading this and the little bit that I am able
to understand, that this will actually develop more questions than it
answers and because I don't believe it provides the clarity that is
needed, because I do believe the courts are now a place to resolve this.
For all the reasons that Representative Carney said, I think this is
probably a third version that's not going to resolve the problem. Thank
you, Mr. Speaker and I would urge members not to concur. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Larry Bell, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I want to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker and members of the House. I
just wanted to make it perfectly clear that because you see my name up
here, L. Bell, and Brisson, we did not sponsor this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] As someone who had the former majority use a bill
sponsored by Representative Tillis for a budget technical corrections
bill, the Chair sympathizes.
Representative Hager, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Guys, we've heard some folks
from Mecklenburg County, Charlotte, say this is an issue that they
should deal with, but I contend this is an issue that everybody around
the Charlotte area ought to be dealing with, not just Charlotte,
Mecklenburg but Rutherford County, Gaston County, Lincoln County, Union
County, Anson County. All of us should stand up and have a say in this.
And I trust our leaders from Mecklenburg County. I've read the bill. I
think it's a good bill. I think it affects my area. It's a good motion
and I would ask everybody to concur.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jeter, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I actually, to everyone and all my
colleagues, I think we're getting a little bit off base, which is
usually my job.
Thank you, Skip. Best seatmate in the building.
Here's my issue. The FAA sent us a letter, asked us to answer two
questions. This bill, if you want to argue the policy, and I have the
utmost respect for Representative Alexander, Representative Carney and
the other Democrat members of the Mecklenburg delegation.
If we want to argue the policy of it, we can argue that. I don't see
this bill arguing policy. This bill was a response to a letter from the
FAA where they asked us to answer two questions. My guess is if one of
the many lawyers in this room had a client and the judge or some agency
asked you to answer a question, you're going to answer it.
That's what we did. If you don't like the policy decision, that's a
different discussion. This is answering two questions by the FAA which
further states the airport remains in the city ownership. I don't know
what more we could do to make this clearer, to make it easier, and to
make this less controversial.
We're trying to answer a question. Not to bring up an old issue. Instead
we're debating a bill that was passed last year. This is a technical
bill. That's what it really is. And I know we use that term a lot. We
answered two questions. That's it. Vote yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Samuelson, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the motion a second
time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I'm must going to very quickly go through
just some clarifications, not because you all care that much but because
the press is listening.
The FAA's policy is that airport governance is a local decision and yet
in North Carolina we know that many of these kinds of decisions, because
of the way we're governed, are actually state decisions. And the ability
for the city to have the airport was granted by the state back, I think,
in the 1930's.
Second paragraph says that the FAA, who would have prefer that their
comments be...</p>

Solicited but that’s what the Pittenger letter did. So, Robert Pittenger
sent a letter to them, asked them for their comments and they said we
need this clarification. It has been implied that somehow another
language that we gave was insufficient, so therefore we had to clarify
because there was something inadequate about it. The AG ?? sent an
original letter and clarified that out language said exactly what we
said. So it said we are just clarifying it more because they didn’t like
the AG’s letter. Section 9 simply restating the intent that when we pass
laws we prefer that they be implemented and then in terms of previous
meetings, yes the meeting with Senator Clodfelter is after the effect
but we had meetings with the previous mayor and some council members
before the fact that we had continued discussions, I urge your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. If not, the
question before the House is the motion to concur in the Senate
Committee Substitute for House Bill 133. All in favor. All oppose, say
no. The Ayes appear to have it. Division having been requested, we will

is a local bill. Representative Johnson, Chair understands that the
count is complete. The lady has the floor to announce the count. Ladies
and Gentlemen, after the count is announced, we will still have to do a
voice vote, a roll call vote. So, please remain in your seats. The lady
has the floor to announce the result.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank You, Mr. Speaker. I want to say how very proud I
am of this body, we only had 4 mistakes and they did not affect the
majority of votes and I’d like to make a motion, Mr. Speaker, I move
pursuit to general statute 115D-2.1B4 that the House confirm the
election of Earnest Pearson to the state board of community colleges to
fill a vacancy on the state board of community colleges for the

to be entitled An Act to Delay the Transfer Date of a Cleveland County
Correctional Facility.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Moore is recognized for a motion and to
debate the motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, I move that the House concur with the
Senate Committee's Substitute to House Bill 183. I will briefly debate
this.
Mr. Speaker, members, this is a local matter having to do with the
transfer of the Cleveland County Correctional Facility. It was closed, I
think, about four years ago and there was an agreement reached where the
facility would be transferred to the community college there in Shelby,
where the college had been teaching inmates for quite awhile a number of
skills.
The transfer was to be completed by July the 1st of this year but
there've been some logistical issues getting in the way of that and so
there's been a request to extend that by two years to 2016.
I know of no objection and would ask the body's approval.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate? If not, the
question before the House is the motion to concur in the Senate
Committee's Substitute for House Bill 183.
All in favor vote Aye, all opposed vote no. The Clerk will open the
vote.
The Clerk will let the machine record the vote. One hundred and
seventeen having voted in the affirmative, none in the negative. The
House has concurred in the Senate Committee's substitute for House Bill
183.
The bill will be enrolled and sent to the Governor.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Chair had expanded the voting time to 20
seconds for the purposes of taking up the debate. I have not changed
that position until now. Any subsequent votes until we get into maybe
any other more intensive measures will now be back to 15 seconds.
