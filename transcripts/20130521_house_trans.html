to thank you for users
with the first bill is representative guns ready. I has been sixty
seven, and of the Lamb enthusiast, so you reckon has Smith and Jones,
Change speaker: Agnes Chairman, members of the community House Bill
sixty seven is about allowing permanent license plates for charter
schools. you start out by saying that this is not so much a license
plate be a lot had multiple grades and people to contact me to save my
great could be added to this be okay. this also has nothing to do with
the bill that was passed in the last session that limited who could or
could not have on the license place. what this really does is simply
recognize that charter schools are also public schools and public will
already have the ability to find a half Carmen licensed lights and up
until recently it was it was assumed at least. at least it was in my
area that charter schools receiving permit, license flights and probably
after the meal before was asking Anaheim people 's awareness and they
look back and make a long story short, my local charter school was
denied this opportunity and and I think it was later made by look into
the Lewinsky to clarify the facts that charter schools are indeed both
schools. they should have the opportunity to get permanent license
plates and Mister Chairman, I'd be happy to answer any questions
Change speaker:  for the revenue department

Change speaker: unless the question
Change speaker: okay last year in transportation. in fact, it may not
have been entranced vision of any one of these committees on last year
there was a move to bring is the number of permanent place letter out
the year and I would like to know hasn't been done. how will this video
impact that study or whatever they're doing, and if possible could we
postpone this video until we get some feel of how many permanent plates
are unclear.
Change speaker:  Jonathan Jones recognizes him. I keep that?
Change speaker: Jane Guillot, I would really prefer as I said earlier,
I'm not trying to lump is seen without a great chapter that might be one
to apply for apartment license plates and I understand we had to deal
the last session energy cited the rain had in somewhat the focus here is
basically very narrowly, this is not. not very many instances that the
charter schools are in the public schools and should be entitled to
license place. this is how the traditional public schools are inside one
eight eight is with that, that we were proceeding with this view,
Change speaker: calm and pleasant to all
Change speaker: this is in the field where the status of that study
isn't working out what was the outcome is willing here little bit about
it
Change speaker:
until you have given them after you have adjuvant.
Change speaker:  I think I can answer that a lot of these permanent
place where we bounce last year. I think what you're before last and
some of them were rebuilt. I think erroneously and one of whom was a
charter school because those are public schools another one. I have in a

these authorities and all to go through, they said it's millions of
dollars, but when there are certain ones like the charter school and the
one I have in a few minutes, which actually is a local government issue,
I think that they're gonna allow those to go through, because they are a
minimal fiscal impact to the state, and they are considered county
government entities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm sorry.  Representative Gill, were you finished?  Thank you.
Representative Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We did repeal all of the special plates for
sundry and numerous groups in the state.  We did it because it was
costing us in excess of 350 million dollars a year, and now we're on the
road to just bring them all back.  We have three here today.  None of
them- only one of these bills has referred to finance from what I'm
reading here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They all go to finance.  Representative Jones, do you want to speak-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm not finished.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think we're setting a bad precedent.  We're having financial problems
all across the board, and, once we open this door and allow these
various groups to start getting their free plates back, we're gonna be
inundated with groups across the state saying, we had this, and you took
it away from us, and you gave it to this guy, you gave it to that guy,
you gave it to that guy, we should get ours back.  I don't think we
should start this process.  I think we should leave things the way they
are for a while until we get a little more financially stable, and we
are not financially stable, no matter what you think, so I think this is
a bad idea, and I'm not gonna be able to support it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jones, do you want to speak to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you, Representative Cleveland.  Let me
just add a couple of comments, if I may.  It is my understanding, and
staff, correct me if I'm wrong, but it is my understanding that the bill
that we passed did not address charter schools.  We did not say that it
is our intent that charter schools be taken off of this list.  It is my
understanding that, because charter schools are public schools, that,
over time, the DMV has recognized it, and, at least in the case of my
county, they've been providing these plates.  However, I think, in now
looking at the letter of the law, there's some concern about whether or
not charter schools are included.  I would add that I've had a fiscal
note done on this, and just for the committee's information, the net
state impact for the next fiscal year, 13/14: 6,900 dollars, and in the
years going out after that, we're talking about 8,600  dollars a year,
so, that's about as minimal as you can get on our level.  I understand
the concerns, but I truly believe that there was never any intent by
this general assembly to say that charter schools were to be included in
the group that was not to receive permanent license plates when other
public schools do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, I have nine names right now, but I believe we have a gentleman
from program evaluation that can shed some light on this particular
issue.  Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.  My name is Larry Yates.  I'm a principal evaluator with the
program evaluation division.  The impetus for this study- we released
five different reports on vehicles within the state of North Carolina
last year.  We found, as we were looking at the permanent license
plates, that total control had been lost over the issuance of the
permanent plates.  There were vehicles still listed in the DMV records
that went back to the 1950's, so, the only way to get control was to,
number one, have the plates reissued and figure out what was actually
out there and what was legitimate.  The decision, obviously coming out
of the legislature, was government-owned, state-owned type vehicles, and
it's pretty clear in 2084 as to what vehicles do receive these plates.
Obviously, that's up to y'all for interpretation or changes as you may
want to do, but that is the background on what happened, why there was a
change, why there was a reissuance of these plates.  Hopefully, that
helps, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir.</p>

Not want to do that and save them a little money. I mean their educating
our children too. I mean I sat through the last debate. Sometimes I
think we get a little carried away around here about the system. Iâ€™m
thinking about the children. Iâ€™m thinking about the children that are
being educated. And these schools are educating our children and why
would we not want to treat them the same way.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a follow up, did I understand you say earlier that these would be
private vehicles? In other words this vehicle would be owned by an
individual who may be the Administrator of a private schoolâ€¦the charter
school but it would be their personal vehicle that would get this
benefit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thatâ€™s right, I did not say that. I think the bill clearly says that the
motor vehicle is owned and exclusively operated by the corporation
authorized to operate the charter schools. So they are owned by the
charter school. Itâ€™s not for somebodyâ€™s private use.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a clarification.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Clarification.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So the vehicle is titled to the charter school? For insurance purposes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative, I assume it would be titled to the corporation that says
itâ€™s owned by corporation so I assume that means it is titled to the
corporation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representatives ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. There were several things I wanted through on
this and examining these bills when they first came up, I also did a
little research and there are some other questions that come up. Youâ€™ve
got authorities, Central Line of Council of Governments. Should they be
receiving permanent tags? If we create an airport authority for
Charlotte Douglas International Airport, should all of their vehicles
receive permanent tags? Should Goodwill Industries who contracts with
Mecklenburg County receive permanent tags? Now, probably the reason Iâ€™m
asking that question is because Goodwill Industries has some permanent
tags now because Iâ€™ve seen them on their pickup trucks. Not their big
delivery trucks but just pickup trucks guys are driving around.
Representative Jones I appreciated his initiative in providing the
financial note and it did come up with some interesting information. Of
the 34 charter schools that responded, they either own or plan to own a
total 240 vehicles, 21 of which are non school buses, 215 are school
buses, 4 of which are light duty pickups. They would be charged a $6.00
annual fee as non-profit charter schools as apposed to the $28 or the
$38 that I pay to register my automobile. Thereâ€™s one other difference
though, charter schools while they are public schools are not required
to provide transportation. School systems operated by LEs are required
to provide transportation. So yes, weâ€™re providing a permanent tag on a
bus weâ€™re making them buy and operate. We are being asked to provide a
permanent tag on a bus that weâ€™re not making the charter school buy and
operate. But just as a nice bobo for $6 bucks a year to the charter
school that chooses to do it. I am a charter school proponent. I
campaigned on raising the cap. I will continue to support that but this
is really isnâ€™t apples to oranges. Weâ€™re not making them buy and operate
these buses, they choose too. Thereâ€™s another oh by the way with
permanent license plates because their not renewed annually, there is no
requirement for an annual safety inspection or emissions inspection on a
vehicle with a permanent tag. So weâ€™re not just saying not only are we
going to save you $6 bucks a year on your tag but now you donâ€™t have to
worry about safety inspections on your vehicle because itâ€™s not tracked,
itâ€™s not there. Youâ€™ve got a permanent tag; you just go do what you want
to do. As good as the case can be made for helping charter schools, this
is not an isolated instance where we do this and weâ€™re done. The line
then starts. Itâ€™s going to be; well you did it for charter schools, why
arenâ€™t you doing for council and governments? Weâ€™re semi governmental.
Why arenâ€™t you doing it for the Charlotte Convention and Visitors
Bureau. Weâ€™re running tax money. Weâ€™re non-profit. Why arenâ€™t you doing
it for all of the authorities, all of the management things for the
Charlotte Convention and Visitors Bureau? There are going to be a lot of
quasi governmental public service groups that are going to ask for this
and if itâ€™s only $6 bucks a piece itâ€™s not that big of deal, but we
heard a little while ago how many millions of dollars it adds up to.
With all due respect to my esteemed colleague I donâ€™t think this is a
good idea for us. I think we clean the mess up and rather than just
immediately starting to do the same thing over and over again, lets just
accept, its limited to government owned, government.</p>

Operated in the furtherance of Government mentioned, and charter schools
are not required to operate school buses. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jones, do you want to respond to some of that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. Thank you Mr. Chairman. I would justâ€¦I appreciate my friends
remarks. I disagree I guess with the thought pattern that weâ€™re not
making them provide the transportation. It seems to me that we would
want to encourage that. If they want to provide the transportation and
they are in the business of educating our students and they can take
that money and use itâ€¦ remember these are non-profit organizations. They
are public charter schools. Theyâ€™re going to be using the money for
something that I think is probably better and thatâ€™s for educating our
children. We heard a lot of examples of groups that might come forward
and probably will come forward. Quite honestly, if itâ€™s the feeling of
the majority in this general assembly that we should get out of the
business all together of providing permanent plates, maybe nobody should
get them. Maybe we should just have annual plates for everybody. But it
just seems to me that sense we allow public school to be those that are
among those that are able to benefit from this and we do it, I think
because we realize that they are better served using their limited
dollars to educate children instead of buying license tags, that we
should apply the same logic to charter schools which do exactly the same
thing and not penalize them because they are actually choosing to
provide a service even thought we donâ€™t mandate that they have to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speakerâ€¦ Excuse me, Mr. Chairman, would the gentleman yield for a
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. Follow up on what you were saying.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Bert. Is $6.00 per bus really going to make a difference in
whether or no they offer transportation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would just say, Representative, I think $6.00 is what they are paying.
My local charter school said that over the course of time this saved
them quite a bit of money to be able to do that. Iâ€™m just saying, does
the state need the money that bad? If we do maybe we should get rid of
permanent tags all together. I think what the charter schools telling me
is that they have a better use to this fund to educate children then
they do to buy license tags and think that sense we do it for
traditional public schools we should treat the children in charter
schools the same way.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ?? hand was up, should I put you in the queue or do you
want to respond to this particularâ€¦? OK.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. Itâ€™s not just buses that get the permanent tags in
the school LEAâ€™s. Itâ€™s also the Superintendent of school and others. I
donâ€™t think this is about the money. I think itâ€™s about the principle
that we treat our charter schools like our public schools like weâ€™ve
intended to do so and so I am defiantly in favor of doing this. I think
this is totally different than transit authorities to good will to local
authorities. I do believe this is government. This is educating our
children.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Rayne Brown.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I have to say that I agree with Representative
McElraft. Right here it says, the division they issue permanent plates
for the following motor vehicles. A motor vehicle owned by board of
education. Well a vehicle owned by board of education is not a vehicle
that is going to be transportation students. So I really donâ€™t get the
argument that its only for the school buses. This seems wide open to me
and I totally agree that the charters need to have an opportunity to
compete with the public schools as best they can. And if someone could
explain to me why we offer that reduced price for a license plate that
is owned by a Board of Education, I assume, member or chairman I would
really appreciate that. Thank you Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representatives Jones do you want to respond to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would assume any privately owned vehicles would not have a
permanentâ€¦owned by the chairman of a school board, it would be a private
owned, would not have a permanent plate. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thatâ€™s my understanding Mr. Chairman and again, I would just reiterate
again that all the charter schools are asking for is the same privilege
that being extended to the traditional public schools. Nothing more,
nothing less. I can say it better than my colleague Representative
Miguel Rap said it. I donâ€™t think we need to say it again. Itâ€™s just all
about treating them the same. Theyâ€™re all trying to educate our
children.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On to page 2. Representative Blackwell.

Just a quick comment, going back to the discussion.</p>

<p id="30:00">
Regarding why we took the action we did a year or two ago to eliminate a
lot of these permanent plates. And my understanding was that there was
thousands of these plates that were out there and that we had sort of
lost track of them. and it seems to me that one of the distinctions here
between a charter school and between a regular LEA is the distinction
between a government body, which is a permanent institution that is
there and will continue to be there absent some action of the general
assembly, and a private corporation that can change its operations, can
go out of business and cease operations at any time. And over time a
private corporation, even though it's a charter school and even though
that is a public school, can cease operation and then there's two or
three more permanent plates that have been issued that are out there and
may be no longer being used. And it seems to me if the purpose of what
we did a couple of years ago was to gain control of the situation that
to ask somebody to pay maybe $6.00 dollars more per vehicle per year so
we can keep up with it is maybe not inappropriate and that that
distinction between a permanent government institution and a corporation
is maybe something that justifies the difference here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, a couple of things. I keep hearing about this
$6.00 fee. Now I'm not an authority here but I know that I pay for my
tag every year and I don't pay $6.00. What it says here is that
permanent registration plates issued to eligible organizations are
subject to a one time registration fee of $6.00. So that's what they are
paying. That's not the fee that they're not paying. What that would be
paying would be quite a bit more than that and it would be on an annual
basis. Now to me it would probably be implied but if it's not I would be
perfectly good with language that would say that if a charter school
ceases its operation that they have to turn back in their tags. If
that's the concern that the tags are going to be out there and that's
not already implied I would be perfectly happy with that language.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Gillman [??].
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have a comment relative to this particular exchange
if I may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You are recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I agree with Representative Blackwell's comments about
this problem with the plates and the need to reduce the number but - and
tell me if my math is flawed here, but if there are 100 charter schools
and it will cost the state $8600 dollars, then on average that's $86
dollars per year, per charter school. So I can't find the harm really
that's being done to charters by not getting their permanent plates. If
there's a flaw in that math I haven't seen it yet. So I just wanted to
make that point. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jones you want to respond to that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Only to say that if that's the case that is an average
per school but all schools would not be affected and some schools might
be affected more significantly. I don't know, I'm not the CPA that works
for these schools. I'm just saying the school that came to me was really
concerned about it, it was going to be a significant cost for them and
at the end of the day $8600 dollars is a lot of money to me, now in the
context of a $20.6 billion dollar budget for the state of North Carolina
you can make that determination. But I would just make the argument that
representative McElrath made. I think it is more than just the money.
Money's always important around here, but the question is do we think
that we ought to treat traditional public schools and charter public
schools the same way in this way that is going to cost the state of
North Carolina very very little money in the great schemes of things?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, I've got is it Gillman [??], does that satisfy
your...? Okay. Representative Bumgardener.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. This turned out to be an
interesting debate and I appreciate all the good information that
representative Brawley shared with us. but according to the way the law
is written that you read a little while ago, I don't understand why
there's an issue at all. Why are all of a sudden charter schools not
getting the tags they were getting before? And another thing that amazes
me is how in the world can we have permanent tags still in use or out
there somewhere that were issued in the fifties? I can't hardly believe
that, that's an amazing thing.</p>

?? speak to that or is it ?? I have some history for you.[speaker
changes] I think I will speak if I may just with a question to staff.
Currently with all permanent license plates is there no requirement for
those license plates to be turned back in. [speaker changes] First
question. Let Mr. ?? or Mr. Perryhaven answer. [speaker changes] Yes, I
believe that's current law in subsection A of 20-84. [speaker changes]
Again I would just follow up and say I would be perfectly comfortable
with an amendment that would require these charter schools to turn their
plates back in if they go out of business. [speaker changes] Mr ??
somebody also has a response. [speaker changes] ?? During our evaluation
we found that there were definitely a lack of turn in of these plates it
is a requirement, however if the organization goes out of business or
whatever previously that had the plates. There was definitely loss track
of these plates and who may or may not have been using them and thats
part of the issue that we found is that nobody had cleared license
plates from thirty, forty, fifty years ago from the DMV records.
[Speaker changes] Mr. ?? [speaker changes] Yes sir. [speaker changes]
Questions for staff. [Speaker changes] ?? sir. [speaker changes]
Approximately how many charter schools have gone out of business in this
state in the last ten years? A year, five years, ten years? Probably
negligible, but ... [speaker changes] ?? I found the number three or
four but I am not sure if the is accurate. Representative ?? may have an
answer. Representative Shepard [speaker changes] Yes sir, Mr. ?? just
for a comment, in the last session when we looked at this and we
realized there were a lot of people in this state that had permanent
tags that did not need them we also realized that there were people who
had had them since the forties and the fifty's and so fourth. It was
something that needed to be done, but as in a lot of things that we do
in the general assembly and in government sometimes we over react and we
hurt people that should be qualifying. I support what Representative
Jones is trying to do here because if that is a public school and those
tags are going to be licensed under the name of the corporation, I think
that they should get that. In the same token I know there are other non
profit agencies that I am aware of that fulfill a need for our state for
our local counties. There is one in my area. They basically take senior
citizens to the doctor, they take them to the grocery store, they do so
much in support of the department of social services. They take people
to dialysis, if they need to go to the veterans hospital, they take
them. During this process that we did and eliminated some of the things
that were going on with these tags, most people were also hurt and I
also believe that in some of these cases these agencies deserve to have
a permanent tag too and we say well it might not be very much money and
its not based on the research I have done, however every dime helps when
we are crunching money and when you are a non profit agency or any
agency and they are providing a service for our counties, our
communities and for the people that live in those counties and
communities so, you know I am supportive of what Representative Jones is
doing but I also want to point out there are other non profit agencies
that are providing a tremendous service to the senior citizens and to
those that are handicapped and so fourth through our world transit
agencies and so fourth that also lost their permanent tags. So you know,
I dont know where we stop and I agree that we should make sure that all
of these people have permanent tags, because they are doing a great
service for the state. [speaker changes] A couple of comments, and then
Representative Jones is going to be recognized again. I have been told
we do have a ?? fiance meeting we have to be at ten till and its our
attention to take a vote right away here.</p>
