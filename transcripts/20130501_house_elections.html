?? unskilled or semi-skilled and the people I work with everyday are
hardworking people. They're ?? living for recreational boaters and
anglers. Our business depends on recreational anglers. The Recreation in
Boating and Fishing Foundation showed that about 33% of fishing
participants own a boat and about 52% of the participants are
considering the purchase of a boat in order to have better or more
access to fish. Anglers are interested in abundance of fish and an
occasional opportunity for trophy-sized fish. Recreational fishing does
create jobs and does stimulate economic activity. It pays my bills. It's
done it for over 31 years. The bill... This is a tough situation that
the bill will create jobs. I think the abundance of fish, it will help
many people that don't directly touch the fish or commercially sell
fish. We actually rely on recreational fishing to make a living. Please
help us and support the Game Fish Bill. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Hello. I'm Steven Hammonds. I'm the Executive Director
for CTA. I'm a paid staff just like Mr. ?? is for the commercial
industry. I come to you not as a commercial angler and I had a script
all written out but I've sat here, listened to both sides argue for the
Game Fish Bill. And I'm not a commercial angler and I don't even do
recreational fishing because they work me too hard. I don't even get on
the water as much as I'd like to. But I do know something about ??. I
was picking up leaves at the age of four. I understand a little bit
about what you're saying on the ?? side. However, the State of North
Carolina has to look beyond the ?? just like what you did in the ??
situation and do what's best for the entire citizenry of North Carolina.
And by doing that, they'll pass this bill. they'll pass the Game Fish
Bill and the money and I'm not even gonna do the figures because the
figures have been beaten to death by both sides. Thank you. But I also
want you to remember another thing. The bill not only concerns game
fish. And if you look at the bill clearly, it also allocates money for
the observer funds, for the floundry fisheries which is from what
commercial people tell me is a whole lot more available than these three
fish are. The bill is providing money for observer funds. It's also
providing funding for dredging. It might not be a lot to you smaller
fishermen but I guarantee it means a lot to the bigger fishermen in this
room. They won't let ?? bill pass and that's part of where the bill is
??. And it's not just about game fish. We're wrapped up in understanding
the emotion behind it. But please look at the bill as a whole, complete
deal and I think you'd be satisfied with it. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Hello. My name is Nick Hamilton. I'm a fish and
wildlife biologist. And I come to you today after 37 year career with
the Wildlife Resource Commission. Presently, I'm working for the North
Carolina Wildlife Federation where I take an objective look of the
management of all the wildlife resources of the State of North Carolina.
I encourage the general assembly to do the right thing. I'm pleased to
report that all the game fish and all the game animals of North Carolina
are doing quite well. They're being managed quite efficiently and
effectively by the Wildlife Resources Commision and the US Fishing
Wildlife Service which manages and monitors ??. No game animal or game
fish has ever been classified as threatened or endangered. In fact, none
have ever been classified depleted. Unfortunately, I can't say the same
for our marine fisheries which have been managed with a commercial
component over the years. The river herring has been depleted, season is
closed. Sturgeon is endangered and is completely protected. The speckled
sea trout is depleted with restrictive limits. Gray trout, depleted,
severely restricted. Southern flounder depleted. ?? depleted. Another
thing I heard a lot about the 99 ?? fisheries ?? today, I call your
attention to the fact that the 1997 Fishery Reform had a preamble which
is identical to the preamble for the House Bill 983. It says exactly the
same thing so it cannot be referred in one way. ??</p>

Further discussion, further debate? Seeing none, the representative ??
made a motion for a favorable report to the bill. If you favor the
motion, please signify by saying &quot;aye&quot;. [SPEAKER CHANGES]Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Those opposed please signify by saying &quot;no&quot;.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No. [SPEAKER CHANGES] In the opinion of the chair, the
&quot;aye&quot;s have it and the bill is given a favorable report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you representative Lambeth. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Next bill on our calendar today is House Bill 460, short title
&quot;Epedite Voter Maintenance Lists&quot;. And representative Hurley
is here to explain the bill representative Hurley you have the floor. Is
there PCS? There is no PCS. House Bill 460 is before us. Welcome to
elections committee. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chair and
committee. Representative Boles is also here with me today. I decided to
do this bill and as you know the integrity of the voter rolls is very
very important. And the names are never removed unless they are
absolutely positive that is the persons name that was, that has passed
away. I decided to do this bill when as last year I was looking at my
constituents list from the county. And saw that two friends names were
still on the rolls, and one had died a year ago, and one had died 3
years ago. And so I started checking to see why that was still
happening, and I went to the trouble to get the form for these family
members to remove those names. And also the military, the forms don't
always get to our Register ?? when they pass away in the military. Or if
they are from out of state, they don't always get there. I'd like for
Representative Boles to tell you how the death certifcate comes about
and what happens to it and how it goes. And then tell you why we want to
do what we want to do with this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentlman Moore
is recognized to speak on the bill.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. Pat
and I have talked about this bill. It doesn't mandate the fueneral
director to notify any board of elections. What it does is, then, during
the family conference when the fueneral director and family share
information in order to obtain a death certificate which is taken to the
department of health first. And then the original copy is taken to the
Register ?? so we can receive the certified copies. At this point as
we're obtaining death certificate information we're going over
information we advised them, they need to go by the Clerk of Court. Or
have the attorney for the state if they're of VA benefits that the
county offers, VA. And what we'd also like to do is just recommend that
the funeral director explain to them that they may want to go by the
board of elections as the family representative and remove their name
from the rolls. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We didn't want to mandate so I got
with Representative Alexander and Representative Boles and also the
board, the lobbyists for the funeral home. And we agreed that they would
give the forms, provide the forms for the families to give to the, take
to the Register, to the board of elections where the person in the
county where the person lived. Also is adding other people who are on
the estate. Right now it's just your relatives. But now they've added
the executive or administrator or the attorney for the estate can also
do that. And that was just a small step to help assure that those that
are deceased are removed from our rolls. And are not kept on our rolls.
On a voluntary basis, not mandating. I'd be glad to take any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any questions to the bill's sponsor? Representative
Conrad you're recognized for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Not a
question but I'll make a motion- [SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? Let's see, any
question on the bill? Represnetative ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mister Chair. I guess, I'm not sure how to describe this question, but.
You say that this form is going to be given to a family member? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Your relative. The person that normally comes into the funeral
home when the person dies. Normally it is a husband, wife, sister,
brother, child. [SPEAKER CHANGES] State your follow-up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I guess my concern there is the hesitancy of a spouse or
whoever to actually do that. Severing ties. And I was just wondering if
by chance this is something funeral director might, could they also
submit that form? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No ma'am. [SPEAKER CHANGES] They</p>

When you win person down, were mandated by law Social Security to notify
the home, but we is not our responsibility to contact Social Security
only have the family of verbally and settlement was so security is also
not our responsibility to file the VA benefits for the person hits the
funeral directors is a service that he and all for war.  He will assist
you in contacting the VA 's, but we cannot go to these different
agencies and sprinkled half of the family and then you ask about a
family member company and on the death certificate.  It has the
informant offers the responsible person for this under General statute.
There is a pecking order of who is liable for the certificates in that
split over this if this is the bill sponsors are further comment in
right now
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
they of the board of elections.
This is done on what's written Vietnam already near relatives, and then
going to keep at the same why it could be a cousin of mine when others
have passed away at here, but right now they will not take up a united
looking not be your miscreant, but you can go in and tell him or even
signing thing that this is just another means to help them to take the
name of the role legally knowing for sure that
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
it is a person who has passed away versus Arsenal versus the gentleman
that is in question, and I am this just allows the family to be
proactive in making sure the system soft rolls, but wanted everyone to
core processes of the board of elections uses you simply go through the
obituaries everyday or do they get notices wrong.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The registered deeds as to people who deceased winner is a process for
which there are also purged down this just allows family members.  Be
proactive in right now they cannot use obituaries agonizing because you
think our date may be incorrect, something that incorrect.  I have to
have something to get actual certified death certificate.  Copy of that
or a written notice from a family member and this is just adding the
administrator or the executor or the attorney for the estate also to be
able to do this fill out this form.  I already have these forms at sea
on board of elections.  It looks like this and we will permit will be
provided if this bill passes to the funeral home, so that they can give
out personal instead that can be taken care of if they will, in the
county where the person Leah and my and the reason the money was in art
show is right next year to five points in the people were dying in the
High Court hospital to just give her County, even though was physically
fit and ending the death certificate with him.  From Guilford, but the
information deviant.  It got to Randolph was not being done and
supposedly the DHHS sends a copy of the once you've owned I have a
database that, the counties can get the names of the deceased accounts
of the people enough with all the names are still not being removed.
Even with that process of this is just another small piece of the anger
trying to get it removed if it gets me us on this in further discussion.
 We don't have a motion before shipment.  Think ever since our first
tennis.  I heard him shout such purpose at what you say has an SSRI will
him and I'm currently, the law requires DHHS again on a monthly basis,
unnamed husband and deceased individuals of their enough certificates
for which arguments the same board.  He then transmit sensory County
Board of elections who is responsible for removing them if they have a
match between that information in the deceased voters at
bread-and-butter registration information fingers and bells like that
they can mistake on</p>

<p id="15:00">
Because of the rule committee and hospitals most people don't die in
their own county like lot a people die do Chapel Heal, charlotte, ?? or
advance facilities. So therefore couldn't have Darn the HHS your death
certificate is filed in the county of death not in your residence. That
would be durum haven't to send one hundred counties this records.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You may have an initial follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Right it is on the county. Right but I understand that
you are saying that it has a massive state agency to the state board of
elections. What this does is encourage local families to go to the local
board of elections and it doesn't get caught in the massive paper work.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I think Representative Hurley want to respond to also.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well this came from the board of elections when I ask
about it. To set full with the conversation you ask on how I like some
of the issues that may prevent this ease of voters being removed
county's voter list. Some counties will allow on a monthly report for
body to the end by the state board of elections to remove voters
predeceased. In compiling these among the county reports is agency use
data provided to us monthly by the NC department of health and human
services. Under current law counties are task researching these monthly
reports to determine if any registered voter in their counties is no
longer qualified to vote because he is already ceased. When conducting
this research. County is looking for data matches. They are looking to
see if a registered voter based on elements such as name birth and date
of birth matches the deceased record on the DHSS list with out of data
match counties will not remove voter. Many county boards also work with
the local registered date officials. And all counties remove deceased
voters if they have received a signed notification from a relative. So
they do not remove them unless things match. Your birthday may be
incorrect, something they may have a first name like my name its
Patricia Allan. I might have gone by may be on the Allan and if it
doesn't match exactly they will not remove it so this is just another.
It's not gonna remove everybody but it's gonna help with those who get
mixed like I said man from ?? county who died in Guilford county even
though the supposedly system was supposed to work. It didn't worked.
Three years ago one that when you just go when I was not looking for him
I just met him accidentally and how many more out there with it. It's
just a simply thing it's not a man date it's just gonna help some more
authorial that are truly deceased.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] As a former I am just the chair not a speaker. Go
ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] As a former legislator prior to get just another tool
in top box.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion on the bill. Representative
Floyd.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] At appropriate time Mr. Chair this is prior get some
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I had promise representative Carney that I would
take I would allow her to make the motion a minute ago but I will take a
second here. Representative Carney I have moved to your favorite report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Sorry. Hello.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Hey.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Lady from Mecklenburg is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman one last question I may have
miss this earlier in the presentation, I notice that in the bill the
description of the bill it defines who near relative is. What is the
definition of personal representative?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Executer or the administrator or the attorney of the
state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ma'am any further comment, further discussion on the
debate. Representative Carney moves for a favor report to house bill 460
further discussion debate. Seeing none so many favors the motion.</p>

This bill that would save about $12,000 and 26,000 slipped into good

removal and maintenance of the voter registration list.  It is
authorizing the State Board of Elections to share information with other
states and to garner information from other states regarding the lists
that they have of voter registration information and voter records, but
it does not change the process used by our state for list maintenance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Further questions of the bill's sponsor, Representative
Michaux.  The member is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]About prohibition in the NBRA of 90 days before any
federal elections before you can even purge anybody under NBRA.  It
appears to me that you'll be in sort of conflict with the NBRA at this
time.  The state law also permits the County Board of Elections to
remove registers.  I guess my problem is, if you're going to start doing
this in trying to follow and work with other states, maybe we ought to
look at studying this situation before we get into it, because purging
can be used in very evil ways in many instances as has been shown in the
past, and I don't mind looking at this, and probably, maybe, some
changes in that, but when we've got NBRA out there with the rules, and
we've got our own state laws and I think that if we start moving and
proving any thing on here, without any kind of study being done, I think
we could be headed for trouble.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Ross, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Just to ask the bill's sponsor, or maybe staff, a
question.  I depends on who can answer it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]The member is recognized for that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]So when I look at, I guess, lines 20 and 21, it says,
Any data sharing agreement shall require the other state or states to
comply with North Carolina law.  Just wanted to remind the members what
those 2 provisions are, and then to ask whether other states will be
able to require us to comply their law.  Is there a kind of reciprocity
in how that's approached?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Do you want staff to take that, or do you want it,
Representative?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I think I'll comment, and then maybe let staff follow
up.  I know that that addresses in instances, for instance, of identity
theft.  These are statutes that have to do with confidential information
that you would not want to be shared like a social security number, but
I'd be happy for staff to add to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Anyone want to comment back there?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes, sir.  Both of those statutes are about pieces of
information that are in the voter registration record such as your
social security number, the last 4 digits, or your date of birth  North
Carolina law can obviously require the North Carolina State Board of
Elections to behave in a certain way.  We would not be able to require
another state to behave that way, except under the contractually
arrangement, their state, which every of the 49 that it is, would
control what that state's behavior would be for their information in
their contractual arrangement.  Obviously, if a contractual arrangement
didn't meet the requirements put on by the State Board of the General
Assembly, then the state would not be able to enter into that agreement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Further questions, further discussion, or further
debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Mr. Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Lewis is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Yes sir.  We're blessed to have a lot of new members.
I wanted to announce that as Chair, that we received a letter which I
have passed out to each of you.  It is entitles the NAACP End
Advancement Project.  If you will not at the bottom of this form I wrote
per request, and that was done, because whenever material is passed out
someone's name has to be written there, and I was asked that this be put
as a part of the record on this bill</p>
