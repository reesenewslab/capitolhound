  Members will take their seats. The visitors will retire from the
chamber, the sergeant at arms has closed the doors. Members and visitors
will please silence all electronic devices. The prayer will be offered
by Representative Avila. Members in the gallery and visitors in the
gallery will please stand and remain standing for the pledge of
allegiance. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let us pray. Our gracious Heavenly Father,
today we come before you in humility recognizing that all things come to
us through your mercy and grace, not by any of our own actions. We
praise and thank you for guiding each of us to this place today. We ask
for your wisdom and understanding as we face important issues affecting
the lives of North Carolinians. Grant us patience and love as we deal
with each other and the differing ideas among us. Watch over and protect
our men and women in the armed forces as they defend our freedoms. Be
with their families as they struggle with separations, anxieties and
fears. Give them a peaceful mind and a restful heart as they sacrifice
to protect our great country. All this I pray in the name of my Lord and
Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I pledge allegiance to the
flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it

the Governor coming on Wednesday this is a historic occasion and
we&#39;ll need your help. Thank you very much. You may resume your

[SPEAKER CHANGES] For an announcement. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You&#39;re
recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The Capital
Commission Bible Study will meet this afternoon at 5pm in room 1228. For
those of you that have participated in the past, please note the room
change, room 1228. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Dollar is
recognized for a motion, well, first recognized for a point of personal
privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Point of personal privilege, thank you. Mr.
Speaker, members of the House, I made a proposition with a school
counselor at my son&#39;s middle school, Mr. Ron Perin, the school
counselor at Rutkin Road Middle School happens to be a rather fervent
New England Patriots fan, and had the game gone the other way, the way
it was going up until 26 seconds left, then Mr. Perin would&#39;ve been
obligated today to be wearing a Seattle Seahawks jersey over at the
middle school today. Unfortunately, because of probably the single worst
play call in the entire 49 year history of the Super Bowl, I am standing
before you today fulfilling my requirement to praise the New England
Patriots on their fourth Super Bowl championship in that franchise&#39;s
history. I would note with some solace, I suppose, that the winning
player, the guy who made the difference at the very end, was an
undrafted, unrestricted free agent from a very small school who, once
again, proved in America that with hard work and determination you can
rise from the very bottom to the very top pinnacle of your profession,
and I do so with just a few seconds to spare in this case.

  So I congratulate Malcolm Butler on his win, and I congratulate Mr.
Penn, for the record, on the New England Patriot&#39;s victory in the
Super Bowl and just simply say, wait till next year.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Unless someone, Representative McNeill is recognized, for whatever
purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you.  Would be appropriate to recommend that Representative
Dollar&#39;s comments be spread across the journal?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
If you&#39;ll pay the cost of transcribing them, we&#39;ll do that.
Representative Dollar is recognized for motion.
