December 31st, 2015 from August 1st, 2015. These are just being done
mainly because we’re at the end of the session getting this law passed,
so just to give a little more time to get that done. Adds locations that
are in the hundred year floodplain to be an additional factor. The DENR
must consider in prioritizing impoundments. Clarifies language
concerning public notice. Clarifies the warden requirements for
impoundments to require the impoundments located in whole or in part
beneath the water table be dewatered to the maximum extent practical.
Also, modifies commissions considerations factors for closure, approval
to provide that although cost may be considered, costs may not be the
dispositive factor in that decision. Modifies the variance provision to
provide limitations on issuance, to change the decision maker from the
secretary environment natural resource, excuse me, to change the
decision maker from the secretary of economic and natural  resources to
the commissioner. Changes setbacks to 300 feet, adds additional
appropriation, and corrects various other dates. That, in a nutshell, is
the content of the conference report. I’ll be happy to answer any
questions. I think we’ve discussed it quite a bit. I think this makes
North Carolina the leader in the United States in Coal Ash management. I
think something we can go home and be proud of and to the extent we’ve
gone and the thought and the time that’s been placed in this. I think
it’s very important to our constituents and to our state as a whole. I
look forward to getting this on the books and I ask for your support.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do we have any further discussion or debate? Senator McKissick, for what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick has the floor to speak to the conference report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’d like to thank all of those that worked on this particular bill. I
think it’s an excellent representation of what we can do when there’s
collaborative bipartisan cooperation looking for a good outcome. This is
one of those bills that was necessary, in fact I would go as far as to
say as it was imperative. I think we came up with a good bill that we
had to balance a lot of competing interests. I know when I first started
reading articles about Coal Ash, I thought it was just intuitive that
what we need to do is dig up all the coal ash in the state and go in
there and impoundment and offsite locations, but I quickly realized when
I went out to visit several of these coal ash ponds, I think Senator
Foushee you were with me one day and we spent about two hours and you
saw ponds that were active, you saw ones that were inactive, you saw
them at different stages and you began to realize this was not a one
size fit all solution, that you had to differentiate between whether
they were high risk facilities, low risk, medium and the like. I think
this bill has taken us in the right direction, so I want to thank all of
those that put in the time, the energy, and the effort, both in the
House and in the Senate. I’ve spoken with many of my colleagues in the
House side as this bill has moved forward and in particular,
Representative Glazier, because I spoke with him this afternoon even
though he was up in Minnesota attending a conference. I feel good about
where we are. I feel as if this Senate and this House and this General
Assembly is putting North Carolina in a positive light and addressing a
serious environmental issue that had the potential to have far reaching
implication in terms of water quality and impacting the lives of those
that we really want to protect in the most serious way possible.

Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question

I just want to be sure we thank Senator Apodaca. He’s thanked everybody
in the room and I want to be sure we take a moment to thank him. He’s
here, sick, under the weather, he worked all weekend. He’s been tireless
in his work on this bill from the very beginning and I just want to be
sure we thank him also.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 42: Confidentiality of unemployment changes information.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President and members of the Senate.  Senate Bill 42 was
one part of a very good bill on unemployment insurance, a piece of
legislation that was put together in a bipartisan manner. Ladies and
gentlemen, what this portion does is it will allow the USDOL regulations
and state law to comply and conform and in doing so, it reduces the risk
to the state on any potential problems on giving out private information
on a potential beneficiary. And I urge that you pass this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson, you have the floor for a moment of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members, two things that I want to mention
tonight. It’s been a pleasure and an honor to serve with all of you for
the past two terms. Some of us will not be back in here next year and we
know that. But I just wanted to tell you thank you. It’s been an honor
to come and know each and every one of you. And whether we come back or
not, it’s been a pleasure. The second this is, I wanted to recognize
luckiest woman I know in this chamber. And that is my wife.  She’s
joined us tonight.  She’s in the gallery and she told me not to mention
it at all, but me being me just could not get away with it.  But my
bride of 36 years, Debra Jackson, we call her Debbie, and I just wanted
to let the folks know who she was here tonight.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, I always say you’re the luckiest man in the chamber. Senator
McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Brief announcement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
First of all, like Senator Jackson, it’s been a real privilege and an
honor to serve with all of my colleagues in this chamber.  One of these
things, many of you know I do on the last day of session is I typically
is bring my camera in and take photographs of many of you that are in
the halls that day.  On this occasion, we’re back from what I thought
was the last day, but the good thing is that I have some of these
photographs with me.  I happened to take plenty of pictures last Friday
and if you would like to get a copy of those particular shots, feel free
to stop by my desk after the session and pick one up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator. Any other notices or announcements? Ratification of
bills.  The clerk will read.
