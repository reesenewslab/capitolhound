[Speaker changes.] I hope ya'll are enjoyin' the liquid sunshine this
mornin.  Call the meeting of the House Education together. We have a
little housekeepin' we have to do and that is introducing our
Sargent-at-Arms and our students today. So we'll start with our House
Sargent-at-Arms.  We have ....oh I was correct...Martha Gattison?????.
Martha's a regular. Mike Clampett and Wayne Davis. Now our students, we
have Zachary Clark...where's Zachary? Oh, OK...I'm sorry. He's from
Colwell?????? County and he comes from Representative Starnes district.
We have Chance Corvin????.  There ya' are...and he's from Wake County
and he's in Representative Dollar's district. If you'll allow me, we
have some guests today...most of you know that yesterday, Speaker
Tillis, along with some of the education chairs, led a press conference
announcing that this week is going to be...in the House is going to be
Education Week.  This week the House will be welcoming the
superintendents, principals of the year and teachers of the year and
they'll be from all across North Carolina.  They're going to participate
today and they're gonna sit in our seats, not in our shoes but in our
seats and give us a little bit of insight on what their problems are and
see if we can answer any questions. If the superintendents that are
here, if you'll come forward? How many do we have today? In order for
our...oh my goodness...(Laughter.)  If you'll come up front so people
can see ya' and while you're comin', I would like for your names and
your...the school that you lead to be part of our minutes today so if
you will come up front and get to the microphone and give your name and
the school system that you lead.  And, while they're comin' forward, is
Kathryn Joyce???????? here? l Hey Kathryn...Kathryn serves as a School
Board Admin...she serves the School Board Administration here in Raleigh
here to the legislator.  About two or three years ago, she invited me
and Representative Glazier...don't know if you remember this or
not...but she invited both of us to speak and we ended up being there at
the same time...and the conclusion of that meeting, I think on both of
our parts, we were lacking a lot of communication.  If the
superintendents that are here...if you will come forward, how many do we
have today?
REPETITION: In order for our...oh my goodness...(Laughter.)  If you'll
come up front so people can see ya' and while you're comin', I would
like for your names and your...the school that you lead to be part of
our minutes today so if you will come up front and get to the microphone
and give your name and the school system that you lead.  And, while
they're comin' forward, is Kathryn Joyce???????? here? l Hey
Kathryn...Kathryn serves as a School Board Admin...she serves the School
Board Administration here in Raleigh here to the legislator.  About two
or three years ago, she invited me and Representative Glazier...don't
know if you remember this or not...but she invited both of us to speak
and we ended up being there at the same time...and the conclusion of
that meeting, I think on both of our parts, we were lacking a lot of
communication.
Wait just a minute...anyhow, from that...if you'll keep your welcoming
down til we get 'em introduced. Am I gonna hafta send ya'll to the
principal's office?  (Laughter.)l
Anyhow, from that meeting, we approached Speaker Tillis about the fact
that communication was not good and we felt like we needed to have a
little closer bond with our administrators and, out of that, after two
years comes a week of education, opening the doors of the legislature to
our school leaders.  Now if you will follow Representative Langdon and
introduce yourself:

<p id="10:00">
favor say Aye.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Aye.[SPEAKER CHANGES]All opposed, no.
Ayes have it. Okay, Representative Horn.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you very
much, Mr. Chair. House Bill 97 as put before you in a PCS is a
flexibility bill. This is a bill that came out of Committee with
unanimous support. The bill simply allows the LEAs to use lottery funds,
heretofore earmarked only for construction, to allow them to purchase
school technology needs. It requires that the counties using these funds
that they use the funds to meet their digital needs, and that they are
to ensure high-quality ongoing professional development. It's not new
money, it's just allowing the LEAs to use the money in a more flexible
manner. The PCS, all it did was provide some technical corrections. No
substantive change in the bill whatsoever. It's all yours to
support.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Cleveland.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. A comment more than a question. In other words, we're
saying that 40% of the proceeds of the Education Lottery are going to
the Public Schools Capital Fund. That might be what the law says, but
that's not what's happening in the budget process. I don't know of any
school LEA that doesn't have capital funding problems. And now we're
going to allow them to dip into a source of those funds for the digital
learning and getting into the 21st Century education. I've just got some
problems with the mentality that we're dealing with here of doing this.
This is going to allow and open a door for other good ideas, and it's a
good idea. We have to find funding someplace to support this type of
thing. But it's going to just open the door for others to look at this
capital funding and think that it's a good source to do something that
the education establishment needs. I think we should actually start
funding these things and not looking for easy sources.[SPEAKER
CHANGES]Representative Adams.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chair. I
was going to raise a similar kind of question. I see it's 40% as what
we're proposing. Do we know that is in terms of dollars?[SPEAKER
CHANGES]Representative Horn.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Presently, 40% of the Lottery funds received by the LEAs are earmarked
for construction. So that's not a change in the Lottery fund
distribution formula per se. All this bill does is allow LEAs the option
to use that portion of their Lottery fund for the purchase of digital
devices, not just devices, but to fill their digital learning needs.
There are some LEAs that are, in fact, billed out. There are some LEAs
that will decide that their needs are better fit by having the
flexibility to move some money from one pot to another. This is one step
in allowing the LEAs that type of flexibility.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Follow
up, Mr. Chair.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Okay.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you. I think
I understand that. Does anybody have the 40% in terms of dollars and
cents? What kind of money are we talking about?[SPEAKER CHANGES]Brian,
can you help us with that figure?[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. Brian Madison with Fiscal Research. To the questions raised by
Representative Adams and Representative Cleveland, the first point I'd
make with this legislation is that it does not modify the Lottery Act's
recommended allocations. That 40% has been recommended by the Lottery
Act and also overridden in the last several budgets by the General
Assembly, as have allocations for other programs. And certainly, that's
within the General Assembly's purview to overrule laws it has made
previously. Currently, the 11-12 allocation for school capital was about
$100 million, which represented 22% of the total net receipts to the
Lottery. To have made that 40% would have been roughly around, what's
the figure here</p>

<p id="15:00">
...roughly around 180 Million which would have required reductions to
other lottery sources such as classroom teachers, pre-K, scholarships
for needy students, or UNC need based aid.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke. Luebke?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm trying to be really clear on what you are
doing here, Representative Horn. My first take on it is that your
robbing Peter to pay Paul. That is to say you are taking monies that
otherwise would be used for school construction and moving it over to
another need. Granted, another need of the schools: digital learning.
Let me just start by asking a question, &quot;Is that correct?&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, sir, it's not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Could you correct. Then tell me what it does do?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We are not taking anything away. We are allowing the LEA's the option
for it. To utilize construction monies that they may not need and apply
those monies to meeting their digital requirements. We are not mandating
anything nor are we robbing Peter to pay Paul. This opens the door for
the LEA's to make their own decisions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let's say I represent a county and I haven't had a chance to ask my
county as to where the county is in terms of capital needs for
construction. But, let's say I'm from a county where 40% is needed and
you're also saying, &quot;Hey, folks, why don't you go ahead and use
some of your 40%. Take from your 40% (we'll just say 10% so 4 million of
it) and put it towards digital.&quot; Is that not a correct
interpretation of the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is a correct interpretation. It allows a superintendent, an LEA, to
make that decision based on the needs of their school district. It does
not direct the superintendent to utilize...it does not direct or require
the superintendent to use that money.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Final question, Mr. Chairman, if I may?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So, really, for a school district, for Durham Public Schools, there is
no additional money coming here at all and since I believe as the last
time the 40% didn't even go it was 20 some percent in the budget,
there's no gain at all for public schools systems really from this bill
really just increased options.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Glazier (???).
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I find myself in agreement, first with
Representative Cleveland who made the point that we obviously are gonna
have other obligations here, but I don't think that's a reason to be,
and I don't think he was saying that, to be against the bill. I actually
very much support the bill. North Carolina School Boards Association I
know is in support of the bill because I think it does just what
Representative Horn says: It provides options. They're clearly lots of
additional resources that are going to be needed, but for some
districts, or portions of districts, that have real digital technology
and capital needs that they can't meet any other way and they choose to
do that as opposed to...perhaps they haven't had a bond haven't had
renovations. They don't use all of their money currently get out of the
lottery for construction this just seems to me to give them some option
to try to meet some of those needs. But again I would say this isn't a
substitute for the resources we're going to have to provide. It's simply
to try to get a start for some districts that may have the capacity to
do that.  And with that in mind I would very much support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dockham (??? Daughtry?)
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The point that concerns me is that the capital
construction is the responsibility of the county and my county has
really put us out on the limb in bonds, borrowing money to build new
schools. We've had to build a lot of new schools, and we still have to
build new schools. And they don't want us messing with this fund because
they are counting on this fund to help them retire the bonds. If you
give the LEA the authority to mess with the fund, to take money out of
the fund it may not suit our county even to, even to suggest that
because they are looking down the road to build more schools and this is
their responsibility. The capital money is what they need, it's not
necessarily what the LEA needs. So that worries me about the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand your concern.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Shepard.</p>

<p id="20:00">
Yes sir, Mr. Chair. I don't know if this is the right time for the
question but what Representative Cleveland brought up, I'm concerned
about, if 40% is supposed to go to the school districts from the lottery
for school construction, where's the other 18%? Why is it not going?
There's only 22% going.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Shepard, that was a budgeting thing. So the budgeting
situation could end up being that same way. Representative Wilkins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I do know where the School Boards Association
stands on this but, Representative Horn, if I may direct you to the
whereas language, line 14. And we're seeing several LEA's who have
requested more flexibility. Can you quantify that for us?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Horn?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm going to have to ask staff for that clarification.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning. Over the course of the study committee there were quite a
few LEA's who came and spoke. We can count, that would take some time,
but there were quite a few throughout the state who came and spoke in
support of digital learning.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I may add to that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, you may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have also personally met with a number of
superintendents around the state, planned to meet with a whole lot more,
and I'm coming to you. You don't need to come to me. But if there's any
one consistent word that applies to the needs and desires of the
superintendents, the word is flexibility. And that's exactly, I've heard
this time and time again without exception, and so no I didn't take
count. We haven't taken count. We can do the best we can to recap
exactly who has supported this. I just don't have it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Dixon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. First a brief comment and then a question. We need
to, as rapidly as possible, ensure that we've identified where this 18%
is going that it's not supposed to be going and put it in the right
place if we're going to continue to call it the education lottery.
Representative Horn, I'm looking at the bill analysis. This is not a,
this has a built-in sunset, if I'm reading it correctly, in that the
authorization for the LEA's to use this flexibility begins in July of
'13 and has a sunset of July of '16 unless the State Board of Education
determines that the local school administrative unit has demonstrated
consistent improvement and growth in student outcomes. And so, in
effect, that is a form of a sunset. So we're not doing anything
permanently here. These technology needs, if I understand it, are
immediate and this is an attempt to provide immediate flexibility for
these school systems to get this technology. Would that be a correct
assessment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Horn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That would be a correct assessment. It says, on one hand we're giving
you flexibility, we want results. You get results, we got something to
talk about.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I've got three more names that I've taken and at the end of this we're
going to go ahead and vote. Representative Carney.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and to the bill sponsors I support the whole
digital learning and think it's a great way for our state to go. I have
a little, having been a former county commissioner like many of the
previous speakers, here we go pitting county commissions against school
boards and I've been in that room where we're trying to work together on
what's best with the increased budget request and also the capital needs
of the counties. I would, I know you've said that the school boards have
support the association supports that could we, Mr. Chairman, hear from
the County Commission Association to what they're response would be to
this bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't know if there's anybody here to, could respond to that. I'm
going ahead and see, okay, get to the mic and state who you are.</p>

<p id="25:00">
And who you are working for.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I’m Rebecca Trap
with the County Commissioners Association. We actually school technology
in using lottery funds as a part of our goals package in the last
biennium. Our members chose not to include it this time, not because
they’re against use of those funds, but because of what Brian mentioned.
Instead of getting roughly $180 million, now we’re getting $100 million.
Our concern here was we would certainly be supportive making sure that
our allocation goes back up to a statutory level.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Horn.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair. I would also like to point out on page 2 line 16. A county
may use monies in this fund to pay for digital learning. Again, trying
to bring people together to work together and giving them the option on
how they can go forward. It’s my understanding that many LEAs, many
superintendents have ongoing agreements work pretty well with their
county commissioners in trying to deal with school construction needs
and the rising demand for technology. They’re looking to be able to
create some balance. This bill offers them that opportunity without
saying no you can’t use this money. That option is there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Torbett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a motion, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Hold your motion. Representative Fisher.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wanted just to piggyback on to what
Representative Dixon had said earlier about the idea that this is just a
way to bring schools digital technology needs to the fore. We know that
there are schools that can’t afford to do this and this would be a way
to make that happen. Another idea to be sure that people see is that
this is the permissive bill that has a sunset. Let’s see if this will
bring our schools up to what they are…what they need for 21st century
learning, and then too, when you look at when schools set out to
build...when school systems set out to build a new school, what they’re
at in that new construction is how will that school be able to implement
technology within the building of a school. They’re getting wired and
upfitted for digital uses from the very, very beginning, even when they
are just being newly constructed. Why not give schools that are already
constructed and who need this kind of upfitting a chance to get going as
well. I would say that with the permissive language, with the idea that
this does sunset, I think that it is an idea worth looking at. Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The last speaker, Chairman Johnson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Since you’re not taking any more committee members, I’ll speak as a
sponsor of the bill. I didn’t want anybody to think I was injecting
myself, but if you can remember the first two technology bill that came
through our committee, they were to gather data, to find out where we
actually are and we’re sunsetting this in three years. This is a method
to help us until we can get to the point that we can actually move and
know that whatever we decide is the correct option. This will give the
schools some kind of assistance until all of that, the first two bills
can and I’d appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Torbett. For your motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, for a motion that the House committee on education report out
as favorable on the proposed Committee Substitute for House Bill 97 and
unfavorable on the original bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All in favor say aye.

<p id="30:00">
And staff will give us a synopsis. ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Chairman, Chairwoman Johnson. If you look at your summary for House
Joint Resolution 138 it walks you through the 5 step process that is
regulated by the statutes GS115d-2.1 before f that says that the speaker
of the house will assign a committee to manage the election for the
State Board of Community Colleges and Speaker ?? has assigned that duty
to House Education. The Chairs of both House Education and Senate
Education have determined a nomination period, and the nomination period
if this House Joint Resolution passes would culminate with the election
of one member to the State Board of Community College, that's how many
vacancies you have this session, on March the 28th, so if this House
Joint Resolution passes through the House and the Senate today and
tomorrow than the plan is that the nominating period would begin this
Thursday, February 28th, you all would receive your nomination form that
you would fill out with your nominee. Your nominee would also send in a
statement of economic interest to the State Ethics Commission, and
traditionally that nomination period has been open for 10 days, so the
nominations, if the Joint Resolution passes, would be due to the House
Principal Clerk on March the 24th, but again all of this procedure you
would receive through your legislative email with your nomination forms.
So basically this Joint Resolution is just to set the date for Thursday
March the 28th of when in the House separately you would elect your
nominee and then the Senate would also at that same date vote in their
chamber elect their one vacancy. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, do we have
any questions. I think this puts about, allows us to start the form
work. The fifth, when will these, when will the legislature get the
chance to nominate. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If the resolution passes through
the House today, passes through the Senate tomorrow, the plan is we will
send out the nomination forms Thursday. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thursday. OK.
Do I have, any questions? Representative Tolson. [SPEAKER CHANGES]   For
a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It is time for a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
move we give House Joint Resolution 138 a favorable report. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Tolson has moved that we give House Bill, what's
our number, 138, a favorable report. All those in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Those opposed. The House Joint
Resolution passes. Now we have Rebecca Garland with us today. Dr.
Garland is the Chief Academic Officer at the North Carolina Department
of Public Instruction and she's going to present the founding principles
act. You're getting to be a regular. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, thank you so much for
the opportunity to be here today. To share with you the implementation
of the founding principles act. First of all I'd like to send the
regrets of our State Superintendent Jane Atkinson. She and I presented
this presentation jointly last week for Senate Education but today she's
visiting in the schools out in Murphy and she didn't want to disappoint
the students and teachers who were expecting her to be there. So she
does send her regrets to you. She certainly does like to come when
invited to the General Assembly. As many of you know, in 2011 the
founding principles act became law and the bill requires that high
school students pass a course on the philosophical foundations of
America as a graduation requirement, so I'm here today to demonstrate to
you that we are indeed compliant with the law and walk you through the
timeline as to how we went about implementing the legislation. The first
thing that we did at the department after the legislation passed, we did
review the standard course of study to see if the standards themselves
would have to be changed and we determined that the standards did not
but the support materials did. Our standards are written at a very high
conceptual level.</p>

<p id="35:00">
and certainly the standards were there in place that we were teaching
the constitution ?? but we wanted to have resources, and materials to
make it very explicit to teachers, to our principles to show them were
the founding principles should be appropriately taught to ensure that we
were compliant with the law, and we also wanted to identify curriculum
content that is appropriate to teach just a reminder that in our state
the state board of education does pass the standard course of study. Let
the school systems determine the curriculum and resources that they want
to use in order to teach those standards that we do not have a required
curriculum but we do have required standards. Standards are what
students will need to know, and be able to do upon completion of the
course, and we wanted to make sure that it was very apparent that we had
a course that is ?? the legislation that actually was named
&quot;American History One the Founding Principles&quot;, and so our
state board of education did officially change the title of our first
course in social studies from &quot;US History&quot; to &quot;American
History One the Founding Principles&quot; we changed it from &quot;US
History&quot; which was the typical name. So we wanted to make it very
clear from the very surface with the name all the way down to the
resources that we were indeed compliant with the legislature. So now to
walk you through just the timeline of actually what we the staff had
done. We started in July and August to revise the current teacher
resources that were available for teachers to use. Those resources can
be accessed on our web. Some are documents. Some are links to places on
the website where teachers can find resources, and in September of 2011
the states superintendents council that meets a couple of times a month
actually the whole group reviewed the resources reviewed everything that
we were doing to make sure that we were compliant with the law requiring
the founding principles. In October of 2011 we took the state board the
resources that we were going to suggest to our schools and to our
teachers. Typically the state board does not approve of resources but in
this case because we wanted to make sure that we were compliant with the
law we did indeed take some resources to them so that they could
validate to us that we were being compliant with the ?? founding
principles ?? . So in November, and December we opened our website, and
in our wiki spaces we refer teachers to where they can find those
resources, And what I have for you are just a couple of screenshots to
show you examples of what the teachers see if they go to these websites
are hosted now over at NC State, and their education cloud will be ??
those links, and resources into our instructional improvement system as
soon as that gets built, and is implemented next fall. So teachers will
sign on, and will immediately be able to go to all the resources
available to them but in this particular slide you can see where the
founding principles is ??. In this particular slide you can see where we
took the standard course of study and we highlighted under each standard
where each of the principles could be appropriately taught, and on this
slide I'm highlighting for you a partnership that we have with Bill of
Rights Institute. Other resources that you can find links for on that
page just giving you an example The Center for Civic Education, a free
resource site that the federal government provides free resources around
the founding principles, Kids Voting witch is an opportunity were we can
encourage our students to be involved in the election process, links to
the Library of Congress, to the National Humanities Center, to the North
Carolina Bar Association, to the Civic Education ?? , to primary source
documents so that teachers can easily access primary source documents
without having to do a lot of work to find copies of them, and then the
National ?? for Humanities. These are just some of the links so that our
teachers can readily and easily access the resources they need to teach
the founding principles, and if any of you have ever been involved with
school you understand the importance of a course code once a course has
a course code then that it's actively in our ?? system, and teachers can
direct students to register for that course. So in the spring of 2012
&quot;American History One the Founding Principles&quot; actually did
receive its course code, and we now have students who this year are
signing up to take ...</p>

<p id="40:00">
New course with its new standards. Now just to give you a context for
how students access information about the founding principles in courses
other than American History 1 in K-3 our students begin their study of
social studies by studying their community. So we start with the family,
the city, the county, just so our students can learn how their local
government works. The whole notion of going in to out with our students.
In fourth grade our students study North Carolina history, in fact I
know you see the buses as they arrive in Raleigh and children are
walking through the downtown mall park. In fifth grade students study
United States history, and so this is where they get a formal
introduction to the founding principles. In sixth and seventh grades our
students study the eastern hemisphere and the western hemisphere,
primarily a regional walk through the world. Western Europe, the Middle
East, Asia, Africa, I'm going to leave something out, Canada, Mexico,
South America, they study each of the regions of the world in sixth and
seventh grade. In eighth grade they come back and do another study of
North Carolina history, and this is where they get deeply into the
history of our state. In 9-12, students in our state are required to
take 4 courses all of which they have to pass in order to graduate from
high school. They have to take American History 1, the founding
principles, which is the beginning of our country through
reconstruction. In history 2 they take reconstruction to the present.
They take a full course in civics and economics which they also have to
pass. Civics is another place where we go into great depth with the
founding principles. In the civics course students actually learn the
founding principles and how they are applied to life today, so it's an
application level course if you will, and then students must also pass a
course in world history in order to graduate. I would probably argue
that our students in North Carolina take as much as if not more than
history of students in other states, and so we're very proud of the
history offerings and the social studies offerings that students in our
state walk through at the time that they are in high school. From the
spring of 2012 until now we have been implementing the common core. Now
some of you know that the common core is in English and Mathematics, so
it's just what the students need to be able to do in English and Math in
terms of their standard work. What a lot of folks don't realize about
the common core is there are two subcomponents of the common core. One
is that students have to be literate and being able to read and
comprehend and write about and speak about social studies and the same
is true of science, so there are science literacy standards and there
are social studies literacy standards in the common core, but one of the
reasons that the common core ever came to be was the realization that
American students are not able to read complex text and so they were not
very successful in reading social studies documents and science
documents so as part of our common core implementation students are
being required to read in a very close way, and what we mean by close
reading is students need to be able to read it for deep understanding,
then they have to be able to do something with the information that they
get from the reading, so we feel very confident that because of the
common core and our focus on social studies that students in our state
should be able to read the Declaration of Independence, the
Constitution, the Federalist Papers and that our teachers are focusing
on our students' ability to be able to do that. Every summer for the
past several years since we have had race to the top, we sponsor a
summer institute where we do training for teachers. Now the way this has
worked in order to insure that standards work is filtering its way down
into the classroom, 115, all of our LEAs send a team to a summer
institute. Our charter schools are invited to send teams. Obviously
charter schools have a lot of leeway. Many of our charter schools take
advantage of that opportunity and do attend. At the summer institute we
do training with our teams to make sure that the social studies
coordinator at the local level understands the central standards, that
our language arts folks and our math folks understand the common core
standards and then they are responsible for going back and doing
training in their own LEAs. Now in addition to that, we do monthly
webinars ourselves from the department where teachers can sign up and do
if you will face to face but virtually and get training directly from
our consultants in the department. Last year we did about 96 trainings
regionally</p>

... across the state. Included in them were trainings in the area of
social studies, around the founding principles. So we are constantly
doing professional development at the department to make sure that our
teachers have the knowledge and skills that they need to be able to
teach it.
The law also requires that any standardized test that we have would
focus on the founding principles. We no longer have a United States
history end of course test. That was eliminated a couple of years ago.
We have, however, implemented as part of Race to the Top, common exams.
Some of you may remember back when you were in school that you had to
take a departmental exam. I can remember my undergraduate work at UNCG
that everybody that took biology took the same exam. That’s the type of
exam that has been implemented. It was developed by teachers. We had 800
teachers come in this past summer to do our common exams. The purpose of
these common exams is that we’ll know that if our teachers are teaching
effectively. These are not exams where the state publishes data. When
the exams are taken, the teachers score them. They are given a scoring
key. The teachers score them, the data go to the principals, and then it
translates into an ?? score, so that our principals will know if the
students in a class are growing. These are not state tests, if you will,
that we collect data and publish. These are data that go back to the
principals for them to help determine teacher effectiveness to see if
students are growing. Because we have these common exams, and because we
have this statue, as part of the content that went into these exams, we
ensured that the founding principles were reflected in those exams.
We have started recruiting teachers to help us create some content for
the instructional improvement system, and we are working with the Bill
of Rights Institute to make that happen. We hope to have 10 digital
contents, one on each of the Bill of Rights, to implement in our
instructional improvement system in the fall when it goes live. The Bill
of Rights Institute will be partnering with us through an MOU to develop
that digital content.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair. Is this a good time to ask questions? Or shall we wait to
the end? I do have a question about this Bill of Rights.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes we’ll wait until the end.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On this Bill of Rights I have questions. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
These are the topics of some of the modules that will be going into the
instructional improvement system. The Bill of Rights Institute will have
representatives at our social studies conference so our social studies
coordinators across the state will be able to have conversation with
them, and we’ll be doing some communication with them to let teachers
know that those modules will be included in the instructional
improvement system. Our district supervisors will be meeting with the
Bill of Rights Institute. And then in June, we’ll do a final review
before the modules go into the system. So, Madam Chair, that’s the end
of my planned remarks. I’ll be happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Dr. Gardland. I’m sorry we put you on a schedule. We have to
be over, but our vice chair is going to take over and take the
questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Luebke is recognized for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. Dr. Gardland, I’m concerned about the Bill of
Rights Institute as being your resource or being your collaboration
partner. It was drawn to my attention that the Bill of Rights Institute
has a somewhat limited view of the Bill of Rights. I went on the website
last night, and I can tell you that particularly in the area of civil
rights and racial equality it’s absolutely true. It’s a very deficient
website and from that I presume the curriculum is deficient. My first
question is, I’m very concerned that this institute has been selected,
and it sounds like it is the source, and as I say there is no proper
treatment of issues of racial equality and no proper treatment of racial
issues at the US Supreme Court, racial equality, segregation, on the
website of this institute. My first question is, who made the decision
to go to this institute, because it seems, as I said, very problematic.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’ve been using resources from the Bill of Rights Institute for several
years. Our social studies…</p>

<p id="50:00">
Consultants have used their resources in the past. So they were very
familiar with the bill of rights institute. The bill of rights institute
is not the only entity that we use in order to get resources, and we
will have to approve any resources before they go into our instructional
improvement system. Our teachers will have to sign off that the content
is in there. School systems across the state have access to the web.
They can certainly find any resources that are out there, and they do.
That's why I said we do not have a required curriculum. What we are
planning to do with the bill of rights institute is have ten digital
units that represent the ten bill of rights. Now obviously, there are
all kinds of activities that could be included to demonstrate each of
the ten, so whatever goes into our instructional improvement system will
have to pass and be validated by folks at the department of public
instruction, which will include teachers in social studies, experts
across the state. So I can't say that the bill of rights institute does
everything in a way that we would agree to, but in terms of their
working with those ten bill of rights, then it would have to pass muster
with the department as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, mister chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I am very concerned by the way that, in this bill, in its institute, on
its website, issues of racial equality for the united states supreme
court are treated. Very concerned. There is for example, mention of
Brown vs. Topeka School Board, but there is no mention of Swain vs
Mecklenburg which is the case which desegregated schools across the
South. Argued, by the way, by two heroic attorneys from Charlotte,
Julius Chambers and James Ferguson. That's not in their recommended
cases, of their four cases. One of them is Plessy versus Ferguson, which
actually upheld segregation. One is Brown, one is the Bakke Decision
which tried to work back to, roll back affirmative action, and the
fourth one is Ballinger in Michigan, which also rolled back affirmative
action. Now, you put those on there and you don't put Swain vs
Mecklenburg, how is the average teacher, social studies teacher,
supposed to know about these cases? And I mean, it's just a totally
biased selection, and it's one which is very undermining of the struggle
for racial equality before this US Supreme Court. So, I mean, I'll stop
there, but I really think you need to reexamine what they've got, and
for you to say, ma'am, well, there's lots of resources teachers can to
look at, but you've got a contract with the bill of rights institute, so
I think it's very problematic. And I'd like to take another look and
meet maybe with  you and Dr. ?? et cetera to reexamine this. I think
this is a big mistake for the children and young people of our state to
get such a treatment of issues of racial equality. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Representative Charles Graham, I believe you had a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chair. Dr. Carlin, thank you for being here. I had a
question as it relates to civics. That number's 4052, I think, as far as
the course offering. It's considered, it's an economics, is that a
civics and economics taught, is that a semester class or a year class?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is a full year class, but it may be taught in a semester. We have
about 90% of our schools in this state that are on what is called a
block schedule and in a block schedule, students take four courses a
semester rather than the six or seven that I used to take when I was in
school. So each of those courses represents a full year of study. So the
American History I course is a full year of study even though it may be
taught in a semester. The classes are 90 minutes long and the civics and
economics course is also 90 minutes long, and it would be a full course
of study even though it may be taught in a semester. Some of our schools
are still on a traditional calendar, and if they are, then they will
teach their classes throughout the whole year. But their classes are
usually around 50, 45 minutes or 50 minutes in length.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Follow up mister chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One of the concerns I have and this is a personal concern. And I don't
know if our educational system can have any, a greater impact on what
I'm getting ready to say, but in terms of our children's civic
responsibility and civic duty and actual caring about being a good
citizen and conducting themselves in a civic way, what, what do they get
out of a civics course that will</p>

Promote citizenship. Promote being civic minded. Promote being a
law-abiding citizen. Are there standards in there that addresses those
issues? Because I'm really concerned about our students' lack of civic
mindedness. What are you doing in the educational system, particularly
this course, to encourage that?[SPEAKER CHANGES]I don't have the
standards for Civics in front of me. But I do know that it is about the
political system and how the political system works. But Civics is not
the only course where we teach civic mindedness. That's the reason why,
the way that our Social Studies standards are designed, it starts at the
local community. Because typically, if you can get people interested in
what happens locally in their community, then you can encourage them to
be better citizens. And citizenship is a part of our Character Education
that's also required in North Carolina statutes that we teach. The whole
notion of civic participation is found throughout the Social Studies
curriculum. Civics is where the components of the Government as they
work today, the court system, the three levels of government, all of
that is actually taught specifically in Civics. But it is certainly not
the only place where we teach citizenship.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Chair
recognizes Representative Malone.[SPEAKER CHANGES]It's working today.
Thank you. First, just a comment based on what I just heard. My personal
thoughts on this is that Civics is absolutely imperative to be taught
and I certainly encourage it. But I don't know whether or not it should
be taught within a History class but maybe as a companion to a History
class. But it's just a thought. Watching your presentation, listening to
you speak, and thank you very much for a great job. I'm not really a fan
of Common Core, but I understand what we're trying to do, and I
understand why. When I was listening to you, a thought came to my mind.
We all understand, and we've heard many, many different stories of kids
not knowing where India was or not being able to place somewhere on a
map. Limited learning. And we also understand that we have literacy
issues. Both these these are very important that we be able to work out.
How are we addressing the literacy issue within the context of a History
class. Would that not better be served in an English remedial class or
something like this? I'm wondering what we're teaching them, and are
they still able to get the full content of American History while at the
same time we're trying to make sure that they understand the English
language?[SPEAKER CHANGES]Two things. First, I don't think I was clear.
We have a Civics class that's a stand alone class. So yes, they do have
two classes in American History, and Civics is a third class that they
take. So yes, Civics is a stand alone class. In terms of literacy, what
we have found is that in our English classes, our teachers tend to focus
on literature in terms of texts for reading. So our students are pretty
well skilled at being able to read a novel where there is a story, or
being able to interpret a poem. What we have found is that when it comes
to reading historical documents such as the Declaration of Independence
or the Constitution, our English teachers don't focus in that type of
reading. It's a different skill set to read for information than it is
to read for enjoyment or it is to read to figure out who the main
character is in a novel. The literacy that is focused on in Social
Studies is for students to learn how to read informational text in
Social Studies itself. Because you read Social Studies differently than
you read Science. And you read Science differently than you read a
mechanical manual. It's teaching them literacy skills within the content
of Social Studies. So it's not teaching students how to read in that
class, it's teaching them how to read Social Studies documents. And our
Social Studies teachers would have the best skills to be able to do
that, because they obviously have had to read and interpret those
documents in order to earn their degree in that area. But we have
ignored that for many years in the past.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you.
