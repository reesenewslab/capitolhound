[speaker change]

Let’s pray y’all. This is a prayer that was actually spoken by rev Jacob Douche at the first session of the continental congress on September 7, 1774. Join your hearts with mine in prayer. Be thou present, oh God of wisdom and direct the councils of this honorable assembly. Enable them to settle all things on the best and surest foundations. That the scene of blood may be speedily closed. That order, harmony and peace may be restored. And truth and justice and religion and piety prevail and flourish among the people. Preserve the health of their bodies and the vigor of their mind. Shower down on them and the millions they here represent. Such temporal blessings as thou seeth expedient for them in this world. And crown them with everlasting glory in the world to come. All this we ask in the name and through the merits of jesus christ our son and our savior amen. 

ALL
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
