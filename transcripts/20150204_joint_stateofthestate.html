  To the great people, to the great state of North Carolina. You know it
was just two years ago right before I walked through these beautiful
gold doors, that my Chief of Staff Thomas Stiff handed me the phone, and
it wasn&#39;t good news. I just received a phone call informing me that
Highway Patrol Trooper Michael Potts was fighting for his life. You see,
during a routine traffic stop, on highway 70, Trooper Potts was shot
four times. He was shot in the hands, shot in the shoulder, and he was
shot point-blank directly into his face. He was left for dead by the
assailant. He was left for dead on the side of the road. After the
State-of-the-State speech, I immediately traveled to Duke University
Medical Center to visit Trooper Potts, to check on his condition, to see
his family, and to see the literally hundreds of fellow troopers who had
gathered outside the hospital, out in the hallway and some at his
bedside praying for him. The terror that evening was only the first day
of suffering Trooper Potts and his family would endure. I might add
Trooper Potts saved a lot of lives by pulling this person over. Since
the shooting, there have been surgeries, grueling rehabilitation
therapy, and also personal reassessment. Some advised Trooper Potts to
turn in his badge and to pursue a safer line of work. But Trooper Potts,
he had a passion to be a trooper, and to work for people and the state
of North Carolina, and he wasn&#39;t going to walk away from his job.
Instead, he and his family worked together to overcome his obstacles,
heal his wounds, and today he is reassigned to the North Carolina
Highway Patrol Training Academy. Ladies and gentlemen, join me in
welcoming, North Carolina Highway Patrol Trooper Michael Potts. And his
wife Laura.
Michael. Trooper Potts, I got a little emotional there, because I
consider you a friend. You&#39;ve become a friend. And your family&#39;s
incredible. We&#39;ve eaten dinner together at the mansion, and
we&#39;ve thrown baseball together at a ball game. In fact, several
months ago we played &#39;catch&#39;, on the capital grounds together.
Most people don&#39;t know this, but before Michael became a trooper he
was a major league baseball pitcher for the Milwaukee Brewers. And he
played in the major leagues. And so, to be able to throw a ball with a
guy that I saw hanging on to his life, and be able to throw a ball with
him a year and a half later outside the capital building was an
incredible thrill for me. And believe me, he&#39;s got a good arm too.
Trooper Potts still carries bullet fragments in his skull, as he&#39;s
with us today. But instead of being defined by his injuries, and
he&#39;s made a point to tell me this, he&#39;s made a point to tell me
this, instead of being defined by his injuries, he&#39;s conquered them.
And he&#39;s come back even stronger. And ladies and gentlemen, like
Trooper Potts, I&#39;m proud to report that the state of North Carolina
has come back even stronger today as I speak right here. North Carolina
is strong, and its going to even stronger. It&#39;s people are
resilient, and our future is bright. Because of many people in this room
and because of the resilience of people in North Carolina, our
unemployment rate, which was the fifth highest in the nation two years
ago has dropped substantially. It&#39;s the second sharpest drop in the
United States in America. Right here in North Carolina. Our economy is
improving, cranes are returning to many skylines, and real estate  . . .

  Is finally getting back on its feet. And yes, the ‘Made in North
Carolina’ brand is returning in our factories throughout North Carolina.
Manufacturing is coming back. Along the way our administration like many
of you took swift action in response to other serious crisis that hit us
during this past two years, from an Ebola scare to the Dan river spill
to this year’s very serious?? of a flu virus which is hitting my wife at
this time. We’ve also had to respond to extreme weather events
throughout North Carolina. Heavy rains and flooding in western North
Carolina, a series of ice-storms covering the whole state, hurricane
Arthur hit the outer banks bringing flooding and knocking out the power
to thousands of people. Nine tornadoes devastated parts of eastern North
Carolina. In fact while visiting many areas damaged by theses horrific
storms during the past two years, I was moved by incredible things.
Neighbor helping neighbor and the incredible?? to response teams and
city counties and our state workers came together. No turf, courage, a
sense of helping anything we could do to help people get back on their
feet. I saw the best of North Carolina. I saw the best of state
emergency operation workers in a great team. And at one tornado damaged
area I was especially touched by the spirit of Winfall Mayor Fred Yates.
This man looked at his neighborhoods in his town and saw homes totally
destroyed. And I was in a walk through this neighborhood, I could see
first-hand with him the physical and psychological damage that the
citizens were just a blank stare going what has happened but the Mayor,
Mayor Yates continued to move forward and inspire his citizens and go
inside their homes and say, “We’re going to come back. We’re going to
rebuild.” And this is the type of a leadership that inspires me. And
Mayor Yates told me as I left this one neighborhood and says, “We’re
going to come back and we’re going to rebuild.” And they’ve done just
that. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a true leader in a crisis,
Winfall Mayor Fred Yates. Mayor that day I’ve never got a bear hug like
you gave me. And I’ll tell I saw you give bear hugs now as a governor
you gave bear hugs to your friends and neighbors and that really
rejuvenated them and I’ll just your  leadership was inspirational to all
of us. Thank you very much. It’s the same spirit of resilience that
helped North Carolina recover from our economic crisis. When I took the
oath of office in January 2013, North Carolina taxes were among the
highest in the south-east but working together, working together in
these two chambers, we passed a short tax reform that put more money in
peoples’ pay check. It was the first major overhaul of our tax system in
nearly eighty years. That is quite an accomplishment. And two years ago
because of our badly outdated unemployment insurance system, our
businesses owe the Federal government 2.5 billion dollars, 2.5 billion
dollars but drawing upon the resilience, we reformed our unemployment
system and we not only aligned our benefits with neighboring states, we
also devised a plan together to pay off our debt this year before three
years ahead of schedule. Thank you. Now in North Carolina not only do we
have a balanced budget which we’re required to do but when we have a
debt we’ve learned to cut up the credit card and we pay it off. And
that’s a lesson those in Washington also need to learn and we’re a good
role model. I want to give special thanks to a former member of the
House for

  Representatives right here. And that&#39;s Assistant Secretary of
Employment, Dale Falwell. And also, our new Secretary of Commerce, John
Scavarla, for being the driving force behind this effort. Today in North
Carolina, instead of having unemployment offices, we have career
centers. Because as Dale often reminds me, and he often reminded many of
you on this floor over the past several decades, we want people off
unemployment and into jobs. And they&#39;re doing just that, we&#39;re
proud of that work. Dale, welcome back to the House chambers. Appreciate
your work, man. I&#39;m pleased to report, because so many of us in this
room rolled up our sleeves with the goal of getting people back to work,
that as of today, the private sector has now created nearly 200,000 new
jobs in North Carolina. We went from being the fifth highest in
unemployment to the 23rd lowest in unemployment, and now we&#39;re even
beating South Carolina. You know, but that&#39;s not good enough.
He&#39;s, we accomplished a lot, but it&#39;s not good enough. Cuz you
know and I know that there are a lot of people still hurting out there.
There are a lot of communities that are still suffering. There are a lot
of small businesses that are barely hanging on. And so there&#39;s a lot
of work to do. So while we celebrate what we&#39;ve accomplished, we
need to move forward and help those people who wanna rebound, from still
economy that is suffering throughout the United States. Therefore, my
administration focus will be on five areas that have the greatest impact
on the people of North Carolina. The first area is this: we wanna ensure
everyone who wants a job can find a job in a vibrant North Carolina
economy. Second. Second, we wanna ensure that every child and adult
obtains the skills and knowledge needed to become a productive citizen.
Third, we will continue to connect North Carolina&#39;s small towns with
our state&#39;s commerce centers and vice versa, through physical and
digital highways. And fourth, improving the quality of life, we gotta
make sure we have public safety and good health care for North Carolina
families. And fifth, we&#39;re gonna continue to look for efficiencies
in our budget and improving government services. In other words,
we&#39;re gonna focus on jobs, on education, on connectivity through
infrastructure, on health care and public safety, as well as government
efficiency. That&#39;s where my work is gonna be focused on and I ask
you to join me in that effort. Now let&#39;s talk about jobs. As you
know, the fight for jobs is global. It is played at the highest level
and believe me, the competition is at our heels. In California last
year, while visiting high-tech companies and venture capital firms,
promoting North Carolina, I just happened to run into Governor John
Kasich of Ohio, and I know he wasn&#39;t there to visit the wine
country, and neither was I. Just a few weeks ago, on an economic
development trip in Europe, I know for a fact, because I got a little
intel from the taxi cab drivers, that other governors preceded me the
day before, and other governors followed me the day after, in trying to
bring businesses to their states and to America. The governors I&#39;m
competing against are good friends, and often neighbors. And like North
Carolina, they have cut taxes, invested in education, and have built new
roads. What they have that we don&#39;t have, that I don&#39;t have as
governor, is a clear and concise job creation toolbox. Therefore,
working with the leadership of the House and the Senate, we will submit,
for your approvals, a series of tools which will help us continue to
beat the competition. Beat the competition for jobs coming to North
Carolina. That&#39;s our goal. We need these tools passed.

  We need these tools passed in the matter of weeks, not months because
right now we&#39;re attempting to recruit new jobs in North Carolina.
Our plan, NCCompetes, will promote long term sustainable job growth and
capital investment. It will encourage mid and large scale manufacturing
because manufacturing is a part of North Carolina&#39;s DNA. It will
leverage our university research advantage to attract venture capital
and new generation of entrepreneurs as well as help retain North
Carolina&#39;s home-grown talent. And this plan is based upon a series
of guiding principles. Principles designed to grow North Carolina, while
also protecting our taxpayers. NCCompetes recognizes the importance of
economic strength in all of our regions but emphasizes support to areas
that still have high unemployment. NCCompetes will require strong
financial safeguards to provide a positive return to state revenues in
the long run. In addition to NCCompetes we need to pass the historic
preservation tax credit. [Speaker Change] Being a formal mayor, I
understand this more than anybody. We have got to continue to revitalize
the main streets from Wilkesboro to Greensboro to Swansboro. Secretary
Susan Kluttz, a person with unlimited passion. Former mayor Salisbury
reminds us that the vitality of our state is best reflected by the
vibrancy of our town centers. And believe me, it&#39;s a big deal when
you have a blighted building in the middle of your town center
that&#39;s showing a side of disrepair opposed to a side of economic
vitality. This is a big deal and last week I saw it first-hand, visiting
Concord, where we went to the hotel Concord where I was joined by
Senator Fletcher Hartsell and representative Linda Johnson, along with
two hundred citizens who joined us. And it reminded of success of
existing products and the potential of new projects coming along to
Concord. We need to get this bill passed. Now is not the time to pull
the plug on a strategy that has created new jobs and new invested and
revived small towns throughout North Carolina. Two years ago, when I
stood before you, I said North Carolina had to get off the sidelines
into the energy business. Senator, and ladies and gentlemen I&#39;m
pleased to report that North Carolina is off the bench and in the game
and we have a new quarterback, Secretary Don Vandabart, the head of ??
now. And to keep energy prices low, particularly in eastern North
Carolina, we&#39;re supporting the construction of a five billion dollar
natural gas pipeline that will run from West Virginia throughout eastern
North Carolina. This will have a huge impact on eastern North Carolina
by lowering the gas prices and giving more access to customers and help
me and help John Skvarla, my secretary of commerce recruit more jobs to
eastern North Carolina. Energy is a vital part of that effort. And this
year, through Don&#39;s leadership, we will begin to assess North
Carolina&#39;s energy potential. Energy potential both on land and on
shore. We are right now working with our congressional delegation to
ensure, if there are resources offshore, that North Carolina gets energy
revenue that will help pay for teachers, help pay for roads, help pay
for beach renourishment, and help pay for the dredging of our ports
which is desperately needed. That&#39;s our goal right now, to bring new
revenue and new jobs to our state and to help with our country&#39;s
energy independence. Now I&#39;m encouraging these investments, we must
not forget that small businesses are the largest job creating sector of
our economy. And we also must remember that agriculture is North
Carolina&#39;s biggest industry, contributing more than seventy eight
billion dollars a year to our economy. We must continue to look for new
ways to help our farmers who are facing increased competition from
around the world.

  …here at home. One area that continues to be a challenge to all growers
is the shortage of food processing facilities in North Carolina. Our
farmers right now have to send many of their products to other states
which substantially increase their costs. Working with our very able and
excellent agricultural commissioner to access the need and develop a
strategy for attracting more food processing plants in the state we are
going to put together a task force of farmers, business leaders, and
venture capitalists. This group will convene and recommend a strategy
and disband by March of 2016. One key to our economy which affects
agriculture and other industries is also our state ports. We have made
some great progress with refrigeration in Wilmington, but we have got
some other challenges right now at a very important state port and that
is at Morehead City. As I address you tonight, we have a very urgent
problem at the port of Morehead City. The Beaufort Channel, inlet
channel has an authorized depth of forty-five feet, but without
explanation during the past several months shifting sands have reduced
the depth to thirty-four feet, forcing many ships to enter the port
half-empty, in some cases having to split their loads between Morehead
City and another port. This has just happened. We have been working
closely with our congressional delegation and the Army Corp of
Engineers- literally been on the phone during the past several weeks
trying to come up with a solution. It is crucial to thousands of jobs in
that area and I am pleased to announce that some of our efforts have
recently paid off. The Army Corp of Engineers just added 4.1 million
dollars to this year’s dredging budget bringing the total to 8.9 million
in federal dollars dedicated to this emergency. In addition, my
administration stands ready to commit state dollars as needed in this
emergency to keep this crucial commercial artery open for business. I
especially want to thank Transportation Secretary Tony Tata and our
entire delegation for their incredible work; your phone calls to both
the Army Corp of Engineers, the contacts that you have in the Pentagon.
I also want to thank not only our congressional delegation, but also
Senator Richard Burr who has been working with me on this problem around
the clock. Please give them a round of applause and we all need to work
together; human nature is tough to deal with, but we have got to deal
with it.
Now, let’s talk about a priority of all of ours and that is education. A
key part of any jobs plan and quality of life plan is a quality
education so students can compete in a global economy. Connecting the
students to the greater world is the mission of Garinger High School
history teacher James Ford. Ford, once an Illinois teacher came to North
Carolina, chose North Carolina to continue his career and fulfill his
teaching potential. He has proved himself- not only has he recently
become North Carolina’s Teacher of the Year, but several weeks ago
Charlotte Magazine named him Person of the Year, not teacher of the
year- but person of the year. He beat out business and civic leaders.
That is the respect that teachers need in North Carolina. Ladies and
Gentleman please welcome my teacher advisory committee leader, Mr. James
Ford. This guy is absolutely incredible- you have got to hear him speak.
He spoke to the members of the Board of Governors about two weeks ago
and I had the mistake of following him. I also happened to see him at
Rite-Aid in Charlotte when I was picking up my cold medicine I ran in to
him and I said, “you got Person of the Year in Charlotte, I was mayor
there for fourteen years- I am now Governor-I have never been
nominated”. I am so proud of you. He has been a great member of the
teacher advisory group which made many recommendations that this
legislature passed. The best ideas come from the people that are
actually doing the work and James Ford is the best. I have got some good
news…

  Because of teachers like James Ford our most recent graduation rate is
the highest in North Carolina history as we speak today. Now with
continued investment in pre-K and continued reforms such as NC Works
which was an excellent program and job training in our community
college, we hope to see even a better rate of employment and graduation.
We want more people filling the skills gap in North Carolina.
Still we have to build an education system that rewards teachers like
James Ford for their results driven leadership and he is a leader. There
are a lot of leaders just like him in every school throughout North
Carolina. We all knew who they are. When you think back to your high
school years, you knew who the best teachers were. The parents knew, the
students knew, the principals knew, the superintendents knew. Everyone
knew who the good teachers were.
But I need to let you know that our goal is to make North Carolina a
teaching destination, not a layover for our state&#39;s best and
brightest. I know for a fact that teaching is extremely hard. I know it
firsthand because as a 20 year old student at [unclear 00:01:24] college
trying to earn my own teaching degree and North Carolina teaching
certification, I had to student teach at [unclear 00:01:33] High School
in Spencer. I was the young 20 year old and I said I&#39;m going to tear
this up. I&#39;m going to do great.
So Wayne Crowder, my mentor, my teacher, guide, said, &quot;You&#39;re
up tomorrow.&quot; So the whole evening before I got a lesson plan ready
for an hour, an hour of teaching. I worked the whole night with this
teaching material. Well, I started the class and after ten minutes I ran
out of material. The next 50 minutes was the longest 50 minutes of my
life as Wayne Crowder, the teacher advisor, was taking notes and the
students were just staring at me going, &quot;What is wrong with this
guy?&quot;
In other words, teaching is hard. It is hard work. We need to do
everything we can to support our teachers. So this is what I&#39;m
recommending and I know many of you will follow this lead. First of all,
we need to fulfill our promise and I&#39;d like to thank this leadership
for making this promise last year. Your leadership has been very much
appreciated.
We must fulfill our promise to raise teacher based pay to $35,000 a year
for any entry level teacher regardless of where they live and work in
North Carolina. We&#39;re going to fulfill that promise.
Thank you very much.
We have another goal that we&#39;re setting and it&#39;s a team effort.
We also must give our teachers, because they&#39;re giving us feedback
and so are students. You&#39;ve heard it, I&#39;ve heard it, and
they&#39;re right. We need to give them the gift of time and allow them
to start teaching again by testing less and letting them teach more.
Don&#39;t you agree with them?
Now this is going to be a team effort and it&#39;s already been a team
effort. My administration is finalizing a plan and working with a great
group. First of all, I want to thank state superintendent June Atkinson.
You&#39;ve been a great teammate and I really appreciate it. Lieutenant
Governor, Dan Forrest, who is right at the forefront of education
initiatives. State school board chair, Bill Kobe who has just committed
limitless hours for education. But more than anyone we&#39;re getting
the ideas on how to limit testing from our school superintendents,
principals, and teachers. They&#39;re the ones who are making the
proposals to us.
We want to distinguish which tests improve a students performance and
which tests simply waste the time of those teachers and students.
I&#39;m guaranteeing this and June, you will join me I know because
we&#39;ve just recently had another meeting on this, we want to
eliminate un-

  testing by next year. That&#39;s our goal.
And we&#39;ve got some good ideas. We also are continuing our efforts to
bring WiFi to all of our classrooms and long distance learning to both
our children and adults, and to help our schools hire the teachers they
need now. To help our schools hire the teachers that they need now, we
are moving to expedite teacher certification, recognizing an
individual&#39;s experience and subject expertise.
For example, my excellent Education Advisor Eric Guckian- Eric, please
stand up, I wanna see you. Eric, he&#39;s upstairs. Thank you, Eric.
He&#39;s come up with some great ideas. Let me tell you about how hard
it is to get a teaching certification in North Carolina. Eric Guckian,
my education advisor, taught for two years in the south of Bronx in New
York for Teachers for America, and he has a masters degree in Education
from Harvard. Now we&#39;re not going to hold that against you, but
that&#39;s pretty impressive. And yet, when he came to North Carolina he
was required to take 18 months of courses to earn his North Carolina
teaching certification. And this is why schools are going, &quot;I need
talent now, more than ever.&quot;
This bureaucratic process of certification must change. We want and
should be encouraging accomplished people who want to join the teaching
profession. The bureaucracy should never, never stand between their
talents and our children&#39;s needs. And we&#39;re going to begin that
now.
You know cost must also not become an obstacle for students at our
community colleges and universities. We must look at our community
colleges and universities to balance balance sheets, to make sure that
we&#39;re making investments in the programs and learnings that will
prepare our students for a job and for the global economy.
And we have to close North Carolina skills gaps. I was in Fayetteville
today, and I still had several employers tell me, &quot;I&#39;ve got job
openings but I cannot find the qualified people to fill these
jobs.&quot; We have to do better to beat our competition. And I&#39;m
proud to report that our community colleges and our universities are
turning in the right direction to do just that. And we need to continue
to encourage them to do just that.
And now we in North Carolina are fortunate to also have the benefits of
the best research universities in the world. It&#39;s one of our
strongest economic recruitment tools. And I&#39;m proud to say that we
are now leveraging the advantage provided by our public and our private
universities through innovation to jobs initiatives, which we just
presented to the Board of Governors several weeks ago. It is designed to
convert more of our research dollars into products and services that are
patented and introduced in the marketplace to grow jobs right here in
North Carolina. We cannot have these reports and studies up on a shelf.
We&#39;ve got to convert them into jobs, and I&#39;m working together
with the chancellors to do just that.
Increasing the commercialization of university research, and connecting
it to our greater economy will create more high paying jobs. As
governor, my goal is to have North Carolina become the third vertex of
the National Innovation Triangle. From the Silicon Valley, to Boston,
and the third part of that triangle is right here in North Carolina. And
that&#39;s going to be a recruitment tool. And what better state than
North Carolina with our incredible research universities can join that
competitive partnership and create jobs? That is our goal, working with
our universities.
I&#39;m proud to say that this top priority, and the person who is
leading this team effort with our universities is a person who is not
only a personal friend but he&#39;s a great leader here in state
government. And that is my Chief of Staff, Thomas Stith. Thomas, please
stand up. I appreciate your leadership on this effort.
I stole him from the Kenan Institute. God bless you, buddy.

  <p id="40:00">
  Now let&#39;s talk about our third focus and that&#39;s transportation
and infrastructure. I&#39;ve always told you in the past, Eisenhower is
a hero of mine, and he left us a legacy that we&#39;re still using today
throughout our country. Connecting the east with the west and rural with
urban, and we want to do the same thing right here in North Carolina.
During the past decade or so as I&#39;ve driven down the highways of
North Carolina, I&#39;ve always noticed the lanes go from two lanes to
four lanes, back to two lanes, back to eight lanes, and then back to two
lanes again, have you noticed the same thing? And everywhere the road
happened to be wider, it was always named after a politician or a DOT
board member. And where the congestion choke points occurred, where it
was two lanes, I noticed there was no politician&#39;s name at the choke
points. Well that&#39;s not the way we&#39;re doing things anymore
because of your leadership. We&#39;ve taken the politics out of road
building by putting in place a transportation formula that focuses on
relieving congestion at those choke points wherever they may occur,
improving safety and growing and connecting the economy in all parts of
our state. Connecting the economic centers with towns throughout North
Carolina and even across the borders in Tennessee, Virginia, and South
Carolina. That is our goal, to connect each other, and those changes
have allowed us to become more efficient with taxpayer dollars. In fact,
we have more than doubled the number of transportation projects that
we&#39;ve built. Under the leadership of Secretary Tony Tata , this new
approach is creating thousands of  new jobs during the next ten years.
Our twenty-five year transportation vision connects small towns to
economic centers and vice versa. These connections will make it easier
for people to travel to jobs, to travel to their schools, hospitals, and
our parks. Our twenty-five year plan also recognizes that even with our
new formula, we can only build one out of five projects right now on our
plan. And counties and cities and many of you are telling me we&#39;ve
got to speed this up more, we&#39;ve got to improve this connectivity.
Therefore I will request from you a transportation bond of $1.2 billion
that&#39;ll allow for the quicker construction of projects in the
twenty-five year vision plan. Projects funded through a revenue bond
would be the next projects in line scored under the mobility formula,
with environmental documents in place so we can begin these projects
immediately. Here are a few examples of what we can achieve with the
mobility formula, this proposed bond as part of our twenty-five year
transportation. For our coastal counties, we&#39;ll make it easier for
the military to move troops and equipment during deployments, while
helping transport goods to our ports. It will relieve congestion also
during the busy tourist season, and help improve emergency evacuation
routes. For the east, a few examples, we&#39;ll connect eastern North
Carolina to the Hampton Roads region of Virginia. Here this? The
governor of North Carolina saying we&#39;re going to connect to the
Virginia. I learned this as mayor of Charlotte because I noticed Rock
Hill, South Carolina liked to connect to North Carolina. The economic
regions don&#39;t recognize political boundaries. And one of the
greatest opportunities for parts of the East, Elizabeth City and other
areas, is to connect to parts of Virginia. I recognize economic
boundaries as much as I recognize political boundaries, and that&#39;s
the way our transportation system is now designed. In the central part
of the state we&#39;ll focus on relieving interstate congestion. An
incredible bottlenecks, and that we need to ease the flow and improve
the flow of freight along these bottlenecks in the Piedmont portion of
our state. In the west, we need to connect the mountains all the way to
the coast. From Asheville to Wilmington and unchoke those points, you
know some of them, Tim, ones in your area, around Shelby. A choke point
which hurts the commerce and job creation all the way from Asheville to
Wilmington. This is our goal is connectivity. Connectivity across the
state, east, west, north, and south. Additionally I will support your
efforts to protect and stabilize, I will support any efforts to protect
and stabilize our existing.

  existing transportation revenue streams, while also looking at funding
reform and alternatives for our future transportation and infrastructure
needs. Let me tell you another infrastructure issue that we need to turn
our attention to, and that is the inefficiency of state buildings, not
just here in Raleigh but across North Carolina. One of my first clues of
maintenance issues and inefficiency occurred when Ann and I were walking
to get sworn in at the old state capitol building on January the 5th. In
walking between the Episcopal church and the beautiful 1841 state
capitol building, I walked by these fountains that were in front of the
state capitol, and they were full of dirty water and trash and they
weren’t working. Well two weeks later as Governor, I walked by them
again and they were still full of dirty trash and water. Two weeks after
that, I walked by them again, the same condition, and so I finally said
“What is going on here? This looks terrible. It’s a terrible signal for
North Carolina,” and I was told “I don’t know. It’s been that way for
five and a half years. That’s just the way it is, Governor.” No it
isn’t. We can no longer afford this culture of neglect and apathy. We’re
going to fix things in our state. We’re going to fix our infrastructure,
including the fountains in front of the 1841 building, and those
fountains were repaired shortly after that conversation. Turns out all
they needed was a little maintenance, and now, by the way, if you go by
the beautiful capitol building, on any day you’ll see people reading a
book and kids around the water enjoying the beauty of North Carolina and
this natural flowing water in an historic building and on some beautiful
grounds. Well like those fountains, the analogy of fountains two years
ago, many of our state buildings are suffering from a lack of
maintenance, and frankly efficiency. Too many of our buildings are
obsolete, with broken HVAC units and inadequate insulation which costs
taxpayers a fortune to operate. It’s a major part of our budget – my
budget as Governor. At Dorothea Dix, for example, North Carolina
taxpayers spend approximately 8.5 million dollars a year to keep that
complex operating. Just operating cost – HVAC cost and the grounds. 8.5
million dollars a year. It’s fantastic that our capital city here in
Raleigh and working with city leaders is now gaining land for a
destination park. I’m so proud of Raleigh and us for coming together and
making a fair deal, and by the way, with this deal the maintenance cost
of the Dix complex will finally get off the state books. That’s good
news, and we’re going to have a beautiful new destination park. Even
better news is that we’ll get 52 million dollars which we’ll direct
towards supporting mental health and the wellbeing of our citizens.
That’s good news for North Carolina and good news for Raleigh, but we
have structures all over the state that are a blight to North Carolina’s
main streets. Here we’re trying to restructure private and rebuild
private buildings for the historic tax credit; well some of the
buildings that we’re having problems with are our own buildings. They
have asbestos installation issues, they have broken elevators, they have
leaky roofs, they’re inefficient, they have high utility bills, and the
utilization of some of these buildings is 30 or 40%, and yet we’re
paying as though it’s 100% capacity in these buildings in North
Carolina. The shape they’re in is an embarrassment, and we have many
buildings that taxpayers are paying for that are essentially being used
for storage – very expensive storage literally only a block or two from
here. We can do better and use that money more efficiently. Bill
Daughtridge, my Secretary of the Office of Administration, is doing an
outstanding job identifying… a former member of this House is
identifying all these properties and making a long term plan on how can
we be more efficient and which buildings should be revitalized, which
buildings should be torn down, and which buildings in which we should
build brand new buildings which are workable and efficient facilities
that will be points of pride, not only here in Raleigh but throughout
towns in North Carolina. Last sessions, I want to thank you that funds

  appropriated to gut the Albemarle building. Have any of you been in the
Albemarle building? It’s an embarrassment, inside and frankly out. It’s
replete with soiled carpets and broken tables, stained ceiling tiles,
and frankly it’s half empty, and we’re paying to deal with that whole
building while agencies are moving out, leasing space in other areas
throughout Raleigh. That’s not efficient and it’s a waste of tax
dollars, so I want to thank you for allowing us to gut that and
incorporate that into our project which we call Project Phoenix, and we
want to do that with other buildings in Raleigh and throughout the
state, so let’s do… By the way, I’m impressed with what you’ve done with
this building inside the legislative chambers. It needed help. Now let’s
do what we did here to other buildings throughout the state of North
Carolina. Our towns and the city of Raleigh deserve it, and this will
help boost employee morale, improve safety, increase productivity, and
in the long run and the short term will save taxpayer dollars. For the
two bonds, both the transportation bonds, and for Project Phoenix, this
is an excellent time right now. Interest rates are historically low and
we have the financial capacity to invest and maintain our fiscal
infrastructure. Another area of great interest to all of us, and that is
DMV. Two years ago I asked Secretary Tata – well I tasked Secretary Tata
– to make the DMV more customer-friendly. Back then, people waited in
lines for hours, only to learn often that they were in the wrong line to
begin with. Going to DMV took so long that folks had to take time off to
go get their driver’s license. Well our DOD team immediately went to
work transforming the DMV into an example of excellent customer service,
and we’re still looking at improving that throughout the state. We’re
now opening some offices on Saturday and extending hours throughout the
week. Today nine million residents are within a 30 minute drive of a DMV
office with extended hours. In other words, working people can now use
state services that they need and not have to take time away from work.
We will soon be installing self-service kiosks for renewal and/or
replacement of driver’s license or IDs. Do you hear that? We’re coming
into the 21st century. License plate agencies across the state now
accept debit and credit cards, and later this year… later this year, DMV
offices will accept debit and credit cards. You won’t have to bring the
cash or your checks. How’s that for progress in the 21st century? More
importantly – more importantly than anything, the DMV now has a culture
that treats people like customers, and that’s the way we should be
treating any citizen using any of our state’s services. Treat them as a
customer, and that’s been one of our goals, and we continue to roll out
the customer service operations that all my secretaries have been asked
to follow. Now the fourth focus is probably the most complex and most
difficult and the most in need, and that’s our focus on healthcare. Our
customer-first philosophy must also translate to healthcare, and we want
to translate into a patients-first philosophy for healthcare as well. We
hear from patients – Dr. Aldona Wos travels the state and hears from
patients that healthcare is too hard to navigate in North Carolina.
Imagine a hardworking, low income mother juggling kids, running the
household and trying to keep her family healthy. What if that mom could
rely on one visit to coordinate the care she needs? Whether it’s a
treatment for an earache for a child or an orthopedist to set a broken
ankle or a plan to keep her high blood pressure under control, our
reform plan under our Healthy North Carolina initiative was developed in
partnership – in partnership – with doctors, patients and healthcare
providers across the state, and our incredible Secretary of Health and
Human Services went out to get their

  Ideas. Not all the good ideas come here in Raleigh. The best ideas we
get from listening to the people of North Carolina, especially the
people who are delivering the services. And that&#39;s exactly what Dr.
Voss has done. She is also a medical doctor, so she understand what the
doctors and the hospitals and others are saying. She gets it. She went
throughout North Carolina communities, large and small, talking to the
people on the front lines of our health care system. This is
physician-led reform. Physician-led reform. As part of her plan also,
health care providers, including a physicians, will share in the
responsibility for reducing costs by avoiding unnecessary services. And
working to keep people healthy and out of the emergency room which is
very costly. Dr. Voss, I want to thank you for your leadership. You are
the true definition of a public servants. Y&#39;all give Dr. Voss and
Secretary Voss a round of applause. Thank you and God bless you. Our
health in North Carolina plan puts patients first and controls costs for
taxpayers, and incentivizes health care providers to coordinate care.
North Carolina&#39;s health care community has a long history of solving
problems. Let&#39;s empower them now to keep our people healthy, and
continue to make North Carolina, let me repeat this, continue to make
North Carolina an excellent place for doctors to practice medicine. In
rural and urban areas alike, and produce new discoveries for treatment.
Now last session, we came close to passing Medicaid reform. But progress
stalled on the one-yard line. Let&#39;s not take another pass this year,
let&#39;s run it up the middle and win a victory for families across
North Carolina. No interceptions. As we continue to review health care
options for the uninsured, we are exploring North Carolina-based options
that will help those who can&#39;t help themselves while also
encouraging those who can. If we bring a proposal and come up with a
proposal and determine that the proposal is best for North Carolina to
cover the uninsured, it must protect North Carolina taxpayers. And any
plan must require personal and financial responsibility for those who
would be covered. I will only recommend a North Carolina plan, not a
Washington plan, so that we can put patients first. That&#39;s my goal.
Now, another issue of critical importance to the health and safety,
especially of our young people is underage drinking and addiction.
That&#39;s why we have launched a powerful campaign called, let&#39;s
talk it out. To start the conversation to stop underage drinking. I hope
you have seen the ads. Have you seen the ads? They hit you at the heart.
They hit you at the heart about the tragedy of underage drinking. This
campaign is being led by one of our state&#39;s great leaders. And he is
passionate about dealing with this addiction, underage drinking issue.
Ladies and gentlemen, I just want to recognize one of our true leaders
in the state of North Carolina, Lt. Governor Jim Gardner, who is also
our ABC commissioner chairman. Jim Gardner, welcome, glad to have you
here. A young 81 years old! Jim Gardner has more energy than anyone in
this room. He hasn&#39;t aged a day, either but he is passionate about
this, and we&#39;re gonna continue this effort, as I promised two years
ago, to deal with the addiction issue. If we don&#39;t deal with it now,
we&#39;re gonna have to deal with it in Health and Human Services and
Mental Health. This mental health issue and addiction issue is a plague
on our state and our nation. And we&#39;re not gonna run away from it,
North Carolina. Another area of public safety that we&#39;re not gonna

  run away from is gangs in our streets, and frankly gangs in our towns,
gangs along our highways, and even gangs in our prisons. I’m working
with our Department of Public Secretary Frank Perry and our SPI Director
B.W. Collier to implement our new intelligence-based initiative designed
to prevent crime before it happens, to deal with this head on working
with our local officials and our sheriffs and our DAs. In North
Carolina, not only are we fighting drugs and gangs in our street, but we
are also fighting gangs in our prisons right now. It’s a very serious
issue that we’ve recognized as soon as we came into office. Correction
officers are fighting the most violent people in our state in our
prisons every minute of the day. Can you imagine having that job,
especially in the high security prisons? Some are living right now as we
speak under death threats, not only to them but also to their families.
Working in this environment comes at a price. On average, a North
Carolina correctional officer was assaulted every 11 hours during 2014.
We’re unveiling this secret. We’ve got to let the people know and let
you know this is a serious problem to which Frank Perry is saying
“Governor, we’re going to take some leadership on this.” Some were
sexual assaults; nearly 300 involved weapons. Weapons in our prisons.
And retention of our correctional officers is a serious challenge, and
just several weeks ago I had a call about a correctional officer who was
slashed in the face. We will be submitting specific proposals, not only
to fight gangs and drugs but to help our correctional officers, our
state employees, who may have the most difficult job in North Carolina.
The starting pay for them right now is $28,000 a year. $28,000 a year.
We have an obligation to those who risk their lives defending. We need
to help them, and we’re going to make proposals to do just that, and we
wanted to make you aware of his problem. We also have an obligation to
those who risk their lives defending our freedoms. In just two years,
our administration has launched successful veterans’ initiatives
including converting military training into college credit or
professional license, giving credit for military experience when
veterans serve as educators, creating driver’s licenses that identify
veterans, and working to support a new Veterans Life Center in Butner.
Those are just a few of the things that Ilirio Pantano has been working
on, and thank you Ilirio. General Cornell Wilson’s been a great partner
– two star general who’s also served overseas in Iraq, like Ilirio. They
are putting their energy into doing anything we can to help our military
and help our veterans, and for some veterans the transition is very,
very difficult. There’s a major movie out right now that shows that
difficulty of someone coming home, and literally we have thousands of
veterans coming home from Afghanistan and Iraq right through North
Carolina. Some of them have had problems with addition, homelessness,
getting a job, and struggling with mental illness. In 2013 we
established a veterans’ treatment court to help troubled veterans. The
two courts now have been an unqualified success. The visiting them has
moved me and visiting their graduates has moved me. Therefore working
with our judicial leaders and the Governor’s Crime Commission and other
efforts, our goal is to establish two more veteran treatment courts in
North Carolina. Our veterans deserve a second chance, and we’re going to
give it to them in North Carolina. In addition to these issues, we will
have budget and legislative recommendations, and I’m just… I’m looking
forward to working with all of you. Just in the past several months, Tim
and Phil and I have had numerous phone conversations and visits, and
we’re working together to share ideas and to chare your ideas and come
up with viable long term solutions. I’ve met with the minority leaders
of the House and Senate; we’re all a team here. We’re all working for
North Carolina, so we’re going to have other opportunities and other
recommendations, and that’s our goal.

  In addition to helping our correction officers, we want to provide
resources for Western Crime Lab. There&#39;s got to be improvement in
our crime lab situation. We&#39;re hearing this from sheriffs, police
officers, and DAs throughout North Carolina. We&#39;re going to continue
that funding that would promised. Senators, you get this done!
Also, my wife demands I say this and I believe it. We have to protect
our pets from abuse and puppy mills. I&#39;m embarrassed that North
Carolina is not giving basic food and water and shelter to our puppies.
We&#39;re going to continue to look for ideas to fight drugs and gangs,
to improve mental health, and we&#39;re going to continue our fight to
prevent addiction, just to name a few.
All of our challenges and opportunities require money and resources.
Like last session, money will be tight. My department of Revenue
Secretary Lyons Gray, almost every day he updates me on the revenue
that&#39;s coming in. We&#39;re lucky to have the talent of Lyons Gray
working for this cabinet. He&#39;s counting every dollar because much of
our spending is already obligated even before we sit down to write a new
budget, which we&#39;ll deliver within the next several weeks.
Let me just give you an example, which most people don&#39;t realize
where dollars are already tied up. State workers pensions, health care
costs for current and retired state employees alone. Those two items:
State workers pensions, which we&#39;ve got to keep strong, healthcare
costs for current and retired state employees, which many of you
receive, account for nearly 22% of our spending. Those two things alone.
We&#39;ve got to look for savings in other areas and everywhere.
Here&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do in the McCrory administration to
find continued savings in our current operations. One area where we
think there is great potential, is workers compensation claims. They
cost tax payers tens of thousands of dollars. In fact, during the past
six years, we&#39;ve spent $896 million on workers compensation claims
in North Carolina.  $896 million! That&#39;s about $150 million
annually, which would&#39;ve paid for 2% pay raises for teachers or law
enforcement officers every year.
We all want to pay legitimate claims, and give injured employees the
best medical care possible. More importantly, under the excelent
leadership of Office of State Human Resources Director Neil Alexander,
we are increasing worker safety training. Not only to reduce
workers&#39; accidents, but to prevent them in the first place.
That&#39;s our goal, to prevent any accidents in the first place and
make our workplaces safe. However, our examination during the past two
years of workers compensation estimates that 40% of worker costs are
related to abuse or outright fraud.
To take a hold of costs and get people back to work sooner, I&#39;m
signing and submitting an executive order placing the oversight of
workers compensation under the Office of State Human Resources.  One of
our first priorities will be to responsibly settle cases that are over
five years old, an action that could save taxpayers over $17 million
over the next two years, and we will launch a major effort to stop fraud
and abuse dead in its tracks so that money can be used for other state
employees and other needed services in North Carolina.
Now, many of you  are also familiar with NC GEAR efficiency program.
I&#39;m so pleased to have Lee Roberts as our new budget director.
He&#39;s doing an excellent job coming in  and his learning curve has
actually been amazing.  I&#39;m lucky to have that type of talent on my
cabinet. Based upon some of the NC GEAR findings, I will take additional
actions to streamline the operations underneath the governor&#39;s
authority. Not only because they save money in many cases, but it makes
common sense. For instance, the North Carolina zoo, the state of
aquariums, museums, and our state parks, we think need to move from the
Department of Natural Environment.

  sources to the department that actually manages attractions, and it’s
part of our mission, and it’s Cultural Resources, and that’s what we’re
going to begin to do. Over the years, the Department of Administration
has become the home for various divisions and agencies that have been
moved to Bill Daughtridge’s department. We will begin, after extensive
review, to transfer a number of these agencies from the Department of
Administrations to areas where they’re better aligned within state
government. Now one area where we found a lot of inefficiency – a lot of
inefficiency – is in information technology during the past two years.
What we have found is the piecemeal approach we’ve taken during the past
decade to information technology has had disastrous results. 74% of the
state’s IT projects have come in over budget and behind schedule during
the past decade. 74%. Who would hire anyone or a company with that type
of track record? We found that the state has 40 data setters with over
1,000 different computer systems. That’s hardly an example of
efficiency. We discovered that obvious opportunities to pool the
purchasing powers of several agencies are often bypassed. My
administration is going to insert accountability into IT operations by
proposing and working with you, as we have been on this issue for
several months… by proposing a new cabinet-level Department of
Information Technology. The IT professionals throughout the cabinet
agencies and the departments of the executive branch will report to the
new department; however, the IT specialists must remain housed near the
secretaries in these departments so they can provide quick in-house
expertise and good customer service and oversight, and I want to thank
probably one of the most important people in state government during the
last two years who has done a clear audit and review of the IT
malfunctions, and his talent is incredible, and to have this talent as a
part of our team, I just want to say thanks to Chris Estes, our Chief
Information Officer, who’s helped many departments, not just in my
purview, but many departments throughout the state of North Carolina.
You all need to give Chris Estes a round of applause. I want to thank
you very much. Stand up, Chris. He comes to me and tells me what the
problem is; I said “What did you say?” I took Fortran at Catawba
College, and we might still be using Fortran in state government right
now. Seriously, we are. I rest my case. At a time when so many
servicemen and women are coming home from Afghanistan and Iraq through
North Carolina, as I mentioned before, we must have an efficient and
well-coordinated process in place to meet the needs of active duty
personnel and veterans. These services are right now scattered across
many areas of state government with no accountability, causing delay,
frustration and sometimes poor customer service. Thanks to the marine
corps’ dedication and my Veteran Affairs Director Ilario Pantano and the
leadership of the Department of Administration Secretary Bill
Daughtridge, we have made some incredible progress. Cornell Wilson has
also been a real leader in this effort, but we are going to do more to
make this even more efficient and easier for our customers to
understand. To strengthen our veterans affairs and the office of my
military advisor, Cornell Wilson, I am proposing the creation of the
Department of Military and Veterans’ Affairs in North Carolina. This
department will be responsible for four major initiatives which are
crucial to our state. The first is coordinating all efforts to protect
and fight for the survival and growth of our existing military bases
right here in North Carolina, which are crucial also not only to our
national defense, but also to the towns and the cities in and around our
military bases. We’re going to have to do this now. Another objective of
this department will be to promote the health and safety of our
veterans, the military families, as we’ve explained some of their
challenges, and our goal also of this department is to work with the
Commerce Department to help veterans get jobs and also use veteran

  Or recruitment tool to bring new companies in North Carolina because
they have the skills to fill the jobs gaps, the skills gaps that many
industries are looking for right now. And also this individual and their
team will work with unique needs of base communities throughout our
state that have very unique infrastructure and transportation, water and
sewer needs. So we exactly know how the communities can work better with
the bases to retain that solid investment of the military in North
Carolina. We’re going to coordinate all this into one department now and
that’s going to be our recommendation to you. I’ve asked my military
fares adviser General Cornell, Cornell Wilson to spearhead this new
effort. He is already attending all of my cabinet meetings and I
consider him right now a direct report to the governor. The military
also has a special place in the heart for my wife Ann. She has hosted
numerous advance for military families at the executive mansion outside
of the cameras. She doesn’t seek the spotlight. Her knowledge of the
sacrifice made by our military families comes naturally. She was born on
a military base and her father Colonel William Flash Gordon was P47 army
pilot in World War II. Now, tonight we have in attendance some very
special people in the military. And I want to give special welcome to a
person that’s become a ?? partner of my administration until this
governor and the Lieutenant Governor. I want to give a special welcome
to Lieutenant General Joseph Anderson, Commander of the XVIII Airborne
Corps of Fort Bragg. And until December, he was deputy commanding
general in Afghanistan. And during his deployment he saw a lot of action
and his troops saw a lot of action, very, very tough action. And yet he
continued to hon our North Carolina by displaying this flag right here
over the; that once flew over our state capital, he flew it over the
Kabul International Airport where his photograph with diplomats from 48
countries that comprised the International coalition. General Anderson
the class act that he is, I just saw recently at Fort Fisher down on the
coast. He is, he cares for North Carolina, he cares for his servicemen
and women. In fact he wrote a little letter on the back of this flag,
“To Governor, thanks for the State’s great support for soldiers and
families around the world.” General Anderson brought our flag home and
he’s brought our troops home. See this flag? People are at home. Ladies
and gentlemen, please welcome General Anderson. You always look at
somebody. Thank you General. Cornell, Cornell Wilson, General Wilson I
appreciate both of you so much. You all need to give General Wilson a
round of applause. I love him. He’s doing a great job for our military.
I’m proud to have you as part of our team. As we end tonight, my vision
for North Carolina is to have the best of everything. My vision for
North Carolina is to have the best of everything. Think about it. We’ve
beautiful mountains, big city skylines and we’ve the best beaches in the
nation but it’s more than that. We must have both, big city
opportunities and small town quality of life choices. From the mountains
to the coast, we have the best of both Mayberry and metropolis right
here in North Carolina. When we unleash our resources in education,
transportation, energy and technology and commit to greater government
efficiency and affordability, our state will be second to nobody. We
will be the role model for the nation working together, not only for the
day but for future generations. To continue the momentum of success that
we’ve enjoyed during the past two years, we must continue to be
innovative while maintaining the basic values that make our state great.
We must continue to cultivate a culture, a culture that encourages
building, growing, producing and inventing things. And we’re protecting
our environment to preserve the natural beauty

  Draws visitors, and have a quality of life from around the world to our
attractions and our state park systems which will be celebrating their
100th anniversary here. As my father often said, Matt McCrory, when he
was a city councilman in Ohio in the mid 60s and later, when he was a
civic leader in Greensboro where I grew up. He said the following, we
must walk the fine line between our continued economic prosperity while
also protecting the quality of life and environment that brought us here
to North Carolina and keeps us here in North Carolina. Let me repeat
that. We must walk the fine line between continued economic prosperity
while also protecting the quality of life and environment which keep us
here and bring many people here. I have no doubt that the people of
North Carolina will continue to live up to that challenge. We are
resilient. We are strong. We are diverse. We are strategic, and we have
already proven that we can deal with about any crisis thrown our way. As
we have grown to become the ninth most populous state in the United
States of America. We&#39;re number nine in population. Let&#39;s
continue to fulfill our potential and create opportunities for all of
North Carolina. So I ask you to join me. Let us work together to achieve
the best for everyone, everywhere in North Carolina. May God continue to
bless the people of North Carolina. It&#39;s an honor to be your 74th
governor of North Carolina. This is the greatest state in the United
States of America. Thank you, and God bless each one of you.
