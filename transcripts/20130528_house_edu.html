Professional development for educators who are already serving our
children and doing a quality job everyday.As tax payers we have already
invested in north Carolina constitutionally mandated public school
systems and we are just getting to appoint where we have some methods of
countability and place .This bill unfortunately moves in the opposite
direction and provides few provision for private schools countability to
the tax payers and the students they serve it also appears that the
money can be used not only for in state private schools but also for out

?? have said that their schools can offer smaller classes and more
attention to children. Why are we not supporting these same strategies
for public schools, instead of lifting the class size limit and cutting
teacher assistance? It would also make sense to develop policies that
discourage the creation of of high-poverty schools in the first place.
North Carolina is 48th in the nation for ?? funding, and 46th for
teacher pay. Instead of diverting funds we should make a serious
investment in our public schools and give students what they need in our
schools that are constitutionally obligated to provide all students with
a sound and basic education. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Madame chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I have one more thing, I have a Dot Kearns? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Madame chair? Did the speaker identify who she represents?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] She did not, she's a private citizen. Is that correct?
Amy? ?? Private citizen? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay.
And I understand Dot Kearns is here. But our next is Joe Hass with North
Carolina Christian School Association. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Madame chair,
members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to speak in
favor of this bill. And to set the record straight, the record shows
that when parents are given a chose about the education of their
children, their children who achieve better in the current model are
state unfortunately discriminates against children who are at the bottom
of the socio-economic ladder. And they are disenfranchised from having
the opportunity to have a better educational choice only because of the
amount of money in their parent's bank account. I think it's interesting
that historically one of the largest professional groups who enrolls
children in non-public education are teachers and principals in the
public schools. I think our poor children in our state ought to be given
that same opportunity. If we're gonna be consistent, we need to oppose
all the grants that are out there. The Smart Start, the Head Start, the
Pell Grants, the GI Bill Grants, the Food Stamp grants. We don't want to
do that. But for some reason, when it comes to providing choice to our
children, there's opposition. You know, the opponents say the public
schools are not accountable, these non-public schools are not
accountable. But they are. They're more accountable. They're accountable
to their parents, they're accountable because they have to take
nationally standardized individual achievement tests. It's simply not
true that passing this bill is going to take money from public
education. This bill will save tax payers 2500 dollars per student.
It'll save tax payers by not having the expenses of paying for buildings
and buses and books and additonal teachers. I believe now is the time to
quit discriminating in our state against children because their parents
are not rich. In a recent editorial in the newspaper it said that public
schools are the best thing we do. I disagree, respectfully. I believe
children are the best thing that we do. This is not an anti-public
school bill. A pro-children, pro-family, and a pro-North Carolina bill.
I ask you. Remember the children and vote in favor of this bill. Thank
you Madame chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. I apologize to Dot
Kearns, who's next. I didn't turn my paper over. Dot is with the public
school first. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much Madame chair, and
thank you all for allowing us to be here this morning. I am a former
social worker, I have worked with many many handicapped and poor
children. I'm also a former county comissioner and school board member
in Gilford county for many years. Most of all I'm a parent of 3 and a
grandmother of 7. I have been in public schools across the state for
many years. I've asked myself repeatedly in the last days, what is
HB-944 really about? The name suggests it's about opportunity,
opportunity for whom? A few children selected each year on a first-come
first-serve or other basis. A few children given a special ?? at the
expense of the many just like them. That didn't get selected and who
will still be in the public system, made the poorer by the chance given
a few. Shouldn't the opportunities be available to all our children to
itself? Yes. And I bellieve they are. It's popular now to say that
anything not perfect is broken. Public schools are not broken. I've seen
the light in the eyes of the hundreds of children when they learn
&quot;I can read, I can read fast now. I can graduate, I never thought I
would be able to.&quot; I have seen this happen as teachers and social
workers work consistently and constantly with students to see that they
have better healthcare, and better</p>

communities.  I see every day a rising graduation rates and a lower
dropout rate. HB 944 isn't about a broken public system, and it isn't
about a lack of choice. I've seen the progress of students in dozens and
dozens of magnet schools. Elementary magnet schools. Middle schools.
College high schools on college campuses. Early college schools.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Miss Kearns, if you will just finish up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright.
So if HB 944 isn't about a lack of choice, what is it really about? It
is about using our public tax dollars. The poet said a rose is a rose is
a rose. So it is with vouchers. A voucher is still the name of the use
of public tax dollars to provide a select situation, profit, parochial,
or whatever, to  a few. John Adams, out founding father said,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. You're gonna have- it wouldn't be fair if I didn't stop you
at the same time. Thank you so much for coming in,
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, I beg you to oppose this bill in the interest of all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
and I appreciate so much the people who came back again to speak and I
apologize that we dedicated one hour to public of the 2 hour meeting
that 944 would have heard. So that will give us an hour, I plan on
voting on this at 11, that will give it a full 2 hours, and we do have a
PCS, so I believe our sponsors can come and tell you the change-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm sorry, yes.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was just ask you about arithmetic, you said we'd have a full 2 hours,
and then we voted at 11?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We had- Oh, I'm sorry. A half an hour of discussion, I said that wrong,
an hour of having the public heard, and a half an hour of debate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a quick follow up, I know you have a speaker, but only a half hour
for the committee?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well we've already heard the bill, we heard it last week and they took a
half an hour that time, so that we have an hour. You understand what I'm
saying? Okay, if you'll go ahead, 2 minutes please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For the record, the public would like to know who paid for the out of
state speakers who spoke at last week's meeting? Speakers such as
Jeannie Allen with the Center for Education Reform, a member of ??, and
Doug Tuthill with Step Up for Students, also an ALEC member. Step up for
students is also on the ALEC education task force which helped draft
this and other voucher legislation, that they directly benefit from by
receiving almost $7 million in fees this year from managing the Florida
voucher program. No wonder Daryl Allison is pushing so hard for this
legislation and donated a lot of money to many of your campaigns,
because parents for educational freedom could make a lot of money from
managing a voucher program here in North Carolina. If the public schools
are not serving our children, then it is you who has failed them.
Parents who support vouchers want small class sizes, access to pre-K, a
teacher assistant in every classroom to help struggling students,
resources for high achieving students to having enrichment programs, and
alternatives to student suspensions. We had these in the public schools
until you cut funding. House bill 944 comes directly from ALEC model
legislation and ALEC privatizers seem to be trying to buy your votes
with hefty campaign contributions. The ALEC corporate lobbyists are
foaming at the mouth to make money off the backs of our children and
taxpayers. There's no accountability taxpayers and there's no evidence
that vouchers increase student achievement. However there does appear to
be fraud at least in Milwaukee. According to Milwaukee's member Larry
Miller, they have private schools that over enroll voucher students
until after the official date to calculate enrollment. Then those
private schools kick students out but keep the voucher money. You are in
a position to help our children, not throw  them under the corporate
bus. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, and I apologize again for missing your name, Miss Lee. Again,
thank you everyone for wanting to have an input in this, and if our bill
sponsors will come forward and explain your changes in the PCS?
And because it's 5 more minutes, we'll not vote til 11:05.</p>

Madam Chairwoman, You do have a PCA before you, I think from the one
that we looked at last week, there is just one additional change which
might  be difficult to read now, but it’s requiring the annual
administration of  national standardized tests in grades 3 or higher.
Right now the non public schools, I think they  are required to take
tests in grades 3, 6 8 11 may be.  This requires annual testing for any
students receiving scholarship and that’s the only change to PCA.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you so much and  now we are open for questions.
Representative Adam.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Madam Chairwoman. I have a question and I
want to make a comment on the bill too. What’s the actual amount that
you are requesting? Initially I think saw $90 million is there a change
in the PCA?
[Speaker Changes] Well it’s not a change from the last week’s PCA. But
from the original bill that was filed yes there is a change. It’s $ 10
million for this coming fiscal year and $40 million for the following
fiscal year.
[Speaker Changes] Following [??]
[Speaker Changes]  Yes
[Speaker Changes]  So how does that impact the number of children that
you are proposing to serve, if you initially had 90 and now you have 50.
[Speaker Changes] Well in the initial year and part of this was a timing
issue given  how late in the year we are . So in the initial year about
2000 students could exercise their scholarship and the following year
another additional well about 9000 total. Assuming that the 2000 stay in
the program about an  additional  7000 students could join the program
[Speaker Changes] Madam if you could recognize at some point to comment
on the bill.
[Speaker Changes] Rep Glazier
[Speaker Changes] Madam Chair, you are just taking questions, mine are
comments
[Speaker Changes] Ok Comments
[Speaker Changes] Thank you  Comments on the bill and several points.
First there has been argument that’s been made about this bill that if
you have a voucher at the eligible income level set that this is going
to open wide opportunities for  those who are poor to access private
choices. So decided to test that theory out with actually some data. And
we contacted over the past week 24 private schools in the state and 8
counties and vast majority of them are religious based. Because those
tend to have slightly lower tuition than some of the richer private
schools. And if you combines those, this voucher  would mean that
someone who gets the voucher going to an elementary school would still
have to come up on an average $5,869 for that year middle school $7150
per year and high school $8457. So to say that this is going to create
access for the poor in any of the school as an economic matter is simply
not correct at least in this state and this is based on schools in 8
counties that occupied the share of the specific data. Second, this idea
that even if they got a voucher and then got assistance form the school
and most of these schools have assistance. But if you look at their
assistance in scholarship form, they are to say least substantial. And a
lot of people would not be filling out those forms. And if you looked at
and configured out why, but even if they were, the difference is  the
private schools get to choose. They get to turn away VSL kids.  They get
to turn away the economic kid who has a discipline problem. They get to
turn away the turn away the health care concerns that they cannot meet.
So the only poor kids that are going to get access under this at all are
the parents are the ones whose parents are substantially involved and
who have a good academic record  who are not at risk, particular not at
risk during the first year of the program. And what it’s going to leave
the public school with then are even a higher percentage of at risk ESL
kids  exceptional kids, kids with discipline problems and jake up the
cost of education in those class rooms. This bill in my view has all the
problems vouchers have. It will weaken public education. It will
undermine opportunity for the vast majority. It is a waste of tax
payers’ dollars at a time when we have extremely financial limitations.
Most importantly it promotes a divided North Carolina. I may conclude my
comments with what I always believe and that is the public education is
the one institution in this country that bonds our people together as
one nation under one flag with a common set of values and if we divide
that in to hundreds and hundreds of private schools, we are doing
incredible damage to the fabric of public education.</p>

and that would make it more directly accessible to the public by
requiring them to provide it to the public directly upon request rather
than going around through the authority.
[speaker changes]
Do the bill's sponsors have any remarks?
[speaker changes]
Conceptually, we don't have any problem with it but the language right
now, as it is, is a little broader. We'd like to work with the
representative on tweaking the language.
[speaker changes]
Is anybody else want to speak on the amendment? Representative Elmore.
[speaker changes]
In reference to the amendment, this morning in ?? appropriations, the
senate budget is making an effort that the school systems budgets be
posted online and made more publicly. This amendment seems to put this
more in line with that policy decision with the public schools and I
just wanted to make that comment.
[speaker changes]
And again, we conceptually have no issues with this amendment. I just
think it's a little ambiguous of how that will be administered, how that
data will be applied, so I would just like to work with the bill's
sponsor, the amendments sponsor, to be able to tweak the language to
ensure that we have good reference of language.
[speaker changes]
Representative Collins
[speaker changes]
I was just gonna say the same thing. Why do you meet the requirement
here? Do you have to put it in a local newspaper? Can you put it on your
website? What's considered public notice?
[speaker changes]
Representative Iler.
[speaker changes]
That was my same concern. Thank you.
[speaker changes]
Well, the amendment is properly before us. All those in favor of
Representative Gill's amendment will say yes. All those opposed no. The
amendment fails. Representative Ross.
[speaker changes]
Thank you, Madame Chair. I don't know whether this is a question for the
bill's sponsors or for staff, but I just want to talk about what schools
this would apply to because we've heard from private schools and we've
heard from some christian schools, but I assume that there can be no
discrimination and that this will also apply to muslim schools. Is that
correct? I'm asking this question because I had a muslim school in my
district that's interested in vouchers, so I want to make sure that it
would apply to them as well.
[speaker changes]
Please let them know that they are just as eligible as anybody else.
[speaker changes]
Thank you and Madame Chair, may I just ask another question?
[speaker changes]
Certainly.
[speaker changes]
I understand that this bill is going to appropriations and that there
have been some claims about it saving the taxpayers money in the end.
When the appropriations committee looks at it, cause I serve on finance
so I won't have that opportunity, I think it would be important for us
to know how many children would actually have to leave the public
schools to have those savings. Because, if you just have one student
leave a classroom, you still have to have the teacher there. If you
still won't have to turn the heat down because one student leaves and so
I think that there's a big difference between a fixed cost and an
incremental cost and several of the speakers have talked about how this
is going to save so much money but I think it's really really important
to look at it in terms of how many kids would leave each school and if
it's really one or two, excuse me, if it's only one or two, I don't see
where that cost is gonna come in and I think to have an appropriate
fiscal note, we need to look at that and so I just put that request in
since it's going to appropriations  .
[speaker changes]
Would the bill's sponsor like to?
[speaker changes]
Sure. Sure. Representative Ross, I appreciate the comment. That's
obviously something that everybody is concerned about, the sort of
collective impact, but I would say that they've done studies in all of
the places where they have similar programs and they have saved money
and there are a lot of variables to consider when doing that. I would
say in urban areas, which is where they tend to be exercised more often,
these type scholarships when you have, especially in counties like Wake
and Mecklenburg which tend to have a high level of growth, it's actually
just, when you lessen - if you take 500 students out for a scholarship
and the growth was gonna be 5,000, you just have 4500 less students
which there's variables like school building and things like that. All
of that to say, we do have an initial fiscal note. We, as the bills
sponsors, still have been working on things, but that initial fiscal
note does show cost savings but that will be before appropriations. I'll
be glad to get you a copy of it.
[speaker changes]
Representative Michaux
[speaker changes]
Just a comment, Madame Chair.
[speaker changes]
Certainly.

I noticed that the information given us is from local school systems
like Milwaukee, Miami, Cleveland.  I haven't heard any data given us
from any statewide systems where this has been in affect, that's number
one.  Number two is what happens to those kids who are in impoverished
communities who do not have access to this education that you are
talking about that they are supposed to have access to.  I'm talking
about counties like Warren County and other counties where you don't
have the private schools that this would apply to.  How do we provide
for the education for those kids if you're gonna be taking money away
from the public schools on that.  Then the third thing is that we know
the private schools cherry pick. So, I don't care which color you are or
what has happened in your life, that private school is gonna cherry pick
their students.  I happen to see an add in a newspaper this weekend
congratulating the graduates of a particular private school and they had
pictures of all the graduates in there.  Out of the 90 some odd
graduates there were only three that could be identified as being of a
minority hue.  The last thing is why would you not put a diversity
clause into this legislation that would guarantee that you would somehow
approximate the number of students in public education.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Whitmire.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you Madam Chair.  I would like to speak on the
bill and then ask a question at the end.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  In my district which includes three counties, people
have lots of great choices and let me emphasis the system that serves
over 87% of the kids in this state is traditional public education.
Transylvania County, both high schools, all high schools over a 90%
academic ?? scores just last year.  The list of accolades go on and on
with graduation rates and so on.  Henderson County ninth overall in the
ACT, but yet 92nd least in 80 in funding.  Transylvania County is not
far behind that that.  Polk County, three out of four  of the elementary
schools were not just honor schools of excellence, but national blue
ribbon schools of excellence.  In the last five years their overall
graduation rate has been north of 89%.  That's three counties, three
rural counties, that when you continually take away, take away, take
away, folks no matter what their political dominion is their kids end up
taking it in the shorts.  An an example, we cut our athletic budget two
years ago when I was a school board chairman.  Oh by the way we're the
most fiscally effective school system in the state is the NVIDPI.  We
had to cut it 50%.  My little girl was wearing a basketball uniform that
was 11 years old.  Now that may sound like a sob story, but my point is
folks there are some great choices.  I can't necessarily help if some
areas have some major issues, but I have to speak up for my district in
my area where this bill robs Peter to pay Paul.  In the end I have great
issues with the transparency of accountability.  In terms, the
limitations of the reportability of testing.  The criminal background
checks are probably OK, but then again what's good for one
classification is good for the other.  Only one at the highest level, I
don't think that makes sense.  In the end the money just doesn't add up.
 I look at what we have in terms of private school opportunities in this
area where I live.  We've got a couple of private schools that K8 is
about 14,000 a year, nine through graduation is 19,000.  When I look a
those that are affordable that this 4200 would work for, their capacity
is extremely limited with not much chances of increasing.  I spoke with
one individual who runs a great school and again it's a great choice.
It's a Christian school.  Their maximum increase that they could expect
is five students.  I only have two of those in one county, one in
another.  I may have missed one or two, but the capacity that would help
is very limited.  So when it's all said and done Madam Chair my question
is this, as a freshman there are a lot of things during budget that
probably could go right passed us.  Is this bill going to be a stand
alone that goes on to appropriations, then on to an individual house
vote or is it possibly gonna get embedded in the budget with no further
hearing?  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Either one of those are possible.</p>

Thankyou mam. Mam is the house this is a very simple mam can i hope the

creating educational environments there it enable it starts learn as if
this bill is place with us can happen. Infinitely i don’t hope it linet
as it is ?? an power who all that teaches on that state. So ready list
shows clever point that better change about the world at this additional
which seems them we already have education environments in our state in
an enably change the world and budgets with the bill iam putting dish no

we really came and really trouble soming makin this ?? the bill how it
to be paid and how this ?? to be paid if someone saying this going for a
one crorer of the year and haven’t ?? to go the core. I was seeing
anything the bill will takes  a bag in his tution from the professor
brain turn out from the point what the bill says lets go on money for
the students . these lessons are true from the website these go says
you pay 100% on the tour and you leave 10% ther on the ?? and this is .
but the real point the most important point i think before us is the
issue of separation of fusion state if you look at this bill carefully
you maynotice the line of the ??  the bill is does not require still
goes credited by sacks which is the standard of these ?? crosses out
these places for universe seasons who are credited there. they are not
in this bill now. And one of the place you go to is the mutual sounding
organisation which i cabable now.  And when you drill there there are
organisation you find there Christian accreditation association and in
the criteria for accreditation is how well Christian teachings come
across to the students .also in acrediation work is where further the
school has teachers are  possibly the jesus Christ.  Now are you stop
there discover examples also the summaries go the Christians can
catholic ?? tution for those children and ?? to be and i do the course
from the website  for the Christian are catholic. Now what iam saying is
this may u.s supreme court must had giving a compensation of the us
supreme court. The fact that them is i do not to have ?? you cant
support the bill i should flavourly give you?? have spend money to
schools as they machine to teach one and another denomination with the
in the Christian faith and actually wont say i didn’t see respect to

...decision. My question is, I think this is wrong, I think it needs to
come out of the bill. The whole, any kind of funding for Christian
schools, whose website indicates that Christianity, or Islam, is part of
the teaching mission, and I just wonder if Representative Brian or one
of the other sponsors will defend the lack of separation between church
and state. Thank you.
Chair: I do want to remind you, we have a couple more people who want to
speak, and we are going to vote at five after.
Did you want to respond, bill sponsors?
Representative: I would like to respond, madam.
Sure, this is about parent selecting schools for their kids. So
ultimately we're not deciding, we're not giving money to a particular
school, a parent is giving money to a particular school. It's perfectly
constitutional. I heard you give it to pre-school and to colleges. I
assume you would not like us to stop supporting these pre-k's or these
private universities that we support, through the GI bill and others.
[Inaudible objection. A gentleman continues to interject out of range of
the microphone.]
I might disagree, and I think the majority of us here disagree.
Chair: Representative Fisher.
Representative Fisher: Thank you, Madam Chair.
I have a few things I want to say, and I will try not to take up the
whole time that we have left, but I have a lot on my mind here.
Chair: You'll have to explain that to [mentions four representatives].
Representative Fisher: [laughs] I wonder if the bill sponsors have made
sure that the nonpublic schools will not charge more than the amount of
the vouchers, and the reason I ask that question is because in Wake
County, private school tuitions alone, at St. David's, it's $39,650 a
year; after vouchers it would be only $34,450 a year. Cary Academy, it's
$17,750 a year; after vouchers it would be only $13,500 a year. Cardinal
Gibbons, if you are not a Catholic, it's $13,380 a year; after vouchers
it would be $9,180. If you are a Catholic, it's $9,475; after vouchers
it's $5,275. Ravenscroft currently charges $20,335, but after vouchers
you could get in for $16,135.
I have to say that this is a ridiculous use of taxpayer money. I am
proud that our schools were one of the only system of schools in the
country that did not close during the Great Depression. We go back that
far and farther. And here we are in the Great Recession getting ready to
ultimately shut down public schools.
Is this where we really want to go? I ask you to vote against this bill;
thank you.
Chair: Representative Jones.
Representative Jones: Thank you, Madam Chairman, I appreciate the
opportunity, and I would like to just note for the record that it seems
like that so far the committee time has pretty much been monopolized by
the opponents of the bill, so I hope the Chair will be gracious.
I'd like to make just a few comments in support of this bill. i really
think it comes down, at the end of the day, to whether you think House
Bill 944 is a good bill or a bad bill is how you answer this
philosophical question, and that is, whose decision should it be? Who
should have the authority? Who is responsible for these children?
We hear a lot of red herring debates, every time any bill comes forward
that has any aspect of parental choice. And I would just suggest that
just because you would support such a bill as House Bill 944 would not
be, as the opponents would make it seem, that you are against public
education. That to me is an incredible thought, and it basically means
that if you shop for your groceries at Food Lion, that somehow you are
conceding that Harris Teeter is broken, or that Harris Teeter is bad,
and that is simply not the case. And once you get to Food Lion and you
decide you want to purchase your gallon of milk, that just because you
purchase 2% milk means that there's something wrong with whole milk or
1% milk, or chocolate milk, or fat-free milk, or all the milks out there
now that aren't even milk. [laughter]
So I would just suggest...</p>

Let this slip this is a sample build a sense that you can get the money
earlier any campaign back with your other three allotments to come out
in the above offense is that the charter schools to pay by billions in
three different departments and sell this is almost like a tall and
sensitivity about 220-5000 dollars and if you take that continue with
this kid has come out of your other three are missing from a viewer
calls absolutely no money to state the slowest official note this is the
name of the clicker so you can actually start operating quicker the
falcons feels about . (SPEAKER CHANGES)  The reviews and later thank you
very much, Mr. Sharon bacon members, would that have some concern that
the bill but I think I am an amendment that would answer my concern
allow me to go for the bill and the amendment that deals with some have
actually work simply will Rogers chat about the need to get a $25,000 up
front but if the charter as we know tours of condos belly up and so
there are many more payments that we get the 25,000 that this simply
says the good guy that little risk is on the was on the on the charter
should be on the taxpayer that if they don't have any money to pay back
the Golan belly of the day that the board as a person be liable for the
$25,000 in repair the amount because if you go door to do this for
charters and we all of their own be some acceptance of responsibility
and so this just as if  you go belly up, it is no more money to pay back
now we get kids back and doing about that we do that, but we ought to be
able to get a $25,000 back in the role of being accepted some
responsibility and which happens in other corporate affairs and so I
would ask adoption of human further discussion and debate on him and I
would like to say that this publication of the bill are happy that this
would not be a problem we don't have a problem with him about the fact
that dictates that the people are controlled with realignment of soul
you automatically have to pay for the $5000 to go belly up to not until
after logging which is to take the law. (SPEAKER CHANGES)  But it didn't
find that they pay the price back self-employed by the lapels and open

on if you are a lot of simply home mouse and the procedures USA cartel

if the church were soon be incorporated mean that money often church
will be partially loud so the market conflict between an idea in which a

completely subtle public policy that you were operating under, but this
simply says those members aboard virtues of nonprofit corporation that
if you are partly to have the money otherwise you taken the taxpayer
money irresponsible to pay practices and quite as represent Brennan says
because you're not assuming that that goes belly up between the number
one and number two or two and three whenever we have today and you've
got this initial $25,000 , to store can now use school goes belly up and
there isn't any mother money of one race you have to go do this in
taking the taxpayer money is the person should be out the rest is the
taxpayers so this is overwriting any other obligation you have an
obligation for callback the lack of a better way of saying a  pullback

have many other taxpayer money we can develop fatal blow to their
obligation to do all of the new chairman greenspan on the our public

<p id="095:00">
that there was no fiscal note required for this bill, and I wanna make
that completely clear, that there's no fiscal note required, because it
is not. The reason why we have to do a different appropriation is
because of the timing of the money. But it actually doesn't cost us any
more money to do it. It's because we're gonna get it before fiscal
year's up. But, like, that's what I was explained by staff. So, but,
like, we didn't have to have a fiscal note because everybody pays the
money back. And, and they actually, there is no, there is no way that
the money not get there because you get three allotments, and in those
three allotments it just, it's just, look at it like a draw versus
commission type thing. And, and, if you have, if you get $24,000
advance, then three times out of your three allotments, we're take
$8,000 out to make sure that we pay the 24,000 [that's what this
is?].[crosstalk]
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brandon, we starting to get into
appropriations and not policy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But I see that [Mr. Nordstrum?] has a follow-up
comment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Uh, sure, Chris Nordstrum, fiscal research. Just to
clarify, uh, there was no fiscal note required on the bill because there
are no fiscal notes required on any bills other than those dealing with
retirement system, there would be a fiscal impact related to this bill
of the amount appropriated in section three $1, 575,000, which would be
an impact for increased expenditures from the general fund.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Adams.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] A question to Representative Brandon, you mentioned,
uh, that this bill came about as a result of a school, a charter school
in Guilford County, what school are you referring to, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The one that I serve as a board of the Point
Leadership Academy, where we start early and we start strong.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Where, where is the school?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The school is in High Point, North Carolina.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All right, we're going to take two more questions and
then we're gonna vote. Representative Warren.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Question for Representative Brandon, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Go ahead.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brandon, I wanna make sure I
understand, you're saying that the $25,000 is basically secured by
virtue of being able to be payed out out of three future allotments to
the charter school. I, I'm not the brightest bulb on the tree, but it
seems to me like you're saying we're gonna pay Peter from Peter. Uh, I
don't see where that's secured, [Ed?]. Again, I may be not looking at it
correctly, but if you go belly up, you don't have those allotments
coming anymore, correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] They, you get, as, once you get a charter,
Representative Warren, you have x amount of students, right? So you
automatically have that money coming for the entire year. That's why
it's really no risk at all. If I have 50 students and I'm going to get
$8,000 per the, per student, I'm gonna get the money for that, and this
just says that I can get the money quicker. Because, what's happening
now, charter schools are getting their money in August or September and
they have to open the door. So if you care about kids, regardless of
your, if you feel about charter schools, but if you care about kids and
you wanna make sure that the charter schools that are open have adequate
funding to make sure that they can take care of those kids when they get
there, then you will vote for this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Brief follow up. Yes. I just wanna say, speaking about
the bill, I, I support charter schools and I supported very strongly the
removal of the cap on charter schools, but I believe charter schools
shouldn't start or apply for a charter until they're financially viable
and able to start up on their own. I uh, I think there's a lot of, to me
it's just like starting a business, if you're under-funded you shouldn't
be applying for it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Wilkins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, I can respond to Representative Elmore's
question if you would like.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Please. Briefly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That business plan first goes to the charter school
advisory committee which makes its presentation to the state board.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I thank you very much. Representative Jones, you're
recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I move for a favorable report
to propose Committee Substitute for House Bill 291, unfavorable to the
original, as amended.  Unfavorable to the original with a referral to
appropriations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You've heard the motion, all those in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All those opposed, no.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Division.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All those in favor raise your hands. All those opposed
raise your hands. The no's have it, the bill is defeated. And the
meeting is adjourned.</p>
