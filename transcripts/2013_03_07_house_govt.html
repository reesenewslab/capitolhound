<p id="00:00">
Good morning, welcome to the House Committee on Government. I’d like to
introduce the Sergeant in Arms Young Bay, Martha Gadison, Carl Marello
and Berry Moore, thank you for helping today. Introduction of pages,
Madison Williams from Randolph County, here with Representative Hurley,
Gabrielle Johnson from Johnston County, Representative Daughtry,
Benjamin Howell from Cumberland County sponsored by Representative
Glazier. We have 2 Bills on the calendar today, Senate Bill 95 and House
Bill 140. Do we have someone here today to present Senate Bill 95? You
have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Ladies and Gentlemen, Senate Bill 95 is a parallel
Bill to the one I introduced in the House, House Bill 104. I told
someone this morning it’s a real simple Bill and they backed me off and
said, “No nothing is a simple Bill,” but this is really a simple Bill,
all it does, it’s a local Bill for Taber City and what they requested
was that they have one member that has been elected to County
Commissioner Board and they had to replace that member and to resolve
the confusion in the election in the fall. They simply asked, instead
having people to file for the partial term that was left, they’re going
to file all 3. They have 2 open seats, which is normal in a cycle in a
Municipal Election there’s 2 open seats, plus they have to replace the
person that was elected to County Commissioners Board. So, they want to
allow the people to sign up for those positions, without having to worry
about whether they were signing for the partial position or the 2 full
terms, and they way that will play out is, the top 2 vote getters will
get the full term positions and the 3rd place vote getter would get the
remaining term position. Like I said, pretty simple, and it does expire
at the end of the year, so there is nothing carried forward on that. I
would encourage you to support this Bill and if you any questions, I
will be glad, within in my capacity to answer them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Wilkins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Forward motion, that the time being [inappropriate]
Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lubke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Certainly I support this Bill from my good friend but
I also have a lot of interest in election policy, actually studied it. I
guess what I’m what I’m trying to figure out, has there been a vacancy
or is there a vacancy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] There was a vacancy that they filled by act of the
Council but it will only last until the next official election cycle
which would be this November. So, that person they appointed would have
to run for that seat and they may or may not want to run for the seat, I
don’t know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. Would normally the vacancy having been
filled, would the person be on the council to 2015?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] They would still have to go back and still have to . .
.  I think general statue allows for next General Election and then they
have to stand for election.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One more please sir and really this is for staff, or
you may know sir. Is this a section 5 issue? So, that in order to
approve it has to be sent over to the Justice Department for approval.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It was done back in 1992, by Legislative Process for
Taber City and they just pulled this . . .
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I asked staff a question of whether is has to go the
Justice Department in Washington for clearance under Section 5 of the
[??] Rights Act.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Lubke, We’re going to let her answer
the 1st question, and then she can follow up with the 2nd for staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. Representative Lubke, Colombus
County is not a Section 5 County.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you</p>

Any other questions? Representative Collins.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you know of any opposition from the local folks concerning this bill,
or how does it stand? How does the bill stand? Is it controversial,
non-controversial.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, no sir, no controversy.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do I have any questions or comments from the general public? All right,
any other questions from the committee? Representative Wilkins, you'd
like to make a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chair. My motion would be that we give a favorable
report to Senate bill 95.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All those in favor say aye. Oh I need a second on that motion. I got a
second, Representative Collins. All in favor say aye. All against? The
ayes have it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Torbett. House bill 140.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman, members of the committee. This bill is very,
well, it exactly like one the general assembly passed last year. Last
year we added the town of Belmont. This year we're adding the town of
Lowell. It provides the city the opportunity to pretty much take care of
the utility vehicles that are in the town, such as if they want to run a
John Deere gator around to do some of their cityscape brushes and shrubs
instead of a pickup truck, then it provides them that. If they have a
citizens that are using golf carts to get back and forth, it kinda takes
care of that so it's pretty much self explanatory and it's an add-on to
a local bill that was run last year and it still is a local bill. I'll
take any questions mister chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any questions? Representative Pittman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister chairman, for a motion at the proper time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative. Representative Presnell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
How large is the town of Lowell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not very.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you have a population?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don't have a population level. The whole county's 206,000 individuals.
The main city being Gastonia probably has 70,000 of that. I'm one of the
fortunate ones that live in a county of 14 municipalities, Lowell being
one, and so I would estimate, sheer estimation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Torbett, we have a expert back here behind us that can
give us that information. Staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The population is fewer than 2,000 persons to the city of Lowell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. I was trying to do the math in my head and it
wasn't getting there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions? Any questions from the general public? At this
time, Mr. Pittman, you have a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. I move favorable report on House bill 140.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do I have a second? I have a second, Representative Gill. All those in
favor say aye. Any opposed? In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have
it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. Thank you committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Congratulations. Thank you for coming to government committee and that
adjourns our meeting.</p>
