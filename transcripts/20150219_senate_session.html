  The Senate will come to order. The sergeant at arms will close the
doors. Members will go to their seats. Members and guests in the gallery
please silence all electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer is
the Reverand Peter Milner, Senate Chaplain. Members and guests in the
gallery, please stand. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Let&#39;s pray together.
Gracious God, Heavenly Father. Thank you for the warmth of this
building. We pray for those that are without it right now. We give you
thanks for large things as well like democracy and we pray for those who
are without it right now. We come before you and we ask that you in your
blazing face would pierce us with the shafts of your burning love. You,
oh God, are a God of love and Lord, you are also holy. Your holiness is
our judge and your wounds are our salvation. Lord, thank you for
salvation. May you send us out to serve the people of this land whether
in Bertie County or Cherokee County or Harnett County or Wake County
because we&#39;re blessed to be at your service and we&#39;re blessed to
be gathered here today to do this great work. In Jesus&#39; name I pray.
Amen. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Apodaca is recognized for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President, the journal of Wednesday, February 18th
2015 has been examined and is found to be correct. I move that the
Senate dispense with the reading of the Journal and that it stand
approved as written. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Without objection the journal for
February 18th stands approved as written. Senators, we have leaves of
absence today granted for Senators Woodard, Wells, Bingham. We do have a
nurse of the day with us today. Our nurse is Stephanie Leach from
Raleigh, North Carolina. Nurse Leach, please stand and be recognized.
Thank you for your service to the Senate today. [Applause] Senators we
have one item on our calendar for today, public bill third reading roll
call, Senate Bill 15. The clerk will read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill
15, Unemployment Insurance Law Changes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho
is recognized to speak to the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr.
President and members of the Senate. We did have a chance to review that
bill yesterday and there was a question from Senator Smith-Ingram that I
may not have been able to answer clearly enough, but I surely would like
to make sure she knows all the facts before she makes any rash
statements like we are trying to hit somebody or punish somebody when
they&#39;re down because that is far from the truth, but the question
that was about the issue of the two contacts on separate days,
that&#39;s the original proposal and that was coming forward was five
contacts over any number of days per week. The original actually was
damaging to recipients because it said if you did more than one contact
on one day, you could do two, you could do three, you could do five on
that one day, it disqualified you from benefits. So what we are trying
to say is you could do five over any number of days, you could do five
over one day you could do five over five days, but the fact of the
matter is this is more protection for those individuals who would&#39;ve
lost qualification or been disqualified from receiving the unemployment
benefits and I hope now that she understands that, that she may retract
the very negative comments. I&#39;ll stand for any additional questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any further discussion or debate? Senator
Smith-Ingram, for what purpose do you rise?

  To address Senator Rucho&#39;s clarification. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you
want to speak to the bill, Senator. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Good. You have the floor to speak to the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. I&#39;m sorry. I came in on the tail end of that, I
was meeting with the President Pro Tempore. I will say that if you were
offended or if I hurt your feelings by that statement then that was not
my intention, so let me apologize to you face to face. You have
clarified one or two things for me, and the bill is not all bad, but
there&#39;s never a one size fits all. When you look at the eight
counties that I represent and people were looking on a map yesterday.
Where is Tyrrel County? Well, I can tell you Tyrrel County is east of I
95. It is our smallest county. There are 638 students in the school
system. 17% of the population in Tyrrel County have access to the
internet. Beyond that, Tyrrel County does not have an employment agency.
Of the eight counties that I represent, North Hampton, Tyrrel,
Washington Counties do not have employment agencies. Beyond that, they
don&#39;t have public transportation. If I were receiving these benefits
and I was unemployed and I did not have a car, I did not have internet
access, how would I make those five contacts? When I read the bill and I
read it thoroughly, I didn&#39;t see suggestions as to what those five
contacts would be. I wish I could pass a bill on this floor or walk a
day in the shoes of the people you&#39;re going to affect when you
implement legislation, so with all due respect, sir, I apologize if you
were offended, but at the same time I have to represent the people that
I serve who do not have the access that you have or maybe people in the
area that you represent have. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Tillman, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman has the floor to speak on the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Smith-Ingram, you&#39;ve done something
I have not been able to do in 14 years, you&#39;ve hurt Senator
Rucho&#39;s feelings. I didn&#39;t know he had any. I didn&#39;t know he
had any. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any further discussion or debate. Hearing
none, the question before the Senate is the passage of Committee
Substitute to Senate Bill 15 on it third reading. All in favor will vote
aye, opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the voting,
the clerk will record the vote. 40 having voted in the affirmative and 6
in the negative, the Committee Substitute to Senate Bill 15 passes its
third reading and it will be sent to the House. Do we have any notices
or announcements? Senator Smith-Ingram, FYI, your microphone is on.
Thank you. Senator Daniel, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Point of personal privilege at the appropriate time. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Daniel, you have the floor for a point of personal
privilege. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Members of the
Senate for those of you who didn&#39;t know or weren&#39;t aware, my
congressman or former congressman Cass Ballinger passed away yesterday.
He had been a member of the House of Representatives and the North
Carolina Senate prior to going to the US Congress. For me personally he
meant a lot to me because he gave me one of the best opportunities of my
life. In 1987 Congressman Ballinger during his first term in Congress
appointed me to be able to attend the United States Military Academy
which was, you know, an experience that has shaped the entire rest of my
adult life so I just hope that today, Senator Berger, maybe we can
adjourn in honor of Congressman Ballinger and had talked to Senator
Wells who Cass Ballinger resides in his district. He wasn&#39;t able to
be here today, so I told him that I would speak in honor of Congressman
Ballinger and he certainly was a dedicated public servant and will be
missed in my area of the state. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Any other notices or
announcements. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Pate, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To make an
announcement. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Pate has the floor for an
announcement. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This announcement concerns the Senate
Select Committee on Nominations, pursuant to
