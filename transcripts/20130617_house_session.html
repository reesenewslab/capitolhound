The prayer will be offered by the Reverend Representative Shepard.
Members and visitors in the gallery, will you please stand and remain
standing for the Pledge of Allegiance.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let's pray.  Our gracious, heavenly father, we just want to come to you
now and we want to thank you and we want to praise you for all your
blessings that you give us each and every day and we thank you for the
safe travel we all had to get back here today and we thank you for the
fact that we were born in this great nation, in this great country.  We
pray as we attempt to be leaders, Lord, that you will help us to be
statesmen, not politicians.  Lord we pray for your wisdom, your guidance
in all the discussions that we make, that it will bring honor and  glory
to you, as we each are to bring honor and glory to you with the way that
we live our lives and the difference we make in Peoples lives.  Lord, I
pray a special prayer for our nation, for our leaders, for our congress,
for our president, and for each and everyone of us here, and for our
families and our military men and women wherever they may be, that
you'll protect them, put a hedge of protection around each of us, and
bless us in a mighty way, and  we thank you for all these things that
only you can give us. In Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to

<p id="05:00">
Ladies and gentleman, we're moving to the resolution that was just
placed on the calendar for immediate consideration. The House will come
to order. Members, please take your seats. House Resolution 835, the
clerk will read. And the clerk will read in its entirety.
[speaker change]
House Resolution 835. House Resolution honoring the life and memory of
Warren Basco &quot;Sneak&quot; Louis III, fallen Nash county Sheriff's
deputy. The House resolves. Whereas Warren Basco &quot;Sneak&quot; Louis
III, a lifelong resident of Nash County, North Carolina, served as
deputy for the Nash County Sheriff's Office for over nine years. Three
of which as an Investigator for the United States Marshall Service
Violent Fugitive Task Force in the eastern district of North Carolina.
Whereas Investigator Lewis was a dedicated law enforcement officer who
was especially proud of his work with the Marshall Service and was
admired by his peers and the members of his community. And whereas
Warren Lewis was an avid water skier who enjoyed spending time in the
water. And whereas on June 9th, 2011, Investigator Lewis was killed in
the line of duty while he and another member of the Fugitive Task Force
were attempting to serve a murder warrant. And whereas Warren Lewis is
survived by his wife Shannon Bailey Lewis, two daughters Lauren Bailey
Lewis and Ashley Nicole Lewis, and his parents Warren Basco Lewis,
Junior and Ann Mitchell Lewis. Now, therefore be it resolved by the
House of Representatives. Section One, the House of Representatives
honors the memory of Warren Basco &quot;Sneak&quot; Lewis III and
expresses the appreciation of this state and its citizens for his
service to law enforcement. Section Two, the House of Representatives
extends its deepest sympathy to the family of Warren Basco
&quot;Sneak&quot; Lewis III for the loss of a beloved family member.
Section Three, the principle clerk will transmit a certified copy of
this resolution to the family of Warren Basco &quot;Sneak&quot; Lewis
III. Section Four, this resolution is effective upon adoption.
[Speaker Change]
Representative Collins is recognized to debate the resolution.
[Speaker Change]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I stand tonight just to honor the memory of
Warren &quot;Sneak&quot; Lewis, as he was known to those who worked with
him. Didn't know this man, but I've had the chance to speak to some that
have worked with him, including actually one of our sergeant at arms
here, Mr. Clyde Cook, served as a  Marshall along with Mr. Lewis and had
great words of praise for him, as did his other colleagues who I've
talked with on the Nash County Sheriff's Department. We're honored to
have his family--wife, daughters, parents--here tonight. And it's a
shame this man died in the line of duty serving a warrant actually
outside of our area. Just one of those senseless things. But he died
doing what he liked to do. Serving our community. I'm proud to know
folks like this. I'm proud that we have people who are willing to give
everything, including their lives to protect the rest of us. I'm just
sorry that it has to come to this so often and that it seems like too
many times in this chamber we wind up coming to honor those who have
died in the line of duty. I'm thankful for those who are willing to do
it. Again, I'd like to give my heartfelt sympathy to his family and
offer their thanks. I know that a lot of people back home give my wife
thanks for letting me come and serve here. And I think that's very
appropriate, because she probably sacrifices more than I do to be here.
I think the same thing could be said in triplicate of families of law
enforcement officers, who allow their loved ones to go out and serve in
the most dangerous domestic job you can do. I'd just like to honor them
and thank them for being here with us tonight.
[Speaker Change]
Further discussion, further debate. If not, the question before the
House is the adoption of the House Resolution 835. All in favor vote
aye, all opposed vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The clerk will
let the machine record the vote. 108 having voted in the affirmative,
none in the negative. The resolution has been adopted and will ordered
printed. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, the Chair wishes to
recognize Shannon Lewis, wife of Officer Lewis, his daughters Lauren and
Ashley, and his</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. All parties, all players involved with this are supportive and
that's reflected with quite a bit of tweaking to ensure that all are
happy. But as far as the process goes, when it comes to a student what
we were doing was testing mildly retarded, intellectually disabled
students with a college entrance test and the individual education plan
team members that's the process to make sure that the word gets to the
parents bill to make their inputs.

enacts. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Riddell, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, on the familiar D-400, individual
income tax form, is a box that allows you to designate three dollars as
an individual or six dollars as a couple to one of three political
parties here in North Carolina. This bill very simply eliminates that
program and it allows the rest of the funds remaining through this year
to be exhausted in the normal process of how they were distributed
amongst the political parties. I’ve got several reasons for why I
introduced this bill. The first is not every political party here in
North Carolina can access these funds. Believe it or not, there are some
other political parties besides the three that are listed on the form.
On the form you have North Carolina Democrat Party, Republican and
Libertarian, but there are some other parties, smaller, but with people
equally as devoted to them as we are to our respective parties here in
this chamber, but they are prevented from accessing this fund, these
funds, this money. Secondly, in the last presidential election, more
than over 1.2 billion dollars was raised by the respective candidates
and their parties. 1.2 billion dollars. There is not a want of
successful fundraising in the nation nor North Carolina for political
enterprises, so I have a question about whether or not this program is
needed. I think it might have outdistanced, outrun its original purpose,
and lastly I don’t think that it’s the job of state government to be
soliciting money on behalf of political parties. I don’t think it’s wise
for the government to be doing that on a tax form, and I don’t think
it’s good that we should enlist the aid of the tax-collecting arm of
state government to prop up our political parties. The fiscal note on
this bill says it will return two</p>

A million dollars, that's in a general fund.  Two million dollars,
there's a lot that can be done with that money.  We just gone through
part of the budget process we each have programs that we would've like
to have seen more money designated for.  Two million dollars I know it's
probably not a great deal in the shape of a twenty billion dollar budget
over all, but two million dollars can do a lot of things.  Think of the
different aspects of education programs that could've used another two
million dollars.  Think of the number of assistant district attorneys we
could've added to our court system for another two million dollars.
Think about our state law enforcement personnel, those that work in the
department of corrections, FBI,and my favorites, the State Troopers.  We
could unfreeze the State Troopers salaries with this additional two
million dollars.  There's a lot of things we could do with this money,
and I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.  Thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Alexander please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr.Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House I rise to
urge you to vote against this bill, and I want to remind you, that this
check off measure first became law as a bipartisan measure, shortly
after the Watergate fiasco when people were concerned about the undue
influence of money in politics.  And people are still concerned about
the undue influence of money in politics.  The ongoing debate about
Citizens United is an excellent example of that.  You've heard a
proponent of this measure talk about all the things you can do with two
million dollars.  Well, if you decided for instance, not to devote some
of our tax money to a voucher program, you'd pick up not two million,
but over fifty million.  And with that fifty million we could improve
our pay for teachers.  I could go on and on and find programs that are
buried in our budget that exceed the two million dollars in question.
That you could use the money to re-purpose to do something else, but the
most important thing I want you to consider as you make your decision to
vote, hopefully against this measure, is the fact that when we get a
bipartisan way, decided to go down this path of check offs, and to
explore using some of our tax payers money voluntarily put in the
direction of political parties, this was all designed to get money out
of politics, and I think that's something that both Democrats,
Republicans, Libertarians, Federalist wigs, no nothings, and every other
political party that you can think of ought to sign on to.  Vote red.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]Presenter Stan, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]Speak on the bill
{SPEAKER CHANGE]The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]Mr. Speaker, members of the House, a good bipartisan
reason to vote for this bill comes from Thomas Jefferson, the founder I
believe of the Democrat Republican party.  So, we all claim some lineage
from Thomas Jefferson.  Some of us name our fund raising dinners after
him.  And considering a bill that was going to use tax money to present
the ideas of one set over another, to paraphrase him, he said to do this
is both sinful and tyrannical.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Representative Pittman, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGE] ??? the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you Mr.Speaker.  If we want to keep money from
being that big an influence, I don't know how you do that really, and it
seems to me, if that's the concern, keeping money out of the thing, then
we shouldn't be involved in the state treasury and having anything to do
with it.  And as far as money, just my personal situation, last year, my
opponent in primary had over 45 thousand dollars, I had 83 hundred,
didn't even spend all that, and here I am, so money isn't everything.
And other than that, I'd just like to say to Representative Riddell,
amen brother.</p>

Thanks, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Bumgardner, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to ask that you vote in favor of
this bill, because I agree with Representative Riddell that this was a
bad idea when it started. It’s gotten as bad or worse over time. The
government has no business mix in the money and politics and taken tax
payers' money to fund any political party or campaign. And so I would
ask you to vote in favor of this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Riddell, please state your purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Folks, I just want to continue on with the discussion taking place here.
When this initiative was first introduced as Representative Alexander
said in a bipartisan way, that was before online giving. You know what?
Just a few clicks, you can give a lot more than $3 to the party of your
choice. That was also before the time of social networking and
money-bombs. And there is no shortage of means new and traditional by
which political parties can gain, the support they need to stay in
operation. I do not think it is the job of the state government to use
itself to prop up political parties. I urge you to support for the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Lucas, please state your purpose?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To ask Representative Riddell a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Riddell. Does one have to check this thing up,
is it required?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Second question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would you consider this freedom of choice?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I didn’t hear what you said, I sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would you consider this freedom of choice, this process to be freedom of
choice?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would consider it to be freedom of choice if it wasn’t on a compulsory
state document dealing with tax revenue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Third question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman yields?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you have the option to ignore it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, if you are filling out a tax form.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Robert Brawley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ask Representative Riddell a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Riddell, does gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Isn’t this $3, tax dollars?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And a second question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman yield? Gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And the choice is whether or not we have the state contribute $3 to
political funds, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is my understanding, this does not come from an individual's
refund, this is directed away from the general fund to a political
party.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Third question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And doesn’t – everyone have the choice to send as much money up to
$4,000 as they want, to any candidate they want to?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is my understanding.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Alexander, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak a second time on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill a second time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I want to remind everybody again that the reason why you get this $3
check off in the first place was we wanted to encourage small donations
by individuals to support the political party of their choice. And that
was set against large contributions that were coming from the wealthy
and from corporate ?? through all kinds of interesting ledger domain.
And also wants you to remember that these tax dollars, they don’t belong
to you, they don’t belong to me, they belong to the people. And as a
result, when a citizen voluntarily decides that they would like $3 of
their tax liability to be used to support a political party of their
choice. I would submit to you that there is nothing wrong with that. I
would also say that if the problem is that there are not enough
political parties listed. The way they correct that is to allow that $3
to be directed proportionately to every political party that happen to
have qualified in the last gubernatorial election. This isn’t about
money going to a particular party. It’s about the ability of citizens
who may not have access to the internet. The ability of the citizens who
may not…</p>

<p id="50:00">
[Speaker changes.]...all these new sophisticated ways to contribute but
who do get a tax return. To be able to send a small portion of their
liability to the political party of their choice and, in the aggregate,
these citizens are fighting large money and it's influence in the body
politic of this country. And  I know I'm fightin' an uphill battle and I
understand that some of you've already made up your minds but I'll...in
closin' I'm gonna tell ya' that, if it's wrong for a citizen to send
three dollars to a political party, it is also wrong for a citizen to
use the tax system to send $4500 to a voucher program because that is
still tax money and it's tax money that's being directed somewhere and
it's not tax money that's bein' used generally for the common good in
the general welfare.  Now I know you're gonna debate with me about that,
you'll think that that's a wrong headed and bad direction but it's...IT
IS...it depends on where you're standing.  If you stand one place, it's
okay to spend 50 million dollars this way. If you're standin' somewhere
else, it's wrong to spend 2 million dollars to defend democracy. I think
that it's important that we defend democracy and I urge you again to
vote red.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Speciale, please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] To debate the bill.
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[Speaker changes.] I hafta disagree with the previous speaker who just
said that it's not your money, it's not my money, it's the government's
money...it's that train of thought that got us where we're at over the
last few decades. If this was an extra three dollars...if they were
saying, here's how much tax you owe, would you like to put three more
dollars in of your private money to cover this, that would be bad enough
because then...we'd still be using the state to do our dirty work so no
matter how you look at this, it was always a bad idea. If it was
designed to take the money out of politics, obviously it didn't work so
if we came up here to get rid of failed ideas, this is one of them.  I
ask you to vote against...or to vote for this bill.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Alexander, please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] Just to speak on a matter of privilege.
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman will be recognized for a point of
persona privilege. If the gentleman wades into anything touching on this
bill, he will be ruled out of order. The gentleman is recognized for a
point of personal privilege.
[Speaker changes.] Mister Speaker?
[Speaker changes.] Representative Insko, please state your purpose.
[Speaker changes.] May I ask Representative Alexander a question.
[Speaker changes.] To the extent that the lady is not effectively trying
to allow Representative Alexander to debate the bill a third time, the
lady is recognized.  Does the gentleman yield?
[Speaker changes.] Yes.
[Speaker changes.] The gentleman yields.
[Speaker changes.] I would like to get some clarification because there
is some misunderstanding, I think, on the floor about whether...and this
is has to do with the bill but I'd like to get some clarification about
exactly whether the reference was to government controlling or
taxpayer's controlling. I think there was a difference and, if I could
ask...if you'll allow me to ask Representative Alexander that question,
I think we could get it clarified.
[Speaker changes.] If the gentleman wishes to respond to the specific
question.
[Speaker changes.] Yes, thank you Representative Insko. My reference was
to the citizens, not to the government and I think that is a extremely
important distinction.

same violation. In other words it’s to regularize this penalty with
every other amount that we… in every other situation in the state in
which we penalize this same infraction, we penalize it for the amount
that’s in this bill. So this is designed to regularize it for this

No duty on the part of the police to even tell you that this process is
going on until your building is ceased and it is gone. Now there was a
Nuisance Act related to gang activity that has specific language for
innocent landlords, I cosponsored it, I supported it and I would do the
same for this bill if it had protections for innocent landlords, but it
doesn't.
And for this reason I'm opposing this bill because once again the city
is gonna say, you own the building, you don't know there's trouble but
we're gonna hold you 100% accountable and take your building and tear it
down because you should have known and kept it clean and never mind the
fact that we're the guys with the police department, we're gonna hold
you responsible. And that's just not the way we need to do business in
this state. I ask you to oppose this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the bill a second
time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Want to address two issues here real quickly. The one
that representative Brawley just brought up, you have to be aware it's
going on. This is repeated contact. Law enforcement will let you know
there's problems with your facility and that is what the law requires.
The second thing is Representative Glazier kept talking about rebuttable
presumption, that's very different than the other three statutes he
talked about. Those are held without bond for a period of time.
A rebuttable presumption says we've got some magistrates out there that
just sort of have a written rule, they just simply a low bond, $5000 for
each felony up to a certain thing, and don't really weight a lot of
these consequences. What it says is that the judge can have that
discretion decide and to be able too weight those things. A rebuttable
presumption is just that, it presumes they should be held but then it
gives the defense counsel and the person and even the judge the
opportunity to rebutt that presumption by considering the various
factors. So I'd ask that you still support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Shepard please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir Mr. Speaker to speak on the bill and I'd like
to ask Representative Boles a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Boles does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Boles recently I saw on WRL one night
there was an apartment complex in Southern pines, they were having some
similar issues, there was a lot of crime, a lot of things were happening
around this apartment complex and law enforcement was at a standstill as
to what to do with it. Was that - what I saw is happening is it not?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It is and I've talked to my DA and she's very
concerned and very supportive of the bill here and they've had public
meetings as well but they still need some more [??] teeth.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The other thing that i saw that night on television
that night was that they've made repeated attempts to bring the owners
of this property to the table too discuss this and to work on doing
something about this because some of the tenants that live in those
apartments are afraid to even go out at night or allow their children
outside to play because there seems to be all this crime going on in
this neighborhood and so forth, but the owners I believe of the
apartments have refused to come to the table and discuss it with law
enforcement and community officials if I'm not wrong.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct and they were an out of state
ownership and finally the DA and the chief of police and the sheriffs
department forced the owners at a meeting to come and speak to the
residents as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Representative Boles.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. What I'd like to say is my police chief sent
us an email this afternoon and he seriously, he said we would really
appreciate if you would support this bill because it would help us in
combating some of this crimes and so forth that's going on, some
neighborhoods and some businesses. And I understand what representative
Brawley is saying but at the same time I don't believe that you own a
property without knowing what's going on at that property, and most of
the situations that I'm aware of the police chief and the people of the
community have already contacted them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I was going to ask the gentleman a question but I was
gonna wait until he finished his sentence and then ask.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] But basically what I was going to say is I think most
of the time these people are aware, just in the case of Southern Pines
they were made aware by the people in the community and some of the
tenants in the apartment complex but they were not willing to come to
the table and discuss it and try to work anything out. So, I would ask
that you support this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker would the gentleman yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Shepard does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I'd be glad to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Shepard will you show me in the bill
where it says that the police will notify the owner that there's a
problem?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley I did not see that...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] [??]  Representative Shepard the gentleman will
suspend that question, it's probably better directed to Representative
Stevens.</p>

The gentleman doesn't doesn't mind they will redirect does this lady
yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
and I knew that was an issue that he was having  I was attempting to
find representatives Rawely the definition. This is under Chapter 19 –
one is what what are nuisances is and that's what comes in hundred 19 –
1.11a uses the definition knowledge or knowledge of the nuisance which
is something you find in order to take the property or create the
nuisance action and I can read entire paragraph but it says repeated
acts which constitute creating constitute a breach of the peace is
evidence that the defendant knew or by the exercise of due diligence
should have known they are conduct constitute proof of knowledge so
somehow the defendant is the person that you are going through civil
action which would be the person who owns the property knows or should
have known of the activity you can't just get back in and be stupid that
you can't just lease your property for this purpose and that's what a
lot of people done is that they leased it continue to repeated acts have
gone on and they refused to take action [SPEAKER CHANGES]of Mr. Speaker
a follow-up does the lady yield? the lady yields.[SPEAKER CHANGES]  does
the section that you just quoted say anything about the police notifying
the owner or does it merely allow them to establish that they knew or
should have known[SPEAKER CHANGES] it in new or should have known
because sometimes[SPEAKER CHANGES] thank you representative will lady
yields for the second question [SPEAKER CHANGES] representative rawely
when she is answering herquestion chair you appreciate that you not
interrupt does the lady finish answering and then the gentleman will be
recognized for follow-up question[SPEAKER CHANGES] thank you Mr. Speaker
Mr. Moore knew or should have known has very specific legal
ramifications that to be proven that you knew or  deliberately
disregarded knowing Mr. Speaker can ask a follow-up [SPEAKER CHANGES]
does the lady yield [SPEAKER CHANGES] follow-up does what you think the
yield is there anything in the bill and general statute you quoted that
would hold a cooperative landlord harmless for his attempt to cooperate
with police [SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe there would be that when I said
I have to know and and yes it's time to take some action to help the
police respond with it if you know of any circumstance in which law
enforcement has had a cooperative person who did not lost their property
to anyway waiting for police please let us not because that's not the
intent of this and I don't believe there's anywhere that that's been
done or Michigan Michigan, where it is always that your purpose
specifically you for question that if the Jonah wielders are probably
the gentleman have any other follow-ups are what did I think I wasn't
intending to be rudely represented by the election was debating the bill
after answering the question of if there were specific exemption does
the lady yeid? [SPEAKER CHANGES]as after asking the questions I will if
there's which you agree to a specific exception or a defense for a
cooperative landlord have an absolute defense against loss of their
property[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would say yes [SPEAKER CHANGES] thank you
mr. speaker for offering an amendment tomorrow representative McNeil or
representative stone please state your purpose[SPEAKER CHANGES] thank
you Mr. Speaker do you mind asking if the lady will yield. The lady will
yield. Thank you Mr. Speaker and I'll tell you from a landlord's
perspective that we have a great piece of legislation and I'm just
wondering if you would take the opportunity of course I just heard that
there will be a amendment but we have a chance to appoint a great piece
of legislation I don't know of a landlord who that I am aware of that
would not work with the city County or state or whoever but we got an
opportunity while this bill is here today to go ahead and fix it so that
we can clarify this because the biggest problems are not what solved
here it's how it's intended back home and who reads it the intended
pressure of the person a reason will see one another so given
opportunity to fix it and I'm just wondering if you will consider
putting this bill up or displacing it until we get an amendment to fix
it [SPEAKER CHANGES] that would be fine whether we want to have a vote
on Saturday I can work on amending it on the third I think of an
abundance of respect and ask anybody to to a lease contact the senator
because the Senate bill not mine</p>

Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative McNeill, please state your
purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To ask Representative Stevens a question if
she’s not worn out. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens, does the
lady yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. I’m just getting ready for the
next bill too, so… [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m a little confused about the debate tonight. If this bill is
defeated, would the language that Mr. Brawley is objecting to still be
in the old bill? [SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES] So
defeating this bill is not going to change his argument, correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That’s correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Another question
please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the lady yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The Lady yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And when you were
talking about the rebuttal presumption in section G, you explain that’s
where it says that a judge can overrule that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] He can.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He can. So the rebuttal presumptions, it’s pretty much
just going to relate to magistrates pretty much. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES] A judge could overrule that. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] And I believe that a magistrate could too, but they would have
to make specific findings of fact as to why they didn’t follow the
presumption. That’s one thing a rebuttable presumption does, is it gives
somebody a reason in the future to understand why this person was
released, if particularly they fled. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. To
debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate
the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think there’s been a lot of argument
tonight about nothing. Number one, we’ve spent a lot of time on Mr.
Brawley’s, and if we defeat the bill the language is still in there, so
it’s not going to fix his problem. Also there’s been a lot of debate
about rebuttable presumption when a judge can overrule it. It seems to
me like there’s been just a lot of debate over nothing. As a member of
the Sheriff’s Office I wholly support this bill. It is a good bill. We
have used this bill numerous times, or excuse me, this law numerous
times in Randolph County to shut down places that were a nuisance and
selling drugs, and it has been a wonderful piece of legislation, and I
commend the bill to you and I think you ought to vote green on it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Larry Hall, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is
recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Ladies and gentlemen, I’ll be brief. There are two problems with this,
and certainly I hope they’ll be fixed and I can support this bill. The
first is there is a restriction that says the person, if charged under
these sections, has to be released by a judge, so if a judge is not
available, magistrate cannot do it if he’s charged under these enhanced
provisions. A magistrate cannot do it – it clearly says it, so we don’t
have to debate whether a magistrate could. It clearly says “released by
a district or superior court judge”. That’s who has to release him. So
if it’s on a weekend when a judge is not on duty, not available,
whatever, unless someone’s going to go bring the judge back, they won’t
be able to be released as they would normally be released. Second of
all, this bill says if you’ve been previously charged, then if you get
charged a second time while on release, not having been found guilty,
not having had an opportunity for a trial, but if you’ve been previously
charged then you fall under these guidelines without having had your day
in court. Now maybe we need to speed up the court system, maybe we need
to give priority to these type charges, but we don’t need to treat
someone as if they’re guilty without having had that opportunity, and we
don’t need to hold them this additional period of time which may be
three or four days depending upon if they get arrested on a weekend or
on a holiday weekend before a judge is going to be available. I hope
this bill will be fixed so I can support it. Can’t support it in its
current form. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hall, Larry Hall… [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hall,
does the gentleman yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hall, do you
recall the Durham delegation bringing us a bill earlier this session
that has the same presumption in order to combat gang activity in
Durham? The same procedural requirements? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, I do recall that bill. I objected to it in our city
council meetings. I objected to it because our county presiding superior
court judge and our district court judge were opposed to it because of
the reasons I just talked about about judges being available and
additional workload, as well as the bondsman objected to it. I objected
to it for the reasons I already articulated on the floor. As you know,
this is the long session, not the short session, so one member of the
delegation can’t stop the legislation from moving. I objected to it, I
objected to this. I hope this will be fixed and I hope the Durham bill
will be fixed. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Michaux,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Actually to correct Representative Stam. The bill was
not on gang activity, Representative Stam. The gang activity bill passed
three or four years ago. The bill that was introduced this time was the
use of weapons.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stevens, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, since I'm stimulating such discussion to speak
on this bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The lady is recognized to debate the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members of the House,
what this bill first says is that it eliminates the requirement which is
set to go into effect July 1st, 2013, of being a certified ILAC facility
for, but only for purposes of DWI law. And under DWI law, you allow
hospitals who are certified under federal law through the Department of
Health and Human Services to conduct that blood and urine, or blood test
for alcohol, and to allow that to evidence, to come in under forensics.
This will help with some of the backlog that the lab has. In the interim
I also received an email from Christy Agnar at the Department of Justice
who indicated that as of Friday, the state crime lab has received it's
ILAC certification. So it will continue to handle those controlled
substances, DNA, things like that. This is simply for the purposes of
alcohol and to allow lab people to come in and testify. Thanks for your
support. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
The question before the House is to passed to the House committee
substitute to Senate bill 285 on it's second reading. All in favor, vote

record. Representative Bill Rawly. Clerk will allow the machine to

discussion, further debate. If not the question before House is to
passage of the House committee substitute of Senate bill 285 on it's

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Committee substitute number two for Senate bill 358
available to the entitlement and act to authorize to guarantee to asset
protection waivers to be authorized in this state. General assembly of
North Carolina, you're next. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative West,
please state your purpose. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker. Members of the House, I guarantee that
asset protection waiver is a constitutional provision. When a creditor
waives the amount of debt in excess of the borrowers primary insurance
in the event of a motor vehicle having a total loss. What that is is,
when you buy a new vehicle there's usually, when you first drive it off
the lot, a significant diminution in value. That means the insurance, at
that point would not cover the full amount that a car purchaser may well
have borrowed to purchase the vehicle. The gap waiver is just for a fee.
The creditor who holds the note on that vehicle is saying, I'll take
just what the insurance covers.</p>
