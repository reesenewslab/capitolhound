this success been isolated to just one county, we can palate a similar
program that may have statewide impact on our state's most neediest
children. This is hwy we stand before you today in great appreciation of
these courageous elected officials, on behalf of our neediest children.
I stand here, along with thousands of others that cannot be here, and
salute and thank our representatives who are standing on behalf of low
income or working class families in our state. And I want to be very
clear, and not just in general, our primary House sponsors of
opportunity scholarships back, but specifically, we want to thank the
lead sponsor, Rep. Rob Bryan from Mecklinburg county. We want to thank
Rep. Marcus Brandon from Guilford county. We want to thank Rep. Brian
Brown  from Pitt county, and we want to thank Rep. Hanes from Forsyth
county. And not only have leaders stood up from North Carolina House
standing here today, but we're also thankful to have Senators Malcolm
Graham from Mecklinburg county, as well as Sen. Ben Clark from
Cumberland joining us and we thank them for their support of this
imitative as well. You will be hearing from these leaders soon, but
without further ado, I would like to introduce a champion in his own
right, just his second term here, but he is coming, guns a blazin' and
we are happy now to turn it over to Rep. Marcus.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I want to thank everybody for coming. I am Rep. Marcus Brandon from
Guilford county. I want to thank Daryl Alison, and his incredible staff
at Parents for Educational Freedom for the help leading this the way
through forward on this bill. People want to know how I got here on this
particular issue, and I want to let them know that it was my
constituents who led me here. And when I first ran for office and I
knocked on doors and tried to find out why my community was the way it
was, and why I had 41% of African-American males who weren't graduating
from schools, and why I had 60% of kids who were not reading on grade
level. And then I turned around and looked at the community and why I
had the highest HIV/AIDS rate, and why I had the highest infant
mortality rate, and why I had the more people who didn't have ??, and
you can see how this all intertwines into one complete cycle. And what I
realized is that we needed space, and we needed an opportunity to deal
with all of these issues. And one of the things that kept coming up to
me was all the parents coming up to me and asking what are we going to
do about this school that's been in our neighborhood for 25 years and
it's been failing for 25 years. And I worked very hard to make sure that
school comes from a failing school to a performing school. But the core
issue of this is that how do we look a parent in the face, and say
&quot;Ma'am, I understand that you child has been suspended twice. I
understand that they might have 3 &quot;f&quot;s on their report card. I
understand all of that. But because therefore you live in that zip code,
you must attend that school. And if any- and how do I have that
conversation? But I would like to let my friends on my side of the aisle
and others, that to let everybody know that that is not even close to
being a progressive conversation. It has nothing to do with our
progressive ideas, and has nothing to do with the ideas of the
Democratic party. We don't stand for things like that. If you do things
over and over and over again to the detriment of poor and minority
communities, that is not close to being progressive. And it's time for
us to understand that conversation, it's time for us to understand what
that really looks like,  and it's time for us to start representing our
constituencies, and not necessarily entities and 50 year old rhetoric
and mindsets. And that's why I stand in this fight, I fight very hard
for the constituents that I have to represent. I'm not really interested
in what other people's agendas are or anything like that. I know what
mine is, and it is for me to make sure that I have every single child in
my community has the same access and opportunity as anybody else does.
And that's why I'm here, and I appreciate the opportunity to you, and I
hope that we can all support the opportunity scholarship bill. Thank
you.

Good afternoon.
My name is Michael Pratt, principal of Victory Christian Center School
in Charlotte, North Carlolina. When people hear the words &quot;private
school&quot;, many assume that these schools serve the upper class and
the well-to-do. But for nearly 25 years, Victory Christian Center School
has been a change agent for working class as well as some poor families
in Charlotte. Currently we're making a difference in the lives of over
330 students. Unfortunately in Mecklinburg county, when it comes to
children from low income and working class families, we know that only
53% of low income</p>

Children passed [?] state test last year compared to 87% of wealthier
students. Also only 70% of low income working class students graduate on
time compared to 76% of all students. But over the past two years I’m
excited to say that 99.9% of BCCS students have graduated. And 90-95% of
our graduates have enrolled in college. That’s more than 450 students.
Our students are attending some of the best colleges in the nation.
Chapel Hill, Duke, Brown University, Vanderbilt University as well as
others. And while these are great statistics, it is important to
understand that BCC was not established to hit the [?] problem. We knew,
we’re concerned with trying to provide a quality solution for parents in
the Charlotte area. That and we’re proud that just about every one of
our students have graduated and are going onto college. Now we’re very
familiar with the concept of the opportunity scholarship because many of
our students have gone through the children’s scholarship fund as Darryl
mentioned earlier. We are excited that we can come to partner with the
parents, work hard with them and put them in an environment that we
trust will insure that they have an opportunity to enroll and to
succeed. We made this scholarship program. It’s worked well in
Charlotte. And I’m here today to say opportunity scholarships can work
in our state. I would like to thank the primary house bosses of the
opportunity scholarship. And I would especially like to thank Senator
Michael Brown for his leadership and supporting access to quality
education for every child. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good afternoon. It has often been said that it is not
you’re environment, it is you. The quality of your mind, the integrity
of your soul and the determination of your wills that will decide our
future and shape our lives regarding education. It is known that the
majority of students in North Carolina will attend public schools. And I
support public schools. I support our principals. I support our
teachers. I support our assistant principals and the case workers and
the nurses. And making sure that North Carolina has the best public
schools in America.  But I also know that, and I was telling Bishop
Davis from Charlotte who is here today, that from my home in Charlotte
there is two ways to get to Winston, Salem. I can go 77 North. I can go
85. But any route that I take, I will get to my destination which is
Winston. My point is this, my destination is to making sure that every
child in North Carolina receives a quality education by any means
necessary. By any path necessary. Good public schools. Good charter
schools and giving them the opportunity to succeed. Your education
should not be based on your zip code. It should not be based on who your
mother is or your father is. It should not be based on your income
level. It should be based on the ability for that child to learn and
achieve. What I’m here today standing for is access to quality
education, quality schools, and giving the children of North Carolina an
opportunity. Poor children in North Carolina. You just heard from
Victory Christian, New Birth Charlotte, Friendship Baptist Church, The
Park Missionaries. All schools in Charlotte educating poor black
children. I want to give them a hand. I want to give them an opportunity
to help someone reach their destination. I want to get a kid to Duke. I
want to get a kid to Johnson C. Smith University. I want to get a kid to
Harvard or Howard. I don’t care how they get there. They can go to
Mallard Creek High school, a public school like my kids did. They can go
to Victory Christian. They can go to Chip Academy. But I want to make
sure that parents have the opportunity to make good quality decisions
for their children. For their kids. How we deliver public education in
America has to change. Has to change. And I want to be a part of that
change. I want to welcome this bill to the Senate. I want to</p>

<p id="15:00">
I want to create an opportunity where a child and a parent can sit down
and make a decision as a family about what's in the best interest of
that child. That's why we're standing here, that's why I am a leader.
And I clearly know that doing what is popular is not right, and
sometimes doing what is right is not popular. But I'm here to be a
leader. And I want to lead on things that are important for our
community. That's why I stand with these guys today. To work together
across the aisle to create an environment where kids can succeed. Now we
may agree and we'll disagree. We may have to massage some things to get
it right, but there is no question that it is right to do what is in the
best interest of poor kids. I work professionally at Johnson C Smith
University as assistant to the President. And I see kids from all walks
of life come on our campus, looking for an opportunity. And we give
opportunities. All they want is an opportunity to be successful. Whether
they come from Ballantine, where the houses range four to five-hundred
thousand dollars, or they come from the old Piedmont Courts, where mama
and daddy's on food stamps and looking for public assistance to make
ends meet. They want to get to their destination, which is a quality
education. I'd like to bring forward a friend of mine from Charlotte,
North Carolina, Bishop Davis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good Afternoon. I'm Phillip David, and I have the privilege of pastoring
the Nations Ford Community Church in Charlotte. Frederick Douglass once
said that &quot;It is easier to build strong children, than to repair
broken men&quot;. Our church founded the Male Leadership Academy of
Charlotte as a single-gender school for boys developing young men to
become men of character who will one day lead us into the future. The
goal of the Male Leadership Academy of Charlotte is very simple; it's to
provide boys with a structured, disciplined place to learn and explore
and to develop the greatness that is within them. Our curriculum is
based on the Common Core, with a concentration on STEM subject matters -
Science, Engineering, Technology, and Math. Personally, I come from that
low-income, working class family. I was described at one point as being
high-potential, but low-opportunity. Many boys in our targeted group are
in the same position. They have great minds, they have great talents and
they have great potential, however, most of the have low opportunity.
The leadership of our church a few years began to work to address this
issue relating to our city's high-potential and low opportunity males.
Fortunately, the statistics show that there is a lot more to be done.
Fifty-three percent of students suspended in Charlotte-Mecklenburg
Schools are black males. Forty-nine percent of black male students that
took the end of grade test. And we know that black students make up half
of all of the students dropping out of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools
last year. So the urgent crises, as it relates to African-American males
particularly, is one that is obvious. But it's one thing to know about a
problem and to preach about a problem, it's something else to do
something about it. And so we decided to do something about it, and we
started the Male Leadership Academy and we didn't do it to make money,
we didn't do it to make a name for ourselves. But we did it because
there's a real need, not only in Charlotte, but across the state and
across the nation, and while we believe that we're doing a good job
reaching many of the males in those challenging situations, there are
many more who we would love to be a part of our Leadership Academy. But
their families, quite frankly, can't afford to send them to us, and to
me, that's not acceptable. Nevertheless, we're committed for the long
haul. And quite frankly, with or without state funding, we gone do it
because it's the right thing to do. However, partnership is critical and
partnership is needed. And the parents of these boys need a hand. Now
listen, they don't need a hand out.</p>

They need a hand up and these boys can make a difference and sit in
these very chambers and make laws for us in the future. When we heard
about the strong bi-partisan leadership and the vision of the four
primary sponsors of the Opportunity Scholarship Act, we were excited. We
were excited because when this measure passes, I said when this measure
passes, through this program we'll be able to open more doors of
opportunity for our boys, not only today but in the future. That's why I
came here today. Not just to make the drive in the rain, but to thank,
personally, Representative Bryan and my long-time friend, Senator
Malcolm Graham, who's been a leader of education in the Charlotte area
for many years. I stand here very appreciative of their leadership and I
urge the members of the House and the members of the Senate to pass this
measure and make it law so that we can continue to build strong
children, rather than to repair broken men. Thank you for the privilege
of sharing those thoughts and let me have come to us now, Pastor
McLauchlin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Good afternoon. I'm Pastor Allen McLauchlin, New Life
Bible Church in Fayetteville, North Carolina and I'm also the Senior
Administrator of New Life Christian Academy and Preparatory School in
Fayetteville. Our academy was founded back in 1997 to serve different
types of the learners. High achievers, at risk kids, and others in
Cumberland and Hoke Counties. Our desire was simply not to lose one
child to the world. Our goal was, and still is, to have an impact in the
life of some students who often seem destined to fail because of
behavioral or academic shortfalls. Since our conception in 1997, we have
provided well structured and nurturing academic setting for several
thousand students in grades K3 through the 12th, predominately low
income whites and black students. In Cumberland County, as in other
counties, as well, many working class and lower income families are
concerned about several issues in our public education system. Low
graduation rate among minorities, suspension disparity among minorities,
especially African-American males. Lack of black male instructors in our
schools and the rise of negative peer pressure. My academy, New Life
Christian Academy, strives to address these concerns by focusing on
individual needs of the child, bridging the gap of family, school,
church, community by providing a solid foundation that produces well
rounded, globally competitive students with christian values. We believe
that every child can learn, they just learn at a different rate. As a
pastor and educator, I have seen and I know that this can work. I know
first hand the urgency of passing this Opportunity Scholarship Act, OCA,
for this county and for the State. I understand that without financial
assistance, many families in my community may not have the high quality
education alternative that fits the needs of their children. What
happens when they don't have that opportunity? There is a lack of
college opportunity. Employment opportunities dwindle. Military service
may not happen. A lower standard of living and, of course, illegal
behavior. We've got to stop this. I want to applaud Senator Clark, my
senator from Cumberland County, for his leadership on this Opportunity
Scholarship Act, Bill 944, and I urge the members of the House and
Senate to stand and support this bill. We owe it to our children. Thank
you. I introduce my senator, Senator Clark.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Clark, I represent Hoke and Cumberland County
and in addition to being a senator, I'm also a veteran of the United
States Airforce and also former educator. When I was campaigning, this
is my first term, I campaigned under the motto for the cause of right.
I'm under no illusion that being here is not necessarily the most
political...</p>

The words, &quot;I can't,&quot; and, &quot;I won't,&quot; don't exist.
This means that I won't give up on giving her an education, on giving
her the education she needs and deserves. But as a single mom whose
child qualifies for free and reduced lunches, &quot;I can't,&quot; are
the words that I, that run through mind and through my head when I think
about trying to find another school that would work for her. This is why
I stand before you today, as a parent, to support Opportunity
Scholarship Act. Because I want to turn, &quot;I can't,&quot; into,
&quot;I can,&quot; for my daughter. I'm not here because I'm a parent
who's against public schools, but because I'm a parent who only wants
the best for her child. I believe Amaya [spelling?] would strive in a
private school with smaller classes and teachers who can give her a
little bit more of one-on-one. My worse fear is that Amaya will continue
to struggle in school, where she will fall further behind in her
classwork, lose interest in school, or just eventually give up. This is,
this is every parents' greatest fear, and I will do whatever it takes,
that this does not become a reality in my home. I want Amaya to succeed
in school. And while I may not make enough, the Opportunity Act, the
Opportunity Scholarship Act would put me much, in a much better position
to give her the opportunity that she needs to succeed. Thank you
Representative Bob Bry-, Bob Ry-, Bryan, Marcus Brandon, Brian Brown, Ed
Hanes, and Senator leaders for taking the brave stand for my child,
Amaya. To give our, to give to our other legislators, and to those
within the sound of my voice, please support the Opportunity Scholarship
Act because many of our low-income children and working class families
need the opportunity to receive quality education. Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you for that testimony. I'm going to introduce,
we've heard a lot of people supporting the bill, and, and, but I have
had the tremendous honor of working with the primary sponsor, Bob Bryan,
who is in his first term but you would never be able to tell it. He has,
uh, he has been a stalwart, he has worked across the aisle, he has
wanted to make sure that we all have input and he woul-, he's a great,
great listener and I think that he's one of the, one of, one of the uh,
one of my favorite people to have been able to work with and so, without
further ado, I will introduce Rob Bryan to explain this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I really appreciate Daryl [spelling?] and my
fellow bill sponsors, it really has been a privilege to work with, with
each of, each of you, and hopefully you'll note the relative age in
terms of us. We are a young crowd and I think, um, that says something
about [laughter].
[laughter]
I am gonna go through the bill. I what you real briefly give you a
little of my background. I am a humble dirt lawyer, and you may ask,
&quot;Why on earth am I interested in education?&quot; I actually grew
up here in Wake County, a product of Wake County public schools. My mom
was a public school teacher. I got a great education here in the public
schools. After college I had the privilege of going to Las Angeles, to
an inner-city, low-income community, and taught in a bilingual classroom
for two years. For a program called Teach for America that many of you
are probably familiar with. It was a fantastic experience and it really
shaped some of the trajectory for me as I looked at, as I thought about
education and how to make sure kids in low-income and working families
were getting the right opportunities. And I think, again, when we look
at education, it's like a table with different, different legs to hold
it up. And this is just one of those legs to help support the table that
is education for our kids. And this is one that provides them, I think,
some opportunities that, that they're presently not able to act on. And
just when, I saw the Children's Scholarship board up here, when we moved
to Charlotte after, after law school, my wife was, I think, the first
administrator of the program, so I have, also have a, just heart, heart
for that program and it was, it was fun for me to get to see the fact of
the impact it's had in my own district. Which I realize now, I am, in
district 88 in Charlotte, so it would be remiss not to, not to mention
that.</p>

<p id="45:00">
Let me run through what the bill does as quickly as I can. For some of
you that have seen the bill. There is some pretty substantial changes to
it that I'm gonna run through for you. Obviously, fundamentally this is
a bill that provides scholarship grants to eligible students, in none
public school like. Like me, the schools you heard from, appear the
maximum reward amount is 42 hundred-dollars. The program is going to be
administered by state education assistance authority, and there is a two
year phase. The first year we have an allocated 10 million dollars
toward the program. Eligibility is awarded two types of students. They
have to be enrolled in a public school during the 2013 spring semester,
and they qualify for free or reduce lunch. This is the upcoming school
year and again the maximum scholarship amount would be 42
hundred-dollars. In year two we have an appropriation 40 million
dollars. Some of the requirements change in year two. And let me run
trough those. You  have to reside in a house with an income,  not in
excess of 133% of the amount required to qualify for a free or reduce
lunch. And then you have to have not received a high school diploma jet
and meet one of the following criteria. You have to have been a full
time student in NC public school the prior semester. Receive a
scholarship grant the prior year. So if you receive the grant, free to
continue to receive  grants. To be entering kinder garden or first
grade. You can be in foster care of if you been adopted in the past
year. ?? acknowledge certain of those special situations. There is also
a prioritisation that the state education assistance authority will give
to the awards. Will have a date certain by which you have to apply. The
fist priority will be to students who received the award the prior year.
We wan to keep the students in the program. After that the funds have to
be use in the following order. At least 50% of the new scholarship go to
students who qualify for free or reduce lunch. So again that sort of
first year level. then no more that 35% can be warded to students
entering kinder garden or first grade. And then any remaining funds are
to any body else who is eligible. Just to add, the amount I told you was
42 hundred. If you are a free or reduce lunch or below on your income
level. You can get the full amount 42 hundred. If you were above that
amount up to the 133% amount you can get up to 90% of the 42 hundred. So
there is something in that range where the parent would also be paying.
Then  finally I wanna talk about a little bit abut. Well let me give you
a few background. On the state education assistance authority is gonna
be the administrator of the program. They are going to have some
requirements. They are going to have to verify eligibility of a certain
percentage of the applications. They are going to get annual reporting
to DPI. They are going to report annually to the joint legislative
education oversight comity on demographic, and other information on
scholar ship grants. And they are also going to report on learning gains
made. So that also of the ?? requirements on that. There is also certain
reporting requirements for the non public school that are participating.
They got to provide information on there tuition and fees. There certain
criminal background checks required. They have to provide parents
annually with written explanations regularly of student progress
including. Standardizes text scores. If there more than 25 students
enrolled trough scholarship at a particular school. They have to provide
aggregate school test performance data. As long as that information
doesn't contain personal identifiable information. They also have to
provide graduation rates for students who receive scholarships. And
there is also a financial review required for schools receiving more
than 300 thousand dollars in scholarships annually. That is 70 students
or so. And they cant require additional fees for scholarship students. I
think I have hit on all the fundamental of the bill, and I think that
were are open for questions to any of this. My folks can join me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
Who much does it cost the scholarship student ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES].
There is its actually an existing authority. We have allocated 1% which
is roughly 400 thousand dollars</p>
