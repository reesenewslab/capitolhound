<p id="00:00">
Good morning everyone. I’d like to call this meeting to order. First I’d
like to begin by thanking our pages. We have Christine Long from Senator
Berger, Kwon Anderson from Senator Bryant, Andrew Cavari from Senator
Barefoot and Odem Wilford from Senator Nesbitt. Thank you for your
service today. With us as Sergeant at Arms we have Ashley Mickens, Steve
Wilson, Ed Kessler and Billy Fritcher. We have one bill on the calendar
today, Senate bill 320. We’re going to hear some questions and comments
from members, we have a couple of people who’d like to speak and that is
our plan and agenda for today. Yes first we’ll need a motion to adopt
the PCS. Senator Cook moves. All in favor say aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Opposed nay. The ayes have it. The PCS is before you.
Senator Daniel please explain the PCS.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman. I guess this bill has been
worked on for a long time by Senator Newton and myself and some house
members who have a joint interest in the fact that both of us have a
North Carolina School for the Deaf in our districts. The deaf community
has come to us and been interested in sort of advancing the literacy
efforts of our deaf and hard of hearing children in the school system.
Basically that’s what this bill does and just so you’ll be aware, the
PCS, the only thing that was really modified in that is in section one.
There is a sub paragraph two and that was just cleaned up a little bit
to eliminate a reference to an outdated test or database. That’s the
only section that I understand was changed from the original version to
the PCS but what this bill does is it focuses on the development of
literacy for children who are deaf or hard of hearing and it does so by
monitoring their progress. We know that reading ability is so important
to educational achievement and specifically, one of the things… Probably
the two things that the bill does mostly is one, in the development of
an IEP plan for these children the parents will have an option to have a
representative from one of the residential schools there to at least
present the opportunities that are available to these children at a
residential school so that the option is presented to them by somebody
who knows about the institutions and not necessarily somebody from
another part of state government. The other thing is that it will allow
better tracking through the databases of deaf child and hard of hearing
children’s progress as they meet benchmarks and so that they will be
flagged in the database, which they are not always now, as being a deaf
or hard of hearing child. I think that’s generally the emphasis of the
bill. As far as I know there’s been no real opposition to the bill. DPS
supports the bill and I think all the state quarters that I’m aware of
basically support the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator Daniel. Senator Bryant, do you have
a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I just wanted to, at the appropriate time, move for a
favorable report and say that this is very important to our
constituencies which include the school for the deaf in my district and
I think one of the important issues I heard from the state caucus is
that often there are misdiagnoses, if you will, of some of these
students. They are presumed to have learning disabilities and there may
be communication issues and these steps, setting out and delineating
these four steps that would need to be taken will help make sure the
communication issues are clearly identified, which may be significantly
important in helping them read and communicate in addition to what other
learning disabilities may be involved and I think that would be an
important accomplishment. For that reason we ask your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Great. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If I could Mr. Chairman, I would just thank Senator
Newton and Senator Bryant for their help in developing this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Great. Thank you. I don’t see any questions or
comments. We do have two people from the audience that would like to
speak. I’d like to ask Sergeant at Arms could you ask Megan Cats to
speak for two minutes please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Hi my name is Megan Cats. I’m a resident of Wake
County. I’m a constituent of Senator Stein. Thank you all for your
service. I am here as a representative of North….</p>

D Bausch, even like you got you as senators and legislators to
reconsider this bill and we support the development of spoken language
found in children with hearing loss that overarching mission is for all
children with hearing loss to reach their potential.  You go read
Senators is clearly terrific map present majority of your constituents
in reply, it relied on stakeholders to guide your decision making when
it built with this kind of title comes across your desk.  It seems like
an army to be a good thing and we applaud your willingness to support
children with hearing loss.  This is a well-intentioned bill.  However,
there are several points which we support that they need further
refining consideration before legislation is enacted.  There are
thirteen stakeholder groups in North Carolina that serve children with
hearing loss across the state.  This bill was written by two of them in
North Carolina schools for the deaf represent ten percent of the
population of children with hearing loss across the state, about a
hundred and sixty students.  There are two thousand more children in
North Carolina in the public schools are under represented in the
composition of this bill am not here to imply that sign language in the
schools for the death by not important that they don't provide and
partner resource first-time children.  That is a small subset of
children with hearing loss and unfortunately and of course testing a
showing that the graduates and students across the board action at the
schools that I significantly lagging behind their peers in the public
schools, and it lies are going to be put into place.  AG Bell would like
to ask that stakeholders with experience in improving outcomes for
children with hearing loss that the table when offering a bill such as
this.  Thank you so much for your time and consideration.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, scouts and we do have Julia Adams elected recognition for
treatment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
good morning, my name is Julia Aventine, the assistant to him relations
for the artist, North Carolina– North Carolina has been working actively
on this legislation author for the past four years York of North
Carolina is a nonprofit organization that was founded by parents of
children with intellectual and no mental disabilities ever six years and
throughout our history, that it is really a supported educational
opportunities that recognizes students diversity, supports the child's
ability to fully included academics and creates an environment that each
child is afforded the ability to reach their full potential and
significant number of students with intellectual and development of
disabilities.  I also diagnosed with hearing loss.  The Centers for
Disease Control and prevention reports that nearly one quarter of
children with hearing loss have one or more others of elemental
disabilities such as cerebral palsy, intellectual disabilities or vision
loss.  This prepares legislation creates a framework where child is deaf
or hard of hearing will have a second monitoring monitoring their
progress through the school system.  The goal of achieving a standard
and literacy for this population and ensuring that appropriate
communication plans are made available with options for families is
critical to students have multiple disabilities, one of which is hearing
off working just achieving a standard literacy assists an individual in
securing options for higher education and for employment, and we ask you
to integrate their participation thank you sounds and we do have a
motion for the report, but we know that's a good question.  Your essay
available select with the comments of some son
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
thank you so.  Ms. Katz, a quick question, yes, the Ì evinces some
extremely well intended legislation, and I read what before charges to
the state board of education are under the no minimum jumps out at me is
being our wrong were more poorly worded, is there anything specific you
can point to that is your concern sort.  I don't know and I can stress
your name, your religion on cyanide and half an eye with North Carolina
Isabel and also speechless pathologist who has been teaching seven to
develop second language, and since nineteen ninety.  So if you look at
that.  There is a clause about teachers being highly qualified to fill
that bat is certainly a magnet every student deserves absolutely
however, as going to be very difficult to define and enforce the
legislation as teachers of the staff are required only to have a
bachelors degree.  There is no examination certification process that
they must go through to prove that they are good at what they do and
they are effective speech.  I</p>

are required to have a Master’s degree and a certification, but the
resources for specific training and teaching children to develop spoken
language is limited, so you cannot just say this person is highly
qualified without stating “This is what it takes to achieve that
designation.” In addition, there was a clause about collecting data.
Section 2, I believe it says that there will be a database, and
certainly collecting data is very important, but there’s no designation
as to what the importance… what’s going to be done with that data. It’s
going to require a lot of labor and time, and what are we going to do
with it? What we find is that long-range planning is what makes the
difference for these children. It’s sitting down with a variety of an
IEP team and giving them… saying “This is where we are. In five years,
this is where we need to be. How are we going to get there?” Collecting
data and doing an assessment is a piece of that, but it’s not even close
to all of it. And lastly, there was one more piece. It throws me at this
point. I think it was section 1.2, but I can grab my notes if I have
time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well thank you. And Senator Daniel, you had a
comment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well first of
all I guess I could sat to Ms. ??, or to the committee, really, is that
as Ms. Adams indicated, this bill has been in development for at least
two sessions, and that certainly there was no intent by the members who
were working on the bill to exclude any interest group who at any time
wanted to express an opinion or their thoughts or concerns about the
bill. So I had heard as of yesterday that the A.G. Bell Society may have
had some concerns about the bill. This is the first I’ve heard that
expressed now that it’s passed the House and it’s in a Senate committee,
but in regard to the database, we’re not developing a new database. It’s
a database that exists. This children are monitored when they’re in the
preschool years in the DHHS database, and then they’re later monitored
in the DPI database, and so this is really more of an effort to just
make that data more effective by identifying children who are deaf or
hard of hearing so that they’re flagged so they can be monitored based
on their literacy achievement. It’s not a new database. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you. Senator Bryant, you had a question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I’m only wanting to add that the comments she’s making are
really consistent with the purposes of the bill, that it does specify
and more clearly delineate a team that would need to be available to
address the complex needs that Ms. Adams described, and in section 1 and
2, the data that’s referenced is just that the data that will be used to
make decisions about the placement of the child will be identified. It
doesn’t indicate that some database would be created from that, at least
in one and two, and then he addressed the other database he referenced
that the team would have access to, the educators would have access to,
so I think some of the concerns she raises will be fleshed out by DPI,
the state board, and probably DPI as they implement these four sections,
and I think there’ll be plenty of opportunity for that, and I met
several times with Superintendent Atkinson and she’s very committed to
making sure all stakeholders who work with this population with complex
sets of disabilities will be included. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Great, thank
you. And we do have a motion for a favorable report on the floor. Any
further questions or comments? Seeing none, we do have… it needs to be
a… It’s a motion to favorable to the PCS, unfavorable to the original
bill. All in favor say aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Opposed, say nay. The ayes have it. The bill passes and meeting’s
adjourned. Thank you for your time.</p>
