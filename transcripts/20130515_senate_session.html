[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Senate Bill 523 Returns W/Refunds Filed Late Penalty.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Senator Rucho is recognized to explain the bill.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Thank you Mister President and members of the Senate. Senate Bill 523
Late Filing Penalty is an effort for us to make a clarification for the
Department of Revenue in how to handle what is a failure to file penalty
which is set at one hundred dollars. What it does do is it eliminates
any penalty for someone that has failed to file but is also due a
refund. So we've clarified that issue
completely and the Department of Revenue supports this and we had a good
discussion during the Finance Committee and I urge that you support this
bill.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Do we have any discussion or debate?
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Mister President
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Senator Clodfelter, for what purpose do you rise?
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
To speak on the bill.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Senator Clodfelter has the floor to speak on the bill.
[CHANGE SPEAKERS]
Thank you Mister President. First off, I want to say that I think as the
saying goes I appreciate the fact that this is not Senator Rucho's dog.
He's just agreed to walk it for the Department of Revenue. So I have no
quarrel with him really. In fact, I very much appreciate how far he's
been able to move the department on this bill since the original version
of the bill. And so I thank him for that and I think he has been very
mindful of the issue that I'm going to address in my remarks. For many,
many years it has been the longstanding practice of the Department of
Revenue not to penalize a taxpayer who files a late income tax return if
that return shows no tax due to the state or shows a refund due for the
state if you think about it. That's a taxpayer. The states have their
money</p>

<p id="010:00">
...has had more than the state's been entitled to, all throughout the
time period, and what's happened here is that the taxpayer's just late
asking for his or her own money back on a refund claim, and so the
policy has been, we won't impose a late filing penalty. Now if you're
late, you owe tax, you get penalized for late filing and also for
nonpayment of the tax, and I respect that; I think that's fine.
But the practice that the department has followed, I think, when they
discovered the new temp system they're going to roll out this fall,
which is going to be a great improvement in tax administration, that
maybe the law that's currently on the books was not fully consistent
with the practice that they had followed.
Now the practice that they had been following was exactly the same as
what the Internal Revenue Service follows with federal taxes. You have a
federal tax return, and you're a day late or so in filing it, and but
you're due a refund. You don't pay a late filing penalty the IRS, and
North Carolina was doing essentially the same thing as the IRS was
doing.
I actually think that's good practice. I think it sort of recognizes the
sort of realities of what happens, and if folks are a little slow
getting their own money back, that just means the state gets the use of
their money for a longer period of time. But we shouldn't penalize them
for that, and that's been the practice.
There are taxes, and again, I think Senator Rucho's addressed this in
the bill, and I agree with him on this part of the bill. There are taxes
where the department really needs to know very soon after the deadline
exactly what the filed tax collection's going to be because they have to
make distributions of that tax to other people. They have to distribute
sales tax back to local governments, they have to distribute bear and
wine excise tax back to local governments. There are other from which
they make distributions, and they really do need people to get their
returns in on time.
But for an individual personal income tax, no harm, really for the
state, no harm, really if the return is late. Again, a refund is due,
it's the taxpayer's money. We've been holding it. And so I really wish
we would preserve and clarify the law. I agree with Senator Rucho, we've
got to clarify the law, so the department knows exactly what the rule
is.
i wish, though, we wouldn't put the penalty on the taxpayer. And again,
I appreciate the fact that he's gotten it down to a hundred bucks. It's
not really so much the money here, the amount of money. It is sort of
the principle of the thing. You know, we have rules. We'll have to
follow the rules. I understand that.
But occasionally folks expect us to use a little common sense in how we
administer the rules and maybe not to be so really insistent on every i
and every t when it comes to something like this. I think folks would be
a little bit offended if they thought we were penalizing them for not
getting their own refund back in time.
So I wish what we would do with the bill is eliminate the penalty on the
individual income tax returns where there is a refund shown due on the
return. I agree with Senator Rucho on all the rest of the bill, and
again I think him for kicking the department along as far as he's kicked
them.
I'd like to go a little bit further, and for that reason I can't support
the bill in the form in which it currently stands.
The President Pro Tempore: Is there any further discussion or debate?
Hearing none, the question before the Senate is the passage of the
committee substitute to Senate Bill 523 on a second reading. All in
favor will vote aye; opposed will vote no. Five seconds will be allowed
for the vote. The Clerk will record the vote.
29 having voted in the affirmative and 19 in the negative, the committee
substitute to Senate Bill 523 passes its second reading and will remain
on the calendar.
Senate Bill 85. The Clerk will read.
Clerk: Senate Bill 85. Ordinance first reading vote...
Senator Clodfelter is recognized to explain the bill.
Sen. Clodfelter: Yes, sir, Mr. President. This is a really technical
subject, and I know you don't want to hear a lot about it. This is the
mechanics of the process for the adoption of local government
ordinances. This bill passed this chamber in the last session 49 to
nothing, with no controversy. It got caught up at the end of the House
session. We were going to try to get it over there again and see. It
really just clarifies the mechanisms for taking votes on an ordinance.
Right now, if you vote on an ordinance at the first meeting, you have to
vote it in unanimously or else you have to vote on it a second time at a
subsequent meeting. What the bill does is say that if you have had a
public hearing on that ordinance and people had a chance to see it,
gotten notice of it, and talk about it, you can adopt it in the meeting
after the public hearing by a majority vote. You don't have to vote
twice after you've had a public hearing.
Again, it was non-controversial; there was no objection to the bill from
the league or the association of county commissioners. I ask for your
support.</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson is recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President and my fellow members of the Senate.  This is a
lengthy bill but I will try to go through it very quickly in light of
our calendar. Parts I and II are purely technical and are an ERC
recommendation.
Part III is a request from DEMA and part of their efforts to fast track
certain permits.
Part IV is also another technical change sent over by DEMA.  This makes
technical corrections that more accurately reflect protected and
endangered species safeguards.
Part V is just a word change from anti venom when it comes to dangerous
snakes and so forth.
Part VB amends the statute governing the investigation of suspected
violations, seizures and disposition of reptiles.  In order words it
would require them to consultant with the zoo and with DEMA before law
enforcement officers try and collect a dangerous, venomous reptile.  Not
a bad idea.
Part VI amends the Administrative Procedure Act to provide the Wildlife
Resource Commission with temporary rule making authority for manner of
take.  They currently have rule making authority but this is just for
manner of take.
Part VII amends the definition of the term ?? as it pertains to storm
water management.
Part VIII provides underground storage tanks and systems installed after
January 1, 1991 and prior to April 1, 2001 are not required to comply
with well setback requirements.  This is a DEMA request because the
underground storage tanks and systems installed after April 1, 2011
already have the requirement for the secondary setback.  Part IX amends
the rules of the North Carolina administration code that pertain to open
burning or land clearing or right-of-way maintenance.  We are working
with DEMA to help change the rules in accordance with Secretary ?? goal
of lessening the permitting process when applicable.  Part X exempts
ponds that are constructed and used for agriculture from riparian
buffers.  This would not affect any riparian buffer rules only as it
pertains to agriculture uses and farm ponds.  Part XI amends the rules
also to provide for reduced flow alternatives to daily flow rates when
designed for waste water systems and this section would exempt proposed
waste water systems from complying with the daily flow rate or design.
There are numerous options out there for engineers to use and this
allows them to do so.  Part XI ?? provides that waste water systems with
a daily flow of less than 3,000 per day are not required to obtain state
level review for the system.  This just adds clarification because
anything over 3,000 is already regulated.  Part XII amends the
continuing education requirements for certified well contractors so they
can get their credits in a three year period instead of a one year
period but they will get the same amount of credits.  Part XIII directs
the Department of Transportation to adopt rules for selective pruning
within highways right-of-ways for vegetation which obstructs nebulous
views of property that involves agri-tourism.  Part XIV prohibits public
entities from purchasing or acquiring ownership in real property with
known contamination without the approval of the governor and the Council
of State.  In order words the municipality or county can't buy a piece
of property and it be contaminated, thinking that the state tax payers
are going to clean it up.  This sort of corrects that assumption.  Part
XV prohibits the local government from impeding the storage retention or
use of non-hazardous, recycled material, including asphalt pavement,
wrap or roof shingles in properly zoned storage facilities with
regulation of the height of recycled material stockpiles.  There is some
concern with this section and I</p>

trust senator brown senator over here to sit down and go through and put
in this bill what is to be stopped and if they came back and agreed on

need on both sides i think what i heard was it 's helping both
sides,some o these were saving money for the both sides and saving
system  we all wanted to do that it wouldn't talk that senator orthodox
we have laid people's on J committees too and that's what j committees
for is to sit down and look at bills trying to figure out in detail what

the check and pays  ?? i certainly appreciate what you have to  say and
and i agree that sincerely it is an attorney who defended both employers
and employees in the conference setting,
Speaker Changes: I think senator Daniel has raised significant concern i
think to folks continuously move forward to think about one of the think
i like for the business people to hear is that I'm not sure when you
heard it i said was some of these rules are going to make it cheaper for
the bill for the business people because it's expertise process and it
prevents your business lawyers calling by the hour i thin that was forth
considering because i did note the person who was there speaking on
behalf of this bill and great length which was curious to me right from
the beginning was a defense lawyer and I'm having done both sides of it
and understanding how the clock works i do think that's something a
body we gotta consider now with ?? I'm gonna support the bill because,</p>

just hope that as a body that we’ll take a deep breath on this when it
comes back to us again. And that we’ll work hard to make sure we have
balanced it. Because what we do want to do is make sure that we keep the
costs down and we take care of these employees as we’re supposed to do
under this body of law.
I appreciate what’s been said, and I appreciate the efforts that’s been
done by all parties. Thank you.

Substitute for Senate Bill 174. On its second reading. All in favor vote

Thirty-four having voted in the affirmative, and 14 in the negative, the

[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Nesbitt objects to the third reading. It’ll be
placed on the calendar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 182, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 182, limit appeals to Superior Court.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brunstetter’s recognized to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Members this bill comes from
an ongoing effort with AOC, the Conference of DA, the school of
government, among others, to reduce the court workload in Superior Court
and for the DAs. Particularly in view of the limited resources we’ve had
to allocate lately.
The primary sections of the bill are Section 2, which changes current
law so that if a defendant waives a revocation hearing at the district
court level, including the finding of a violation, probation, activation
of sentence or imposition of special probation, that may not be appealed
to the Superior Court. So that’s in the event of a waiver.
I’m going to go back to Section 3 in a minute because I have an
amendment for that. Sections 4, 5, and 6, which came out of a
reclassification impact study and are based upon recommendations from
Indigent Defense Services, take a variety of fairly low level
misdemeanors and make them infractions. Things such as failure to carry
a valid driver’s license while driving a motor vehicle.
I’m going to go back to Section 3, and Mr. President I’d like to send
forward an amendment, and I believe it’s on the dashboard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brunstetter moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brunstetter’s recognized to explain the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you members. When we originally prepared the
bill, what this had done was repeal GS15A-133. This is the section in
the law where if somebody files an appeal they cannot get a sentence
that is more severe than they received originally. And it led to a
series of frivolous appeals because there was really no incentive for
somebody not to keep appealing and appealing and appealing.
However, we did receive some good advice from DAs Conference and from
Advocates for Justice on another way to approach this. And that’s what
we have done. In essence, we’re not going to change current law unless
the defendant succeeds in, excuse me, unless the defendant had pleaded
guilty originally, and was trying to seek to have that vacated.
So I think this amendment will work a little bit better. As I said it’s
supported by both the Advocates for Justice and DAs agreeing on this
particular amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any discussion or debate? Hearing none, the

These are a group of business people who employ about 4,600 people in
the State and they bring in an average tax revenue to the State of about
124 million dollars a year.  Most of you have these type folks in your
community.  Those that are viable recyclers.  In 2012, we re-wrote the
laws governing medical recycling, and in that the medical recycling
industry supported many of the changes in 2012, including those
requiring recyclers be permitted, operate only at fixed locations and
that law enforcement could place merchandise or materials on hold if
they believe they were stolen.  All these they supported.  They worked
alongside the power companies who were being hit for copper theft at
their substations, and since the passage of the law in 2012 there has
been some confusion in different jurisdictions about how law enforcement
interprets the law, so, they came back to use working with the power
companies and got all the parties in line and made some clarifying
changes.  What they did was clarify the definition of a cash card
system.  It also clarified the definition of copper and how copper was
supposed to be paid for just to make sure that that was done.  I know of
no opposition other than probably one person in chamber that wishes to
address this, Senator Bryant.  She and I have talked about it
extensively.  So, I would ask for your support of Senate Bill 583.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Senator Bryant.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I will be glad to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Senator Bryant what is the purpose of your rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Senator Bryant has the floor to speak on the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I don't oppose the Bill Senator Tucker.  I think
that you've done a good job on this Bill.  There's just one point that's
outstanding on this copper issue that I want to make sure we are aware
of in the Chamber.  If you'll notice in the Bill it does clarify the
definition of copper, which defines it separately, which is a
non-ferrous metal, but if you also go down in the Bill you will notice
that copper is also a part of the non-ferrous metals.  Now, why does
that matter?  At your desk is another part of the Statute GS66-425 and
this is where Senator Tillman told me.  He said &quot;Senator Bryant you
need to tell me when you're talking about facts and when you're giving
me your opinion&quot;.  So, this is facts Senator Tillman.  Don't turn
me off yet.  If you look at this statue it said - it was not drafted in
the best format - but it says no non-ferrous metal purchases shall enter
into a cash transaction for the purchase of copper, and that was our
goal in the work that was done last year in last session to eliminate
cash for the purpose of copper in any format by card, by any manner
whatsoever.  Then you go on to say no, non-ferrous metal shall purchase
any non-ferrous metal property, which includes copper, for cash
consideration greater than 100 dollars.  Well, that's irrelevant to
copper because you can't have cash for copper.  Then it goes on to say
any payment in excess of 100 dollars per transaction shall be made by
check, money, order or cash card system.  Well, that doesn't apply to
copper because you can't get cash for copper and as far as we were
concerned when we worked on this last time that included a cash card
system.  And it also says there can be no more than one case purchase
per day for a non-ferrous metal, which applies across the board.  So,
I'm saying all this to say when you look at this statute it is murky
about the fact that you cannot do cash for copper.  There is concern in
the community that people will think you can give an ATM card for copper
and it has happened in a situation with a constituent of mine whose son
has a drug problem, took copper, and he was following him and he went to
the recycler, got a cash card and because he could get the cash card was
able to move past them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Senator Bryant go ahead and wrap up here please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Okay.  So my point is, and I want to follow up with
a question to Senator Tucker, which is, is it your position as the metal
dealers that it is the law that you cannot give cash for copper,
including a cash card.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Senator Tucker do you yield for the question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I do Mr. President.</p>

Thank you, Mr. President, members of the Senate. School buildings are
part of the educational process. The default should be that the
construction and maintenance should be left to the school board unless
there's some reason not to. What's the appropriate size of the school?
What the right location for the school? What programs are going to be
offered at the school? What facilities need to be shaped at that school
to further the educational mission of the local education agency, the
LEA, the school system. So, they should have that control unless there's
some reason they shouldn't. I want to talk to you all about Wake County,
because, frankly, this is what this bill is all about. It's targeting
the Wake County School Board, just like the redistricting bill we had a
couple weeks ago. There have been 104 major construction projects in
Wake County in the last 12, 13 years. Most of them were new
construction, because we're building six, seven schools a year, but also
some major renovations. In that time from the last major bond referendum
that was run at Wake County, the projects came in at $104 million under
budget. That was savings achieved by the Wake County school construction
office. In the last five years, they purchased 16 new parcels to build
new schools down the road and achieved the acquisition at six million
below appraised value. Wake County Public School System has won dozens
of awards for construction and design of its school facilities. Wake
County has a AAA bond rating. The school system controls three times the
amount of assets as does the county.</p>

That are you? I don't know about you and your delegations from the
counties or areas that you represent, but sadly enough that has totally
dissipated in Wake County. So that we talk among ourselves about things
as a chamber would have us do that affect a region. I told you several
weeks ago that because of this process, this legislature, meddling not
on your own free will of course, in the Wake County affairs, you're
probably gonna help ensure the failing of a billion dollar bond issue
that they're trying to put on the ballot this fall. Now, people can say
that it's not gonna happen, but I will assure you that the resistance to
doing anything given the climate that we're operating in is increasing
exponentially. So, as we make these decisions to make Wake County
different than all of the other counties, I want you to have in mind
that you're also again, contributing to the demise of one of the areas
that has helped drive this state for the last decade, decade and a half,
and is helping to set the tone for prosperity, economic development, and
job creation for the state through this century. And I hope you will
give some second thoughts to how you will push your button.

To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Robinson has the floor to speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, mister President. This morning in education I offered an
amendment which was ordered down, so I'm not gonna do that this time.
Since you're gonna vote against it again, but I do want to say as I
stand and as a person who's advocated and worked very hard in education
and not as a teacher, but as a citizen, a community advocate, a PTA
president, a board member, all the way through, I value the quality of
education and we have put a lot of, of, of confidence in electing people
who can represent all of the children in Guilford County. And I would
say that North Carolina hasn't been so bad as most of you say. We've
worked hard in this state for a very long time and we haven't done it
all right and it is not where it ought to be, Senator Tillman, but we
have worked on it, and things have improved. And in Guilford County, I
was one of those persons who helped to merge three systems where there
was inequity in school systems and there were not buildings, and then
worked on a bond to make sure we had bonds in all of the citizens of our
county across, even though some disagreed with merging three, they
worked together to make sure we could build schools. Because everybody
was concerned about their children having schools to attend. And that
was orchestrated by a school board, which represented the entire county
and those of us who worked hard. And so what we've seen over the years
is a bipartisan board, people represent all of the counties, Senator
Gunn, you met one of the persons yesterday who came out of Pleasant
Garden who has worked most of her life to make sure, first as a teacher
then a principal etcetera, to make sure that quality of educations
there, these people do have all kinds of professions, there are, some
are lawyers, some are business persons, some are PTA, and some are
parents, but they hire people in terms of construction for schools, in
terms of assessing what needs to be done. There were people on the
redistricting committee with us who were in the business of
construction. So we brought all of those disciplines into play to make
sure that Guilford County has had a good school board. It does the kinds
of things it ought to. It is able to manage and assess and determine
what needs to be done to meet the educational needs of its children. And
so this bill is going to mean it takes away the responsibility, now my
colleague, Senator Wade, will tell you the kind of commissions that say
yeah, we want that authority. The school board which has done it says
they want to retain that responsibility. And while they've not done it
all right, none of us have, but they've worked hard and they've worked
hard together, and we had a person here this morning and one yesterday
to say that. So I say first, Wake County, please don't tag us to
anything else ya'll do. Because we don't need to be tagged again.</p>

Representative: …watch school and you are not responsible for bus and
all that stuff - that is their responsibility. We are just going to

does not make any sense at all. It is just one of the worse ideas – the
only one worse than this, is the bill that says school boards get to
raise taxes – I would be against this one too. This is a bad bill. We
need to leave these school facilities with the people elected to do it,

Representative: To speak to the bill.
Speaker: Senator Huff has the floor to speak to the bill.
Representative: For those of you all that were not in education today, I
thought I would tell you all what the bill is about. The bill basically
allows the counties to be responsible for the construction, improvement,
ownership and acquisition of public school property. To me, this is
common sense legislation. It simply gives the counties the option to be
responsible for this construction. It has nothing to do with the
furnishings. It leaves the property to the management of the schools to
the school. It requires that the school boards consult with the county
commission to relay this information to the them. I try to do common
sense legislation. I am a business person and like business people
making these kind of multimillion dollar decisions. The chairman of the
Wade County School Board spoke today on education. They gave an example
of how the Wade County School Board, with the best of best of intention
but a lack of acumen, were trying to pay $8 billion for a piece of land
and got the county commissioners to back up and buy the land for $4
million. We did a pole of the uban area – actually of all the areas
involved in this process, 65% of the county commissioners are business
people, 25% are educators. I want a business person making these kind of
decisions. To this being politics, in 2010 in Wade county, it is [xx]
the democrat majority of the county commissioner voted unanimously to
take control of school construction in the county. That was the democrat
majority. It was unanimous: 7 to nothing. So much for being political. I
am doing this because it makes absolute common sense. I urge you to
support this.

Senator Parmon, do you have it yet? Is it on your screen yet? Senator
Woodard, no? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think everybody’s got it now. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Senator Brown is recognized to explain the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. What this bill does is amends the
statute to allow an insurer to cancel a worker’s compensation policy
using any method of service provided in rule 4 of the North Carolina
rules of civil procedure, and I’ll just run over the rules that are
included in that, and that’s delivering a copy to the insured or leaving
a copy with a person of a suitable age at the insurer’s home, delivering
a copy to an agent authorized by the insured, mailing and delivering a
copy using registered or certified mail, return receipt requested to the
insured, depositing a copy with a designated delivery service and
obtaining a delivery receipt, and mailing and delivering a copy using
signature confirmation. Parties work this out. I think everybody’s on
board with this. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Is there any discussion or debate?
Senator Kinnaird, for what purpose do you rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. President. Of course I don’t have it, but that’s alright. What
I want to find out is… [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Kinnaird, do you want
to ask a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I want to ask a question of the
bill sponsor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown, do you yield for a
question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Besides that, I want
us to all go back to paper, but I’ll skip that part. What I’m trying to
figure out is remember there was a series in the News and Observer about
the workers’ compensation? So many employers were simply not carrying
the insurance, and then we had people who had terrible injuries and had
lifelong industry injuries without any compensation whatsoever, so I’m
concerned over the notification, and not having seen this, I’m sorry.
What I want to find out is presently do they have to do registered or
certified mail and you are now relieving them of that responsibility and
they may do that but they must censor first class mail? Is that what’s
happening? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Kinnaird, the parties got together
to work out these issues. I can go over what the current law does if you
want me to, but I think the changes actually improve how notice is
provided. I’ll do what you’d like. If you’d like for me to go over the
current law, I’ll be glad to do that, but I think it just strengthens
the law. [SPEAKER CHANGES] If I may… [SPEAKER CHANGES] Do you want to
speak to the bill or do you want to…? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I want to speak
to the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Kinnaird has the floor to speak
to the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] It says the notice “may”. In other words,
present law is “shall”. You are no longer making them – you’re no longer
requiring them to go by registered and certified mail, and so what I’m
very concerned over is that a businessperson may get a stack of mail –
they’re going to get bills, they’re going to get junk mail, they’re
going to get all sorts of invoices, and this may not be particularly
prominent, whereas if a businessperson gets a registered or certified
mail, they will answer that. They will accept it because even if the
person who it’s addressed to isn’t there, any employee will very often
take it. This poses me great concern that you’re making what was
mandatory just permissive now, and I feel that this is a… Especially in
light of those articles that showed how many injured people were just
simply not covered by insurance so that if their employer has noticed
that there’s a cancellation, they would try to remedy that situation.
I’m very concerned over this change. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown’s recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator
Kinnaird, I guess my response, or best response to you, is the parties
have got to gather to work out this language, and I think I don’t know
of any objections to the way the language is now. That’s the best answer
I know to give you at this point, but saying that, I do have an
amendment I need to send forth. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, you can send
forward you amendment. If we can get it on the dashboard. Clerk will
read. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown moves to amend the bill. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Just hold tight for just a second, Senator. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
It’s pretty simple, really. I don’t show if anybody needs to see this
one. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Brown, you’re recognized to explain the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. President. Instead of having
it</p>

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just wanted to speak to the issue which has come up relating to the use
of Rule 4, as the mechanism for notice.  When this bill first came up in
committee, there was an alternative procedure being specified and
suggested and I actually recommended that we do it this way that could
say in a broader, more effective, more legally recognizable way of
providing notice.  I just wanted to share that with you, Senator
Kinnaird. It’s actually better protections than what were in the
original bill that was coming before us for consideration. And it
provides more protections than otherwise would have been provided for
us. I believe that those who dealt with this in committee, Senator
Apodaca and Senator ?? remember that we have ?? discussions.  It is
actually a significant improvement.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Cary?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, can I ask Senator McKissick a question, please?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, do you yield for a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you not have concerns, though, of the fact that it’s only a
suggestion that they “may” send by certified whereas before it was
“shall”?  Shouldn’t they have a belt and suspenders? Shouldn’t they have
both?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Obviously, it could almost be… You can take almost any rule and expand
upon it, but it was my understanding that based upon the way we… It has
come before us now using Rule 4 as the model for doing so.  Rule 4 is
going to provide for delivery by a deputy sheriff of notice potentially.
 Rule 4 also provides for service process by publication in some
instances. Rule 4 provides for delivery of service by certified mail.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

purpose do you rise?

Thank you sir I'll try to do a good job of explaining it for anyone who
doesn't have it. The proposed committee substitute that I'm bringing
before you has, gives the DMV some flexibility in keeping inspection
stations open or not taking the license when they find a violation.
Sometimes the owner of the inspection station is not aware that a
violation is occurring. But under current law DMV has no choice but to
suspend the license for a period of time. This bill allows some, a
waiver of that strict rule and allows the DMV to use some discretion,
and whether or not to issue a violation. Thank you.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President, members of the Senate, the Jordan Lakewater
Quality Act. Just let me start off by saying: I know that there's not a
single member in this place who does not want to see clean water in the
Jordan Lake. Not a single member. But, I also know that we were dealt a
bad hand by the core engineers and were told from day one, when they
impounded this lake, that it was going to be full of nutrients and it
was gonna be impeded.
Regrettably, this has caused a lot of folks upstream, municipalities, to
have a hardship when it comes to what they are required to do relative
to mitigation efforts upstream.  And it also has curtailed development,
it's curtailed business, and it's been tough on the tax payers. None of
this has been positive. But, the most disturbing thing is that we have
over eight years, per Deener, not seen one single improvement in the
water quality in the Jordan Lake. Not one single improvement in eight
years. Keep in mind, that's four years prior to the initiation of lake
laws and since then. Not one single improvement. Not at all. With all
the costs incurred, millions to date.
Here's what the bill does, five things: It's gonna provide historical
context that the feds knew that the lake was impaired and prior to
construction and they built it anyway. This bill clearly states the
legislative intent that the current water quality strategies are not
working and sets forth a new strategy to improve water quality of the
lake by developing new rules.
It immediately repeals related session laws and directs repeal of rules
by October of 2013. It creates an LRC study commission consisting of
five senators and five house members to research the issue during the
interim including reiteration of authority to hire technical consultants
and provide legislative proposals to the 2014 general assembly.
And finally, it directs Deener and the ?? to work with the core and the
EPA to identify mitigation strategies focusing on treatment, remediation
in or at the lake.
Folks, we got handed an impaired lake. And I mean, this thing is very
impaired. And as I mentioned, eight years of Deener, data shows us that
we've had no significant improvement and the algae issues are still
there, and we have no reason to believe that they're going to change.
Hundreds of millions of dollars later, we have no improvement.  Evidence
suggests that the deployment of unlimited resources and technology
upstream will never, will never, improve the water quality in Lake
Jordan. Right now, Cary is proposing spending two million dollars
investment on an aeration, mitigation technology for their water
treatment intake and they're in the best part of the lake and they're
spending two million dollars. It continues to put a tremendous burden on
the municipalities and the county governance as well as the private
sector. It's a tax burden on our citizens. Technology does exist today,
and this is from Deener, technology exists, that will help us in
developing new rules. It does exist and we need to take those
technologies and require--

<p id="160:00">
The new regulatory approach that maybe works. Let’s make this thing
work. There is no reason for us to continue to throw good money after
bad. Let me sum it up by saying this, “we all had the same goal, we want
assured North Carolinians”. North Carolinians can use Jordan Lake as a
source of good, clean drinking water and as a great place for recreation
and to spend time with your families. But the current rules simply are
not working. The water quality problems remain and may have gotten
worse. Let’s redirect our resources to a system that achieves positive
results. I’ll be glad to answer any questions and I appreciate your
support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Stein has the floor to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I agree with Senator Gunn at one point. The lake
is polluted. Jordan Lake has drinking water for about 300 thousand North
Carolinians. 1.2 million went to the state parks to enjoy it and
hundreds of thousands more used the boat ?? The fishermen, swimmers,
boaters, campers and it’s polluted because there’s too much algae.
Excessive nitrogen and phosphorus creates that. The way he talked about
we need a process, engage the stakeholders, come up with a way to come
up with some rules that make sense, is completely devoid of history. 15
years ago, the General Assembly enacted the clean water responsibility
act which called for rules to limit pollution in Jordan Lake and upgrade
waste water systems upstream. Required those changes to be made by 2003.
1999, several hall river communities sought a delay so there could be
some modeling, pollution modeling of the lake. That was actually a good
idea. I’d figure few years to do. ?? started the stakeholder process to
draft the rules in 2003, 10 years ago. 2005, there were draft rules
offered to deal with the pollution. But Greensboro and Burlington sought
additional delay. ?? went through a second stakeholder process. 2006,
there were 27 stakeholder meetings and ?? sent it to the environmental
management commission. 2007, 14 meetings with stakeholders in 2007 and
2008, it went to the rules review commission. Had five meetings on the
Jordan Lake rules. Throughout the entire process, all stakeholders,
municipalities, developers, agricultural interests – they were
participating at these more than 50 meetings. It already happened. It
came to the General Assembly and disapprove a bill just as we learn,
talked about earlier about the administrative process. Out of a 108 to
109 in the House and almost unanimously in the Senate, we agreed to
extend the date for Greensboro to improve its waste water treatment plan
from 2014 to 2016 and for new development ordinances we pushed to 2012.
Well, last session, you all moved the Greensboro waste water plan date
from 2016 to 2018 and the new development ordinance to 2014. Last time
?? were in 2013. Senator Gunn expresses amazement that there’s been no
improvement in the lake. The reason there has been no improvement in the
water quality of the lake is because the rules have not taken effect
yet. You all keep putting them off. I accept this notion that there are
inherent problems with Jordan Lake. It’s a shallow lake. It’s gonna have
its problems. But to conclude from that that we do nothing and we
eliminate all rules that deal with the pollution that flows into the
lake, is inane. By the same logic, somebody who is genetically
overweight shouldn’t be concerned at all about what they eat. Eat all
the sweets and sugar that they want, it’s okay because we will treat
them for diabetes. That is what this bill says. Let’s treat it at the
source, let’s not limit the amount of new pollution that comes in.
There’s not a doctor in the country who would recommend.</p>

<p id="165:00">
Such a foolish course, and yet that is precisely what this Bill does.
Again, the cost that Senator Gunn pointed to for the Jordan Lake rules.
He reported to Carey having to spend 2 million dollars to treat polluted
drinking water.  The solution in this Bill is for Carey to spend more
money to clean up even more polluted drinking water over time.  That is
not the solution.  Carey adamantly is opposed to this legislation.  The
Jordan Lake rules will improve water quality, protect public health, and
benefit the region's economy.  Eliminating these rules is incredibly
short-sided.  Carey is one of the fastest growing municipalities in the
country.  Raleigh, Carey, metro areas are the fasted growing in the
nation. It was selected as the number two best place for business and
career.  Just today, Forbes Magazine named Carey one of the best cities
for jobs. It's home to Sass, a world class institution.  Year after
year, named one of the best places in the world to work, for families.
It is home to the MetLife expansion in Charlotte, 2,600 jobs.  The State
invested tens of millions of dollars to bring MetLIfe to Carey. so what,
they could have more polluted drinking water? You pollute Carey's
drinking water and you damage our State's ability to thrive
economically, to create jobs for the people of the State, and for the
people of Carey to contribute mightily to the general fund through the
income taxes and the other taxes it pays.  This is an extremely
short-sided bill.  To eliminate the rules that have been under
construction for fifteen years, it is completely a historic.  It assumes
that nothing has been worked on, that no prospectives were included.
Please, vote against this legislation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Senator McKissick for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Speak on the Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  Senator McKissick has the floor to speak on the
Bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]:  I think we can all share concern about the water
quality in Jordan Lake and that's simply what everybody tried to do.
You hear about this going on for fourteen, fifteen years.  Well, I have
been intricately involved in this process for at least five of those
years, and I know that all of the stakeholders came together, all the
communities that were impacted, the upstream communities, as well as
those that use this as a water supply today and understand the Core of
Engineers has issued authorization for many of the communities in this
area to draw water from this lake at some point in the future.  They may
not be drawing it today but at some point in the future they may, so
it's in everybody's vested interest to protect this very valuable
commodity.  That's what all the stakeholders attempted to do.  To come
up and craft a set of very fairly and balanced set of rules that we can
all live by.  That wasn't very long ago and here we are four years down
the road, three years down the road, we've postponed a number of
deadlines.  We're really not giving it a chance to be fully implemented.
 It's not to say there may not be new emerging technologies, there might
not be new strategies or approaches or new methodologies that can be
improved upon other than what's in this existing set of rules that we
have.  I would like to see us pursue those new technologies.  I would
like to see us explore what else can be done, but I don't want to see us
abandon what we have until something new and better can be devised and
put in effect.  I think when you repeal what we have without coming up
with a new set of rules, a new set of regulations, a new set of
strategies to protect the water quality in Jordan Lake, then we've got a
problem.  To go out there now and abandon the hard work that went into
this for all the stakeholders would be a tragedy of justice to be honest
with you.  It really is the wrong thing to do and is extraordinarily
short-sided.  If Senator Gunn wants to work on new methodologies, if he
wants to pull together that stakeholder group again together to have a
see what could be done, then I will work with him as vigorously as
possible to see that that can be done as expeditiously as possible.  It
is my understanding from looking at the Bill that he would like to look
at some alternatives.  My only thing I have to say to Senator Gunn is
lets look at alternatives and come up with solutions first before we
totally abandon what we have today.  There will certainly be communities
that have</p>

&lt;h3&gt;they will bear. We all have to bear those costs. That's part
of us living upstream from any water supply. If we want to protect that
water quality for those downstream communities. And yes, those that draw
the water out today need to be also contributing to that. I know I've
had a study bill, that, filed this year we filed it once before, we've
never gotten around to doing it. But one of the things that we'll look
at is how you hear that burden, and hear that cost, between upstream
communities and the downstream beneficiaries that may be drawing from
that water supply. WE need to balance the cost of implementing measures
that mitigate pollutants that's going into the water supply. But most
importantly we need to work together to pull together the state ??
approve that come up with alternatives. But to go and cast away what
we've carefully devised without an alternate being in place that we can
implement I think is a short sighted and a doomed approach.

Senator Woodard, for what purpose do you rise?

Speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. Jane Jacobs, the mother of modern urban
planning, wrote in her seminal book The Death and Life of Great American
Cities that building a dream city is easy. Rebuilding a living city
takes imagination. And I believe for us to fix the ?? Jordan Lake will
take a lot of imagination. And unfortunately I don't see that
imagination in this bill. I have the unique position of having sat on
the local government side of this bill for most of their life. In 2005 I
joined the city council about the time you all were approving, or EMC
was sending us the first round of rules. I've lived there, I've sat with
them. I've been in meeting after meeting with storm water staff members.
I have three notebooks in my office I brought from Durham city hall,
because I knew I'd need them here. And sure enough I did. I've sat with
developers trying to figure out how we could save a deal as we went
through these rules. From that perspective I speak to you today. You've
already heard how Jordan Lake is going to be a source of drinking water.
We've heard about Cary. But it also includes Apex and Holly Springs and
Morrisville. It includes unincorporated parts of Wake County when they
need water. It includes the research triangle park, the economic engine
of this part of the state. It includes communities served by Owasso, and
in Chatham County a growing part of our region that includes
incorporated parts of Cary in Chatham County. It's an important
recreational destination and there are a lot of business that rely on
the recreation in Jordan Lake. But as Senator Gunn has correctly pointed
in down there I have where you can see nothing but green all across the
lake. And we need to repair it, or it's going to threaten many economic
engines in this region. But how do we clean it up? And what are the
costs that are going to be associate? When you all finished with the
rules in 2009, a unanimous vote in this chamber, near unanimous across
the lobby. And even before that, I've sat there in the city of Durham,
and we began working, we began implementing, we began planning and
working with our developers, our chamber of commerce, our local
businesses on how we were going to implement these rules. So I've lived
in, now, for four years plus. During this time, now we've heard from
critics &quot;well, it's been a lot of cost. Our construction's down,
it's hurting our economy&quot;. While we were living with the rules in
the city of Durham, construction up, new home construction, up. New home
sales, up. Unemployment, down. And we have approved a number of projects
in the Lake Jordan water shed. We were able to work through these rules.
I've been there, I've helped negotiate with developers in our planning
department. We've been able to work with these rules and keep our
economy growing. And we didn't agree with all the rules. Let me tell
you, we fought like heck on many of them. We challenged the science in
many times. IN fact local environmental group sent out an email in which
its executive director called me an environmental bully. Me, an
environmental bully. So we didn't agree with-

small but we found ways to work with them. They haven’t worked? Well
that’s a specious argument from folks upstream because we’ve proven that
we can make them work in Durham over these last few years. We’ve taken
steps while others decided to sit on the sidelines and pray for a more
favorable group here in the General Assembly. We’ve implemented those
rules. Others just asked for more time. So sure, they’re not going to
work if you don’t work with them. And their sign talked about weight
loss, my doctor wants me to lose a little bit of weight. But until I
start getting to the gym, ya’ll start letting me out of here at a
reasonable hour, we’re not going to know if I can lose any weight. So of
course they haven’t worked, nobody’s implemented them yet. And it’s
going to take time. Remember we didn’t get, I didn’t get fat overnight,
this Lake didn’t get impaired overnight. I’m not going to be thinner
over time, Jordan Lakes not going to be cleaner in just a few years with
no rules in place. Now all of this work that started here back seven
eight years ago was done under the specter of the Clean Water Act, and
we cannot forget that. EPA, under these rules, would allow a
supplemental permit. Allow all of us to develop and to expand in the
basin with a total management daily load. Technical term there, but we
have to be responsible stewards of that EPA permit. And I believe this
action is irresponsible and will raise EPA’s attention even more with
other regulations that are leaving this General Assembly this summer.
And what’s going to happen is we run the risk of EPA stepping in and
taking away that supplemental permit. What’s the net result of that
ladies and gentleman? Your developers, mine, yours upstream will then
have to go to the region four office of EPA in Atlanta and get their
individual permits. Is that what you want to do? You talk about adding
cost to your development, you let your individual home builders your
developers go fight with EPA to get their permits in Atlanta. We also
run the risk of EPA suing the state for not following the tenants of the
clear water act. That drives up litigation costs and every time we delay
and EPA is just waiting with their rules it’s gonna just cost us more
and more to implement these rules however they come down. This morning a
number of us heard Secretary Decker talk about her five tenants of a
healthy economy. The two of them, for those of you who weren’t there,
that I would like to share with you. One was health. She said that our
economy is not going to improve until we’re a healthy state, and that we
have a better quality of air and water. And the second was a quality of
life that encourages a good clean environment. I believe this bill
challenges two of those tenants that the secretary shared with us this
morning. I’m sorry my recycling truck came to my block today because I
would’ve loved to have brought you Saturday’s real estate section. Some
people still advertise in the newspaper by the way in spite our efforts.
The real estate section out of Saturday’s paper, where you see an add
from a developer, whose developed a great project in the Jordan Lake
water shed in southern Durham. We worked with this developer, I worked
very hard because that’s in my former city council district. We worked
very carefully with this developer so they could navigate these rules
and have a development that would sustain whatever the Jordan Lake rules
are. Well he fought, we were still fighting him at the time that this
development started. But ultimately we were able to get there, and now
when you see his half page add every Saturday he touts proximity to I40
to the good jobs at UNC and at Duke, proximity to South Point Mall. But
the second bullet in his add every Saturday says minutes from beautiful
Jordan Lake, that’s what he’s selling with this project. Ladies and
Gentleman of the Senate we can have a beautiful Jordan Lake that
provides safe drinking water for three hundred thousand plus people in
the region that</p>
