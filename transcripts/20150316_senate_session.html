[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I&#39;d like to change my vote on the last one to no, as
well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would respectfully submit that neither of these guys know what the

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Davis changes his vote to no. Final count was 47-2. Senate Bill
185, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate Bill 185, clarified credit for time served.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Daniel is recognized to speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the Senate. This bill is
geographically neutral. It comes to us from the North Carolina
Sentencing Commission, which I sit on along with Senator McKissick and
Senator Brown. This is a recommendation of the commission to clarify
credit for time served. Apparently, across the state there&#39;s some
confusion in the way different courts allow a defendant who&#39;s been
in pretrial confinement, whether or not his pretrial confinement counts
towards his ultimate sentence. Specifically, the bill will clarify that
if the conduct for which you are ultimately convicted was part of the
same incident then you would receive credit for time served for that,
even if it&#39;s not a lesser included offense. So, if there&#39;s any
questions, probably Senator McKissick can answer them but that&#39;s the
gist of the bill. It should make the treatment of defendants and time
served more uniform across the state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any discussion or debate? Senator Tillman, for what purpose do
you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I wanted to ask Senator McKissick a question but I
thought better of it. I would like to ask Senator Daniel a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Daniel, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, please don&#39;t suggest that I ask Senator McKissick another
question. If you&#39;re convicted of the same crime, time served in
pretrial counts as time served?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Now unrelated cases and what they&#39;re tried, that has nothing to do
with the pretrial and days served, that&#39;s a totally different
matter? I heard something about that and I&#39;m not on J2 therefore
I&#39;ve got a, that&#39;s...
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To answer your question, Senator Tillman, if the defendant is convicted
of a crime that&#39;s different from what he was in pretrial confinement
for and which is not related to the same incident, then he would not get
pretrial confinement allocated towards his ultimate sentence.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, that clears it up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question before the
Senate is the passage of Senate Bill 185 on its second reading. All in
favor vote aye, opposed vote no. Five seconds will be allowed for the
voting, the clerk will record the vote. Blue, Bryant, aye, Sanderson,
aye, 48 having voted in the affirmative and zero in the negative Senate
Bill 185 passes its second reading, without objection

[APPLAUSE]
Do we have any notices or announcements? Senator Van Duyn, for what
purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The democrats have caucus directly after session.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other notices or announcements? Senator Apodaca, for what purpose do
you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, I have a announcement/personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You have the floor, Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. Members, we had planned to hold a Nominations
Committee meeting later this week. I think the committee needs to hold
off. Earlier today a Wake County trial court ruled that the Coal Ash
Commission is unconstitutional. Its work is on hold immediately for
appeal. Needless to say, I am concerned. If the opinion stands, it
represents a monumental shift in how the General Assembly and the
Executive Branch have done business since the 19th century.
Respectfully, I think each of you should be concerned too, regardless of
party. At this time, I believe the right thing to do is to move slowly
in studying the opinion and allow the question to be decided by the
North Carolina Supreme Court. Therefore, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s
appropriate for the Nominations Committee to meet until the decision is
handed down. Thank you, Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator. Any other notices or announcements? Any further
business to come before the Senate? If not, the Chair recognizes Senator
Berger for a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President. I move that the Senate do now adjourn, subject
to the standard stipulations set forth in rule 24.1, the receipt and
referral of committee reports, the receipt of conference reports, the
ratification of bills, the appointment of conferees, messages from the
House, to reconvene on Tuesday, March 17, 2015 at 2:00 PM and, Mr.
President, before we take that motion a short announcement, Conferees on
Senate Bill 20 will not meet tonight.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator. The motion is that the Senate do now adjourn,
subject to the stipulations stated by Senator Berger, to reconvene
Tuesday, March 17th and 2:00 PM, seconded by Senator Brock. All in favor
say aye, opposed no, the aye&#39;s have it. The Senate stands adjourned.
