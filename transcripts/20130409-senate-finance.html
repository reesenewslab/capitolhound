And welcome, we'll begin today with the introduction of our Sargent of
Arm's staff Anderson Meadow, Earnest Sheryl, Justin Owens, And Steven
Wilson. We have the four corners covered. Ready for prayer. Our pages
today are Samatha Sparks, my niece, from South Port, Morgan Bass from
Farmville, Morgan welcome. Sophia Stoddard from Rollsville. ?? barefoot.
And Ruth Smith from Wilmington. Senator Goolsby's page. So welcome to
you all, I hope you're enjoying your time in the senate today. Ladies
and gentlemen we're going to talk about income tax reduction and reform.
This is simply informational meeting today. And we will, after senator
Rucho presents we will open the floor, of course with questioning and
comments from the committee and then from the members of the public. If
you'd so like. This is just part of a, our goal to create a
comprehensive new and fair tax program in North Carolina. The bottom
line being to enhance the economy and to create jobs. It's not an easy
task, but we're going to go through this step by step.
And at the end of the day, not today, but when we get things together,
we will wrap everything into one package and then present in that way.
So with that, I'll recognize my co-chair, Senator Rucho. And he will do
today's presentation. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chairman and
members of the finance committee. Thank you. This is the next
installment of comprehensive tax reform. And ladies and gentlemen of the
finance committee and audience. This is a very very critical issue for
the state of North Carolina. And as you can see, the amount of time that
we're spending getting this information out so that we cannot only
inform our colleagues in the senate and hopefully in the house, but also
the public and business community because we would love to have their
input as we move forward. Because as senator Rabin alluded to our goal
is to create positive economic activity, job creation and long term
prosperity. And the only way you can do that is by doing comprehensive
tax reform and changing what is a outdated 1930 model of both economic
model and also the tax policy. So to do so is very critical for this
general assembly.
We're going to be discussing today Senate Bill 677 corporate income tax
reduction and reform. Senator Clidefeld presented some good information
the other day on his bill. Senator Brock presented some good information
on the simplification and transparency of the franchise tax and trying
to again make it both simple and closing as many of the loophole tax
preferences that have, have actually gone through this entire tax system
and we're going to go ahead and continue today in that same vein. I
think you have a summary sheet in front of you that you can follow. I'm
going to briefly outline some overview and then Jonathan Tart and I
think Mike Hannah will provide us some information regarding some more
details on this and then I'm sure Senator Rabin will open it for
discussion of the committee.
But what the goal is starting in 2014, we would drop the corporate
income tax rate to 6.5%. We in 2015 going to 6.25, 2016 and after 6. And
hopefully to zero as revenues allow. What this does is it starts to
dismantle one of the onerous taxes in our tax ?? because economists will
tell you that income taxes, when you tax investment, you tax savings,
you're basically having the detrimental effect on</p>

<p id="05:00">
economic growth and job creation and as was eluded earlier, we're
talking about 61% of our revenue stream is based on income taxes both
corporate and personal. What we are trying to find is a broad based tax
policy that will eliminate the owners taxes, provide us an opportunity
to create a pro-growth economy and then in doing so, be able to create
the jobs that each of us promised as we were running for election. The
second part, and again having talked with many, many people and many,
many business people, talked about what was an issue dealing with the
apportionment factors, and I do have a chart I'll provide you. We're on
a limited budget in the general assembly so we could only get two color
copies, but needless to say, we will be able to explain very clearly
what we are trying to accomplish with this. We want to move towards a
single sales factor apportionment over a three year period of time. Now,
we aren't leading the charge on this Virginia, Georgia, and South
Carolina have already moved in this direction and they did it for a
number of good reasons. One of them being simplicity, but also what this
does is encourages corporations to move their operations and their jobs
to North Carolina by emphasizing less on taxes and put it on the issue
of sales tax, excuse me their issue of their goods and/or services. This
involves a multi-state business apportionment, both on income and on
franchise tax. What we have as part of this bill is a three year
transition, going from what today is a double weighted factor. Now, I'm
going to pass one of them around, just for you to see it and then, I'll
pass the other around. The point being is today, there are three factors
sales, property, and payroll. Now, what the property and payroll are,
are investments in North Carolina because people will put that money
into North Carolina if they find it to be a reasonable investment and
one that isn't taxes ??, and on the payroll that is what you create
jobs. Well, in 2013, which is what we presently have today, we have a
double weighted factor on sales, then we have one factor on property,
and one factor on payroll. In that situation that double weighted factor
generates, well would actually give 50% towards sales. We want to move
it to 100% of sales, which is the ultimate goal of our effort. To do so,
we will move in 2014 to a triple weighted and you can see the three
factors here, out of five. If you read in your summary and also in the
bill, you'll see the description of this, so you will see that as we
move to the next year, 2015 a larger portion is on sales. Then, lastly
in 2016 it will be all on sales. What this does is we emphasize the tax
liability or reducing the tax liability on both property investment and
on job creation. It puts North Carolina into a competitive environment
of creating jobs and creating investment, as far as the well. I'm going
to pass this around on the other side to. Now, as we move forward we're
also talking about eliminating the following adjustments, deductions,
and credits effective in 2014. I know last year we purposely handed out
what was the best bi-annual tax expenditure report that was given to
everybody. If new members of the finance committee don't have it we can
get it. This was just released in 2007, that's our latest number. There
are $9 Billion dollars worth of tax expenditures that go basically out
the back door without any approval from general assembly, because of
deductions of sales tax, exemptions of sales tax, a lot of what some
folks might call loopholes. Well, this bill, Senator Brocks portion of
the bill, and the future portions of the bill on personal income tax,
and ultimately sales</p>

[Speaker changes.] ....do it's very best to eliminate as many of these
loopholes as we can possibly do so and what that does is it makes the
overall process simpler, easier for both businesses and individuals to
comply with and should allow for easier compliance and a...what would
turn out to be a more stable revenue stream for the General Assembly
budget. Some of the other high points as we're moving through...again
we're talking about eliminating adjustments, deductions and credits
effective in 2014. We're talking about conforming a lot of our laws, the
ones that we don't eliminate to the federal law because it doesn't give
us any advantage to have two different tax systems, all it does is it
makes the job of complying and enforcing it a lot more complicated. And
so the next part that we'd be looking at is moving from what is an
economic loss to a net operating loss and you can see the details in
there.   Just to briefly say that we are working on a transition plan
which is under discussion to allow for that transfer to occur but we're
moving from NEL to NOL, which will allow for our businesses to determine
their tax liability and provide certainty which is something that we've
strived from day one and I think some of you who have been here
before...last year when we did the combined returns provision or the
law, which has worked out very well because of the fact that it did
provide simplicity, certainty to the business community when they came
in to the Department of Revenue, everybody knew what the rules were,
which was an unusual occurrence because too many times because of all
the grey and complexity, some of the...most of the folks really didn't
know what they were and it almost seemed like it was made up as it went
along. So what we're trying to do from that point and here in a bigger
manner, in a more comprehensive manner...trying to eliminate that
complexity and the confusion. We're also going on to eliminating some
additional deductions and inclusions which again are some additional
loopholes.  We're talking about reporting...a reporting options for
inter-company interest expense paid to affiliates and what that does is
it reduces corporate tax planning and provides options to treat
inter-company interest/income expenses similar to how they do royalties.
 We're trying to make everything seem like it fits together and there is
some consistency in the process. I think, at this point Mister Chairman,
if Mr. Tarte would be able to go through the bill in more detail, we can
probably...
[Speaker changes.] Certainly, would you like to start with Jonathan or
Cindy?
[Speaker changes.] Well, Senator Rucho did a good job of describing any
of the provisions in the bill.  I could walk through the fiscal note as
a guide to give a little bit more detail.  If you turn...I believe it's
the next to the last page in your packet, you should see a table of
fiscal impact. First of all, these changes are effective starting with
the 2014 tax year and, keep in mind, our fiscal year ends June 30th so,
in the fiscal year 13-14, that results in a partial year impact that you
see coming down that column and then the full year impact of these
changes will kick in at 14-15 fiscal year. And they begin to grow a
little bit in the out years and that is primarily the result of phasing
in the rate reduction and the phasing in of the single sales factor
apportionment.  The reduction in the rate, you see there starts about 29
million dollar impact in the first partial year growing to about 169
million in 17-18 when we're at the 6% rate.  The apportionment again
goes from one-half weighted??????? sales to about 60% weighted?????
sales in 2014 to about 70% weighted???????? sales in 2017 before the
property payroll ???????? are completely eliminated, starting with the
2016 tax year.  We do show the breakout between the income tax ???????
and the franchise....</p>

<p id="15:00">
Impact us as taxpayers do a portion of their franchise tax base as well
if they’re multi-state. The next item is this bill does conform with the
federal treatment of losses. Currently tax payers have to do separate
calculations for the federal NOL and North Carolina NEL. This would
eliminate that. Next on the list, corporations currently are entitled to
a deduction for their charitable contributions. Generally speaking that
is up to 5% of their income. This bill would eliminate that deduction.
Also, under current law, corporations that receive a deduction for
dividends from subsidiaries have to allocate a portion of their expenses
to that non-taxed income. However there’s a preference in the law for
bank holding companies and for electric power holding companies that
limits their liability under this provision. This bill would take away
that tax preference for those entities. There is also under current law
a credit equal to 25% of the appraised value of property donated for
conservation purposes. This bill would eliminate that credit, with some
savings there. And then finally the last item on the fiscal table is to
eliminate a number of miscellaneous tax credits, deductions and
exclusions from income that are in excess of what’s allowed for federal
tax purposes. So this is another effort at simplification there. So the
bottom line on the state impact is a revenue loss of about 32 million in
the fiscal year 13-14, about 111 million 14-15, 235 15-16, 331 for 16-17
and in the fifth and the last year we have showing about 345 million.
There is some local impact with the bill. Under current law 7.25% of
corporate income tax collections are accredited to the public school
building capital fund. So to the extent these changes reduce corporate
income tax collections, there would be some impact on that local fund.
If you turn to the next page of the fiscal memo, if you’re interested in
more of the detail, there at the bottom of that page, the top just talks
about the rate change and the apportionment that we’ve covered. At the
bottom you can identify some of those miscellaneous tax credits that are
being eliminated. And on the last page, well page 4 there, that fiscal
note. In the middle of the page, the bulleted items. That identifies a
number of deductions that are in excess of what’s allowed for federal
tax purposes. That would also be eliminated. And finally, the bill does
repeal some obsolete provisions. If you get to the bottom of that page
there, payments associated with some disaster relief reserve funds are
also eliminated in the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Rucho, would you
like to? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank you
Mr. ?? for helping explain what this bill is trying to accomplish. As
was discussed when Senator Brock presented his information, you have to
take into consideration the fact that again, this is one portion of a
comprehensive plan and the reason why we broke it up is because of the
complexity of each of these pieces. We want members of the finance
committee and the public to understand this portion along with the part
that Senator Brock presented the other day, and don’t get confused about
the fact that you see negatives on state impact and the local impact
because once the package is put together, you will see that the
liability for the locals will be approximately revenue-neutral. And you
will also see the state liability not in the negative range, where there
will be either revenue-neutral or some savings in that sense. So I want
you to understand you need to take this on as one portion of about four
pieces of comprehensive tax reform. Mr. Chairman, any questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. Questions from the committee? Senator
Tucker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair.</p>

<p id="20:00">
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rucho, I know you’re about being revenue neutral, I
know you’re about economic growth because of this tax reform. All of
those things have been your mantra ever since you embarked on this, what
I call difficult task to do. Things like people who manage assets, their
expenses to manage those assets are going to be eliminated from the
deduction. Do you think that those fees will be passed on to the
individuals who own those investments?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator, Tucker,  what we’re trying to do with this
is, if you put together the parts and say for example, corporate income
tax is being decreased, the single sales factor is another issue that
what we’re finding the way of saving the cost in there. So I think when
you add it all together, we hope to approximate revenue neutral. And to
be honest with you, the only groups who may impact differently would be
ones that have received the tax preferences that we talked about in this
expenditure book. And So when you look at it on a comprehensive basis, I
would suspect, that, at least for these portions, let’s not talk about
the sales tax part because that’s gonna have to be presented at another
time where we’re going to find some of this revenue stream that we’re
going to make up with. I would suspect that there wouldn’t be any
significant impact there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up, Mr. Chiar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes Sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Two More questions: explain to me what you’re doing
about corporate charitable contributions, that certainly impacts the
community, and then if I understood you correctly, you made the
statement about 7.5% of corporate tax that goes to counties for schools,
how is that gonna be replaced? Because you elimate that, and we’re
certainly going to hear from back home.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I’m going to let Mr. Charter explain that part
of it, if I can. But I will talk to you about the corporate tax
charitable contribution. What we are trying to do with the overall
package, Senator Tucker, is to try to treat everybody the same. And what
that means is, if corporations choose to support a charity of their
choice, they can do so, but it shouldn’t include everybody else paying
for that choice to be able to move that charitable deduction. Right now,
if I give a charitable deduction, as far as my business is concerned,
you’re helping to pay for my charitable choice. And I don’t believe
that’s fair because if you run through the entire package, what we are
trying to do is make sure that everybody is treated the same. And that
if you decide to make a choice with your money, then you do it  of your
own volition because you believe that charitable organization merits
your decision. It shouldn’t be because of a tax policy. Economists will
tell you: taxes should not impact business decisions, and that’s what
we’re trying to avoid across the board.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And he has one question, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Under the current statute provides for 7 1/4% of
corporate income tax collections to be transferred to that public school
capital fund. However, those transfers have been suspended since 2008;
haven’t been made. The appropriations decision I think is the best
answer I can give you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Apparently, Senator Tucker, it hasn’t been fulfilled.
So in essence, there’s no loss.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Hise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] My question is on the single bills factor. I guess the
first is just trying to come up with a clarification and make sure I’ve
got this right. We have three ratios we look at: payroll, property, and
sales. And we already double-weight sales. So in one year we’re going to
add sales in three times to the formula than the next year, then five
times to the formula, then we’re kind of getting rid of everything else
except sales. Is that an overall description?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, it’s exactly correct because in reality we
would welcome businesses from out of North Carolina to come here, and to
invest their money, as far as not being taxed on property, not to be
taxed on jobs, payroll. So therefore they would only be taxed on a sales
component. And from what I understand from Senator Rabin, everyone will
be treated the same in that basis. So we are encouraging investment…</p>

<p id="25:00">
...in North Carolina.  And if we make any error, what we are trying to
do is, be sure that North Carolina Companies, the ones that are here
that are employing North Carolinians, can either expand or do well here.
And that's why this is there.  This is why we are moving to the sales
factor. Mostly for simplicity and the like.  And I will tell you, the
simplicity makes the overall administration easier.
Now, I would be thrilled to sit down and tell you exactly how to
formulate that.  But I would probably bore you to death.  You and I can
probably talk about it in more detail. To calculate the fact that as we
go from 2013, 2014, the corporate liability will be reduced because of
the sales factor.
And ??
Yes Sir.
With the category of details, I guess my questions are coming around.
If a business in North Carolina makes an internet sale, for the
company,where... is it the customers of North Carolina that count
towards North Carolina's portion of the sale or is it...  I know that we
are kind of dancing around some Federal issues but I am trying to see
how this plays in with internet sales.
Senator [sp] Roocho would you like Jonathan to handle that or...?? Okay,
go ahead.
Right now, something that we had been struggling right along is internet
sales. It's in the vicinity of $200,000,000.00 and plus dollars that
we'd loose that opportunity.  And what's bad about it is, a brick and
mortar, mom and pop businesses that exist in North Carolina; that hire
North Carolinians to be employed in their area to their economic
disadvantage because of the fact that at least whatever the sales tax
is, they are at an economic disadvantage.  We are going to do everything
we can under the law to go after this area of... of course this is out
of the realm because it is in sales tax, but we are going to do our very
best to go after their...And I think they're some changes happening now
as we speak. A number of internet companies have negotiated with South
Carolina, Virginia, Massachusetts and the like.  I think some
handwriting is on the wall.  I think that what will happen sooner than
later, that because of individual state negotiations, congress will
start to lead from the rear and actually pass some legislation that will
allow for states to collect internet sales in a manner.
The other part that you are alluding to is the fact that, in North
Carolina today, and I'm hoping everybody understands this. You buy
something, you paying sales tax.  You buy something from out-of-state,
you still have the liability of a use tax.  And you have the obligation
to pay that tax.  And so that is in place and I am sure that the
Department of Revenue will aggressively enforce this as we move closer
to a consumption based tax. And, therefore, the people that do buy
out-of-state will have their obligation to pay that sales tax in the
State of North Carolina, since that's where the end product was
purchased.
Thank you.
Senator Heist would you like Jonathan to follow up?
Let me, Let me say something ?? been looking for..When we are looking at
the ratio of sales to the company, which, is it the North Carolina side
or the out-of- State side that internet sales are falling into in that
ledger?
I guess you can work on it from a number of ways depending on the
scenario you want to discuss.  I will present one for you.  If you have
a North Carolina business that is making internet sales of goods.  If
the destination, the consumer is out-of-state, that will be an
out-of-state sale.  Right now, you have a property payroll of sales
factor where the sales factor is double weighted.  So for example if,
the company had only 2%.., big company, they're spread all over the
country, they had only 2% of their sales in North Carolina, but they had
50% of their property payroll here, then out of the current formula with
twice the sales and using those other factors,?? you're going to get
about 25% apportionment factor.  So 25% of their income will be
apportioned for taxation.  If you go to a single sales factory, you
would have 2% of it apportioned in that example for taxation.
Very good.
Senator Jenkins?
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
Senator [sp] Raycho, as you've outlined, I think I'm correcting what I
am getting ready to say is that, they are four pieces to your tax
modernization.  The corporate income tax piece which we are looking at
here.  The business or franchise tax that Senator Barrack presented a
couple weeks ago...</p>

<p id="30:00">
So we got the personal income tax piece and the sales tax last
consumption piece to go. Is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. What is your schedule on, on getting the other two pieces so
that we will be looking at the whole?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think each person should really spend some time in understanding the
components. We are working diligently trying to get information on how
to be sure that the municipalities and the counties are kept as whole as
all possible and that information is challenging to find, but we believe
we are in the process of gathering that information and I would suspect
either next or the week following, you should, probably the week
following, you should be able to see the other components come into
play.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. Because it would take, if I'm understanding it with these
pieces, to stay revenue neutral, we've got to find some revenue, which
would be the sales, the consumption piece of it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would say you're right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So a couple of weeks would be the target for it, because I saw on WRL
today, I know I'm not supposed to ?? for them but, that the governor of
Louisiana has pulled back his bill that was similar to this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I think what I gathered from Indiana, and if you look at in
studying these issues, you see some of the areas in some of the
different states that have not succeeded, and if you look at Louisiana,
well I'll take you back, if you look at Georgia when they first tried to
do this, that was something that I believe we all discussed while you
and Senator Clodfelter were putting that together, what they did is they
put together a blue ribbon commission of past governors and business
people and backed by just a past governor and they were looking at
raising a billion dollars in new revenue and they didn't once get the
support of the legislature engage in the process. We're doing it from
the ground up. I believe Governor Jindal made the same mistake. The
Governor came down from the top down and decided to tell the legislature
how to implement this, his tax form. I believe his tax form has a lot of
merit. We have a lot of similarities, but what we're trying to do is
work it from the bottom up. Get the legislature fully engaged, if
everybody agrees with the fact that the existing tax structure, the
existing economy needs to be changed because it no longer meets the
needs of a growing 21st century state, then this general assembly will
help make that decision and drive it up to the top and that is the
proper way to do it and that's why we're following that model.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Walters?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chair. I'm looking at expenses, eliminating expenses
for reforestation cultivating commercially grown trees. Is that for,
part of the forest development program where the industry pays a
severance tax at the first point of manufacturing? Can I get a
clarification on that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We can check to see if it is part of that program. We have checked with
the department trying to figure out the origins of it. What is clear is
that a person is able to deduct more then they would be able to deduct
under federal law and I believe part of the premise of the bill was to
try to conform as much as possible to federal law and have fewer
adjustments. But we will continue to track down if that's part of the
program. I'm not aware of it and I hadn't found that link, but it may be
and I will continue to look.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Walters, may I add to the fact that as Cindy alluded to, ??
alluded to, the goal is to try to treat everybody the same, and not give
special preferences to certain groups. We were trying to make sure that
an investment should stand on its own merit, and not have government
winners and losers, because in essence that's the plan that we're trying
to dismantle and that really is the plan that presently exists that is
not allowing us to have the economic growth and the jobs that we would
all be very happy to receive.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Walters.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Senator Rucho, and I understand that but the industry at this
point is paying a special severance tax for forest development and that
is the point. If  staff would just get information for me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We'd love to do that. Thank you for your feedback.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Allran.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. First thing I need to do is apologize for
coming in late, but I was, it was, there was a necessity for me to meet
with some of my local people in regard to all of this. Senator Rucho</p>

when we're talking ?? getting the buy-in from the grassroots ??, I am
finding that one of the biggest issues from the grassroots are the
cities.  And if this has already been asked or brought up before I got
here, I apologize.  But I really do think that we need to be able to
show our cities that they are not going to be clobbered by this
comprehensive reform, because if they are, that is not going to be a way
to bring in jobs.  If the cities get creamed, they're not going to be
able to attract jobs.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Senator Allran, we did discuss
it earlier, but I'll repeat.  What we have committed to is trying to
keep their revenue level at approximately the same level as they did
prior to the change.  So that's what we're in the process of working on.
 We're trying to determine how those sales taxes are allocated and try
to be sure that as some of the local privilege taxes are eliminated and
the state privilege taxes are eliminated in our effort to consolidate
and narrow the number of taxes on businesses, we will be working
diligently to be sure that the municipalities will be treated fairly in
that outcome.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Followup.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  That's
encouraging and very, very appreciated.  Will we also be able to have it
not just so that it's generic or broad in nature, but every single city,
something in writing?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  You will see that.  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  Thank you.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Members of the committee, any
more questions from the committee?  If not, we will take comments or
questions, or comments from the public.  And we have Mr. Cedric Johnson.
 Is he here?  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Mr.
Johnson, if you will turn on the mic.  State your name, please.  We will
give you two minutes to carry on.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Am I on?  [SPEAKER
CHANGES]  You have the floor.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank you, co-Chairmen
Rabon and Rucho, and to members of the Senate Finance Committee for
allowing me to speak before you on Senate Bill 677.  My name is Cedric
Johnson, and I serve as Public Policy Analyst with the Budget and Tax
Center.  And we would just like to highlight two particular issues in
regards to the legislation that you're deliberating at the moment.
First, cutting the corporate income tax is unlikely to promote or
generate economic growth.  Evidence indicates that a tax cuts approach
is not a primary catalyst for promoting economic growth.  Studies that
examine state and local business taxes highlight that businesses care
more about have a well, highly productive workforce; access to markets
and suppliers; sound infrastructure; and a high quality of life for its
employees, than they do about state taxes.  Furthermore, cutting the
corporate income tax rate is unlikely to have a substantial influence on
a corporation's decision of where to expand or to locate a new business.
 State and local taxes paid by businesses represent less than 2% of
their total business costs, on average, and corporate income taxes
represents just a small fraction of these taxes, less than 10%.  Thus,
the benefits accrued to corporations from cutting the corporate income
tax would be so small as not to justify a business expanding its
operations or adding additional jobs.  Secondly, evidence shows that a
single sales factor system would fail to produce growth and would be a
revenue loser for the state.  Such a system would also pick winners and
losers among businesses.  Corporations with relatively large shares of
their nationwide property and payroll in North Carolina, but a
relatively small share of their nationwide sales in the state, would
receive a tax cut, whereas corporations with relatively little property
and payroll in the state, but a significant share of their nationwide
sales in the state, would see a tax increase.  These are two particular
issues that the Budget and Tax Center urges the members of the Senate
Finance Committee to be attentive to as you continue to deliberate and
pursue comprehensive tax reform.  Thank you.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  Thank
you.  Yes, Senator Rucho.  [SPEAKER CHANGES]  We may have disagreements
in economic policy.  But the ?? in this General Assembly since 2011 have
worked diligently in a master plan to retool the North Carolina economy,
and that is with investments in education, reg reform, an independent
energy policy.  Of course, being able to move transportation needs, and
goods and people, across, not across North Carolina, but across the
globe.  So it's being done in a very comprehensive manner, beyond tax
reform.  That is only one component to creating an economic environment</p>

That will create the jobs that we all want. And now that we have our
house, financial house, at least partially under control, except for
maybe the Medicaid problem, we believe it's the right time to move
forward on this and economists will tell you that taxes are a burden.
When you have the highest taxes in the southeast bar-none, that puts us
at an economic disadvantage in recruiting businesses here. And I'm not
saying recruiting businesses by trying to to incentivize them to come
and spend 90 or 100 million dollars here, but to find a place where they
can actually grow, prosper, make a profit, and hire North Carolinians.
So I'll say to you that this comprehensive plan has a bigger strategy
because it encompasses a number of other factors rather than just tax
rates.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Senator Rucho. If there are no further
questions or comments. Do you have any further comments Senator Rucho?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, sir. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No further questions or
comments. Please wish Senator Brock a happy birthday when you see him.
He came late and left early. And other than that, this meeting is
adjourned.</p>
