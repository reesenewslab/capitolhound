Bow with me.
Heavenly Father, Lord thank you for allowing us to live in a country
where we can govern ourselves. Lord I pray that we would be ever mindful
of this blessing as we approach our annual celebration of independance,
and we especially thank you for those who have risked their lives to
protect these freedoms. Lord I ask that you help us remember that the
beginning of true freedom is only found in the redemptive and saving
knowledge of your son Jesus Christ who died to set all people of every
nation and every background free from the bondage of sin. And it is in
his name in which we pray, Amen.
