  thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate. For what purpose does the gentleman
from New Hanover, Representative Catlin, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, to ask Representative Dollar a question if he
would.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Wake yield to the gentleman from New Hanover?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. How many people or how much population will this grow for
Cary?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It&#39;s about 90 homes, so it&#39;s around 200 and some folks,
something like that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield to an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does this have any impact on the inner basin transfer request for Cary?
Is this behind that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, this has no impact on that whatsoever.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate. If not, the question before the
House is the passage of the House Committee Substitute for House Bill 73
on its second reading. So many favoring passage of the bill will vote
aye, those opposed will vote no, the clerk will open the vote. The clerk
will lock the machine and record the vote, 110 having voted in the
affirmative and one in the negative, the House Committee Substitute for
House Bill 73 passes its second reading and will remain on the calendar.
House Bill 5, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Torbett, House Bill 5, a bill to be entitled an act
reauthorize the Division of Motor Vehicles to produce a special
registration plate for military veterans and remove the requirements
that the division must receive a minimum number of applications before
using the plate. The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Gaston, Representative Torbett,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, this bill is
so easy, I thought it was so easy I just had to amend it, so I&#39;d
like to also bring forward an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Gaston is recognized to send forth an amendment. The
clerk will read the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Torbett moves to amend the bill on page one, line 22,
rewriting the line to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Gaston is recognized to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. All the amendment does in section four, it adds
a 90 day period to provide for DMV, once this becomes law, so they can
get everything pretty much squared away. So it&#39;s just a simple,
instead of it becoming effective when it becomes law, it&#39;s 90 days
after it becomes law. That&#39;s the gist of the amendment, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate on the amendment. If not, the
question before the House is the adoption of amendment one sent forth by
Representative Torbett. So many favoring adoption of the amendment will
vote aye, those opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the vote. The
clerk will lock the machine and record the vote, 114 having voted in the
affirmative and none in the negative. The amendment is adopted.
We&#39;re now back on the bill. The gentleman from Gaston has the floor
to continue debating the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. A summary, House Bill Five would reauthorize a
military veteran special registration plate without a requirement for a
minimum number of applications. The plate is currently authorized but
will expire on July 1 of the year 2015 if it does not receive at least
300 applications. This was brought to my attention and I thought that we
owed, if nothing else, we owed them an opportunity that, if you are a
military veteran in any branch serving the United States, that you
should, if you choose to have it noted on a plate, it should cost you no
additional money and that you should have a plate that denotes your
branch and that you are a veteran. That&#39;s pretty much the
explanation of this bill, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion, further debate. If not, the question before the
House is the passage of House Bill Five on its second reading. So many
favoring passage of the bill will vote aye, those opposed will vote no,
the clerk will open the vote. The clerk will lock the machine and record
the vote.

personnel or to establish a procedure for institutions of higher
education to obtain a list of students and employees at the institution
who are registered as sex offenders. ?? of North Carolina and acts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Gaston, Representative Hastings
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To briefly explain the bill, mister speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister speaker, this bill was amended in committee, fully vetted in
committee and had a strong vote, and through the process we paid special
attention to the structured sentencing to make sure it was rational,
truthful sentencing, consistent, and that it fiscally was responsible,
fiscally, regarding the resource priorities of our prison system. And if
it&#39;s in order, mister speaker, I would like to defer to
Representative Rena Turner to explain another portion of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham, Representative Luebke
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Representative Hastings would yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Gaston yield to the gentleman from Durham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Representative Hastings. I understand your bill and am in
support of it. I did have a question about line 34 on page one, the
first phrase. The one that reads, the phrase that reads upon request of
an institution of higher education. My question is this. This is a good
idea in your bill. Why would it be optional? Why wouldn&#39;t we want to
strike that phrase? It&#39;s a good bill, a good idea, why shouldn&#39;t
all colleges and universities in our state be required to do this?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to answer the question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister speaker, if it&#39;s in order, I would defer to Representative
Rena Turner to handle her portion of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The way this will work, does the gentleman from Durham wish to direct
the same question to the lady from Iredell?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir, I do. Do I, do I need to repeat it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady from Iredell yield to the question from the gentleman from
Durham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I understand your question and I have spoken with the
universities. My initial intent was to direct this to community colleges
that have high school classes on their campus, and for them to have the
information so the officers that are involved with those campuses would
have that information and know who they&#39;re trying to protect and who
the offenders were that they needed to know about. This is as far as we
want to go at this point to give the information to the colleges or
universities because some of them also have this situation where they
possibly could have 14 year olds on their campus, but this allows them
to request that report, know who they&#39;re dealing with, who the
possible perpetrators might be. Just, it&#39;s a proactive.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
May I follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady yield to an additional question from the gentleman from
Durham?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Then if I understand this correctly, you actually, your intent is not
actually to affect the colleges and universities. It&#39;s just the
community colleges.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That was my original intent, but we recognize that there possibly could
be teenage students on university campuses also.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Another follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the lady yield to an additional question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
She yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would ask the same question of you that I asked of Representative
Hastings. Why is it optional? Why shouldn&#39;t we just, why
wouldn&#39;t we require this of all of our community colleges,
universities, four year colleges. Why not strike that phrase?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In the introductory phase, I feel like we need
