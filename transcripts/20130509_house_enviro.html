As, From a construction and operation and  that was just an omission in
the original bill
[Speaker Changes] Rep, Here is your question for the staff
[Speaker Changes] OK
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Madam Chair and Thank you representatives
for bringing this bill forth and I just have a couple of questions about
it. The piece about the air pollution portion  section 3 I guess. is
that really all to the revisions to the air toxic program or is that a
completely different issue?
[Speaker Changes] I believe it’s not that I am sure I am pretty certain
that there are folks in the department who can answer that more directly
[Speaker Changes] Please state your name and position
[Speaker Changes] Mike Edwardson, Deputy Director with the division of
Air Quality. Its not related to the air toxics revision that were
changed last year
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Madam Chair. Relates to the tough
requirements for well construction. Where is that. Number 5 clarifiying
and resourcing. That i assume that means if this is something that takes
place before the rules were adopted and takes a longer time to move
[??] and the point about that.
[Speaker Changes] Madam Chair. Rep Harrison This change was actually
made in 2011 by a legislation. It was just an inadvertent omission the
end date in there to kind of put parenthesis around the tanks that were
eligible.
[Speaker Changes] Rep Iller what's next please. OK and Rep Dickson.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Madam Chair. this question may be for the
bill sponsor or staff. In section 6 help me understand how if does apply
to current livestock facilities relative to the whale in proximity to
the live stock facility itself where to the method of handling the waste
relative to the livestock facility i.e the lagoon
[Speaker Changes] I am going to let staff half answer  that
specifically. I was assuming that ones are already known.
[Speaker Changes] Rep Dickson. I believe what this section is
contemplating is for sources of contamination i.e source of spills and
other like hazardous substance releases and things of that. But I
believe that this was the recommendation of the department, so if they
would like to speak  this more specifically that might be helpful.
[Speaker Changes] Anyone from Deaner. Mr Matthews
[Speaker Changes] My name is Matthews and Ia m the director of waste
Management in deaner. I am sorry, could you repeat the question.
[Speaker Changes] Rep Dickson
[Speaker Changes] The question was to help me understand if section 6
has pertinent applicability to whales located adjacent to livestock
facilities or in proximity to the method of waste stored relative to the
live stock facilities.
[Speaker Changes] If there was a known contaminant source, what this
will do is have the commission adopting rules that basically gives
notice to the person seeking  a permit for a whale of that source of
contamination and any information that the department had on that
particular source of contamination prior to receiving a permit.
[Speaker Changes] Madam Chair a Follow-up
[Speaker Changes] Follow up
[Speaker Changes] Madam Chair and Bill sponsor and also Mr [??]. My
concern is that I don't want anything to interrupt the current method of
watering the livestock as it exists. I want to be assured that the
current whale at the facility cannot be , You can't come in and declare
because there is some certain proximity to the facility itself that it
is now in jeopardy of being classified to a contaminated source.
[Speaker Changes] Madam Chair. From what you are saying could be an
issue that we would probably welcome an amendment to clarify that.
Madam, could be an issue that we would welcome a amendment to clarify to
make sure it doesn't happen. But this amendment [??] because of concerns
from health department.</p>

<p id="10:00">
issuing permits around known contaminated sites.  Thats what its
directed at and to give a procedure in place to where they can still
issue the permits but they have to know, the property owner has to know
theres a contaminated site within 1000 feet.  However in relation to the
question you're asking the way its working its broad enough that it
could go beyond what the intention is for them for perfecting the
amendment asking them to address ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] staff can you, he's correct about the intent was and I
viewed it more too as just notifying them of the contaminate but if its
broad enough that it could actually impact either current existence of a
permit or issuance of a permit, is there a way for us to clarify that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I guess I would note that I believe this language came
from the department.  A couple of things to think about, so this is
known source of release of contamination, so I the way we would read
that that we would not be talking about animal waste as a known source
of contamination as Ms Munt said earlier I think we thinking talking
about leaking underground storage tanks, that kind of thing, so I so
noted the second sentence rules ?? of any way to as Representative
Samuelson noted the second sentence the rules of doc ?? well ?? within
1000 feet of a known source of contamination, they know the
contamination is there so they can decide if they want to drill the well
or whatever precautions, I don't think it has anything to do with the
source of contamination, whatever it is.  That was our understanding and
reading of this, the department way want to expand on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] madam chair I would agree with that assessment there
that's the intent and exactly the way its worded.  The Representative is
concerned that they might go further than that and call hog lagoons or
any kind of animal waste lagoons as contaminated sites.  I think thats
his concern, and so I would probably refer that to back to Mr. Mathews
and see if he would give his response to that and see if he would with
that if he may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] madam chair while Mr. Mathews is coming up I just want
?? one more followup ?? but if it needs ?? amendment I'm in support of
that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] and I'm comfortable with Representative Sanderson
offer there.  Let me give a very brief explanation of what is reality.
I know of a situation where a constituent of mine has a legally
permitted very fine operated livestock facility.  And if you'll envision
in your mind a livestock barn here on your right and one on your left,
when the facility was originally constructed the well the source, the
total source of drinking water he has damaged that facility and that
well is going to not operate, a big chain as dropped down in it when
they were repairing it and he went and applied to correct that situation
and he was not allowed to put a new well down adjacent to the well he's
currently using and a matter of fact under the regulations was going to
have to go 3000 feet because of underground cables etc etc to put down
his new well to water those ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] and that may also be a separate issue that needs to be
resolved in regriform but lets make sure
[SPEAKER CHANGES] lets make sure
[SPEAKER CHANGES] is this on the same subject?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] thank you maybe we can
[SPEAKER CHANGES] and I understand your concerns Representative Dixon
but there are hoglicans that have costs that are sources of
contamination to private drinking water wells in addition to just the so
?? we just want well drillers to know that there is that potential out
there its not to stop it it's just to know about it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] OK thank you
[SPEAKER CHANGES] maybe we can work this out before this goes to the
floor then if Representative Samuelson agree to that then with
Representative Dixon.  Oh, I'll agree also
[SPEAKER CHANGES] and next</p>

<p id="15:00">
was Representative Catlin [SPEAKER CHANGES] A question maybe for the
public health commission. How are we going to identify that? I mean,
it's not easy to identify sources of contamination. There's some
research that you have to do. Has there been any thought about what
these sources of information would be? [SPEAKER CHANGES] This is sources
that are already known and identified, but they have a process for doing
that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, well, I do it myself, and it's not always
easy to find all the sources. So, I'm just curious where we are on that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chair, we have all the known sites identified,
and it's quite extensive in North Carolina, the contaminated sites. The
reason that we didn't submit to you language that was tighter is because
there's absolutely no way that we could have done this in legislation.
We felt like this is an instance where it had to go to rule making so
that you can prioritize these contaminated sites because, if you just
try to say contaminated sites, and basically this would affect most of
North Carolina. So you have to go through rule making to prioritize what
type of contaminated sites that are known actually needs to have this
notification. And that's what all this is. It doesn't stop anything. It
just says that they will notify the owner within a thousand feet once
they prioritize which sites they determine are contaminated. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] And
one good thing about this is the bill that we ran earlier on well
education. It would be putting people that needed to know being able to
get that information. And, to follow up with that, I would agree to
that. And we would've liked to have known this issue in time to have it
in that bill. So, it should've been part of that bill originally. But
this issue is something that has arisen as a result of that bill. And
it's arisen from the health department directors across the state have
brought this issue to us, or brought this issue before the state. And
we've agreed to ask for this recommendation from the house and senate.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, assistant secretary. Representative Iler.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In the senate our question wasn't totally answered.
So, I want to clarify something. It's probably for staff, but my
hometown went through a major issue a few years ago where we couldn't
place irrigation wells close to the sewer. It was a debate about a
hundred feet or twenty-five feet. I just need a final assurance this has
nothing whatsoever to do. We have county water, but we have irrigation
wells which, you know, in some cases, somebody could drink out of a hose
maybe. I don't know. But this will not impact that situation whatsoever.
Is that correct, Mr. Hudson? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Again, our reading of
this is it's just providing information. So your local government, for
instance, would get under this, under the rules that would be adopted
pursuant to this, would get information about any known sources of
contamination within a thousand feet of where you're proposing to put
the well and that you would decide if you still wanted to do it. Now,
there may be other existing background law that says you can't put a
well within so many feet of a certain source of contamination. But this
doesn't change this. The other thing I'd note is this is for rule
making. So, anything the commission does will have to go through the
rules review commission and would have to come back to the general
assembly and be subject to legislative disapproval if, ultimately, the
commission adopted rules that y'all didn't like. [SPEAKER CHANGES] This
about letting you know, when you want to drill your well, what's around
it. Then somebody else decides whether or not you can drill it. But this
is just making sure you know. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One clarifying follow
up? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. So, a municipal
sewer system would not normally qualify as a source of contamination. Is
that correct? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Again, the language in here is
&quot;known source of release of contamination&quot;. So, just the
existence of it is not going to be a source, a release of contamination.
If there was a major spill from it, for instance, then that could be a
source of contamination. But just the existence of that, or an
agricultural operation, or an underground storage tank - it's not a
release of contamination. So, you actually have to have contamination
leaking into the ground, and the department has to know about it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Millis.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair. Just a real quick
clarification about Section 2. I just want to make sure that this is
really just trying to modify these aspects of civil penalties from a
technical standpoint because, a lot of times, these local governments
administer their own sanitation ?? control program. But this is not
expanding the authority in any way</p>

<p id="20:00">
They preform just kind of clarity just making it better more efficient
is that the case?
[Speaker Changes]
Correct and find who the money goes to.
[Speaker Changes]
Okay. Representative McGrady is next
[Speaker Changes]
Thank You. Just speak on the bill real quickly, im one of the co
sponsors too and spent a lot of time going through each of these
sections. I agree with the assessment that these are clarifying these
are fixing mistakes there really pretty clear should be pretty clear
that we just need a fix and there is not a lot else in here. The bill
though does raise a bigger issue and representative Storrin tonight
talked about this and the fact that the proposal put forward by the
department included a range over other proposals to include some rule
changes in the bill we made how we do our rules and I know
representative Sampson has another bill on this issue, we’ve made the
rule process so difficult that we are now seeing dyer need to come back
or proposing to come back and change rules through statutes and we are
seeing legislators like representative Storrins have an issue that
really out to be a rule but since we can’t get through the rule process
we got to stick it in a bill so I just raise that issue this is a good
bill it’s been appropriately described there’s no hidden agendas in this
thing it is exactly what it reports to be and I’ve been gone thru it
line by line and recommend it to you.
[Speaker Changes]
Representative Harrison was next
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you I just want to follow up on a question about section 3 and I’m
trying to sort of understand the impact of the bill summary that is not
considered part of the permanent application I’m just wondering if
someone can speak to it with another more detail department staff or –
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you Madam Speaker. Representative Harrison basically this
eliminates unnecessary paperwork requirement where facilities are
required to report recycling activities every time they paid their air
quality permit fees, we collect in the department that information other
ways so it was just making this requirement unnecessary.
[Speaker Changes]
Representative Starnt.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you well just to comment and there is nothing wrong with this bill
but I think what we have to recognize the fact that in the past
legislatures have passed provisions in law with the anticipation that
something would be done. But then nothing happens because the rules
making process is so slow and I would contend that the rule making
process if it’s not broken it certainly needs to be streamlined so that
rules can be made in a timely matter and I’ll give you nan example we’ve
had a scrap tire provision put in the bill last session one year later
the rules have not been written and they say it’s going to take another
18months to get the e rules done. It’s frustrating because we don’t just
put provisions in bills because we don’t have anything to do. We are
trying to address problems so now I thought I was s fixing a problem
last year and they say a year later give us another 18 months and we’ll
have a rule for that so I’m in favor of if this means eliminating the
rule or expediting but I respect your opinion won’t monkey with it but
I’ve got an amendment that would fix my provision but apparently you
don’t want to go down that path.
[Speaker Changes]
Not in this bill if possible. I am sympathetic wildly sympathetic
actually and just trying had a discussion with the assistant secretary
this morning about tit and I’m trying to figure out how to we get there
because the issue you raise is I can give you six more examples of it.
And I suspect assistant secretary Galespy can give you 20 more examples
about it. We got to figure out how to get there because these rules need
to be put in place in a timely fashion to do exactly what you’re
proposing to do.
[Speaker Changes]
And I know you’ve talked to rep Moffat and I also sent your stuff to
representative moppit and he’s trying to deal with it on the reg reform
side.
[Speaker Changes]
Thank you. Alright any other questions? Is there anyone one from the
audience that would like to -</p>
