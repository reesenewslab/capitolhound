is it was described as we all know is a simple bill but if you just
little bit of background this is a committed bill for member Fred Steen
and myself were honored to chair the year committee on certificate late
other hospital related issues over the last see 20.23 months it
concluded of course as the session began the committee pretty much heard
every issue relative to to healthcare and from both the the hospital's
perspective the the independent providers perspective from the most
important individuals under the status of the great site North Carolina
the committee went on three district you would say we went to the ER
mountains we had a interesting meeting in Fletcher and I'm somewhat
proud to say that we hold the record of attendance at a committee
meeting as over 400 concerned citizens more trauma showed up at the
committee meeting we then moved to the Piedmont and had a meeting in
Mount Holly North Carolina which is have to be my district and then we
had our final meeting in Wilmington North Carolina so as you see the
committee went heard from all sectors and areas of ingratiate North
Carolina we addressed a myriad of topics and concerns we heard issues
from hospitals that we thought could best affect them so they could
focus on providing healthcare to citizens and not so much on litigation
we heard issues from doctors Independents or once again we thought that
perhaps some of the a legislation we could enact would perhaps freedom
up to practice medicine and not worry so much about litigation and
virtually at we had a the a cornucopia of of documents the committee met
and formulated one will committee #2 committee draft FISA legislation
come forward and this is the first one and just published question we
have members from the department here to help answer questions on
certificate of need and I have this rally here that will assist us
during the process also help explain the bill and with that I will just
the I'm assuming everyone's had time to read the bill and if you have
any questions I'll give you just a brief synopsis very great our focus
and our effort was to number one reduce the litigation in healthcare
provision industry so that money that was going to litigation could now
be channeled back in healthcare which should be the primary focus</p>

Speaker: Also to reduce the cost of the state that involves very
processing of certificate of need on the highlights we found just to a
bring it to you attention is noted in the bill is that currently until
this bill passes currently if you were heath care provider and currently
if you  had purchased ten beds for example well lets say now twenty
years from now you want to up fit that bed so you want to ?? ten new
beds you will have to again go through a certificate of need process we
thought for replacement items that was reedy much re dented and is
necessary so if this passes all longer be the case that is one of the
highlights the other items we touched which is are mentioned here that
the ?? have not been address i m gonna address believe it that was
eighty's that's what correct ?? so look at the the ?? so we try to bring
up in the 21 st century and get them to kinda of more relative to the
cause of they are directly impacting with that mystery I'm reedy much
gonna step back ?? question perhaps ?? and directed four members of his
department ,
Speaker Changes: again committee members will have some questions and
Representative ??  recognize ,
Speaker Changes: thank you Mr chair ?? public hearings through the state
do have any opposition with ,
Speaker Changes: as we as many of you knows ?? and we had opposition on
every issues we have talked we have people that who are proposing every
issue that we talk we have both support and negative support on every
issue that was a whole process during the committee and this was the
synopsis on what was the most favorable outcomes of that committee of
which to date on this specific bill i think we have a few suggestion
that come from the physician side of house,
Speaker Changes: i have been asking ?? to go through the bill force ??
Speaker Changes: Thank you Mr chairman I'll try to make this brief i
have been talking from the summary in front of you the bill is one
committee substitutes the substitute will make some technical changes
caught the few reference that we ??to make and to make the languages
more elegant nine few places the section certificate need process is
well is one that where state requires any question one willing to offer
new institutional heath services which covers multitude of projects on
equipments and things must fist acquire a certificate of need from the
department health and services so what's this Bill does it goes in and
it amends two things one of amends some of the definitional items for
what is one of the new institutional heath services second part of the
bill deals with the peals process to try to privileged perhaps some ??
for people who want to file privilege design simply for the purpose of
delay section 1 of the bill deals with ?? review the department is
allowed to do a ?? review when a certificate of review is not
competitive as their is no request for public hearing and the agency has
not found the public hearing in the public interest currently in the law
there is a five million dollar capital expenditure cap on that so any
project that comes in were the value of the project more than five
million dollars is not eligible for ?? review section 1 simply removes
that cap so ? reviews can be for any project many non competitive review
with no request from public hearing and the agency found that it is not
in the public interest the proposed committee section here divided
section 1 as section 1 A and 1 B that is because there was a cross
reference we found and 131 E, An 2 which is in 1B that also needed to be
updated simple check,</p>

section two of the bill corrects the citation to the code of the federal
regulation section three is the one that it increases the capital
expenditure for major medical equipment the purchase of major medical
equipment is considered a new institutional health service it is
designed as a single unit or system of components with related functions
used to provide medical and other health services currently they cost
more than seven hundred fifty thousand dollars section two amends that
expenditure threshold  from seven hundred fifty thousand to one point
five million section four of the bill amends the definition of the new
institutional health service as regards the general capital expenditure
threshold will increases that threshold to two million to four million
dollars in the ?? committee substitute we look further at the definition
of what is considered determining the actual cost of the project and the
actual cost of the project in the current law includes replacement
equipment since we are eliminating the capital expenditure taking the
replacement equipment out of certificate league review remove the
inclusion cost for replacement equipment out of the calculation as to
what a project cost for this expenditure threshold section five deals
with replacement equipment again replacement equipment is that which is
purchased for the sole purpose of replacing company medical equipment
currently in use which will be sold or otherwise disposed of or when
replaced section five renews the two million dollar capital expenditure
threshold ?? the purchase of replacement equipment is not an
institutional health service and does not require a certificate of ??
from the department section six of the bill ??this is an conform of the
amendment  amends exemptions from certificate league review to reflect
the increase in the capital expenditure threshold from two million to
four million section seven gets into the amendments bond requirements on
appeal two levels of  appeal the first is to contest the case hearing
people may be found happy with the contest or result or decision of the
administrative judge that's in appeal to the court of appeals but both
levels the bond cap is now being increased from fifty thousand to
one-hundred thousand dollars and it is also set at five percent of the
cost of the proposed institutional health service for each approved
application sometimes certificate renewed applications have several
applications that come through we might have five or six come through ??
full approved the old bond used to be just on one of those each decision
that's appealed you have to post a bond at five percent of the cost of
the proposed new institutional health service with a cap of one-hundred
thousand for each application that is appealed these new caps are put in
both  to contest the new cap hearing level at the court of appeals level
in addition, at the court of appeals level if the court of appeals rules
that a action was broughtfor the purposes of delay if was just a
frivolous appeal they can remand back to the Superior Court for a
hearing and if the court does find for purposes of delay the court must
order the payment for attorney fees and cost section seven allows  or
provides for attorney fees to be awarded when a contested case hearing
is brought for frivolous reasons or for the purpose of delay I hope I
made that clear ?? section eight deals with the provision certificate
league law that's no longer necessary sorry it dealt with HMOs the bill
is effective October first twenty-thirteen applies to applications

And many two support at which you refer two EMI theme of them discussion
and they'll pay half the first on S and am willing raising  back to the
level of expenditure in section 4 to 4,000,000 dollars isn't that
happens in fact, it's the miracle happens to somebody can live in what's
called on U.S. official Health Service for less than that what is the
procedure colleagues like the  anything less is over four million
dollars to any clarification and OK, (SPEAKER CHANGES) Stephen Neal
understand and I know that the department's unified against the weeds
but there are many things in the finest U.S. official Health Service
they would include are services such as a dialysis services nursing
homes are again and I fear the things that they are required to have a
stupid of me I believe regardless of project cost but if a hospital room
and find the Health Healthcare Service as a project that they propose
that is under the four million dollar special that is what would be
exempt from state to give them enough to think that's because

Less  5 percent of the newest proposed costs and institutional service
Whose it is an initiative  $50,000,000 project from 8 to 5% of that
would probably exceed $100,000 but there's a cap of $100,000 so does not
go beyond that level CC discretionary is 5% of the cost of the new

not a solid answer to that other than that we try to make it so it was

would just ask for further consideration on these ?? before you move
forward. I’m happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Torbett. Would you like to address the concern
raised of the thresholds?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Chip brought those forward in committee. They were thoroughly vetted. He
brought them alight to the committee also through some handouts. I think
it was last week. The committee thoroughly examined those and I even
mentioned that if there objections to it that perhaps an amendment could
be offered and having seen none or offered none, we pretty much just
moved forward with the bill as it is in front of you today. I would
encourage your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila is recognized for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I guess my question is not really a question,
but it’s to have the department clarify, in fact, if you don’t spend $4
million on a new institutional health services, you can’t get licensed,
but you could still be offering an institutional health service.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Would you speak to that again sir and again recognize yourself for the
record.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, my name is Craig Smith. I’m chief of the certificate need section.
A facility that is proposing to renovate or modernize right now is
limited to any project over $2 million requires a certificate of need.
Unless it involves replacement equipment and then that equipment is also
subject to a $2 million threshold. If there’s an existing facility that
wants to renovate, then or modernize with the new threshold that would
be raised to $4 million for the facility renovation and there would be
no limit on the cost of the replacement equipment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further comments, Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. At no point in that answer did you mention the
word license and that’s what my question had to do with. The objection
that Mr. Baggett had was that at $4 million, we’re talking new, not
renovation, not conversion, we’re talking new institutional services,
you have to have a license at $4 million and above. Do you have to have
a license if you’re going to do something as a new institutional service
below $4 million?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Craig Smith. For some services a license is required. For other
services, a certification by Medicare and Medicaid is required. But a
diagnostic center which exists, which wishes to add medical equipment,
would now be subject to a $1.5 million threshold. A diagnostics center
which wants to replace its equipment would have no replacement
threshold. A diagnostic center, and these are all not license,
diagnostic centers are not licensed by the state. A diagnostic center
which wants to relocate and modernize would not be subject to the
threshold unless it exceeded $4 million.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’m really still not sure you answered my
question. If somebody who doesn’t have a bed, doesn’t have a facility,
starts one, and for some major miracle, it’s $3.5 million, can they do
that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me, Craig Smith, certificate of need. All development of new
institutional health services that deal with beds, operating rooms, or
dialysis stations require a certificate of need review, and they require
a license.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Are there any services that somebody could open at $3.5 million that
they would need a license for, but because of the way that this section
4 is worded, they haven’t spent $4 million and they couldn’t get a
license, which is what I understood Mr. Baggett saying was the issue at
hand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Craig Smith, certificate of need. Maybe Mr. Baggett needs to clarify
what service he specifically is discussing because most services do
require licenses except diagnostic centers.</p>

<p id="30:00">
Follow up. Representative Avila.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I could hear Mr. Baggett's explanation, because that’s exactly what I
understood him saying the problem with $4 million is. If he can clarify
that to where I could understand that, I’d appreciate it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Baggett, you are recognized to address this concern. If you would
once again recognize yourself for the record.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chip Baggett with the North Carolina Medical
Society. Representative Avila, I don’t have a specific concern. Many,
many things require a license in order to provide that service through
Medicare, being recognized through Medicare. I’m not looking at one
specific thing. I’m not pointing out diagnostics centers specifically or
am-surgery centers specifically or hospital services in specific. I’m
just saying in general, many things require the license and if you
require the license and that’s part of getting licensure is the
requirement of certificate of need then the threshold is a threshold you
have to meet.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further comments from the committee? Representative Jackson. Microphone
please
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I had a question for staff, I guess, about section four and five. The
change as far as what replacement equipment is. I wasn’t on the CON
committee and haven’t the heard the discussion but am familiar with
other areas like a restaurant. It’s easier to buy an existing restaurant
and change it over if you don’t ever shut it down that it is to open a
new restaurant because of health codes and things of that nature. My
question is, on this replacement equipment, is it limited, he said beds,
I believe ten beds, is it limited that definition in 10A NCAC. Is it
very limited? Or can hospitals or other entities go out and just
purchase somebody who’s on the ground and say, okay, now we’re going to
convert it. We’re going to replace everything, we’re going to change the
nature of it, or is the nature of it going to required to remain the
same?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I understand your question correctly, the nature is going to have to
remain the same. In other words, you’ve got an old x-ray machine and
it’s out of date and you want a new x-ray machine, it’s something
comparable to what you already have but more...it’s newer, it works
better.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that in that definition that was added to 22A here on the committee
substitute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The definition of replacement equipment did not change except for the
fact that any reference to a capital expenditure threshold was removed.
We go on to make it clear that replacement equipment is not subject to
certificate of need requirements.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In section 22A, as defined by 10A NCAC14C, that was added in the
committee substitute. That was not in the original bill. I didn’t have a
chance to pull that before today, and that’s what I’m really asking. If
you say that it’s just tightening up the language, I understand, but
that’s just what I’m trying to…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
In section 1A and 1B, we’re dealing there with expedited reviews. The
expenditure cap for an expedited review and not replacement equipment.
An expedited review is one that the department can do more rapidly. An
expedited review does not require a public hearing and in section 1A we
took the $5 million capital threshold cap for expedited reviews off, but
there was another reference to expedited reviews in 131E185A2 that we
had not originally caught, so we had to make that change so they were
the same in both places. That’s what 1B is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman. Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I apologize, maybe I wasn’t...I’m talking about page 3 of the committee
substitute, section 5, subsection 22A. We added a section of NCAC to the
definition that was not in the original bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We’re saying page 3…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Of the committee substitute.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What line?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Line 8, beginning of line 8. But it’s specifically line 11 is the code
I’m asking about.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I see where we are. I don’t have an answer for you right off the top of
my head. I did not draft the original and I don’t have the
administrative code reference here.</p>

At hand. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can I jump in there? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Torbitt. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Chairman. Representative Jackson, I'm just going to go on an
assumption here that that reference was put in there that is already
defining medical equipment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Torbitt, I
think Miss Paula has an answer. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chair, the
