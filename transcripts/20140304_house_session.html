  And so you&#39;ve heard about the 14 highway divisions, but then there
are five at-large areas of focus that are represented to make up the
total of 19. At least three members of the board must be registered in a
different political party than the governor. No more than two may be in
the same highway division, so that we don&#39;t get a concentration, or
an over-concentration in any one division. And the governor submits
proposed appointees for review for a 30-day period or a minimum of a
30-day period before their appointment. The highway system, as
you&#39;ve heard many, many times--80,000 miles is the way I shorthand
it--obviously for maybe my ego&#39;s purpose. But the interstate makes
up 1,300 miles of that. Primary routes, 5,500 miles. North Carolina
routes, 8,000. And the secondary system, the roads that at least largely
would be under county administration in a lot of states, 60,000 miles of
that system. And then along the system, again as you&#39;ve heard,
18,000 bridges, culverts, and pipes. It&#39;s about 13,000 bridges,
isn&#39;t it? I&#39;m looking out for 13--is that the right number?
Thirteen thousand bridges? What I&#39;m going to be talking about is for
the most part related to the two portions of this slide that you&#39;ve
seen in the past, although there will be obviously some parts of the
bottom two that we also touch on. So project development--and this is a
term of art that I suppose you need to pause to think about a little
bit--purpose and need of a project. So you have to identify the purpose
and need before you go to build the project, and that is used to analyze
the possible alternatives to that project. And always on the table is
the no-build alternative, but as we look at various projects that may be
competing for the construction funding, we have to be aware of the
purpose and need. And let&#39;s just say, thinking about an improvement
of a route through our community versus a loop, they could both be for
the same purpose and need of moving traffic from one side of the town to
the other; there may be an additional purpose that is served by the loop
road or by the one through the town that couldn&#39;t be served by the
other kind of facility, so again, identifying purpose and need is an
important step, and comes back later in the process. Route alternatives
are evaluated to try to minimize the impact. The selection of a
preferred alternative is a step, and then the completion of the
environmental planning documents, which are at the state level or
what&#39;s called NEPA, national level. And then determining the
construction limits. And this is a step that results in being able to
understand exactly what property is going to be needed, what the
right-of-way limits will have to be, is to determine what you need to do
on the construction. Using these current systems, we have got
extraordinarily long reconstruction plans for the purpose of work that
we&#39;re doing ?? evaluating work ?? the national funding through which
things are funded using federal money ?? we think there will be some
benefit from that. ??

Let us pray. Reading from the holy Bible, second Timothy, chapter four,
verse five through eight: But watch thou in all things, endure
afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy
ministry. For I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure
is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I
have kept the faith: Henceforth there is laid up upon me a crown of
righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at
that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his
appearing. Lord, this Scripture was read as part of my mother&#39;s
funeral service. I want to thank you for her 73 years with us.

  Finance and Appropriations. It was voted out overwhelmingly with good
support. We considered in detail a lot of amendments; we accepted some,
we rejected others, so we’ve had a thorough vetting of this bill. Some
of the documents that were shared in Finance were not made available in
Appropriations; I have some extra handouts here, but they are on the
dashboard, as well as a summary and some papers that are coming around.
So I think most members are fully aware of what the bill does – some
minor changes to our Job Development Investment Grant Program, marrying
some programs regarding data centers, and the airline fuel tax, so I’d
like to just open up if there’s any questions, and consider that we’ve
had a full debate on this bill already. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER

Representative Waddell moves to amend the bill on page 4, lines 39
through 45, by rewriting the lines to read… [SPEAKER CHANGES] Now the
gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Speaker. As Representative Martin said, yesterday we had a good
conversation about House Bill 117 in Finance. I think it’s been pretty
well-vetted. Secretary Skvarla is certainly on board with trying to push
this bill. My amendment simply recognizes the fact that in the rural
areas of North Carolina, we are trying our best to try and get industry
or manufacturing concerns or whatever we can there. I looked at the
information that Commerce has, I pulled up information from my counties
– Columbus, Bladen and Robeson – and found some very interesting
information. I’m going to be as brief as I can here, but basically
looking at Columbus County, when I graduated from high school in
Columbus County, it had 50,000 people. If you’ll look at what Commerce
puts out, the projected population in Columbus now is about 58,574. In
2019, it’s projected to go down by about 200. Now what that says
basically to me, growing up on a farm where farmers basically were
driving the economy in these rural areas and small farms were the thing,
that we had a lot of employees. People stayed at home, they worked on
the farm, and it’s changed a whole lot in my 40 years. Now you’ve got
big farmers, less employees, more machines, less opportunities for
employment, so we have what is called in North Carolina a qualified
investment of using a billion dollars to use what’s called a single
sales tax factor, and I think it’s a good thing. I’ve researched both
sides of it. All this amendment does, simply, is takes the one billion
dollars that we’re using for qualified capital, and reduces it to 500
million dollars for tier 1 and tier 2 counties. It does not eliminate
the number for tier 1 counties; it just reduces it for tier 1 and tier
2. Folks, there cannot be any fiscal note on this because nothing
ventured, nothing gained. We haven’t gotten the industry here, we
haven’t gotten the tax dollars in, so all I’m asking you is to consider
this. Consider this, especially if you’re from a rural area. It’s just
another carrot that you can use – as the old saying goes, another tool
in the toolbox to try and get these folks into these rural areas, get
them some jobs. We’ve talked about jobs up here. Let’s do something
about jobs. I’m tired of listening to the rhetoric, so I appreciate your
support.

  What purpose does the gentleman from Nash representative Collins rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Well I&#39;m the primary sponsor of this responsible for carrying this
section so I&#39;ll be the one that responds to this particular
amendment. I would ask that you vote no on this amendment for several
reasons. The way this current statute is written for single sales tax
treatment was written to provide this benefit for one company that&#39;s
come to North Carolina already. The way it&#39;s expanded, I don&#39;t
think there&#39;s any secret here in this chamber probably at least a
couple of sections of this bill have been written to help try to snag
one of these auto manufacturers that are finally looking at North
Carolina. And in particular a spot in eastern North Carolina that could
really use it. And this is designed so that they will qualify. Yet, most
of your sales liability has to be due to property if your going to meet
this qualification currently. Well an auto manufacturer not only builds
expensive property they pay high payroll so they won&#39;t qualify under
this same criteria. So we&#39;re trying to make sure they will qualify
for this. Now I work in a profession where if you use the word guarantee
in a sales presentation or an ad your probably going to get sued. And I
cannot guarantee you what the senate will do with anything we send them.
But I will tell you this short of a guarantee, I will be shocked beyond
description if they don&#39;t try to expand this section far beyond what
representative Wadell is trying to do. But since we don&#39;t know how
much this is going to cost us or anything, and so this bill doesn&#39;t
get any more controversial, I would like to see us pass this bill
without this amendment. The senate is going to give us something much
more broad than this and we&#39;re going to have to see how much they
give us we can stand for frankly when it comes back. So I would ask very
kindly for the success of this bill to vote no on this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Further discussion, further debate. For what reason does the gentleman
from Wake representative Dollar rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I&#39;ll be brief but
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you. I&#39;ll be brief but to follow up on what representative
Collins has said. The gentleman hasn&#39;t been able to determine the
financial impact but I can tell you that in the out years the financial
impact would be quite substantial to the state budget. So at this time I
would agree with representative Collins please vote no on this
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham representative Hall
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and I know we&#39;ve talked much in the last few
days about the two North Carolina&#39;s efforts or supposed willingness
to do what we can to provide economic development to all our rural
counties and rural areas as well. We&#39;ve talked about the inequities
and all the formulas we used. We&#39;ve talked about the excessive
political power our larger counties have and Durham is one of those
counties to get a disproportionate share of those benefits because of
what we already have. So it follows for our larger metropolitan areas
and urban areas the synergies happen that bring more business there
naturally. In this situation we have an opportunity to help our rural
areas. Bring them along provide some relief some  opportunity to those
areas more than we&#39;d normally do. I&#39;d ask that you support the
amendment. Let&#39;s try to make North Carolina one North Carolina.
Let&#39;s not keep piling on and making it two North Carolina&#39;s.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Ash, representative Jordan
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you Mr. Speaker I don&#39;t think it&#39;s much of a secret I hate
this entire bill one seventeen. But if we&#39;re going to do stuff like
in one seventeen let&#39;s at least help the areas that need the help
and that&#39;s the rural areas. Seventy six percent of previous
incentives have gone to Wake and Deckemberg. That&#39;s not where the
money needs to be. So I&#39;ll support anything to make this bill better
and I&#39;ll support the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
For what purpose does the lady from Wilson representative Martin rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
To debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The lady has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Changes to the single sales factor are more
comprehensive than what we can do on in a substantial way as part of
this bill. It does have long term appropriations impact so we&#39;re
looking at the future of the budget. So it&#39;s really a bigger tax
reform type of conversation. So I completely support us moving in this
direction. But I don&#39;t think we have the information that we need at
this time to do that. So I would respectfully ask people who are
interested in seeing this bill pass to reject this amendment. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Nash representative Collins
rise?

I guess maybe I wasn’t clear the first time I spoke, I come from a tier
1 area, that’s the area we go from worst to best, get those confused
anyway…
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’s an important.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Folks if we can locate, if we can land one of those plans in ?? County
and that will do more for North Eastern, North Carolina which is mostly
Tier 1 counties that anything you can possibly do. The passage of this
bill as it is gives us a chance to transfer the North Eastern and North
Carolina from a word of the state to the contributor to the states
economy which will help all of you no matter where you come from. I
plead as one from this effective area, from a Tier 1 County please helps
us pass this bill by defeating this amendment and give us a chance,
thanks.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion further debate on the amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members get back to their seats.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Saying none, the question before the house is the passage of amendment 1
offered by Representative ??, so many favoring passage of the amendment
will vote aye, those oppose will vote no, the clerk will open the vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ?? is the gentleman wish to record.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote, 55 having voted in
the affirmative and 62 in the negative, the amendment fails.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative ?? does the gentleman wish to sent forward the second
amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker I wish to withdraw.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The amendment is withdrawn. For what purpose does the gentleman from
Wake, Representative Stam raise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill for a period of not more
than five minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, I requested that and if the clerk could ring the
bell at five minutes so I will wrap up and that’s because I left my
whole speech on your desk Monday night and I know you have take it home
and read it. Seen is believing but we also know that there are optical
delusions, mirages, my grant  children have card tricks that I can’t
figure out how that work, we used to think that I written this ID was
the gold standard for figuring out who committed the crime. Now, we know
that it’s probably the least reliable way of figuring out who is there
and thank goodness we now have DNA. So the question is whether you are
gonna believe your eyes or you gonna believe me. Alright, by observation
we see that the Earth is flat and that the Sun revolves around the Earth
but we know that’s not true. Satiation teaches that correlation does not
imply causation. About 2,500 years ago the HX categorize logical
fallacies and one of them is post talk or ?? which Representative
Cleveland reminded me means after this therefore because of this is a
logical fallacy but for those of you unlike Representative Cleveland who
don’t know ??, it’s the rooster close because he thinks he made the Sun
come up, the entire basis for this bill is it if we can locate some game
changers, some transformers that will improve our state but the academic
research is to the contrary and I just put one on your desk Monday night
from the Southern Journal of Economics, the economical facts justify the
use of fiscal incentives. The conclusion after studying 109 different
industry, big industry locations conclusion the result show that large
firms fail to produce significant net benefits for their host
communities calling into question the highest tax bidding over jobs and
investment. And then if you go to the end of the article which I’m sure
you have read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from there, Representative Tom
raise? Representative Stam was the gentleman through I was not to stay
here five minutes I gave you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My apologizes the gentleman from Wake continues to have the balance for
just five minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Conclusion, one thing seems clear recruitment…

  did not lead to more rapid regional growth in all likelihood the absence
of significant growth impacts means that large companies simply displace
other sources of job and income growth in the regional economy. In other
words your taking the money form George and given it to J.H. Your taken
it from all the small business&#39;s and given it to the shareholders of
the big business&#39;s. Your takin it, in one case recently, from the
tax payers of Lake county and given it to Lenovo so they&#39;ll move
from Durham county across the line into Wake county. There&#39;s no net
increase in the income of the region by doing this. And it&#39;s very
expensive, thank you Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Now for what purpose does the gentleman from Dare representative Tine
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Tine moves to amend the bill on page four line eight by
adding after the line the following language to read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Dare has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. This amendment is fairly simple and as we&#39;ve
looked at this program I&#39;ve been very thankful to the bill sponsor
who put in an amendment to make sure more funding could actually go to
tier one counties. If we do awards in tier three counties we went form
twenty five percent to thirty percent which I appreciate very much. The
problem that we&#39;ve had in this state is that we haven&#39;t actually
utilized this fund to it&#39;s full capacity in the past. So money has
been left there and then we as a general assembly as money is left
around we tend to go after it and use it for other purposes. So
we&#39;ve had some money come out of this account over the last few
years. So the purpose of this amendment is to simply expand the
utilization of this account for expanding infrastructure in rural
communities. So it very simply says you can also use it to expand the
existing job base or retention of existing jobs. So our issue in rural
communities is more building upon what we have as opposed to trying to
bring big business&#39;s from outside. So this just gives us another
tool in the tool belt to make that happen so I commend the amendment to
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One housekeeping matter very quickly the chair announces the escort
committee for the chief justice is follows. Representative Stevens
chair. Representatives Szoka, Jackson, Jordan, and farmer Butterfield
and Baskerville. The senate will be so notified. Also, the chair would
like to take the opportunity to welcome a special guest and a friend of
the house and extend the courtesy of the floor to former representative
Danny Mobley who&#39;s in the back of the chamber. Representative Mobley
glad to have you here today. Representative Mobley you&#39;ve picked a
good day to visit us we have a lot of things going on today it&#39;s
good to see you. For what purpose does the lady from Wilson
representative Martin rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the amendment Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The lady has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. I&#39;d like to than representative Tine for
bringing forward this amendment and for working in conjunction with me
and commerce. We&#39;ve had a lot of discussion about what are we doing
to really improve things for our tier one and tier two counties. And
it&#39;s not just landing the big fish there&#39;s a lot of things we
need to do. So he is correct in that the utility fund when large
companies come in and they locate in tier three money is set aside to
benefit tier one and tier two counties. But we have not always done the
best job of making sure that it gets out there. So this expands our
ability to strengthen those tier counties which may not be directly
related to a new job coming at that time but we need those to be strong
the infrastructure to be there so this gives us more flexibility to use
those funds to grow and improve our tier one and two counties. So I
commend the amendment to you and ask you to support it. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Rockingham, is this not on the
amendment? The gentleman from Ash is this on the amendment? Okay. For
what purpose does the gentleman from Pender representative Millis rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker to ask representative Tine a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Dare yield to the gentleman from Pender?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Tine I understand your intent of what you actually shared
of the explained amendment. And I have to say that I&#39;m wholly
sarcastic whenever I hear government say that I&#39;m saving or
retaining jobs. Again you hear about this king of ?? a whole lot. How is
this going to be enforced and how will we as a state not going to be
extorted when you have a company that says I&#39;m going to put more
infrastructure in the ground in rural North Carolina and by the way
I&#39;m about to lay off two hundred

  but if you give me some money out of your utility account our state will
be all good an I&#39;ll give you a thumbs up and a nice little wink. I
understand your intent but this seems to me that this could be
incredibly flawed to the judgement of our tax payers.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
First of all this is infrastructure so it doesn&#39;t leave with the
company, it&#39;s infrastructure for the area that it goes to. And the
example I would use is in Hyde county we have a water plant that is for
the entire business district of Englehard which is six seven eight
buildings that are mostly commercial fishing small business&#39;s. That
infrastructure is about to go away because it has major flaws. This
might be the type of money that might be available to improve that. You
can&#39;t ask those business&#39;s if we improve the infrastructure are
you going to stay but the county itself doesn&#39;t have the money to
improve the infrastructure so it&#39;s just another tool in the toolbelt
to be able to address those types of issues and promote economic
development. But in regards to is there like a claw back or something
like that, we get the infrastructure back.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Dare yeild additional questions from the
gentleman from Pender?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I fully understand your intent and again I am fully supportive of the
aspects of infrastructure by all means so what your sharing here and the
actual tool in the toolbox that you shared in your example is spot on.
My fear is it being used in an improper way and my question is in your
language, does it have enough of a fence around it to make sure it&#39;s
used for the intent you articulated and not for the intent of the
existing business&#39;s to extort to put in infrastructure in the
ground. The reason why I say that is my fear is, yes infrastructure once
it&#39;s put in is there. My fear is whenever your putting
infrastructure in for falsified demand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And I would say that there&#39;s probably ways somebody could create an
issue with it. Just like every other government program that I think
exists out there. To some degree you provide the oversight that, the
problem is if we make it too tight and we say you have to guarantee
these jobs, then we can&#39;t do something that&#39;s good for an entire
community for retaining jobs in that entire community. So it&#39;s a
balance act. You may feel this is out of balance I feel it strikes the
right one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Further discussion further debate on the amendment. Seeing none. The
question before the house is amendment two sent forth by representative
Tine. Somebody favoring the adoption of the amendment will vote aye
those opposed will vote no. The clerk will open the vote.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. One hundred and
eight having voted in the affirmative and eleven in the negative the
amendment is adopted. For what purpose does the gentleman from Ash
representative Jordan rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman from Ash has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Representative Stam gave you some nice
hypotheticals about Lenovo moving from one county to another. I want to
give you a story that&#39;s actually happened in my county I won&#39;t
leave all the details there because of, so the guilty parties are
protected. We have lots of empty storage building empty buildings, empty
offices and so forth in my part of the state. Which is in the Northwest
corner which somehow is going to benefit from everything going on in the
eastern part of the state somehow. I hope so. But, we had this one empty
place and the state gave our commissioners money to fix that place up.
So that they could encourage a company to come in to this building. The
company was from the county next door. The company was of the same
industry that we already had four in our county. Small county, we&#39;re
a very small county. So we gave money to a company to come across the
county line to be in a very nice new building to compete against four
existing folks, two of which had been there over a hundred years family
companies in our county. The situation with jobs didn&#39;t change
because they just took jobs from the existing business&#39;s.
There&#39;s no net benefit to our county and in fact two of the existing
four are now out of business. My friends this what you do when you use
incentives. Thank you.

  <p id="045:00">
  Thank you Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen of the House, it&#39;s very
difficult for me to stand up and speak against this bill. I know that
the administration is for it. I have only the greatest respect for the
bill sponsors that are bringing this forward. I know it&#39;s very
well-meaning and I know for a fact that everybody that sits in this
chamber is for jobs. I represent two Tier 1 counties that have been
among the highest unemployment in this state for as long as I can
remember and I have lived there all my life. I was born there. So I
understand and I understand what some of these representatives are
trying to do, particularly the ones that are trying to bring something
to their area where it&#39;s a depressed area. I understand why a
Representative would be desperate to do everything they possibly can to
bring jobs, even if it violates their conscience somewhat to do so. And
we&#39;ve heard some say, I don&#39;t like this, I&#39;m against this,
I&#39;ve been against this, but I&#39;ve got to do it. And I&#39;ve
listened carefully to all the arguments, the emotions, the anecdotes,
the cliches, but I&#39;ve also looked at a broader set of facts. Some of
the things that Representative Stam spoke of and Representative Jordan
and I want to mention them a little bit as well, but let me say this. I
do want to thank the sponsors of this bill for the respectful way that
they have brought forth this debate. I do want to say that I think
it&#39;s unfortunate that at times those of us that oppose this idea, we
are marginalized or we&#39;re often dismissed as being closed-minded ??
or purists riding on our high horse, or people that just don&#39;t
understand how business really works. So I think at least we should
acknowledge that there&#39;s a long list of facts and studies published
by every kind of group out there. And interpreted both by liberal groups
and conservative groups that all strongly oppose this. Whether they
interpret those facts from the lens of the right or from the left. There
are not too many things that these conservative and liberal groups will
agree on but they agree on this and they&#39;re strongly opposed to it.
But let&#39;s make sure that we understand the real debate today.
We&#39;re not here to decide whether or not North Carolina will continue
to use incentives. That&#39;s not what this bill is about. Let&#39;s
acknowledge at least for the record that what we are here about is
dramatically increasing the use of these incentives in our state. So
what do we hear? Well we hear it works. Well of course it works. Of
course it works. If you spend enough money, you can create some jobs. Of
course you can entice some jobs, particularly if you&#39;re willing to
rob Peter to pay Paul, to create the job. But yes, it works. You know, a
little analogy, you can spend a half million dollars on a car. And I
certainly hope it would work. I think it would. I think it would work
well. But you could also take the argument that you can spend 25 times
less on that car and spend all the other money on all the other things
that you might need and I think most of us here understand that the art
of politics, the real world is that we have limited resources, and we
have a lot of needs in this state. Depending on what you think those
needs are, we could all agree on a lot of them. And so we are making
choices here. That&#39;s what it&#39;s all about. We are making choices
with a limited budget. Well we hear this is the right time. You know,
it&#39;s always the right time. When I came here four years ago, in
2011, North Carolina had unemployment between 10 and 11%, fifth worst in
the nation, and we were hearing it&#39;s the right time. The ox is in
the ditch. We&#39;ve got to do this. We&#39;ve got to do everything we
can, we are desperate for jobs. So now we&#39;re here four years later.
And the unemployment rate has been pretty much cut in half. And again I
represent one of those areas where it&#39;s still higher, but statewide
it&#39;s pretty much been cut in half. We&#39;re around the national
average. I think this month we&#39;re a little better than the national
average. But the point is it&#39;s still the right time. This is the
right time. This is the best time. We&#39;ve got to do this now. Well,
we keep hearing that all of these state, all of our neighboring states
are just kicking our rear ends. That&#39;s what we hear. So I looked at
the latest unemployment figures. North Carolina, 5.5%. South Carolina,
6.5%. Tennessee, 6.6%. Georgia, 6.9%. All these other states

…All that we hear of beading this out because of other heavy incentives
compared to what we do but yet we have a significantly better employment
rate. And by the way, I didn’t leave anything on your desk but about
half an hour ago I did send you an email and we could talk about that
and the article that I sent you had to do with one of our neighboring
states and how their debt is now continuing to go up and they are
talking about the use of these incentive programs and why that happens.
We hear all the analogies, it’s a game, we got to play the game, there
will be game changer, we all wanna win the game but we got to do it
better than everybody else, we got to do it more than everybody else
more as better and we can never do enough because somebody else that
they are doing more but it’s a game and we got to win the game. So we
hear all about the game and I’m a sports fan, we wanna win the game. Or
if the sports analogy didn’t work maybe we hear the military analogy, if
we don’t do it, it’s unilateral disarmament, I don’t think we should lay
down all of our weapons but I do think there are some better weapons out
there we could use, weapons like free markets and fair competition and a
level playing field, and things like that, making our state more
business friendly and what we do and we have done that and we are gonna
continue to do it. But we need to understand that there is an
opportunity cost, we never talked too much about opportunity cost what
else could we will do. In 2009, there was a very well sighted study, it
was done right here at UNC, the UNC’s Kenan-Flagler School of Business
where they sit in the previous decade North Carolina in it’s JDIG
Program has spend about 3 billion dollars and we came up with 300 jobs.
We heard a lot about that four years ago, we don’t seem to be hearing a
lot about it today but there is an opportunity cost there and I would
tell you as a former County Commissioner of that tier 1 County that I
came from yes we try to ?? and try to get some of the promise from the
table that we are going to mainly our rule, our urban areas and our
wealthy areas, and we talk a little bit about these statistics with
that. Sure, we will try to get some comments from the table and we all
are and that’s another thing that’s wrong with it not only pit state
against state, it pits county against county, it pits community against
community, we are trading like pigs coming to a troff and trying to get
our fare share and I would say if my county had got our proportional
share over the years and I look at the 30 million dollar share out of
that 3 billion dollars, it would have been transformational to my county
with 30 million dollars would mean it would be huge. What we hear
everybody does it, everybody does it, I think there is a lot of parents
in the room, I don’t know about you, how that argument would fly your
house when your children come home and says, “Well, everybody does it
and that makes it okay.” Actually everybody doesn’t do it or everybody
doesn’t do it to the same degree that we hear that everybody does it.
This might be a good deal for the less than one-tenth of 1% of North
Carolina businesses that actually get these incentives but for the most
it does not, for the 800,000 plus small businesses in the State that
actually pay the higher taxes so that their money can actually go to
businesses that often times complete against them and put them at a
disadvantage and that’s not fair, that’s no fair and I understand the
world we live in is not fair and you can say  the Federal Government
makes the rules and by the way that’s another thing that we hear. Well,
the Federal Government comes in and changes things and will do things
differently. Well, ladies and gentlemen until states like North Carolina
standup and take a leadership role and show that we can do things right
and that we can compete and that we can have lower unemployment rates
and that we can bring jobs by turning the free markets and fair
competition and level playing field and better business friendliness,
they are not gonna change the rules, they are not gonna change the
rules. So everybody says, “I hate this but we have to do it.” Let me
just close and just say, let’s acknowledge and I respect every vote in
this room however you come down vote your contents. But let’s at least
acknowledge that there are lot of facts out there, there are lot of
journals, there are lot of articles that have been published from
universities all over the country from tanks on the right and on the
left, those who have to speak against this or not just people that don’t
have any idea what we are talking about or let’s at least have a respect
for debate, and let’s acknowledge that there are many costs beyond just
the dollars that are on this piece of paper, there are opportunity
costs, and we have got agriculture in this state, the number one
economic driver, we have got tourism the number two…

Think of what the investment and infrastructure could remain to
agriculture in the state and the tourism in the state but we are gonna
make a choice that we are gonna give these incentives to just a few
businesses. So again, we are not debating today just the way the North
Carolina is going to give economic incentives or not and that’s not yet.
We are deciding today are we gonna put the program on steroids, or we
gonna wretch it up to this degree, and that’s the choice that you have
to make ladies and gentlemen vote your contents, I will vote mine, I

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??___[00:44] said, “What the government gives it must first take away.”
We own nothing, the Government owns nothing ladies and gentlemen, we
keep talking about Government Funds, and we kept talk about tax money
this and that. That belongs to the people, that belongs to the folks
sitting up here and over here, that belongs to everybody outside these
doors, and we don’t take the time to think about what we are doing and
how we are spending their money, how many of these people, how many of
the people outside those doors paid their taxes through the force of law
so that we as the anointed ones or vision of the anointed we know better
than everybody that we can pick the winners and the losers, we can pick
which businesses are gonna make it and which ones are not, and we do
this with no risk to ourselves because it’s not our money. Now, if we
had to take the money out of our pockets and we have to make bets on
which presences will succeed and which ones wouldn’t, I bet it would be
taken a whole different view of this, but we own nothing and it belongs
to the people, we were on the right track for the last few years, and we
are doing everything to destroy that. North Carolina is moving up on
poll after poll after poll and here we are, we voted against this type
of thing, we ?? it out for months to attract a sensation last year for
the next year month and more. But in the end we got rid of it, we got
rid of JDIG, we got rid of whatever recalling it now whether the money
goes out on the front end or the backend is irrelevant, the programs are
the same, it’s just different people, different time, different sessions
thinking that they have got the best ideas and ladies and gentlemen we
don’t, these types of things fail time after time after time. JDIG
grants according to John Locke Foundation, JDIG grants last up to 12
years, and very few of them have been successful. Now, we gave it a new
name so it’s not called JDIG but essentially we are looking at the same
type of stuff. Very few JDIG deals have actually going to ?? of the 201
grants that have been awarded since 2002 only three have gone full-term
of the original bill, three. 73 have either been withdrawn or
terminated, all other part of the grant has been returned or forfeited
for non-compliance or back, and only nine JDIG are works since we lost
money. So let me rephrase that, we didn’t loose money, people have lost
money, those people outside that door lost money, here we are and once
again this is a new program and we got a new program, we got a better
idea, we got different people running it, it’s all the same things, it’s
all the same thing, and we were on track with our tax reforms fixing all
the things that we did, we made the state better. And now, these types
of things will trying to dismantle what we have done. We don’t have
funding for transportation, we don’t have funding for medicate, and
merely the other programs but ?? we have funding, we somehow manage to
come up with millions that we are going to give a way based on our
vision of the anointed ones again winners and the losers in business.
Let me tell you something ladies and gentlemen, no matter who we pick to
get these incentives, those folks up there lose, everybody outside this
door looses. I hope you will think about what you are doing, I hope you
remember why you came up here.

  For what purpose does the gentleman from Cabarrus, Representative
Pittman, rise? [Speaker Changes] To speak on the bill. [Speaker Changes]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill. [Speaker Changes] Thank
you sir. There seems to be a misconception at least looks to me a
misconception among some supporters of this bill, that those that oppose
it are anti-business. Nothing could be further from the truth. I believe
we are all pro-business, knowing that businesses are necessary for
adequate employment. But I think I see here however, and please forgive
me if this isn&#39;t the way you feel, but I think some do, that a lot
of folks who are businessmen and businesswomen seem to think that
they&#39;ve come to Raleigh to run the business world. I contend that
that approach to business is not appropriate to do here in the
legislature. Whatever we do back home, we are not businesspeople here.
We are the government. It is none of the government&#39;s business to
run business. It is our job to create a climate favorable to business,
get out of the way, and let the free enterprise system take care of
itself. We do that through lowering taxes, reducing burdensome
regulations, and requiring everyone to deal honestly with each other,
not by giving the taxpayers&#39; money to corporations that are only
concerned about the bottom line and getting their share. Now I know some
folks simply don&#39;t see it. They are good people. But they, and they
mean well, but they don&#39;t understand somehow that the demand for
economic incentives is a form of extortion. Our citizens have a right to
expect better from their government than to volunteer to be blackmailed
and make excuses for it because the taxpayers will pay for it and not
us. Businesses have the right to sell their products and services to
customers who are willing to pay for those and thus make a living. They
do not have the right to be given taxpayers&#39; money to remove from
them the challenge and financial burden of building a business that
others have to bear for themselves. When government misappropriates tax
dollars to pick and choose businesses to favor over others, not only is
that government interference, but it makes it harder for government to
fulfill its own legitimate functions and obligations. We&#39;re told
that we have to do this because everyone else is doing it, and to me
that doesn&#39;t sound like an appropriate statement or responsible
adult statement. It sounds to me, I&#39;m sorry, like an adolescent
excuse. For this corrupt system to be the norm today, someone had to be
the first to say yes to it. For our society to wake up and cleanse
ourselves from such corruption, someone has to be the first to say “no,
never again”. I ask you to stand up for honesty and integrity and the
free enterprise system and let North Carolina lead the way and turn down
this unscrupulous and crooked way of doing business. I believe in the
free enterprise system. This is not it. Please vote no on this bill.
[Speaker Changes] For what purpose does the gentleman from ??,
Representative Steinberg, rise? [Speaker Changes] Slowly. To speak on
the bill, please. [Speaker Changes] The gentleman has the floor to
debate the bill. [Speaker Changes] Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I
respect a lot of what my colleagues have said today, voicing their views
on why we should not be offering economic incentives of any kind. And I
know their position because that&#39;s been my position for many, many
years. So I&#39;ve heard all of the arguments. I know them all very
well. And nothing here today that I heard has surprised me nor
enlightened me in any way. And I say that with all due respect.
Representative Jones, who is probably one of my dearest friends in the
General Assembly, and he and I are on opposite ends of this particular
bill but we&#39;re so often joined at the hip on others, mentioned the
fact, he was quoting unemployment rates. And New York, or rather North
Carolina has made great progress in bringing the unemployment rate down
by some of the actions that we have taken already in this body over the
last four or five years. However, you can use numbers in any way you
choose. If you want to say our unemployment rate is at 5.2 or 5.3%, I
won&#39;t argue with you. And I think that&#39;s a dramatic improvement
on where we&#39;ve been in the past. But if you want to talk about the
unemployment rate in rural North Carolina, let&#39;s take a look at
those rates. I have almost all tier one counties out of the six counties
that I am privileged and honored to represent here in the General
Assembly.

  And I know the desperation, the fight, the struggle that folks have had
to try and obtain a job to provide a living for themselves and their
family. An opportunity to have an education that goes behind K through
12 for their children. We are sending tons of money to rural North
Carolina whether we pass this bill or not. That&#39;s a fact, because we
are going to have to uphold and help those areas that are struggling in
various and sundry ways. What I&#39;m suggesting is I think we need to
begin to have a shift in our mindset, and let&#39;s think once again
about investing in people. Let&#39;s think about investing those people
who are so desperate, not to collect an unemployment check, not to be on
welfare, but they want an opportunity. That&#39;s what we were sent here
to do. Above everything else, we were sent here not to swear allegiance
to any one ideology, but as Republicans and Democrats, representing, and
unaffiliated, we, we are here to, to represent the folks and to try and
bring them good government, to try to bring them opportunity, to try and
give them, above everything else, hope. Hope. H-O-P-E. Hope. I don&#39;t
want to go back to my district, and I&#39;m sure many of my rural
colleagues on both sides of the aisle, do not want to go back to their
districts and tell voters that, you know something? We had an
opportunity to bring a lot of jobs to this region, but I&#39;ll tell you
what. I stayed within the box. I didn&#39;t budge. I am against
incentives. Aren&#39;t you happy? Yeah, they&#39;re happy all right.
They had a chance to get 1000 jobs, 500 jobs, 200 jobs, 50 jobs, and no,
those folks aren&#39;t very happy at all, because you&#39;re asking them
now to wait until another opportunity presents itself. Everybody knows
what this bill is about. This bill is on a fast track because we&#39;re
talking about an automobile industry coming to North Carolina, perhaps
maybe even three. We are incentivizing through this bill those three
businesses, but what we are not considering is the ripple effect.
Everybody else that does business with that company is coming to North
Carolina with jobs whether we incentivize them or not, because they have
to be here. If it&#39;s a truck plant and they have a certain kind of
tire or certain components, the folks who are putting those vehicles
together are saying we want you here. So when we&#39;re talking about
incentives, let&#39;s look at the big picture. Not just who is being
incentivized, but what is the result of that company being incentivized,
and if we can transform these two almost destitute parts of the state,
Eastern North Carolina and Western North Carolina, if we can begin to
transform them and give these people hope, then we truly will be one
North Carolina. Please ladies and gentlemen, please support this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Speaker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose, for what purpose does the lady from New Hanover,
Representative Hamilton rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if my good friend from Edenton, Representative Steinberg would
answer a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Chowan yield to the lady from Hanover?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I do. It&#39;s good to see you back again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I don&#39;t know where you&#39;ve been, but good to see you back.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative. Well, I&#39;ve been trying to make a living a
little bit. It&#39;s tough, it&#39;s tough around these parts. I&#39;m
glad to hear of your change of heart about incentives and bringing
businesses to North Carolina as a whole. I campaigned on the need for
incentives, not the desire to have them, but the need for them in order
to be competitive. I believe strongly in this, this bill and the
programs that are listed in it. But I wonder, how would you feel about
expanding this bill to include other credits and other incentives that
have gone by the wayside in recent years because of inaction by this
general assembly to restore those jobs to other areas of the state?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That&#39;s an excellent question and I&#39;m not surprised you asked it.
Thank you, thank you

  question. I am obviously in favor of bringing jobs to each and every
part of the state, including your part of the state. I think one of the
objectives of this particular bill was to try and run a clean a bill as
possible and not have various incendiary, wait, let me finish, okay, and
not be tying everything else into it. For example, as you know, I am a
big proponent of the historic tax credits and I am going to, as a matter
of fact I have already co-sponsored a bill to try and get that through
the General Assembly, certainly through the House and I would have no
problems talking with you about supporting your particular initiative.
But I think jumbling up this bill with all sorts of other initiatives
would be counterproductive and we have to ultimately look at this bill
passing through the Senate as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly, second question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield to an additional question from the lady, he
yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Of course I do, yes, Mr. Speaker, thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thakn you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The Chair hates to disrupt this conversation between the two members but
if the two could frame a question and an answer that would be most
appreciated.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, I guess it&#39;s are you troubled by the, you talk about a clean
bill and 117 being a clean bill, are you troubled at all by the
extension oft he tax credit for commercial airlines until 2020. I think
that&#39;s the part that doesn&#39;t fit for me in this particular bill,
otherwise I would agree with you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, may I answer, Mr. Speaker? Okay, alright, thank you. In meetings
that I have attended, been privileged to, including the one in which
that particular portion was added to this bill, there are some issues of
urgency as it relates to transportation issues, airline issues, in
Charlotte, North Carolina, which is, you know, is a hub for a very major
airline. And I am not going to try and put words in the airlines mouths
or certainly in Representative Jeter&#39;s mouth, who&#39;s from that
district, and other representatives from Charlotte. They would be better
at speaking to that than I, but I do know that losing that hub would be
critical. That is something that is currently in existence and we&#39;re
trying to keep it. So I hope I&#39;ve, tried to answer your question.
Yes, thank you, and it is good to see you again.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Nash, Representative Collins,
rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You know, if we were just having a philosophical argument I&#39;d
probably have to agree with some of what&#39;s been said today. I agree,
I&#39;m very much a free market person. I don&#39;t believe we need to
be taking people&#39;s hard earned money and tax money and spending it
any way we want to. That&#39;s why about the only type of incentive
I&#39;m ever willing to vote for is one like the one we&#39;re talking
about here where money that doesn&#39;t exist because the company is not
doing business in North Carolina, comes to North Carolina. We have
additional tax money and for want of a better word we rebate them a
fraction of that tax money for a certain period of time. That&#39;s
nothing at all like some of the other things people are trying to get us
to restore where people who don&#39;t pay any taxes in North Carolina,
we pay some of their expenses or if you can just check off the right ten
boxes you get this tax credit regardless of whether we think this is
going to create anything for North Carolina or not. Realize, this is a
whole different program. And we&#39;re not talking about a philosophical
situation, folks, let&#39;s face it. This bill is being propounded right
now and it&#39;s time sensitive because we do finally have three auto
manufacturers, at least, that I know about and there may be more, three
that I&#39;m aware of, looking at locating in North Carolina. Now, if
you don&#39;t think these are the type of businesses that are worth
going after and if you don&#39;t think other business people think these
are the type of businesses worth going after, you are sadly mistaken.
The people in my area that are working their rear ends off to get one of
these companies to come to this location are other small business owners
in the region. And they&#39;re the ones that are begging me to get this
passed. They&#39;re begging me to get it passed. They would be astounded
if they knew so many of my good colleagues I couldn&#39;t convince to
vote for this. I know last I voted, I&#39;m sorry that some of these
haven&#39;t come to your area, and frankly some of this sounds like sour
grapes. I know last year I voted for a bill that would keep a thousand
jobs in Michele Presnell&#39;s area. That&#39;s across the state from
me. That didn&#39;t do me any good. But I&#39;m not here just to
represent my district. This auto plant will not be in my district, it
will be in a district represented by a democrat. I could care less. It
doesn&#39;t make any difference. This will be a game changer, not for

  ...my area, not for East or North Carolina, this will be a game changer
for the state, if you don&#39;t believe it, has anyone been to
Greenville, Spartanburg, South Carolina in the last ten years? Ask
&#39;em if that&#39;s the game changer. For not just that area but for
the state. I can tell you who wants this plant to come to this area, the
restaurant owners, the department store owners, the grocery store
owners, the real estate companies that will finally have some buyers for
these houses in our area that are up for sale. The construction company
owners that haven&#39;t been able to build anything for the last seven
years. All of these people hope desperately that these folks will come
to our area. I guarantee you every small business, we&#39;re not talking
about trying to drag out a fifty person mom-and-pop shop to compete with
another mom-and-pop shop, that&#39;s not what we&#39;re talking about in
this issue. That&#39;s not at all what we&#39;re talking about. The real
situation is one or more companies, now, more than one of them won&#39;t
come to the same location, and frankly, the only reason we&#39;re in the
running for this, frankly, is because they require twelve hundred acres
ready to go and we&#39;re talking about six sites in North America that
fit the bill. And unfortunately, at least one of them&#39;s in Mexico,
so I know they&#39;ll have the wage benefit down there, so we need
something, but we&#39;re talking about a very real situation where
multiples of billions of dollars will be expended immediately. Multiples
of thousands of people will be employed immediately. And when that plant
grows from four thousand to eight thousand, we won&#39;t have to give a
dime of that tax money back for that next four thousand. And when
sixteen thousand people come in on the ancillary businesses located
around these plants, we won&#39;t have to give a dime of that tax money
back. So, we can talk philosophically about pitting people against other
people, as far as I know, the nearest competitor to this auto plant will
be in South Carolina, and I don&#39;t like the people in South Carolina,
frankly. So let&#39;s quit talking about stuff this bill&#39;s not for,
and let&#39;s talk about what this bill&#39;s designed for, and I hope I
can get you to vote for this. If this were born in one of your areas, I
would vote for it in a heartbeat, because I would be happy to get,
probably by the time the ancillary businesses come in, fifteen to twenty
thousand high paying jobs to come to any part of North Carolina, I&#39;d
be dancing on my desk this afternoon, and that&#39;s an ugly sight, you
don&#39;t want to see that. But I would beg you, please, for the good of
our entire state, if you would like for my area to become a contributor
to our state, instead of a ward of the state, please vote green on this
bill.
Mr Speaker...
What purpose does the gentleman from Cumberland, Representative Floyd
rise?
To see if the Georgia leader ?? would hear for a question.
Does the gentleman wish to direct the question to the Rules chairman or
the Majority leader?
Majority leader.
Does the gentleman from Rutherford yield to the gentleman from
Cumberland?
I do, Mr. Chairman, I think I know where this is going.
He yields.
Mr. Majority leader, we have five, now we have four o&#39; clock
appointment, is there any way that we can sort of bring closure to this
discussion?
President Floyd, I feel your pain also, I would defer to the Rules
Chairman Speaker if we want to do anything, but I will on my part try to
bring the discussion to a close as quick as we can.
Representative Floyd, the chair would like to shed some light on the
schedule today. It is the intention of the chair to take a recess at
three thirty, so that everything can be reconfigured so that we can
prepare for the joint session that&#39;s supposed to begin at four,
that&#39;s what staff tell me that they need. It would be the
chair&#39;s hope that we could have a vote by three thirty, but if folks
are still feeling the need to debate, the chair&#39;s prepared to recess
and let us come back and debate after that. But the chair would also
remind the body that we also have another bill that&#39;s probably going
to consume a lot of oxygen also, but that being said, the chair will
defer and allow members to have full debate on this bill.
Mr. Speaker?
For what purpose does the gentleman from Pender, Representative Millis
rise?
To ask Representative Collins a few questions.
Does the gentleman from Nash yield to the gentleman from Pender?
He yields.
Mr. Collins, I definitely appreciate you actually rising to clarify some
things that are missing in this debate, but the first question I want to
ask you is, is this bill that we&#39;re voting on, is it about the
game-changer you talk about, or is it truly about raising the cap of
actually these incentive programs, that just doesn&#39;t go to the
game-changer that you relate to Greenville, South Carolina, but also can
go to a lot of other aspects that may not be the game changer and
actually could be a loser for us. Now, are we just voting on your game
changer, or are we voting on raising the actual threshold of something
we&#39;ve been doing for decades in this state?
I would say we are making that game changer possible, and if there&#39;s
any money left, if we&#39;re fortunate enough to get the game changer,
and if there&#39;s any money left, the answer to your question is going
to be yes.

  To uphold the constitution of the state of North Carolina with our
friends and families and loved ones in the gallery and some of them on
the House floor with us, we placed our hand on the Holy Bible and swore
this solemn oath. While there are decades of judicial standing that say
one thing about target recruitment incentives, until the famous 1996
case at the supreme level, which by the way overturned a lower court
ruling in a highly partisan 5-2 vote, but I wanna beg your attention to
your oath of office. We swore oath to the document. It is my strong
belief, and you can feel free to disagree, that the provision that we
are building upon today involving reducing the tax burden of a chosen
business by 75% when that same tax burden is not available uniformly to
all citizens to achieve is clearly unconstitutional and I wanna beg your
attention to two sections of the actual constitution that you swore the
oath too. First and foremost it says that we hold these truths to be
self-evident that all persons are created equal, that they are endowed
by the creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are
life, liberty, the enjoyment of the fruits of their own labor and the
pursuit of happiness. Note the phrase that we all have the right to the
enjoyment of the fruits of our own labor. In addition, in Article 5
Section 2 it says the power of taxation will be exercised in a just and
equitable manner for public purposes only and shall never be surrendered
or contracted away, just in equitable. How can we take the fruit of
labor from one in a non-equal portion and then another and uphold our
office as elected officials? Regardless of the public purpose, this
action is clearly inequitable on all levels. Do you seriously think the
intent of our framers whether you are democrat or republican meant that
the power of North Carolina Government is to respect the fruit of labor
of one and then disrespect the fruits of another? Ladies and gentlemen,
I want to create the opportunity for jobs to grow in this state just as
much as the greatest advocate in this chamber, but I will only do so
within the purvue of the oath that I swore with my hand on the Holy
Bible and I will ask you to consider the same. If our state government
is not going to respect the fruit of the labor of our citizens and apply
the burden of taxation in an equitable manner, then what other liberties
are we going to trample. You and your constituents should be fearful of
the actions that are currently underway in this body. I would not dare
to build the house, let me back up here, and for those of us who are in
the current majority, why would you want to enhance, expand and endorse
a flawed foundation that was built before your time. I would not dare to
build the house of this majority on a faulty foundation, a foundation
that many of you who were here when it was laid denounced and voted
against. How can you support the continuation of such efforts now? Why
would we not lay a different foundation to build upon, a foundation
built solidly within our constitutional purvue and within the principles
of true economic growth? No matter how hard you try to justify, theory,
application and history prove that government cannot create jobs
effectively as individuals, therefore why don&#39;t we put our efforts
behind supporting measures that are aligned with the principles of
individual liberty and limited government? I would encourage you to
strongly consider your conscience. Recall the oath that you swore in the
presence of you family as well as the presence of Almighty God. Ask
yourself are you preserving and expanding liberty or are you aiding and
abetting a foundation of tyrannical government? I will rest well knowing
that I&#39;m trying with every fiber of my being to create an
environment where jobs can grow in this state in line with the very oath
that I swore. I encourage you to rest easy as well. To vote against this

It is my distinct privilege to renew the tradition of reporting to you
on the state of the judicial branch of state government. It is
particularly meaningful to renew this tradition this year, when we
celebrate the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta. Now, as Speaker Pro Tem
Stam has so soften reminded this body, Magna Carta is foundational to
our liberties and form of government as it was the first governing
document to place limits on the power of the English King. You see, in
Europe, at the time of our countries&#39; independence, judges typically
remained in office only if their rulings pleased the crown. Our founders
saw the need for an independent judiciary, a judiciary not left to the
control of a monarch, but instead a separate and equal branch of
government, accountable to the people as expressed int heir
constitution. The founders recognized that the judicial branch&#39;s
solemn duty to preserve the rule of law was best achieved in this way.
And so, on this special occasion, I am reminded of our generation&#39;s
stewardship of this sacred duty of government, preserving justice for
all. Earlier this morning, thousands of school children across our great
state pledged allegiance to the flag and recited the words &quot;with
liberty and justice for all.&quot; Those same children are learning and
we hope they are paying attention, that our state has three co-equal
branches of government. The legislative branch, which is responsible for
making our laws. The executive branch, which is responsible for
executing those laws. And the judicial branch, which resolves disputes
arising under those laws. And for the judicial branch, ensuring justice
for all is the most important thing that we do. The judicial branch
comprises more than 6,000 public servants. Our unified court system
includes seven supreme court justices,

  Fifteen court of appeals judges one hundred and twelve superior court
judges two hundred and seventy district court judges. One hundred
clerics of court and many of our clerics are with us today and forty
four district attorneys. The administrative office of the courts
provides our elected judges, clerics, prosecutors and courthouse
personnel with assistance in personnel management and compensation.
Purchase and delivery of equipment and technology systems and
specialized judicial and staff training. In states without a unified
court system these jobs are duplicated in every local jurisdiction. The
judicial branch handles just under three million, yes, three million
cases each year. We are grateful for the support that the general
assembly has graciously shown our justice system. This general
assembly&#39;s recent business court modernization act is an excellent
example. We know that as stable and predictable legal system is a key
driver of economic development in a globally competitive market place.
As this general assembly has wisely recognized strong courts our good
for business. Likewise in two thousand eleven this general assembly
passed the Justice Reinvestment Act. That legislation was designed to
improve public safety and conserve resources. By enacting the Justice
Reinvestment Act the general assembly has safeguarded public resources
while investing in programs that decrease crime per five ? mental health
treatment and strengthen our communities. In both of these examples the
general assembly has partnered with the judicial branch and other
stakeholders to ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice.
We all know that lack of business the administrative operations of the
judicial branch must be run efficiently in order to be effective. We
understand this and we fully appreciate that in partnering with this
legislative branch. The judicial branch must be a good steward of
it&#39;s resources. I want to take a moment to tell you about the
justice systems efforts in promoting savings in recent years. When the
Great Recession began nearly eight years ago, it placed tremendous
strain and pressure upon the general assembly to keep the budget
balanced. Like the executive branch and the legislative branch, the
judicial branch did it&#39;s part. Our operations budget has been
reduced significantly. As has our budget for personnel. However even
before the start of the great recession in two thousand seven, North
Carolina ranked forty ninth out of fifty states in terms of per capita
spending on the judicial branch. Five years later in two thousand and
twelve we ranked forty fifth out of fifty states using the same source
data as corroborated by the highly respected national center for state
courts. We have eliminated positions and currently have workforce
deficits in courthouses across our state. Under the metrics used by the
National center for state courts, our judicial branch is now
understaffed by five hundred and thirty six positions. That is
approximately nine percent of our workforce. It is clear that we are
asking our justice system employees to do more with less. Our dedicated
judicial branch staff has picked up the slack from these vacancies ,
while their own families finances are still feeling the strain of
economic hardship. I am told that assistant clerics and court employees
are taking second and even third jobs to make ends meet. Magistrates and
assistant clerics of court pitched in to help each other when they
didn&#39;t have enough staff to get the work done. Deputy sheriffs and
security guards also lent a hand while vigilantly protecting our
courthouse from those who would do us harm. Judicial officials and
employees across our great state have carried out countless acts of
diligence and compassion and hardwork that so often went unpublicized
during these challenging economic times. We will continue to do our part
to manage expenses. In response to the recession, not only did we lower
expenditures through workforce reductions. We also re engineered our
operations to capture inefficiencies, for example, we improved our
centralized procurement system for statewide supply purchases and
deliveries to generate three hundred and fifty thousand...

  [SPEAKER CHANGES] In their patrol vehicle. If the search warrant is
approved, it can be processed electronically in the NCAWARE system and
the search can proceed. In rural counties where a magistrate is on call
for a 24 hour shift, this technology may eliminate the need for travel
to a courthouse. Investments in this type of technology pay off many
times over, especially for law enforcement officers who have more time
to ensure the safety of our communities. Now an initiative that we will
soon be undertaking involves civics education. Our citizens must
understand the vital role that courts perform in protecting our
democracy. This dialogue must begin in our schools with our youngest
citizens. Thus I have asked two of my colleagues on the Supreme Court to
work with the State Board of Education and the Department of Public
Instruction to enhance our state civics education curriculum. In
addition, we will develop a speakers bureau of judges and citizens who
can talk to community groups and school classes aboui the importance of
civic values. In order to ensure that young people understand the
fundamental principles of our society, this work must continue. As our
economy improves, we are also exploring innovative ways to bring out
innovation in electronic filing to further invest in the efficient
administration of justice. How many of us have children or grandchildren
who cannot function without their smartphones? Many of us now fall into
that category as well. As a judge at the Court of Appeals, and now as a
Justice at the Supreme Court, I have seen firsthand the benefits of
technology. We were national leaders when our Supreme Court instituted
an electronic filing system almost 20 years ago. Our business courts
have also benefitted from e-filing. Recently, our neighbors to the north
and to the south, Virginia and South Carolina, began moving forward with
statewide e-filing in their trial courts. Now we are developing a master
plan for instituting e-filing statewide. In order to innovate in a
prudent manner, we will prepare a strategic action plan outlining how to
implement e-filing and virtual courtroom technology in all 100 county
courthouses. We will be deliberate in our approach and our plans will
benefit from technological expertise in the private sector, from
studying the best practices of other states that have been administering
e-filing systems for several years, and from practical insights of the
numerous stakeholders within our own system. In sum, we have learned to
do more with less. But while these efforts at efficiency and innovation
in our justice system have helped ease the crisis, they are not enough.
Many of you are business owners and understand that a business cannot
bring itself out of the red through efficiencies and innovation alone.
It needs investment capital if it is to succeed. The same is true for
the judicial branch. We are now approaching a challenging phase in terms
of the judicial branch&#39;s operational needs. Our operations budget is
under tremendous stress and we have been forced to rely on money
available from vacant positions to cover basic functions such as
payments to jurors, court reporters, and expert witnesses. If we cannot
pay for these basic services, we cannot conduct timely trials. The
resulting delays erode public trust and confidence in the integrity of
the justice system because they impair our ability to promptly apprehend
offenders and see that they are tried and appropriately sentenced. We
all know that justice that is delayed is justice that has been denied
and we are now confronting a situation where the justice system is
unable to promptly serve those who turn to us for help. The justice
system is in many ways a complex chain. And we all know that a chain is
only as strong as its weakest link. In order to bring a felony criminal

  case to trial, among other things, a grand jury indictment must be
returned, and often times lab results must be obtained. I am told that
delays of more than a year have become the norm, rather than the
exception, for lab results of blood alcohol tests in DUI cases and DNA
analysis in serious felony cases. These delays undermine the ability of
our criminal justice system to deter crime and to do justice. Even when
cases proceed after these delays, many never go to trial because
defendants enter into agreements with the state where the defendant
pleads guilty to a lesser defense in order for the state to avoid
expenses associated with trials. Especially when resources are limited,
this strategy allows prosecutors to cope with their heavy caseloads. Now
in many instances, these agreements are perfectly legitimate, but never
let it be said that because of inadequate resources, our prosecutors
were forced into doing this. Now, if a case makes it to trial, a jury
has to be selected and a court reporter scheduled. And I am not aware of
any current technology that can replace the role of our court reporters
in these serious cases. Defendants who are found guilty can appeal to
the court of appeals and also seek further review in our Supreme Court.
There are many steps in the process from the time a criminal defendant
is arrested until the time that the case is finally resolved. The entire
system must work correctly from start to finish and this requires
adequate resources. Our state constitution guarantees that courts shall
be opened and that justice shall be administered without delay. Think
about what it will mean if the people of this great state can not reply
upon us to promptly administer justice. How can we explain that to the
victims of violent crime and their families? How can we explain that to
the small business owners who need a contract dispute resolved in order
to keep their store open and avoid bankruptcy? How can we explain that
to the family that lost a loved one because of a drunk driver? We must
be able to provide them justice. In order to do this, we need the help
of this General Assembly. We all know how important education is to the
progress of this great state. By way of illustration, one county&#39;s
annual budget for the public school system in fiscal year 2014-2015 is
nearly 1.5 billion dollars. The entire justice system budget for all one
hundred counties is only 464 million dollars. This means that the entire
judicial branch budget is less than 1/3 of the Weight county public
school system&#39;s budget. The funding related problems that we are now
facing have been decades in the making. It is not the fault of any
particular General Assembly. Over the past 25 years, our state&#39;s
commitment to the judiciary has not exceeded 3% of the state budget.
That&#39;s less than 3% for a coequal branch of government. If we are to
right this ship, the judicial branch will need sufficient investment
from this General Assembly to ensure that we adequately fund the basic
operations of our court system, provide modest pay increases for our

support the rapidly increasing demands on our county courthouses across

examples, the judicial branch will be a good steward of this investment.
Indeed, to further our accountability to this body and to the general
public, this spring I will convene a multi-disciplinary commission to
undertake a comprehensive evaluation of our justice system, and to make
recommendations for how we can strengthen our courts within the existing
administrative framework. We will be inviting participation from the
General Assembly. The commission will also include key leaders from the
private sector and stakeholders from within our justice system. This

  [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senate Bill 20, the clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senators Rabin, Rucho and Tillman, Senate Bill 20, a
bill to be entitled An Act to Update the Reference to the Internal
Revenue Code to decouple from certain provisions of the Federal Tax
Increase Provision Act of 2014 to modify the motor fuel tax rate, and to
make certain reductions within the Department of Transportation for the
2014-2015 fiscal year, General Assembly for North Carolina enacts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For our purpose, that is the gentleman from
Mecklenburg. Representative Brawley rise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To explain the bill Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Speaker, and I would like to say first
of all to the members that I am aware that the Flavors of Carolina has
already started at the North Raleigh Hilton and that the Restaurant
Association of Big Ed&#39;s and the Greater Raleigh Chamber at the
Museum of History are coming up at 5:30, and I am completly cognizant
that I am the only thing that stands between you and dinner. This is
partially the IRC Update Bill, which was passed out of the Revenue Law
Study Committee and introduced in both houses. It addressed whether or
not we would conform to changes in the Internal Revenue Service, or we
would decouple for the coming year. As to the increase, Section 179
Expensing Limits, we once again have decoupled, which will not prevent
businesses from recovering investment costs, but will not allow them to
do it all in one year. It would have cost the budget $52 million in tax
had we not done so. We have conformed to a deduction increase of $250
for a classroom teacher for classroom expenses where they buy supplies
for their classroom from their own funds. We have not conformed for a
deduction for tuition expenses. The original bill did not conform on an
exclusion from income from cancellation of debt on a principal
residence, but that was changed by PCS in committee, so now we are
conforming with the federal government on that issue. The two other
issues were deduction for home mortgage insurance premiums and an
exemption from tax on tax-free distribution from IRAs to public
charities. So it&#39;s essentially with that single change for the
recognition of mortgage forgiveness as revenue being no longer taxed in
North Carolina. Essentially the bill that has passed out of the Revenue
Laws Subcommittee. In addition, there is an issue addressing the gas tax
in North Carolina and trransportation revenue. The bill that came over
from the Senate was complicated with a formula. It is being very
simplified, and that I believe is where we will have most of our
discussions today. As you know, this body in 2013 addressed a difficult
situaion we had with the way that we allocated road money and decided
which roads to build in North Carolina. We worked together as a body
across the aisle, and we came up with a solution which has become a
standard for the entire country and was passed with overwhelming votes
in this body and in the Senate. That was a situation where I sometimes
say we were performing hip replacement surgery on transportation. This
year we have a crisis and it is brought on by a delightfully ironic
situation. We have tied our revenue for transportation to a volatile,
internationally traded commodity, and in the current market environment
it has crashed. Because of that, the potential revenue has crashed with
it, and it has created a situation where we are not dealing with hip
replacement surgery. We actually have a patient in the emergency room
and we&#39;re trying to stabilize the patient so that we can put in the
stents after the heart attack. The house PCS would fix the gas tax at 36
cents a gallon beginning April 1. This is in response to a forecast
that, under the formula the gas tax

  Would drop to approximately 30 cents a gallon on July 1, 2015. The
impact of a 7.4 cent reduction in gas tax on transportation revenues in
North Carolina would be severe. I have had placed at each of your places
information given to me by the league of municipalities and by the North
Carolina Department of Transportation. Rather than read all of the
impacts, I&#39;ll just talk about the impact in my own district. The two
small towns that are the primary municipalities in my district, Matthews
and Mint Hill will lose $289,000 in power bill money if this cut takes
place. I have a little bit of the city of Charlotte, and I am sometimes
accused of being less than cordial to the city of Charlotte, but the
city of Charlotte would lose $4,050,000 in power bill money in the
coming year. Mecklenburg county would receive $37 million less in
maintenance money, paving, fixing potholes, if the gas tax falls to 30
cents. It is a difficult situation to face, and I think it has to be
addressed. What this bill proposes to do is to stabilize revenue through
the end of the year by setting the gas tax at 36 cents a gallon, which
is slightly lower than the 37 and a half cents that it is now, and it
greatly reduces the tax cut that would occur on July 1 of 2015. So
rather than falling by 7 and a half cents, it would have only fallen by
one and a half cents. That will allow us, this body, all of us, the time
to work with the Senate and create a better answer for how we are going
to fund transportation in the coming years. The method that we have used
to determine our transportation priorities has changed after 30 years
because it needed to. The method in which we finance road construction
needs to change for the same reason. We cannot do this in two weeks and
have the full discussion and debate that we had on the previous
transportation bill. So what I am asking that we do is address this
issue with a fix, a patch if you will, to give us the time to work
through this and come up with a bipartisan solution that will have broad
support in both bodies that can change the way we fund transportation in
North Carolina in a way that will make us once again the good roads
state. If we choose to vote this down today, absent another bill to
address the same issue, some of the cities will have to raise their
property taxes on July 1 to maintain their roads, and we will hear quite
a lot of complaints about the maintenance that will no longer be done.
What this bill addresses is a simple, unpleasant choice that we have to
make. We can allow the gas tax to drop seven and a half cents on July 1,
2015, or we can fix the potholes and pave the roads. We have to choose.
We can&#39;t have both. And I ask for your support that this body can
once again come together and do the right thing for North Carolina.

  Thank you. When I looked at this on the IRA part of it, there&#39;s a
provision that will take away the tax deductions for our senior citizens
that are 70 1/2 old and up, so I want to tell you a little bit about
that. This amendment takes away that exemption. There&#39;s a potential
tax increase in the bill, as it is now for senior citizens over 70 1/2
years old. This is not conforming with the IRA charitable roll over that
the feds have. The provision in senate bill 20 would decouple the
extension from tax free contributions from IRA&#39;s to public
charities, the IRA charitable roll over, and they have unintended
consequences for some donors to churches and other charitable
organization and non-profits. Specifically that provision creates a
significant tax increase for some retired 70 1/2 year old North Carolina
citizens who make charitable contributions from their IRA, so to be fair
to them . . . Well, let me say something else is, according to staff one
of our goals in a IRC update is to maintain conformability with the
federal tax law, which simplifies tax regulations. Because, a tax payer
will not need to account for different federal and state treatments of
the same asset, and its my understand that the provision that is in this
bill is not in conformance with the federal extension. They extended it
one more year, so this amendment extends it for one more year in line
with the federal government and I ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Graham of Robeson, are you wanting to debate the
amendment before us?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Not at this time, Mr. Speaker.

[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Catlin, do you know the fiscal effect of this amendment?
How much revenue would this potentially cost us?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Yes, sir. I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t mention that. Its $1 million
dollars.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Brawley of Mecklenburg is recognized to speak on the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate the gentleman&#39;s interest. I
think there is some misunderstanding on the impact of this provision.
Normally, distribution from an IRA is taxable, the federal government is
saying that they will not tax the distribution from the IRA. What&#39;s
being ignored is when the IRA becomes a charitable contribution that is
a tax deduction for the tax payer, so they are already receiving a tax
deduction for the contribution, but they are paying the distribution tax
that they would normally receive from getting the distribution. This
particular thing for 70 1/2 is something that the federal government is
doing, by example if you earn money its taxable income to you for the
portion of it that you donate to a charity. It is not as if you are
taxed on money that you gave to the charity, your taxes are still
reduced by the deduction. What this would do is eliminate the fee for
the distribution, which the tax payers would pay and then still give
them the deduction for the donation to the charity to the maximal extent
allowable by law. Having said that, the effect impact budget is about $1
million, but the reason we did not concur with the IRS was for that
reason. There was a tax benefit that accrues even paying the tax on the
distribution.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
For what purpose does the lady from Wake, Representative Holley rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I&#39;ve got a question for the bill sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Does the bill sponsor yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I want to make sure that I understand this, because the way I read this
was differently. I read that once we make a donation out of our IRA to a
charitable contribution that we still have to pay taxes on that money

  that came out of IRA. Am I not right? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, you do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And that’s the money that the state is charging us
taxes on that money, that normally if we made that charitable
contribution, if we made a charitable contribution, we wouldn’t be
paying any taxes on it, so we’re actually taxing a charitable
contribution. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You still get the reduction for the
charitable contribution. You get charged the tax on the distribution
from the IRA; that is correct. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I still have a problem
with this. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yeah, I don’t think anybody
understands it, really. There’s a lot of confusion and it’s in the
weeds, and that’s why I really don’t want to fight over this in a big
way. It’s not a huge issue, but the deal is you are charged a tax on a
distribution from an IRA. If you donate that money to charity, you get a
deduction for the donation. What the federal government did, and I make
a lot of nonprofits like this, is they said “Well we’re not going to
charge a distribution tax on an IRA distribution if you are distributing
it directly to a charitable organization. That’s all we decoupled for.
If you make a distribution from your IRA to yourself, it’s still going
to be taxable. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman
from Wake, Representative Pendleton rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker,
may I talk to him about this provision? [SPEAKER CHANGES] You are
recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You are
recognized to debate the bill, and at the conclusion if you want to ask
him a question, that would be fine. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I just want
to make a comment because I’m in that line of work. You’re using pretax
dollars. You have escaped income tax on any type of qualified
investment, so you do not get a reduction. What you are getting is
you’re able to give that money to charity and get the money out of the
IRA without paying income tax when it comes out, but you do not get a
reduction. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does Representative
Glazier rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative Brawley would
yield for a question, please. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Will he yield? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He does. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Representative, and I think I understand. I
thought you did a pretty good job, and with Representative Pendleton as
well, but I want to make sure I understand. What was the federal change
that we’re decoupling from? That is, what would they have done that
we’re decoupling from? Just so I understand that. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
federal government would not charge a tax on the distribution, and it
would go directly to the charity. What we have done, and I’ve actually…
I questioned my understanding with Trina Griffin and got the answer
back. They will pay a tax for the distribution, but then for taxable
year 2014, “a taxpayer who elected to take the income exclusion under
Section 108-D8 of the code for qualified charitable distribution from an
individual retirement plan to a person who has attained the age of 70
and a 1/2, may deduct the amount that would have been allowed as a
charitable deduction under Section 170 of the code, had the taxpayer not
elected the income solution,” which basically says you pay tax on the
money, you get a deduction for the contribution.” [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate on the
amendment? Representative Insko of Orange, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To have a brief conversation with Representative
Brawley. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You are recognized to debate the bill and
conclude with a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brawley, do I
have this right? I have made a charitable contribution from IRA to my
church. It just went through and it happened. I didn’t get the money,
and I would say I got the tax deduction because I didn’t pay taxes on
it. So my tax accountant… the law changed; my tax accountant said “Stop
this. Go ahead and get the distribution and make your contribution,” so
I’m doing that now. I make my IRA distribution, and I’m taking the money
out that I would have given to the church and giving it to the church.
Is there any difference in what I used to do and what I’m doing now?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well the difference that the accountant explained to
you is really the difference. Now yes, it is taxable to you if you take
the distribution, and then you get the deduction for the donation to the
charity. That was the intention of the bill that I’m opposing… or I’m
not going to vote for the amendment. I’m opposing the amendment, but my
opposition on this is very slight because it’s just… yeah.

  Representative Jones moves to amend the bill on page 4, line 2, by
deleting the word “September” and substituting the word “June”. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, what this
amendment would do, and I think it makes a lot of sense for several
reasons, it will put the base period for calculating the tax on the same
calendar as our fiscal year, which ends June the 30th. One of the things
we learned from staff in the Finance Committee was that currently the
figures that are needed to do that are not available on March 31st when
the current base period ends. I would just note that this bill, this
legislation, calls for a rate change on April the 1st when they would go
to a flat, this year, 36 cents, so this would put the next rate change
in six months, which would be October the 1st, rather than waiting until
January 1st, 2016. I will just say that we just heard one of the
arguments. This is going to be spun, as we know, all kinds of ways. Some
people are going to say it’s a lowering of the tax. Some people are
going to say it’s a raising of the tax after July the 1st because it
would be lower if we didn’t do anything. One thing I will point out is
that one of the effects of what this does is to say that yes, April 1st
through July 1st, we are going to have a lower rate than we would if we
do nothing, which is three months, and then for three months afterwards
rather than six months, yes, the rate would be higher than it would be
otherwise if we did nothing, so that’s just one more way of explaining
that, but I do think it makes sense to do this and I would urge your
support. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion or debate? Representative
Brawley of Mecklenburg is recognized. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr.
Speaker. We’re under a pretty tight deadline under the bill as it
currently is written. This amendment was discussed quite vigorously in
committee and was defeated. I would ask that you defeat it again. We
will have our hands full solving this problem, and to arbitrarily cut
the time I don’t think makes sense. Please vote “no”. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Jones, do you desire recognition of debate a second time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir, I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You’re recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well there are a couple of things I didn’t point out
because I wasn’t aware my friend was going to stand up and oppose it,
but since he did, let me just then point this out: As it currently
stands, the change would be made at January 1st next year. Frankly I
wanted to give us time to fix this thing, but I don’t really want to be
here next fall doing it, so I don’t necessarily think we need to
incentivize that plan. I think most of us here would kind of like to get
out this summer, so if we move it to October 1st and we fix this thing
by the summer, there’s still plenty of time to implement it. So that was
another reason, quite frankly, is to put the feat to the fire a little
bit to fix this problem by sometime this summer, rather than saying we
have this fall to do it, so I do think this gives time. This is a
temporary bridge, as you know, but I think this bridge is long enough,
so again, I would urge your support in spite of my good friend’s
opposition, so thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jordan of Ash
is recognized to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Inquiry of bill
sponsor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does he yield? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Brawley. You very quickly
gave an argument against the amendment, but can you give me some more
information about how we’ve come to this emergency, this crisis that’s
happened and the tight timeframe that we’re in so that we can
understand? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well I don’t know that I can explain the
instability in the local or the global markets for gasoline, which is
the real key factor on this. Even at the high prices that gasoline has
been charged recently, it has been a decreasing source of revenue
because of the number of vehicles that get much higher gas mileage, the
number of vehicles that do not burn gasoline, so that even at a higher
price, both for gasoline and a higher gas tax, the revenue contribution
has been decreasing. Now due to whatever reasons, gas prices have
cratered. Personally I love it because the gas price is so low, but we
are facing the potential of losing about 20% of our motor fuels revenue
through this market which is based on an extremely volatile

  I’m not criticizing your comment or advising people to vote or
encouraging people to vote one way or the other. You vote your
conscience on it, but I’m just trying to establish the fact that other
than moving the date, there’s a fiscal impact on it. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Northampton, Representative
Wray rise? For what purpose does the gentleman Person, Representative
Yarborough rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] We need to cut the gas tax to match the other southern states,
to stay competitive, but we can’t do it right now because we won’t have
any money to pave roads this summer. The gas tax is not working to meet
the needs of our state, and we must find a way to six it permanently.
Representative Jones’ deadline for fixing this problem is more realistic
than January 1st. If this problem is not fixed by October, I don’t
believe that it will be fixed, and we will have failed our state.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake,
Representative Stam rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, members of the House, I ask you to vote
“no” on the amendment. First I have a mathematical disagreement with
Representative Warren. I believe the revenue… You can tell this from the
fiscal note. The revenue loss would be about 50 plus million because 6
cents decrease is 4 and a ½ times as much as a 1 and a ½ cent increase,
so it would be about a 50 million loss of revenue, but the reason that
it should go to January 1 is because cities and counties, before July 1,
have to fix their tax rates, and roads just don’t appear ex nihilo, out
of nothing. You have to let contracts… you have to… those contracts have
to be mobilized, and essentially, if we don’t extend it to January 1,
then the last quarter of the year, there’s not going to be much
construction happening on roads, and we just… we don’t need to lose a
quarter of the year on our roads. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose
does the gentleman from Rowan, Representative Warren rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, just to apologize to my colleague Representative
Brawley and to… [SPEAKER CHANGES] The Gentleman is recognized to debate
the amendment a second time, I believe. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
sir. Again, the amendment will have a fiscal impact greater than I had
suggested before, probably at least three times greater than what I had
suggested. I did not give… the figures I had were based on a 1 cent
increment, and I failed to retain the fact that Representative Jones’
amendment is effective for about 5 cents. Is that correct,
Representative Brawley? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further
debate? If not, the question before the House is the amendment offered
by Representative Jones, amendment A2, to the second reading to the
House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 20. So many favoring the
adoption of the amendment will say “aye”; those opposed will vote “no”.
The Clerk will open the vote. The Clerk will lock the machine and record
the vote. 49 having voted in the affirmative and 68 in the negative, the
amendment fails. Now on the main question, further discussion, further
debate? For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake, Representative
Jackson rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To briefly speak on the bill, Mr.
Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the
bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you very much, and first I want to begin
by thanking the bill sponsor for the way he has presented the bill. I
believe the Senate tried to pass this off as a gas tax cut, and I think
we can all agree that it’s a cut, but only for a couple of months, and
so really this is a stabilization or increase in the gas tax, and so I
appreciate the way the gentleman from Mecklenburg County has presented
the bill today. I do want to say this: It is a 20% tax increase as of
July 1st, and that is a minimum tax increase. I am not an oil expert
like Representative Brawley; I agree, I don’t know, but I can tell you
some really respected economists that I follow think oil is going to go
down in the next couple of months, and if that holds true, we could be
looking at a gas tax increase on July 1st which is 40% increase as
opposed to the 20% that everyone agrees to, so I hope you’ll remember
that. I shared just a short story in our caucus today, and I hope you
will consider it as well.

the people that are buying three dollars of gas (at a time? Very

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and members. You know you don&#39;t have an
opportunity to hear from Representative Graham too often in this
chamber, but when I do speak, I speak with some passion behind my
thoughts.  I&#39;m concerned about this bill for one reason, and I think
many of you should have the same concern I have. You.. were elected to
come and represent the best interest of our citizens.  We are obviously
coming out of a tough time with the recession, or the economic downturn,
but now we&#39;re looking at the potential of putting another burden on
our citizens, whether it&#39;s now or in the future, it&#39;s still a
burden. As you know, in my district and your district, we have low
income earners, we have working poor, we have families that are making
ends meet from week to week, and now we&#39;re talking about putting a
burden on them at the pump.  A commodity that they need to make a
living.  That&#39;s gas.  That&#39;s gas. Low income workers spend a
larger percentage of their time commuting to work.  In my district, you
know, someone can travel 15 20 mile one way to get to a job that&#39;s
not paying, you know,  10 or 15 dollars an hour, might be making 9
dollars an hour, might be making 8.50.  And they&#39;re going
to...They&#39;re willing spend that travel time getting to that job to
take care of their families, and to take care of their children.  On the
other hand, our wealthiest families and constituents in this state,
that&#39;s not an issue with them. That&#39;s not an issue with them.
They don&#39;t mind that drive.  It&#39;s nothing.  Doesn&#39;t affect
their bottom line.  But this is a, this is a, gas tax increase.  I
don&#39;t care how you spend it, or how you look at it, it is an
increase. I&#39;m going to… I&#39;m opposed to this. I&#39;m opposed to
it because your constituents and my constituents, who work from pay day
to pay day, Don’t need this type of increase. The bottom line, it&#39;s
not necessary. It&#39;s not necessary that we make this decision today.
There&#39;s ample opportunity in this long session, where we debate the
budget, we make appropriations to, in my opinion, address this issue.
And I do respect that the bill&#39;s sponsoring.  We had a conversation
today and I really am appreciative of his explanation to me of what this
means to the constituents I serve.  It&#39;s a tax increase.  And I
appreciate our speaker who said the prayer earlier and I just wanted to
make a comment on that. Our actions matter.  Our actions do matter here.
 They matter.  They matter to the people we represent.  We&#39;re going
to have to answer to … our decisions we make.

  We are going to need to answer to decisions we make today. And we just
debated a bill that&#39;s very important to North Carolina, 117, but if
I&#39;m remembering that bill, we&#39;re going to give many millions to
our airlines as a tax break. I don&#39;t understand that. I don&#39;t
understand the thinking here. I don&#39;t understand the thought
process. I&#39;ve been a part of this body now for going into my fifth
year, and I&#39;ve been hearing in the debates on the tax credits, the
giveaways to our millionaires, and now I understand we have a
billionaire in our state. Think about what we&#39;ve done in the past
that I think that&#39;s got us to this position. So I would encourage
you, members, to think about your constituents. Think about the people
who are driving, getting into their vehicles, going to their jobs,
taking care of their families, using this valuable commodity. And now
we&#39;re saying to them, we&#39;re trying to spin this as
&quot;you&#39;re getting a tax break.&quot; No, I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s
a tax increase. There&#39;s no other way I can see this. It&#39;s a tax
increase. I would encourage you to think about your constituents, the
folks back home, who can&#39;t afford this. And let&#39;s take our time.
This is a Senate bill, this is not a House bill. We can do something in
the House. I would encourage you, let&#39;s think that way, and I
encourage you to not support this bill. Thank you.
SPEAKER CHANGES
For what purpose does the gentleman from Wake, Representative Dollar,
rise?
SPEAKER CHANGES

SPEAKER CHANGES

SPEAKER CHANGES
Mr. Speaker, members of the House, I wasn&#39;t going to speak today
because I&#39;ve had a problem with my voice for the last few days, but
hallelujah! It&#39;s just amazing to me what I&#39;m hearing today.
Apparently a number of my friends on the other side of the aisle have
suddenly gotten religion on taxes. And I just think that&#39;s a
wonderful thing. I think that&#39;s a wonderful thing, and I hope that
bleeds over to now the official position of our friends on the other
side of the aisle, is I hope this means that you&#39;ll never propose
and never campaign and never suggest that we ever raise the sales tax
again. Join us in that, join us on this side of the aisle in that
position, and that&#39;s greatly appreciated. So while you&#39;re
meditating on that, let me just mention one factor that hasn&#39;t--I
don&#39;t think has been mentioned yet and needs to be mentioned. What
is the point of all this? What is the point of what Representative
Brawley is talking about when he talks about stabilizing this tax rate?
What he&#39;s talking about is not simply hundreds of millions of
dollars in maintenance of our roads and highways. What he&#39;s talking
about is the safety of our citizens. Do you really want to put that at
risk? We have problems enough as it is with maintaining our roads, which
we do at a state level, many of them are highways and roads around the
state. We are not certain of what the federal government is going to do
with the highway reauthorization later in this year. We’re not assured
of that. We need to make sure that as responsible leaders in this state,
that we stabilize the funds that we have and we do not put our citizens
at risk. That we have the maintenance money there, spot maintenance
comes out of these funds, when we&#39;re trying to make improvements in
dangerous crossways and dangerous intersections, and bridges that
we&#39;ve been working on for the last several years to replace. We
cannot afford to drop behind in the progress that we have made as a
state, that&#39;s been recognized nationally over the last several
years. We&#39;ve been one of the leaders in the country in increasing
funds in the last several years into our transportation system to deal
with capacity issues and to deal with safety issues. Don&#39;t put your
citizens, your families at risk. Please vote for this bill.

For what purpose does the gentleman from Durham, Representative Hall
raise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak on the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker and I too wanna make sure that adequate praise is
given, I think it’s been a love for Representative Brawley here this
evening. So I hope he is getting this recorded but everyone has a
complement him on the fact he has given effectual representation in
finance and in appropriations of the fact that this is a tax increase,
he is well understand it and say it, he said it several times on the
record and he did say, “This is a tax increase.” So those of us who were
in both meetings have to congratulate him on his wiliness to come
forward and admit that but one of the things, it seems we have got a
false construct going on here and that is we can only pay for any
transportation improvements from the gas tax or maintenance from the gas
tax that’s not the limitation we have in a constitution and we have on
many occasions supplemented work and done things to ensure we could make
sure we had a good transportation system. So we keep treating this as if
we can’t pay for this any other way we must have this one single source
of revenue to pay for any emergency as it’s been termed in our road
maintenance or road construction. So that is not the case and I don’t
want us to have this discussion for the public and folks who listen and
who think if we have an emergency and we deem it to be such then we
can’t dedicate the funds for it. So if it is an emergency and it is
about safety we have that ability. Also, I appreciate Representative
Brawley making the concession that the way we got here was a misreading
or a miscalculation of where we would be financially and this becomes
important because we have got a lot of towns and cities that we say we
are worried about who want to be able to plan improperly their budgets,
but we know we took millions of dollars from our towns and cities last
year and legislation we pay us to take away their ability to raise
funds. So we are gonna have to be kinda consistent, we have kind of
created this emergency in the way we took away from towns and cities
their ability to have revenue sources. Now, we are saying it’s an
emergency for them to have their roads to be able to be repaired but we
created that. The other question is—can we afford this? We don’t have
the Governor’s budget yet, I’m not sure what budget would based on this
on about what we can afford, it’s maybe put in the cart before the horse
to constituent says, “The Governor suppose to submit us what his
proposal is to meet all of the states needs.” We don’t have that yet, if
we do someone been holding it in back and we like to see that. So what
I’m saying is this is not the answer, this is not the solution everybody
agrees on that, this is an opportunity to find and work on a solution
which we have had for the last few years, we knew this was coming, it’s
been coming, it’s not new, even Representative Brawley would say, as his
work in transportation last year this was known to be coming, this is
not something new. So I understand people’s comments to say, “Why are we
in this situation we knew it was coming.” So this is not new, the
question is—Are we gonna do what&#39;s necessary to solve this
transportation problem? We can keep creating false deadlines and drop
dates etcetera and then bailing our sales out every time, we can do
that, I mean you have the power to do that but ultimately, I think as
Representative Warne and some other folks coming and how we are gonna go
ahead and get this solved not how can we push it down the road? How we
are gonna get this solved? And this measure does not solve it, everyone
agrees, it only creates some implied pressure on us to do what we know
we have to do, we know for a long time and we should do it and we have
to do it, and we just haven’t got it done. So I would ask you to vote
against this bill and come back and let’s solve the problem instead of
continuing to kick the cane down the road and create these false
impressions of we are in a corner and we can’t make a decision and we
can’t discharge our constitutional duty, and the Governor can’t
discharge his; we can, we should I would say vote against this and let’s
do better than this, it can’t be a House Bill that comes out in response
to this or give the Senate something to work with from the house that
moves us down the road to solve this problem, not moves us down the road
to saying, “We are gonna come up with a way to solve the problem.” Let’s
solve the problem.

today to they&#39;ll play as a flood of data to thank you Mr. Speaker
does anybody thing in this chamber right now think that we&#39;re gonna
be able to
take care of North Carolina Reds and 30¢ a gallon no we as a percent of
all inmates in early have for this D a button upon finding our taxes
event
from our citizens for their roots on the conditions that we have
absolutely no control over and ever since I&#39;ve been down your neck
sleep before
I came down here every six months before either cheering the archives
and when the tax and depth gas tax either when a boy came down we have a
residence
as they give the people of a wild we have a residence halls say(SPEAKER
CHANGES) it might seize other sources people that&#39;s exactly what
we&#39;re trying to do with
this tale what the people of North Carolina Walter two things they
wanted rides that they also need constant thing in the sense of knowing
what to
expect from six months to six months if you got the kind of budget and I
keep hearing how we used as examples around here we have got the
technology
we got people drawn our rights bill and even stopping and gas stations
to buy gas(SPEAKER CHANGES) and nowhere in those rides just as much as
they got the job and he is are in filling out with 40 gallons of gas at
one time we cannot have that kind of disparity because the bond is the
default is it always does in taxes
disproportionately on people who cannot afford to pay them is our
responsibility as good still words and a smart legislators to come up
with a
payment system that is based on things that are within the
control..............

…Of the State of North Carolina whatever those sources maybe a
combination of a gas tax that doesn’t fluctuate all over the place, fees
for using the roads, user fees or probably the fairest way to pay for
anything whether it’s your road or your state park or anything of that
nature. The people that use it should pay for it and we have got to come
up with a comprehensive plan and it’s going to be arrived at painfully,
if we were at a situation where taxes were gonna go up July and we
wanted to set the rate at 36 cents and it was gonna go to 38, we will be
cheer and everybody, it will be a 120 that nothing vote in here. The
reason it’s painful for us is because it is going to be a painful change
but it’s going to be a long-term comprehensive change that will give our
citizens the constancy that they need and the fact of no one that every
six months they are not, don’t have to worry about making an adjustment
to their budget because we don’t have control of their taxes for keeping
their roads, please vote yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Guilford, Representative Blust
raise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if Representative Burr will yell for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Stanley yell to the gentleman from Guilford?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I yell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yells.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Burr, how much each budget year is currently being taken
from the Highway Trust Fund from the gas tax revenue and put into the
General Fund for uses in other areas?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Blust before we took the majority it was over 426 million
dollars, for the current fiscal year its right at 255 million dollars.
So right there if that money was not transferred from the Highway Trust
Fund to the general fund that’s a five cents essentially every year this
being transferred out to pay for items in the General Fund.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Rutherford, Representative
Hager raise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Speaker, last time you listened intently believe it or not
and to everybody and I have got what I think of some ?? of wisdom here
and let me go over little quick and I would like to quote Representative
Gram and saying, “We have to have the best interest of our citizens at
heart. We can’t put another burden on our citizens that are actions what
we do here does matter and we have to answer those decisions that we
make today and last but not least think about your constituents.” For
me, that I had said that I probably vote against this bill and got to
think and I got a spreadsheet laid on my desk today that are brought in
this chamber with me. And I had the bridges that we need to fix in North
Carolina by the section they are and I having to see four bridges in
Burt County part of my district but actually slightly outside of my
district. And my children have to across when they go home from Raleigh
and they need fixes, it’s about 12 million dollars worth of fixes that
need to be these bridges that my children, my parents, and people that I
know in my constituency will drive across some everyday and that changed
my mind guys when it becomes real to you, when you understand your
constituents will drive across these bridges one of every five in North
Carolina are structurally deficient as we speak now, they need to be
fixed. So I thought a little bit more and now listen to what
Representative Mitchell says, “Give the people what they need. Or to
show is safety of what they drive on everyday, what your constituents
need, I think it is.” Then I listen to what Representative Hall said,
“Can we afford to do this?” Or let me just give you a good example, in
Lee and Montgomery Counties I think that’s the reason and Simons
Districts they are seven million dollars with their bridge repair there,
you want your citizens driving on those? Ask yourself that, if you give
your citizens what they need is the safe roads, is it for your wives,
your mothers, your children, your constituents to get to work everyday,
to be able to go about their business everyday on safe roads and safe
bridges, is it so important that you demonize this issue that everybody
here knows we need to fix, that you would say that the save your
citizens just because you wanna make a political point, you say sake
your assistance at stake, would you do that? You need to ask yourselves
that right now. I would say we need to vote for this bill, we need to
get a permanent fix, and we do need to give our citizens what they need,
we need to give them safe roads and bridges. I think this is a small
price to pay.

As endeavors and a less to debate the bill down as for innovative make a
mistake are these are not comment on Saturday that this bill one lead of
the year
while the tax system made the calls were not a March 31 use some were
considered sites in the media surviving a window with a member of the
short a
novel ideas are the salmon and is a bigger number and 30¢ and so some
people want a sign that city employees while out on the home of the
someone went to the
widening princess of the Crusoe got out of more than one in my view is I
have never liked uploading tax cat to win the index we have a chance to
get away
from that once and for all let&#39;s move away from an muskets of
stability mistakes that might lead in the east bay from Al to stabilize
the transportations names
of our saving our CDs and we can do something better in Mainz and to fix
this whole problem: forward so we don&#39;t come back to this position
again in the
future and there&#39;s an outlying detail won the prize of Wilson be the
future a out and buying the members of the Encino committee say we
didn&#39;t know
it wasn&#39;t enough for student knows today that nobody via the
palladium now have the prices have any of the future when they play in
the mud and
we wouldn&#39;t be in this fine would be set up by someone with a big
bank account so it&#39;s a tendency to Bowie and CSD Life, out of a tax
that resets itself
over six months and Mazzola and that&#39;s what we didn&#39;t make for
the best as the(SPEAKER CHANGES) Jonathan Demme version of Enron&#39;s
thing is to have to use it and
we&#39;ll miss him as a fit of a veiled second, but as the Canadian a
precedent of those of other members of the level of demand is undeniably
sure all we did stay with the procedures of davis&#39; the senate bill
would violate signs a database of cities we know we know that you
tomorrow and the school and took office of family and a big Mo Simmons
in a statement also has encompassed those sold by egos 70
in this bill is questionable at best the other thing is as we talk
about. In every city, residents reference to the loss of revenue to
local
communities and in outlook and I get an obscene audit indicated what
would be lost in my district about 1,230,000 now the back and look at
what was
lost as a result of data, this takes away from my district last year no
standing it&#39;s only make these decisions and these bodies
sometimes seems we say is a right to take on away from local
municipalities so they can meet their needs and safety and operations
center
wrote another tons of we&#39;ll be set on all deaths impact and all that
should be applauded it should be no stock sold as (SPEAKER CHANGES)
we thought about how do we keep hearing why the CDC cities in the
situation very and we did it in the meaning of us majority help create
this
emergency yugoslavia&#39;s fire, is part of what the tax policy was to
players and soul of you won the maxim that is what you said you
but this that we can make history and make it sound as if this is
something new that happen and we did know about taking put the baby
dolls away
from a budget that that would not hurt mail and it now they have another
me that makes this even more (SPEAKER CHANGES) so I&#39;m a yield to the
fact that you haven&#39;t already
in the right to do that because won the election with you have the
responsibility to two going into this all ms 92, down the road of state
utility to
precede that we we yield to that we have the bill does all this not
create Dixon because we have to solve this problem and we don&#39;t have
that much time
actually we don&#39;t really think about the role it will be borrowing
in a more constitutional and it will go to a conference committee , she
said that
descended and there will be applied and confiscated so out of our
intention is to get the problem solved it not to say we had a patch for
a couple months
as really not only do this, this is only about him that it&#39;s just a

  People&#39;s good will and determination to get this done. So I hope you
will have that good will and determination, especially in the conference
committee in getting this matter solved going forward. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from Mecklenberg,
Representative Brawley, rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate the bill a
second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the
bill a second time. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, I recognize the role that my
good friend and debating combatant Larry Hall plays as minority leader.
He has to do the talking points. He has to fight the partisan battles.
Party leadership on both sides has to do that. I&#39;m not in party
leadership. I&#39;m a committee chair. I have to try to govern. And I
know there will be people on both sides of the aisle that will help me
do that. For the record, I do not want anyone to put words in my mouth
that I did not say. Today the gas tax is 35 and a half cents. So excuse
me, 37 and a half cents. If this bill passes on April 1, it will drop to
36. When July 1 comes, it will not drop to 30, which it would do. It
will remain at 36. It is less of a tax cut than people would have
received. The chief engineer from DOT texted me some information.
We&#39;ve had battling numbers like crazy. But his text was fairly easy
to understand. One cent on the gas tax costs the average driver $7.50 a
year. A seven and a half or a six cent cut in the gas tax that will not
take place on July 1 times $7.50 will cost the average driver in North
Carolina 45 dollars a year. Since we are depriving drivers of that six
cents tax cut for six months, that&#39;s $22.50 cents per driver. $3.75
a month. I do not believe many people are going to miss a meal over
$3.75 a month. We have a bad situation with which we must deal. I ask
you to help me put in a patch and then let us work together to fix this
problem in a way that we are not back here in one year or three years or
even ten years trying to figure out how we are going to build roads in
the state of North Carolina. I ask for your support on the bill. Thank
you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further discussion, further debate. If not, the
question before the house is the passage of the House Committee
Substitute for Senate Bill 20 on its second reading. So many favoring
passage will vote aye. Those opposed will vote no. The clerk will open
the vote. The clerk will lock the machine and record the vote. 70 having
voted in the affirmative and 47 in the negative, the House Committee
Substitute for Senate Bill 20 passes its second reading and will remain
on the calendar. Notices and announcements. The clerk will read notices
and announcement. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The House Committee on children,
youth and families will meet Thursday March 5, 2015, 15 minutes after
session in room 421, LLB. [SPEAKER CHANGES] What purpose does the
gentleman from Wake, Representative Dollar rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] An
announcement. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized for an
announcement. [SPEAKER CHANGES] My folks have been asking about the
budget. I just want to tell you for your future planning, next Tuesday
