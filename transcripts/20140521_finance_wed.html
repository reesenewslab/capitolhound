Section 1.4 eliminates the Lottery Oversight Committee. This is not the
commission that regulates the lottery, that’s the Lottery Commission,
but this is an oversight committee. And this provision was included last
year in Senate Bill 10, which, as you know, did not pass, so is included
in this bill. Section 1.5 A and B of the bill would amend the
Administrative Procedure Act and the Tax Law respectively to allow small
businesses to be represented by one or more of its owners in either a
contested case or a tax appeal case before the Property Tax Commission.
The provision defines the small business entity as a limited liability
company or a corporation that is owned directly or indirectly by no more
than two individuals. Section 1.6 amends the Real Estate License Law to
exempt owners, officers, managers, and employees of a closely held
business entity from the requirement of obtaining a license in order to
act as a real estate broker in connection with property that that
business owned or leased. A closely held business is defined in this
provision as a limited liability company or a corporation with no more
than two legal owners. Section 1.7 would amend a law that was enacted in
2011 requiring that state agencies report on the number, type, and use
of mobile devices that are issued by the agency. Currently, the law
requires that the agencies report quarterly; this would change the
reporting requirement to annually. The next eight provisions in the bill
were recommended by the Joint Legislative Administrative Procedure
Oversight Committee. The Section 1.8 of the bill would repeal a number
of obsolete boards and commissions. This provision was also included in
Senate Bill 10 that did not pass. APO recommended this to the 2013th
Session of the General Assembly. It did not get enacted, so it was
recommended again by APO. Section 1.9 would clarify the process for
re-adoption of existing rules under the periodic review and expiration
of rule process that was adopted last year. That process has been
carried out by the Office of Administrative Hearings so that agencies
have gone through the process of actually reviewing their rules. This
provision would basically set forth the process and allow the Rules
Review Commission to set the date by which rules have to be actually
re-adopted by the agency. It includes a provision that says that
agencies may make amendments to rules in the process of re-adoption, and
it also provides that if the agency adopts a rule without any change,
the agency’s not required to prepare a fiscal note for that rule.
Section 1.10 authorizes licensing boards subject to the Professional
Corporations Act to adopt rules to implement the provisions of that act.
Currently, licensing boards are authorized under that act to charge
fees. However, those licensing boards do not have specific rule making
authority with regard to setting those fees. This provision would give
them that authority. Section 1.11 amends the reporting requirements for
occupational licensing boards and would include several additional items
of information they’re not required to report on currently, including
the total number of licensees and the number of applicants who failed
the examination each year. This provision also requires that the APO
committee notify any board that fails to report, as required by law, and
also requires them to submit the reports electronically. Section 1.12
would authorize the Office of Administrative Hearings to allow documents
in a contested case to be filed and served electronically. Section 1.13
clarifies that the State Board of Education is subject to rule making
under the APA. It also adds language similar to that found in 150B-18 to
the education law to clarify that the State Board is subject to the
Administrative Procedure Act in that policies not adopted in accordance
with the APA are unenforceable. There’s also a provision that would
amend the APA to clarify that a person who’s aggrieved by an agency’s
failure to act may commence, contest, and case if the administrative law
judge finds that the agency failed to act as required by law. The ALJ
can order the agency to act within a specified time. Finally, the
provision clarifies that the right to judicial intervention applies when
a final agency decision has been unreasonably delayed. Section 1.14</p>

Streamlines the rule-making process by eliminating the requirement that
agencies obtain a certification from the office of state budget and
management, or if it’s a council of state agency, from the rules review
commission, before submitting the text of a rule for publication. The
provision also provides that, changes the fiscal note section to provide
that an agency must obtain certification from OSBM, that they’ve adhered
to certain principles in preparing a substantial economic impact fiscal
note. Section 1.15 of the PCS, I’m sorry of the bill, clarifies that the
petitioner has the burden of proof in most contested cases. This is
currently the law. This provision would also establish that agencies,
the state agency has the burden in two categories of cases: one, in
cases involving the imposition of civil fines and penalties, and the
other in cases involving the demotion, suspension or discharge of a
career state employee. The joint legislative administration procedure
oversight committee is directed to study whether there are other
categories of cases in which the burden of proof should be reassigned.
Section 1.16 amends the law governing legislative appointments to boards
and commissions. It would basically provide that in cases where the
speaker or the president pro tem is directed by law to make a
recommendation for the appointment to the full general assembly, upon
the recommendation or consultation with a third party, that the
consultation or recommendation is not binding. It’s merely a suggestion,
and that the third party must submit their recommendations at least 60
days before the expiration of the term, or within 10 days of a vacancy.
It also provides that failure by the third party to make the
recommendation within the time provided by law, would be deemed a waiver
of their opportunity to make that recommendation. The provision sets the
same time limits and consequence in cases where the speaker and the pro
tem are directed make recommendations from nominees provided by a third
party. Similar changes are also made in cases where the legislator is
authorized to make the appointment directly, so that it’s not required
to be done necessarily by the full general assembly. That is the end of
part 1. The first section of part 2 [SPEAKER CHANGES] Can we stop one
moment and then we’ll go on to that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Members of the committee, there has been a number of amendments
that are being put in now, we’re going to give it an extra few minutes.
We move the time to 10:45 as the deadline for amendments. If they’re not
here by 10:45, then they will not be considered in this committee. So
we’ve extended it by 15 minutes. And it’s to be delivered right to our
clerk. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Section 2.1
of the PCS would amend the administrative procedure act to create a new
process for contested cases in which multiple licenses are required from
an agency for a single activity. In those cases the head of the agency
is authorized to issue a written determination. The agency decision is
only reviewable on the date the last license for the activity is issued,
denied, or otherwise disposed of. The written determination is not
subject to contested case under this provision. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
next section of the second edition is section 2.2. This would amend the
process for filing contested cases for air quality permit decisions of
the environmental management commission. Oh I’m sorry I forgot to
introduce myself. I’m Jeff Hudson, staff attorney in the research
division of general assembly. Again, this is air quality permit
contested case decisions. The amendment would provide that the filing
for a contested case by a person who is not the permittee or permit
applicant would not automatically stay the EMC’s decision which would be
the case if the permit applicant or permittee were filing for the
contested case. It also limits the liability of a person who is not the
permittee or the permit applicant. To file the contested case to
circumstances where the EMC’s decision would result in an exceedance of
the national ambient air quality standard. Section 2.3 of the second
edition would direct the department of environment and natural resources
to treat a dairy waste containment basin, so a dairy waste lagoon, as
closed and no longer part of animal waste management system and no
longer subject to the regulations of animal waste management systems, if
the owner of the basin demonstrates to the satisfaction of the
department of environment and natural resources that the basin has been
only used for dairy cows.</p>

<p id="10:00">
It was constructed prior to 1967, it’s not been used to contain dairy
cattle waste since September 1, 2006, the only liquid currently in the
basin is from rainwater or rainwater runoff and the nitrogen levels in
the basin do not exceed 40 parts per million. Section 2.4 would amend
the process for filing contested cases regarding Coastal Area Management
Act or CAMA permits. These permits would be decided on by the Coastal
Resources Commission. The change would provide that the filing of a
contested case by a person who is not the permit applicant would not
automatically suspend the permit. Section 2.5 would authorize the
Governor, during a state of emergency, to issue an executive order to
waive permit or environmental document requirements under the State
Environmental Policy Act, the state Sedimentation Pollution Control Act
and the state’s Coastal Area Management Act – again, CAMA – under these
circumstances: It would be for the repair, protection, safety,
enhancement or replacement of a component of the state highway system
that provides the sole road access to an incorporated municipality or
unincorporated inhabited area bordering the ocean or a coastal sound
where the bridge or road conditions, as a result of the emergency event,
pose a substantial risk to public health, safety or welfare. The
executive order must include the duration of the waiver and the
activities to which the waiver applies. The provision also provides that
replacement of this infrastructure isn’t limited to the exiting size or
location, so replacement could be larger or more capacity or a different
location. Section 2.6 would repeal the fee for under dock oyster culture
permits. These permits authorize the holder to attach up to 90 square
feet of oyster cultivation containers to their dock. I believe last
year, the session before ya’ll established a 100 dollar fee for that
permit. This would repeal that fee requirement. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m
Peter Ledford. I’m a staff attorney with the Research Division. Section
2.7 is something that passed this chamber in Senate Bill 6-12, during
the long session. Under current law, cities are authorized to lease
property owned by the city for up to 10 years, and certain cities are
authorized to lease property for the purpose of citing and operating
renewable energy facilities for 20 years. This provision would allow all
cities to lease property for up to 25 years and would remove the
restriction for certain cities. Similarly, Section 2.8 also came from
Senate Bill 6-12. This governs businesses liquidating inventory during a
going-out-of-business sale. Under current law, the business must obtain
a license from the Clerk of the city or an officer designated by the
local board of county commissioners. This section would amend that law
to say that the license would be obtained from an officer designated by
the governing board of the city. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Section 3.1 would
amend our regulations for impacts to isolated wetlands in a couple of
ways. First it would increase the number of isolated wetlands that could
be impacted without a permit from one third of an acre to one acre for
areas east of Interstate 95, and from a tenth of an acre to one acre for
areas west of Interstate 95. Right now you can impact up to a third of
an acre east of 95 and a tenth of an acre west of 95 without having to
get a permit. This would change that so that you could impact up to one
acre either east or west of 95 without having to get a permit. It would
also decrease the amount of mitigation required to compensate for
impacts to isolated wetlands and would direct the Department of
Environment and Natural Resources to study the regulatory thresholds
which apply to mountain bogs, which is a specific kind of isolated
wetland. And then my colleague Jennifer ??, who’s over on the side, is
going to do the next one. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mister Chairman.
I’m Jennifer ??. I’m an analyst on the staff in the Research Division.
Section 3.2, the second addition, would authorize the Alcoholic Beverage
Control Commission to grant a Brewing, Distillation and Fermenting
course authorization to a college or community college that offers the
program as part of its curriculum. This would be similar in scope to the
authorization for college Viticulture programs and courses that was
enacted back in 2002. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Section 3.3 of the PCS would
amend the requirements for carbon monoxide alarms that are applying to
lodging establishments that were passed in last year’s Regulatory Reform
Bill. This provision includes technical revisions and directs the
Building Code Council to amend the code accordingly. This would also
establish requirements for violations that pose imminent hazard to be
immediately reported to the local health…</p>

health director and violations that do not pose an imminent hazard would
have, the owner would have three days to rectify the situation before
submitting the violation to the local health director.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 3.4 would provide that if the Environment Management Commission
receives a rule making petition from a unit of local government with
jurisdiction over an area to be served by a proposed water intake that
is impacted by a reclassification made by the commission after January
1st, 2012 the unit of local government that requests the repeal of the
reclassification must be granted the rule making petition by the EMC.
The reclassification in any related local ordinance changes will be
stayed until the EMC has adopted rules that are retroactively effective
to the date of the original classification and the units of local
government that filed for the petition must repeal their local
government ordinances that changes that were required to implement the
reclassification.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 3.5 of the bill deals with the North Carolina building code.
Currently the building code requires all recreational and sports
facilities, including swimming pools, be provided with handicapped
accessible features. This provision would direct the building code
council to amend the building code so that it's no more stringent than
the Federal American's with Disabilities Act.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm Jennifer McGinnis and I am the staff attorney with the research
division. Section 3.6 of the bill would establish a disclosure privilege
for environmental audit reports that would generally prohibit the use of
these reports as evidence in civil and administrative proceedings. Under
the bill &quot;environmental audit&quot; means, &quot;a voluntary
internal evaluation or review of one or more facilities or an activity
at one of these facilities that is regulated under environmental laws or
management systems that relate to the facility.&quot; And also that the
activity would be designed to &quot;identify and prevent noncompliance
and to improve compliance with environmental laws.&quot; The definition
explicitly provides that the audit must be a &quot;discreet activity
with specified beginning date and scheduled ending date reflecting the
auditor's bona fide intended completion schedule.&quot; So in addition
to the disclosure privilege for the audit itself the provision would
also prohibit persons who conduct or participate in an audit from being
compelled to testify regarding the audit report or part of the audit
report, except in certain circumstance. In addition, the provision would
generally establish immunity for owners and operators of facilities from
imposition of civil and administrative penalties and fines by
enforcement agencies for a violation of environmental laws discovered
through the conduct of the audit. The provision specifically provides,
however, that waiver of penalties and fines would not be granted until
the applicable enforcement agency certifies that the violation has been
corrected within a reasonable period of time. So that, essentially,
means that the enforcement agency retains it's penalty discretion until
the violation is corrected.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 3.7 would exempt a childcare program operated by a non-public
school before or after normal school hours from licensure and regulation
by the Childcare Commission.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 3.9 would direct the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources to review it's ambient air quality and monitoring network and
request from USEPA the authority to remove any monitor that's not
required by Federal Law. It would also direct the department, no later
than September 1 of this year, to discontinue all monitors, air quality
monitors, not required by Federal Law and for which EPA approval for
discontinuance is not required. The section would not preclude the
department from installing temporary monitors as part of an
investigation of a suspected violation of air quality law or in response
to an emergency situation causing imminent danger to human health or
safety.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 3.10 would amend the Good Samaritan Law to provide that a person
who provides emergency services voluntarily, not expecting at that time
to be paid for those services, is protected from liability under the
act.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 3.11 of the bill would direct the Environmental Management
Commission to mend rules in the administrative code that pertain to open
burning without an air quality permit to provide that, in addition to
the open burning of leaves, tree branches, and yard trimmings</p>

<p id="20:00">
a permit is not required for the burning of logs and stumps when certain
conditions are met. This section would also amend the statutes to
prohibit local air pollution control program authorities, the department
and the EMC from regulating combustion heaters, appliances, or
fireplaces in private dwellings, except as authorized by federal law.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 3.12 of the bill would direct the Coastal Resources Commission
to adopt rules disallowing the establishment of any inlet hazard area in
any location where the location formerly contained an inlet but the
inlet has been closed for at least 15 years, or the location no longer
contains the inlet due to shoreline migration, or the location includes
an inlet providing access to a state port via a channel maintained by
the US Army Corps of Engineers. This section would not prevent the
commission from studying current or potential inlet hazard areas or
designating new inlet hazard areas. Section 3.13 would authorize the
Wildlife Resources Commission to issue a field-trial dog handler or
judge permit, which would allow a person to participate as a dog handler
or judge in a field trial without possessing a hunting license. The
person cannot participate in hunting activities with the dog, but field
trials using exclusively domestically-raised water fowl and game birds,
or legally taken dead game are not considered hunting activities, and
this section will become effective July 1st, 2014.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 3.15 is a recommendation of the LRC Committee on the assessment
on the utility regulatory fee. Currently all public utilities operating
in the state pay a regulatory fee set by the General Assembly that is a
percentage of their jurisdictional revenues. The fee is used to pay for
the expenses incurred by the operation of the utilities commission and
the public staff. Reforms enacted by the General Assembly in 2009 and
2011 allowed certain telecommunication companies to elect to participate
in an alternative form of regulation that involves less oversight. This
section of the bill would lower the regulatory fee for those companies
electing to participate in the alternative forms of regulation and would
direct that the utility fee for all other public utilities be adjusted
to cover the expenses incurred by the utilities commission and the
public staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
10 minutes. Remember, you have to have your amendments in over here by
10:45. Sorry, continue please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Sherman. Section 3.16 would amend a change that the
legislature made last year to the Jordan Lake rules. It was specifically
?? that the piping of a stream allowed under a permit issues by the US
Army Corps of Engineers would be an exempt use rather than an allowable
use under the rules. The distinction is that an exempt use does not
require a local government authorization law and an allowable use does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 3.17 of the bill would repeal various air quality reporting
requirements for the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and
the Environmental Management Commission.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 3.18 would clarify that when a venomous reptile is seized and
anti-venom approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for that
reptile is not readily available, the North Carolina Museum of Natural
Sciences or the North Carolina Zoo, or other designated representative,
must euthanize the reptile unless the species is protected under the
Federal Endangered Species Act.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 3.19 of the bill would transfer the rule-making responsibilities
for on-site waste management systems from the Commission for Public
Health to the Environmental Management Commission.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 3.20 would provide that the General Assembly finds that the
governor's waste board, which was repealed in 1993, has rules that are
no longer enforceable or necessary. This section would direct the
Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources to repeal those rules on
or before December 1 of this year. It also prohibits any political
subdivision of the state from enforcing the rules. The 1993 legislation
that repealed the board transferred its duties to the Secretary of
Environment and Natural Resources, and those are largely about
preemption of local government ordinances that would have the effect of
prohibiting a low-level radioactive waste facility.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 3.21 of the bill would amend a provision that was enacted in
2013 to provide for reduced flow alternatives for waste water systems,
such that in addition to exempting establishments, dwelling units would
now be exempt from the daily flow rate for design, and any design flow
standard under certain conditions. This section would also direct the
Commission for Public Health and the Department of Health and Human
Services to establish flow rate limits by rule that are based on
scientific evidence specific to soil types that are found in this state.</p>

Section 3.22 would repeal two obsolete previsions in the criminal law.
The first relates to using profane or indecent language on public
highways and the second relates to refusing to relinquish a party line
in an emergency.
speaker changes
Section 3.23 of the bill would increase certain penalties for the taking
of protected plants. The bill would increase from a  minimum penalty of
ten dollars up to a minimum of seventy-five dollars. And it would
increase the maximum penalty from fifty dollars to one hundred and
seventy-five dollars per offense. The section would also require the
clerk of port for the jurisdiction to report the conviction to the Plant
Conservation Board provided that the plant taken is also listed under
the protected plants list pursuant to the Plant Protection and
Conservation Act.
speaker changes
Section 3.24 would amend the motor vehicle law to increase the penalty
range for violating the handicap parking privileges provision. Under
current law, the minimum penalty is one hundred dollars and the maximum
is two hundred and fifty dollars. This provision would increase that
from a minimum of three hundred dollars to a maximum of five hundred. It
also removes the provision from the law that requires that signs
designating handicap parking spaces must state the maximum penalty for
violating the law. This provision would prohibit signs displaying
incorrect maximums.
Speaker changes
Section 3.25 would repeal several redundant and obsolete reports as
requested by the North Carolina Utilities Commission.
Speaker changes
Section 3.26 would repeal the requirement for the state energy office to
conduct energy audits of  each state agency and institution of higher
learning as a part of the department of administrations facilities
condition and assessment program. The section would also change from
annual to bi-annual the required updates to the management plans
developed by state agencies and institutions of higher learning to
manage energy, water, and utility use.
Speaker changes.
Section 3.27 deals with the state's coastal storm water rules. Under
those rules certain properties are granfathered and the rules don't

Section 3.28 would authorize the use of any pesticide registered by the
Pesticide Board to control any species of mole other than the Star-nosed
Mole if pesticide Board rules are followed and hazards to non-target

Section 3.29 would exempt any residential building subject to periodic
inspection by the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency from a county or
city's authority to conduct periodic inspections as part of a targeted
effort within a geographic area if the residential building is in
compliance with the federal standards. And the owner must provide the
resident the certification on the residential building that's supplied
by the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency to the local inspection
department.
Speaker changes.
Section 3.30 is another building code prevision. The North Carolina fire
code requires that no more than one half of the doors of certain
buildings be equipped with security grills. This section of the bill
would require the Building Cod Council to amend the code so the grills
are permitted at all exits as long as the grills may be opened from the
inside while the building is occupied by authorized persons and grills
remain open when the building is occupied by the general public.

Section 3.33 of the bill would transfer all rule-making authority for
matters related to solid and hazardous waste from the Commission for

under the North Carolina Drinking Water Act from the Commission for
Public Health to the Environmental Management Commission, including
drinking water rules to regulate public water systems.

Section 3.35 would provide an exemption from the requirements of the
electrical contractor’s statutes for the installation, construction,
maintenance or repair of electrical wiring devices, appliances, or
equipment by person certified as a well contractor so long as the wires
are between the well pump and the pressure switch. This section would
also direct the Well Contractor’s Certification Commission to establish
minimum education, experience and knowledge requirements for its
certified individuals.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 3.36A would provide the private drinking water well permitting,
inspection, and testing programs administered by county health
departments. Must use standard forms created by the Department of
Natural Resources, unless the local program submits a petition for
rule-making to the Environmental Management Commission and the EMC finds
by rule that the area has unique conditions constituting a threat to
public health that would be mitigated by the use of a different form.
The bill would also provide that local health department registries of
private drinking water wells must be searchable by the address served by
the well.
Section 3.36B – D would provide that neither the department nor any
local well program may require that well contractor identification
plates include well construction permit numbers and directs the
Environmental Management Commission to adopt conforming rules. A local
well program may install the plate with the well construction permit
number or any other relevant information on the well at its own expense.
Section 3.36E would provide that if the well location marked on the map
submitted with an application to a local well program is also marked
with a stake on the property, the local well program may not require the
contractor to be onsite during the onsite predrill inspection provided
that the contractor’s available to answer questions by telephone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 4.1 begins Part 4 of the bill encompassing studies. This section
would direct the Department of Ag and Consumer Services to create the
Honeybee Improvement for Vital Ecology working group. The working group
would be directed to proactively address an issue colony collapse
disorder and is directed to report its findings and recommendations to
the Environmental Review Commission by November 30th of this year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 4.2 would direct the Division of Marine Fisheries and the
Department of Natural Resources to designate an area of approximately
10,000 acres in the Pamlico Sound as a recommendation to the
Environmental Review Commission for the creation of the Senator Jean
Preston Marine Shellfish Sanctuary and to create a plan for managing
that sanctuary.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Section 4.3 of the bill is a recommendation from the Environmental
Review Commission. This section would direct the Department of
Environment and Natural Resources to study the statutes and rules
governing inner base and transfers and to make recommendations as to
whether the statues and rules should be amended. DENR is directed to
report to the Environmental Review Commission no later than October 1st
of 2014.
Section 4.4 is also an ERC recommendation. It would direct the program
evaluation division at the General Assembly to study the benefits that
may result from the merger of public water systems and waste water
collection and treatment works.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Part 5 of the bill is a severability clause and effective date and Mr.
Chair, that completes our review of the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, staff, for an excellent report. As you can see, we have a lot
of important material before us. Senator Wade, would you like? By the
way, the deadline is up for the amendments. So, we’re going to work with
the ones we have. Senator Wade, you have the microphone.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don’t have any further comments unless
there’s questions, and I’d like to thank the staff for the presentation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Very good. Now, to make this run efficiently what we want to do is
when you have a question on a specific section, identify that section so
our right staff people can get to that area.</p>

Just to allow us to move along at a quick pace, excuse me. Alright,
members of the Finance Committee, questions? Senator Goolsby.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Section 3.24, increased penalties for parking
in handicapped spaces without required placard, it appears, and perhaps
I'm reading it wrong, that we're gonna have to have all of our local
business in the state, everybody who maintains parking lots with signs,
looks like are going to now have to redesign all of their signs and
replace them. Do we have a fiscal note or any idea what the cost will be
to the public and to the state for all of these new signs? 'Cause there
will be a, I guess, thousands of them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff, do we have someone that can help Senator Goolsby? The question
about a fiscal note on the replacement of the handicapped signs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Identify yourself when you, oh I'm sorry, Senator Wade has a response.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Goolsby, my understanding is these signs won't have to be
replaced. That there are types of stickers that can be put over them and
not all of them have &quot;maximum $100 on it.&quot; But I'm
understanding that there is an easier fix for that. When we went through
the discussion I was told that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does that satisfy or did you have a follow-up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That helps. Okay, I would appreciate if we get some kind of feedback
from staff if there's been any fiscal note run. That seems to make
sense, I hope that that's practical.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff, do we have an answer with, say, a little bit more defined on that
question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We do not have this reflected in the fiscal note. We'll follow up with
the analyst to see if we have any further information and get back with
Senator Goolsby.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Goolsby, we will work to see if we can get you an answer to your
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir, Dr. Lauren's also helping me with it right now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, very good. Members of the Finance Committee, additional questions?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I got Brock. Senator Brock you have first.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Need to send forth an amendment. Are we gonna take amendments now or
questions? It's already been passed up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, no amendments won't be taken until after the recess, okay?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, question about section 3.16. It has to do with
Jordan Lake and I know we took away the ability of Durham County or
Durham City to be able to govern themselves in their own jurisdictional
?? session. My question is does this further limit the ability of either
of those jurisdictions and any other jurisdiction in terms of what the
rules are for repairing buffers at Jordan Lake?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade, you have a response?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, my understanding is the federal mitigation
process already is basically the same as what the local jurisdiction is
and it's just redundant for them to have to do it twice after they do
the federal, the streams and a pipe, it doesn't have, it's not a stream
anymore it's not under the ground. So there aren't any buffers and it's
the, already been, the mitigation papers have been done by the federal
government.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a follow-up question on that and then one other question. The
follow-up is have the jurisdictions around Jordan lake indicated that
they were fine with this provision?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll have to get help from staff on that
particular issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff, does anyone else help us with that question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We do not know if any of those jurisdictions were consulted about this
provision.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you and then an additional question-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, Senator Stein?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
On another section, section 3.1, the regulation of impact to isolated
wetlands, and my question is is 1/3 of an acre to 1 acre east of 95 and
1/10 of an acre to 1 acre west, what percentage of wetlands will this
change apply to?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Actually, isolated wetlands are 2% of what the
state controls and right now we've already passed regulations that
they're exempt from this and this is a compromise. This body passed
that, sent it over to the House. This is a compromise to do 1 acre and
you have to remember these isolated wetlands just contain rainwater and
it's sorta like a mud hole that you fill in. That'd be the best way to
describe it, and so they do, after an acre, have to do mitigation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a follow-up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, and just so I understand, the</p>

<p id="40:00">
these isolated wetlands are 2% of all wetlands?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Correct, that the state controls.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What is the state control?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That the state has any control over, not the federal government. The
federal government controls the other 98%.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So you all set to understand? Okay, I've got Senator Daniel. Anybody
else need to ask a question please raise your hand so I can identify.
Senator McKissick, great.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Wade, I guess I wanted to return back
to the handicapped parking space issue. I just wanted to, is there some
problem across the state that drove this? That we need to double the
penalties? I guess I just wondered what the rationale was for that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My understanding, there's been a lot of complaints that people still
park in handicapped that do not have the license to park there and they
were hoping that increasing the penalty would stop that from happening.
The difference between paying $100 and $500 might defer that from
happening.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Daniel, you okay with that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My personal opinion is it's probably not necessary but I don't know that
I'm-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, you had your question answered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I've got Senator McKissick. Welcome, Senator McKissick, good to see you
today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good to see you as well, Mr. Chair, as always. A couple of questions, I
noticed there was a provision here dealing with the carbon monoxide
alarm, section 3.3. I was just trying to get some clarity in terms of
what we are doing in connection with that. I know there were some deaths
at motels, hotels as a result of carbon monoxide being released and it
was not detected and I believe that was the reason for this being
passed, as I recall it was up in Boone but somewhere in that area. Could
somebody provide a little bit more clarity as to that first-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff will respond to your question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Identify yourself, please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Peter Ledford with the Research Division. Senator McKissick you are
correct, there were, I believe, three deaths at a hotel outside of
Boone. In last year's regulatory reform bill, House Bill 74, we passed a
provision that would require carbon monoxide detectors at hotels,
motels, and other lodging establishments. Subsequent to that we received
feedback from, among others, the Building Code Council and the State
Fire Marshall's Office that there's a distinction between a carbon
monoxide detector and a carbon monoxide alarm and some other technical
changes. So those are the provisions that are primarily ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, did you get an appropriate answer?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, just a quick follow-up, so this-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, this is just simply to clarify that provisions, it doesn't, it's
not effectively repealing any of those things that we thought we were
enacting last year to require a better monitoring of carbon monoxide in
those situations?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir, this is primarily to clarify and then to add the provisions
regarding how it will be enforced.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Second.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, ?? say to you and that is some of the things they
told me was whether it was wired, actually the wires go into the
detector or it plugs into a socket. They had to clarify some of those
things so the building code people, when they went out to inspect, would
know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up on a separate issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I noticed, also, under section 1.8K, this provision here which would
encourage the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to abolish the Actual
Innocence Commission. It's my understanding that the current Chief
Justice as well as Mark Martin, who's sitting Justice today, I know he's
running for Chief Justice, as well as Chief Justice Beverly Lake when he
was around felt that this was a good initiative, the Actual Innocence
Commission. I understand what came from there were recommendations
dealing with the Inquiry Commission that was subsequently established
but it's my understanding that there's a belief among either sitting
justices as well as prior justices of both parties that, believe that
this is something that needs to continue so I was trying to get some
further information as to why that would be abolished at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick, I'm gonna refer to Senator Hartsell. I think he can
give you a better understanding of that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, Senator Hartsell, response please.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Very simply, the Actual Innocence Commission was set up by the Chief
Justice, it's operated by the Chief Justice and we're simply asking them
to terminate it because it hasn't been acting for the last several
years. They have a separate entity that is doing much of the same thing
and we're just trying to clean that up.</p>

<p id="45:00">
we don't wanna direct it because it wasn't set up by the legislature and
we don't want a separation of powers kind of issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Quick follow-up
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is that clear?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is, I guess when I saw that I took the liberty of speaking with Chris
Mumma of the Inquiry Commission and information that's come to me just
in the last hour is that there's a belief that this entity still needs
to continue functioning and operating at their duties and things that it
could continue following through on that would further the potential
exoneration of innocent people. So I would hope we would consult with
those parties before we move forward with the because we may find that
there's reason to, perhaps, delete this from the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any other questions, Senator Mckissick, you all set?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Not at this time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, I've got Senator Tucker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just to raise a question, after we reviewed
this bill yesterday in ??, I've got a real problem with community
colleges selling beer. I know that the brewery and the winery business
has taken off in our state and it's created jobs. By no means does this
question raise the issue of the training to put those folks in those
jobs but to start the ball rolling selling alcohol at community
colleges, like we do winery, I didn't find out until this morning that
we sell wine at community colleges. I know this program was mirrored
after that but I don't know what message it sends, I don't know where we
stop it. I know that there wants to be a casino in Cleveland County,
does that mean that we're gonna have a practice gaming jobs training
program at that community college? Does that mean that since public
colleges are selling alcohol, does that mean that since I own lifetime
seats at NC State's football games does that mean I'm gonna be able to
buy alcohol at the University? I know it's wine or beer that's created
through the program and they sell it. I think that it possibly could be
transferred to breweries and/or wineries to sell rather than the
community colleges being in the business of selling alcohol, getting a
permit, and then assuming the liability if someone were to drink too
much at an event and that's just kinda my hypothetical. It kinda sounds
like Senator McKissick, I know when I get out there with hypotheticals,
but I think it's worth talking about.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tucker, what was that question again?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's what we say to Senator McKissick most of the time. The question
is, is, I oppose selling beer and wine through community colleges. I
would, perhaps let us look at choosing another vehicle rather than
starting this out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Wade.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Tucker, all I can say to you is they
can only do six events and they're limited to the amount of beer they
can sell, and it's the same as the wine industry. And I understand your
point but this is what's in this particular bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up? Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I know it can come out and I know they can sell 64 cases. Now, when I
was in college that wouldn't have been enough but today it is. I don't,
I just, I'm opposed to it and if it comes, if we could work on taking it
out then fine, if we can't I'll lose this battle, I'm fine with that as
well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. Okay, I've got Senator Woodard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. A question probably for staff on the Marine
Artifacts Section.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What is the section?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
3.32.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I just wanna understand what the current rules are related to that.
Again, if you don't have that right at hand somebody could follow up
with me.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Please identify yourself.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm Jeff Hudson on the research staff. We were actually looking into
that a bit last night. We don't have that right now but I'll be happy to
follow up with that and get that information to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'll take the answer offline, thank you, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, I've got Senator Tillman. Any other members would like to have a
question in this committee before we go to Senator Tillman? Seeing none.
Okay, Senator Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You know, it's a good thing I've got a clear mind at 73 because I would
have forgotten all that I was gonna ask. Now, I've got a comment and
then a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's clear right 'til now.
﻿[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is it your birthday? You keep mentioning 73. Is it your birthday, are we
supposed to sing you something?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, I've had six birthdays this year.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's not today. On the Innocence Commission, what you would need to do
folks, if you love this commission, is to find out how many cases
they've reviewed over the several years</p>

we've had it and how many cases resulted in a reversal of the decision,
okay? In these death penalty cases. Find out that if you're interested.
Number 2, on the handicapped parking. I don't care if we charge $1,000
fine that's not my issue, my issue is I go to many places and there's no
handicapped. Some have one and some have ten. I wanna know what the
regulation is on the number of spaces you may have or not have or is it
totally discretionary? Can somebody answer that one for me?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff, can we give a response back to the requirement of the number of
handicapped spaces in the building and how do you arrive at it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, I believe that that is controlled by the Department of
Transportation but I will get a more specific answer for Senator
Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, we'll get an answer to that question, we don't have it
right offhand. Follow up question? Are you, is that it? Okay, members of
the committee, we are going to, Senator McKissick, sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One quick question on one other section here and that's the one dealing
with the repeal of the energy audits, 3.26. I was wondering, are we
repealing that section in it's entirety? I see some language here
talking about requiring updates biannually vs. annually, but if I could
some clarity there because these are audits which are done to help us
conserve energy and water, utility usage in our state buildings which
ultimately saves us a lot of money. So if somebody could provide some
clarity on what we are doing there so I can-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can you identify yourself and please respond to Senator McKissick's
question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Of course, thank you Mr. Chair. Jennifer Mundt, analyst with the
research divisions. Senator McKissick, what this provision would so is
first, you are dealing with the repeal of the program. This is
facilities condition and assessment program audit under that provision,
under the Department of Administration, so that would be repealed, that
provision. There's another report that would be done and that's in
subsection A on page 39 of your bill in front of you and that one simply
changes the reporting of that or updating of the management plant from
annually to biannually so that's a change. So, to answer your question,
that report that you're asking about, that is a repeal of that report.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Quick follow-up, if I could.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, follow-up question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So what would continue to exist, I mean, in terms of the energy audits
that have been required for the last several years? Because when we
adopted those provisions it was with the idea of state saving money on
utilities and operating expenses with state buildings and facilities. So
that was the goal, so I'm wondering what would continue to exist if that
is, in fact, being repealed?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Can we...?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If I may, Mr. Chair, can I look into that a little further for you
offline, Senator McKissick, and get you a response?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That'll be fine.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We'll work on trying to get you a response back. Members of the
committee and financial committee, any additional questions? Alright, we
have five amendments, we're going to have to spend a few moments
reviewing them so that we can fully understand what they do. What that
means is at 11:25, we're gonna recess until 11:25 at which time we'll
begin and start taking on the amendments appropriately. This committee
meeting is recessed until 11:25.
Finance Committee is back in order. We've got to be out of this room

does rename, or re-designate, who will be the responsible agency to
oversee the act's provisions and it gives some guidance on what folks
can do with regard to holding information until ?? is finally settled

the Department of Administration vice the Building Code Council as the
folks who will oversee the provisions. This is the one that gives the
buffer zone to the military installations so they can conduct training
and it requires that they give out accurate maps, and so forth, so that

Okay thank you, Senator Rabin, that will be included.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you and thank all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright, Senator Barefoot would you please come forward with your
amendment? And I believe members have that before them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
What this amendment does is it amends a statute that we passed last year
concerning expedited processes of inter-basin transfers to allow the
Kerr Lake water system to go through an expedited process. Currently the
Kerr Lake water system draws 10 million gallons per day, that's it's IBT
permit. It has a contract with the core that goes back to the 70's for
20 million gallons a day. It is, it's pipes fit 20 million gallons a
day. What's happened is the area has been growing and the growth needs
require for the Kerr Lake water system to match it's permit to the army
corps contract and all this would do is allow it to use the expedited
process. So far, it has been in the process for six years, it's cost
about $600,000. The water it already allotted and everyone is, all the
locals are in support of this. The legislative delegations, it's
bipartisan in support of this so I ask that you adopt it, make a motion-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Bill sponsor would be very favorable to this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Daniel, question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Barefoot, I just wanted to clarify,
this won't affect any inter-basin transfers west of I-77?

Barefoot's amendment? It has received positive consideration from the

Barefoot's amendment to be part of Senate Bill 734. All in favor please
