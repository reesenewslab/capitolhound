  Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats and we will get our
subcommittee meeting started. Now would be a good time to check your
electronic devices and make sure that they are turned to vibrate or off
so your ringing won’t disturb the committee. This is a joint committee
on appropriations for the Department of Health and Human Services. I’d
like to introduce our House sergeant in arms, Young Bae, Bill Morris,
Jim Moran. Senate sergeant in arms, Canton Lewis and Steve Wilson.
Appreciate the work that these gentlemen do to keep us on track and to
be so helpful to us as we go through these hearings. We have two pages
who are from the, sponsored by members of the House with us today, if
you’ll raise your hand when I call your name. Jordan Trivet from Bladen
County, sponsored by Representative William Brisson. Jordan, stand up so
we can get a look at you. Glad to have you with us today. And Nickie
Vermule Apoly. Sorry about that. Vickie, we’re glad to have you with us.
She’s from Cabarrus County, sponsored by Representative Pittman. Glad to
have these young folks with us and we hope that your stay in Raleigh
will be productive and informative for you. Understand we have a Senate
page. Okay, I have found it. Daria Thomas is from Kinston. Daria is
sponsored by Senator Don Davis. I apologize, the, could not find your
name there for a moment. I should have known it. The agenda has been
published and we will stick to the agenda for today, and we appreciate
everybody being here during this roller coaster weather we’re having
outside. First item on the agenda is a presentation from Jeff Grimes
from the program evaluation division. After Mr. Grimes’ presentation is
complete, Joyce Jones from the legislative drafting division will also
offer comments. So we’re gonna invite Mr. Grimes in. Mr. Grimes, I
believe you have some other members from PED with you and if you’d like
to introduce them or have their comments as you go along, that would be
fine. You are recognized for your comments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, mister chair. We also have Carol Shaw, Brent Lucas, and Shawn
Hamel from the program evaluation division team here today. My name is
Jeff Grimes. I’m a senior evaluator with the program evaluation
division. Today I’ll present the findings and recommendations from the
report entitled, the Department of Health and Human Services should
integrate state substance abuse treatment facilities into the community
based system and improve performance management. This project is a
result of the appropriations act of 2013 which directed the study. To
start out, there are two primary components to the state system for
public substance abuse treatment. The first that I’ll discuss is the
alcohol and drug abuse treatment center, or ADATCs. There are three
ADATCs in North Carolina, Julian F. Keith in Black Mountain, RJ Blackley
in Butner, and Walter B. Jones in Greenville. The ADATCs provide 24/7
inpatient treatment for those with a substance use disorder. Services
include psychiatric stabilization, detoxification, substance abuse
treatment and education, and medical care. In fiscal year 2013-14, the
three ADATCs combined operated 196 beds, admitted 3,875 individuals for
treatment, and spent over $46 million providing that treatment. The
ADATCs rely heavily on state general fund dollars to cover operating
expenses. In fiscal year 13-14, state appropriations covered 90% of all
expenses while the other 10% of expenses were covered through receipts.
The federal program Medicare is the largest source of receipts at almost
8% of the total. As you can see, the ADATCs receive very little revenue
from individuals paying out of pocket, from private insurance, or from
the state’s Medicaid program. The second component

  Component of North Carolina’s system for public substance abuse
treatment is the community based system, which is made up of nine local
management entities/manage care organizations, or LME/MCOs. The LME/MCOs
are overseen by the division of mental health, developmental
disabilities, and substance abuse services and receive state
appropriations to contract for substance abuse treatment in the
community based system. LME/MCOs establish networks of providers that
purchase substance abuse treatment services from those providers.
LME/MCOs also have the responsibility for implementing a 24 hour a day
screening, triage, and referral process, provider monitoring,
utilization management, utilization review, and determination of the
appropriate level and intensity of services for individuals, care
coordination, and financial management and accountability for the use of
state funds. Before discussing each finding, I want to refer you to side
one of the handout, which is the American Society of Addiction Medicine
continuum of care for adult substance abuse treatment. This continuum of
care is a framework created by the American Society of Addiction
Medicine or ASAM, and has been adopted by DHHS for use in placing
individuals at the appropriate level of care for treatment. These levels
of care are important throughout the rest of this presentation. On the
left are the least intensive levels of care, such as early intervention
or outpatient services, and each level of care is associated with a
number. On the far right are the most intensive levels of care, with
medically managed intensive inpatient services being the highest. These
are services typically delivered in a community hospital, a psychiatric
hospital, and at the ADATCs in North Carolina. One thing to emphasize is
that the ASAM continuum is about the kind of setting for treatment. It
does not dictate the type of treatment modalities are used. So a
treatment modality is a specific type of treatment or approach to
treatment delivered by a provider. The idea behind the ASAM continuum is
that you can improve clinical outcomes and cost effectiveness by
matching treatment setting to the needs of the individual, preventing
under treatment and costly over treatment. Our first finding is the
three alcohol and drug abuse treatment centers operate with a high
degree of autonomy, resulting in operational and treatment differences.
Now, we expected going into the project to see consistency across the
three ADATCs that would ensure uniform treatment across the state
regardless of which facility provides that treatment. However, that
wasn’t the case and we did find several differences. In this slide you
can see some of the differences in operation and treatment at the three
ADATCs. One difference is that the Julian F. Keith facility has roughly
40 more budgeted positions than the other two facilities. Even though
the ADATCs are all state facilities and provide the same level of care,
Julian F. Keith has a very different number of positions as compared to
the other two. As a result, the other two facilities are, rely more
heavily on contractors to make up for the difference in state personnel.
Next, you’ll see that RJ Blackley had about $900,000 more in expenses
than the other two facilities. One final difference is that the cost per
stay at Walter B. Jones of $10,998 is about 1,500 less than the other
two facilities. The primary reason is that Walter B. Jones keeps
patients for less time than the other two facilities. While we’re
talking about differences in facilities and autonomy, it’s also
important to mention that one potential result is over expenditures. In
the 2013 session, the general assembly reduced ADATC appropriations by
$4.9 million for fiscal year 13-14. However, the ADATCs actually
overspent by $5.2 million which means that even without the cuts, the
ADATCs would have overspent. The way they attempted to meet the cuts was
by eliminating a combined 44 beds from operation at the facilities, and
eliminating vacant positions. Ultimately, the over expenditures at the
ADATCs were covered by unused state appropriations at the O’berry Neuro
Medical Treatment Center and the Murdoch Developmental Center, which are
also operated by the division of state operated healthcare facilities.
Finding two, separation of the alcohol and drug treatment centers from
the community based system creates operational silos which provide
challenges to utilization management, continuity of care

  <p id="10:00">
  And information management. An important concept to discuss is the
existence of structural incentives that promote an over-reliance on ??.
North Carolina funds ?? through an appropriation, while also giving
LME/MCOs separate funds to develop networks of providers to treat
individuals. When a patient is referred to an ADATC, the ADATCs are
outside of the LME/MCO system and the LME/MCOs bear no cost for
treatment at the ADATCs. In fact, when the LME/MCO refers a patient to
an ADATC, the LME/MCO can avoid having to pay for treatment elsewhere.
ADATCs rely on state appropriations and have limited incentive to
restrict utilization of services to only those individuals who need a
high level of care, because most of the cost of operations is already
covered every year through state appropriations. Finally, LME/MNCOs
don&#39;t have much incentive to invest in community-based services that
would be a substitute for ADATC services because the LME/MCO would then
have to pay for community services whereas they don&#39;t have to pay
for ADATC services now, because the state is paying for those services
directly. In fact an LME/MCO has just the opposite incentive to use as
much ADATC services as possible because those services are essentially
free to the LME/MCO and if a given LME/MCO doesn&#39;t use much ADATC
services, other LME/MCOs will be able to use even more. Because state
appropriations primarily fund ADATCs and LME/MCOs do not pay for those
services, there is no payer who may question the need for an ADATC
service or limit over-utilization. One result is that you can find cases
of prolonged lengths of stay at ADATCs. The longest case we identified
was an individual who stayed at an ADATC for 335 days straight. In
total, we identified 113 individuals with prolonged lengths of stay.
Those extra treatment days for those prolonged lengths of stay cost the
state more than 1.5 million during the nearly two year time period we
examined. Another way in which the separation between the ADATCs and the
community based system causing problems is insuring continuity of care.
As discussed, the ADATCs and community based system are separate
components and with that comes challenges insuring continuing care
because it requires effective communication, information sharing, and
planning. Because substance use disorder is a chronic condition, after
leaving an ADATC, an individual is likely to need further treatment at a
lower level of care in order to promote long term recovery. For example,
someone might leave an ADATC and continue treatment at a residential or
outpatient facility. The Division of Mental Health set a goal that at
least 40% of persons discharged from an ADATC receive community based
follow-up treatment within seven days of discharge from an ADATC. This
measure of follow-up treatment within seven days is shown in the graph
by ADATC, by quarter. The reason this goal is in place is that we know
from the literature that individuals benefit from continuing care in
terms of improving long-term treatment outcomes. As you can see from the
graph, performance on this measure has been declining since fiscal year
11-12, and the most recent data shows that coordination between the
ADATCs and LME/MCOs falls well below the performance target. Finding
three: separation of the alcohol and drug abuse treatment centers from
the community based system limits North Carolina&#39;s ability to
address service gaps and managed cost. When North Carolina transitioned
to a managed care model for community based behavioral health, some of
the expected benefits were a decrease in inappropriate use of inpatient
care and an expansion of the array of services provided at the community
level. These expectations were not unreasonable. Managed care typically
results in decreased utilization of expensive inpatient settings as some
services are shifted to less costly residential or outpatient settings.
In North Carolina, ADATC utilization remains outside of the LME/MCO
system, which has hindered the state&#39;s ability to fully realize the
benefits of managed care. In fiscal year 11-12, the ADATCs made up 49%
of non-Medicaid general fund dollars expended on substance abuse
treatment, which means that many of the state&#39;s dollars for
substance abuse treatment are outside of the managed care system. The
closest thing that we have in North Carolina to a more fully developed
community based managed care model is something called the Piedmont
Demonstration Project.

  Which shows that changing the incentive structure and expanding
community-based services results in reduced ADAC utilization. Piedmont
Behavioral Health was the pilot LMEMCO and served Cabarras, Davidson,
Stanley, Roanne and Union Counties. PBH has since merged with other
entities to form Cardinal Innovations Healthcare Solutions and is one of
the nine LMEMCOs in the state. In 2003, PBH entered into a memorandum of
understanding to begin receiving a per-capita share of state institution
funds. PBH began receiving $10.7 million based on its share of state
psychiatric hospital and ADAC funding. PBH then had to pay for the use
of the ADACs and state psychiatric hospitals when someone from one of
the five counties went there, and the rate for the ADACs was $260 a day.
This arrangement remains in effect for just those five PBH counties in
North Carolina and as you’ll see in a moment has had a dramatic impact
on utilization of the ADACs. This graph shows admissions to the ADACs
per 100,000 North Carolinians. The statewide average is in red compared
with the average for PBH counties in blue. At the time of the PBH
demonstration project in 2003, PBH utilization of the ADACs was slightly
below the state average with 36 individuals per 100,000 being admitted
to an ADAC compared to the state average of 42. By fiscal year 2012-13,
PBH utilization was down to 2.6 individuals per 100,000 while the state
average was still 42. Staff at PBH which is not Cardinal Innovations
Healthcare Solutions, noted that one reason ADAC admissions are lower in
PBH counties is due to the use of facility based crisis services which
serve a need for local detoxification capacity and keep individuals from
needing to go to an ADAC for detoxification. Cardinal contracts for the
operation of two 16 bed crisis/detoxification facilties that serve the
PBH counties. In addition, Cardinal reported to us having seven hospital
detoxification providers that serve the counties and also paying for 300
individuals to receive treatment at a medically monitored community
residential treatment facility in fiscal year 2012-13, which is level
3.7 on the handout of the American Society of Addiction Medicine
Continuum of Care. In the report we tried to provide examples of
alternative ways to serve individuals that an LMEMCO might use. Now,
there’s no one size fits all alternative to serving everyone currently
treated at an ADAC but I want to talk about an example of an individual
who is in need of an ASAM 3.7 level of service, which is medically
monitored intensive inpatient services. This is one level lower than
ASAM 4.0, which is medically managed intensive inpatient services. ADACs
admit and treat individuals at both the 3.7 and 4.0 levels. If an
individual requires the 3.7 level, it would cost far less to treat that
individual in the community-based system. So let’s start by looking at
the average length of stay at an ADAC which is 16 days. Based on the
cost per day in the last fiscal year of $771 a day, that stay at an ADAC
would cost $12,336 for the 16 days. Alternatively, here is how that same
level of care, 3.7, can be served in the community. First, the
individual would receive facility based crisis services for
detoxification. Facility based crisis is a 24 hour residential facility
that provides detoxification and stabilization services. The average
length of stay is five days for a cost of $1,500. The individual can
then receive medically monitored community residential treatment
services for the remainder of the time period at the cost of $3,003.
This is a residential setting where there’s a medical or nursing
monitoring and professionally directed treatment. In total the cost of
the community-based services would be just over $4,500 compared to over
$12,000 at an ADAC. Again, this example wouldn’t work for everyone
served by an ADAC, but only in those in need of a 3.7 level. One final
issue related to having the ADACs and community-based

  Community-based system by transitioning ADAC appropriations to the
community-based system and requiring LME/MCOs to pay for ADAC services
when they contract with ADACs. Because an immediate switch of all
funding could negatively affect the availability of treatment services,
we recommend a multi-year process, which would start with one year of
planning in order to allow LME/MCOs to develop plans for how they would
spend reallocated ADAC funding and to allow ADACs time to plan to move
to a receipt-supported business model. After the planning year, ADACs
would have their appropriations reduced in 25-percent increments over a
three-year period and, by the fourth year, would receive no
appropriations. At the same time, LME/MCOs would start to receive
reallocated ADAC funding in increasing increments of 25% and would
receive the full amount of reallocated ADAC funds in the fourth year.
LME/MCOs would also begin to have to pay a portion of the cost of ADAC
treatment and, by the fourth year, would have to pay the full cost when
they contract with ADACs. LME/MCOs would be able to determine how they
spend the reallocated ADAC funding, but they would have to spend it on
substance abuse treatment, either from community providers or from the
ADACs. Having this flexibility would allow LME/MCOs to determine how
much inpatient-level services they need to purchase relative to other
levels of care and would allow them to contract with providers that best
fit their needs. ADACs would have to adjust their operations based on
contracts with LME/MCOs as well as other receipts, such as Medicare,
self-pay, or private insurance. In order to ensure proper planning and
oversight of the transition process, we recommended the following
timeline: By February 1, 2016, LME/MCOs would need to submit plans to
the Division of Mental Health on how they plan to use reallocated ADAC
funding. Two months later, DHHS should submit its own business plan for
the ADACs to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and
Human Services, outlining its estimate for the demand for ADAC services
from LME/MCOs, procedures for making operational adjustments based upon
projected demand, and the method for establishing rates for ADAC
services. DHHS would also report annually to the Joint Legislative
Committee on Health and Human Services and the Joint Legislative Program
Evaluation Oversight Committee on October 1 from 2016 through 2020 on
the integration of the ADACs into the community-based system and the use
of reallocated funds by LME/MCOs. The second recommendation is that the
General Assembly should direct the Division of Mental Health,
Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Services to strengthen
its performance management system for substance abuse treatment by
improving data collection and tracking long-term outcomes. In order to
ensure that North Carolina has effective substance abuse treatment
services, the General Assembly should direct the Division of Mental
Health to develop a plan to improve performance management of the
publicly funded substance abuse treatment system. The plan should
identify specific long-term outcome measures that the Division of Mental
Health will begin tracking, challenges with NC tracks that limit the
ability of the division to implement performance management and proposed
remedies, data elements that would allow the Division of Mental Health
to improve the process for analyzing gaps in the community-based system,
steps for how the division can use long-term outcomes in an order to
improve performance management and timelines for all steps required to
begin tracking long-term outcomes. The Division of Mental Health should
consult with LME/MCOs and other state agencies and divisions of DHHS in
order to plan to integrate other administrative data into a performance
management system. The division should submit this plan to the Joint
Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services by January
15, 2016. In summary, separation of the ADACs from the community-based
system has created several problems, and these limit the ability of
North Carolina to address substance abuse treatment service gaps,
provide a seamless continuum of care, and manage cost. DHHS should
integrate the ADACs into the community-based system and improve its
performance management system by tracking long-term outcomes. This
concludes my presentation for today. The full report is available online
and includes a response from DHHS. I’d be happy to answer any

  Any questions now with the direction of the chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Grimes. Ms. Jones from bill drafting is here to respond
with a draft bill and we will hear her comments and then we will open up
for questions at that time. Ms. Jones?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning, Mr. Chair and members of the committee. You have in your
package house bill 119 as well as a bill summary, and the bill
implements the recommendations that Mr Grimes just discussed. I&#39;m
gonna go through the bill analysis for you. Section one sets forth the
definitions that apply throughout the bill. I will just call to you
attention that one page one of the bill on line 29, there is a
definition of a transition period, and this is the period of time during
which all of this transitioning of funds is to occur. It&#39;s a three
year period that begins July 1, 2016 and it ends on June 30, 2019. And
during that time period the ADATCs are to be fully integrated into the
array of publicly funded substance abuse services that are managed by
the LME/MCOs. Sections two through six of the bill implement
recommendation one of the report. In particular, section two directs
DHHS to prepare by April 1, 2016 a three year transition business plan
for integrating the ADATCs  into the array of publicly funded substance
abuse services managed by the LME/MCOs. It lists five mandatory
components of the plan, and those are the LME/MCO&#39;s projected demand
for ADATC&#39;s services, both during the transition period and during
the first three fiscal years following full integration, the projected
availability of ADATC services during this time period, procedures for
making operational adjustments at the ADATCs, a methodology for
establishing and updating the rates to be paid by LME/MCOs for ADATC
services, a uniform process for LME/MCOs to give prior authorization for
ADATCs to admit and treat individuals for whom LME/MCOs will be
financially responsible. Section three provides for the termination of
all direct state appropriations for ADATCs effective July 1, 2019 and
isntead reallocates these funds to the Division of Mental Health,
Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Services for community
services in order to allow the LME/MCOs to assume full responsibility
for  managing these public funds, including those delivered through the
ADATCs. To help the LME/MCOs do some advance planning for assuming this
enhanced management responsibility, the  Division of Mental Health,
Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Services is directed to
provide each LME/MCO with its estimated share of these fund allocations
by August 1, 2015 and to condition each LME/MCOs receipt of these funds
on submission of a transition plan explaining how the LME/MCO will use
these reallocated funds to increase capacity for providing the full
continuum of substance abuse services. Section four imposes various
requirements on the LME/MCOs to help them plan for and manage
utilization and payment for ADATC services, namely it requires them to
submit written transition plans to the Division of Mental Health,
Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Services by February 1,
2016, and those plans are to describe how the funds will be used. They
need to share with the Division of State Operated Healthcare Facilities
by February 1 of each year their projected demand for ADATC services in
the upcoming fiscal year. They must enter into a contract with the
Division of State Operated Healthcare Facilities by April 1 of each year
for ADATC services they intend to use in the next fiscal year, and
implement and enforce the prior authorization process established by the
department. To help the ADATCs become fully receipt supported, section
five requires the ADATCs to annually evaluate and adjust their
operations to reflect the projected demand for services, and the
availability of funding to meet the demand of services from direct state
appropriations and

  And weighted receipts from Medicare, Medicaid, insurance, self-pay and
the LMEMCOs. Section 6 directs the Division of Mental Health,
Developmental Disabilities and Substance Abuse Services to monitor
important aspects of the integration process during the transition
period so as not to jeopardize federal block grant funding and to ensure
that under this new model the state will be able to offer all levels of
substance abuse services. Section six also requires the department to
report each October 1st from 2016 through 2020 on the status of fully
integrating the ADACs into the array of publicly funded substance abuse
services managed by the LMEMCOs and also it requires a breakdown of how
direct state appropriations reallocated from the ADACs to the LMEMCOs
have been used to purchase substance abuse services. In accordance with
recommendation two of the report, Section 7 directs the Division of
Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Abuse Services
in consultation with the LMEMCOs and as needed other DHHS divisions, the
North Carolina court system and other state departments to develop and
submit by January 15, 2016 a plan for a stronger performance management
system that tracks long term outcome measures for publicly funded
substance abuse services and the bill becomes effective when it becomes
law. That concludes my comments, Mr. Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Miss Jones. Now we will open the floor for questions from members of the
committee. Representative Brissom, Co-Chair. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank
you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Grimes on, I guess it’s exhibit 19, the, I don’t
know of anybody that don’t like the looks of the numbers, the cost, but
I was just, and I may have missed it, you may have told us, the ratio of
the patients coming from the ADAC treatments and the community-based
treatments, do you have any kind of numbers on ratio of, you know,
actually what the if we’re taking the people out of the circulation or
how many of them is still staying in the circulation. I mean, if you’re
coming back to the community-based treatments, if we’re not, they’re not
getting the correct treatment and they’re right back and they’re
constantly rotating through that, then, you know, it’s, I’m not sure
that we’re getting the bang for our buck. So I wanna, in the drug,
alcohol and drug, it seems to be that that’s what we’re doing with a lot
of our patients. We bring them in, dry them out a couple days and
they’re right back in the circle. We’re dealing a lot with the same
patients, particularly in the local hospitals. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Sure.
This example in exhibit 19 is really, it wouldn’t be so much leaving the
ADAC and going to this, it’s how you could alternatively serve some of
those 3.7 level individuals in the community rather than at an ADAC, and
what we said is because ADACs are serving the 3.7 and 4.0 levels of
care, we think that at least with those 3.7 there is a way to more
efficiently treat them in a community-based setting when that is
appropriate and when you do that you can save a lot of expense by
sending them to a facility-based crisis service and then a more
residential treatment service. As far as numbers on re-receiving
treatment I don’t have any exact numbers. What the literature says is
you want to see individuals going down that continuum of treatment over
time, so they may be treated in ADAC. If they then get out of the ADAC
and continue into treatment at, say, an outpatient setting, that’s
considered a success. What is less successful is if you have someone
who, say, was treated at an outpatient setting and their conditions
worsens and has to go to an ADAC. We’re trying to move people down that
continuum.

  Of care.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up, go ahead sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand that, but I was just looking at the prorated on the 16 day
treatment, I’m just, I know if I was an MCO, I would certainly look at
the bottom to begin with. I look at the dollars and it’s tightest
dollars have been lately or, particularly but, I’m not sure how that
this chart actually gives us a good idea of cost because community
based, the standard ADATC time, is that 16 day treatment, is that
standard with those?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir. The average length of stay across the three facilities is 16
days.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But, but some people stay a lot longer, sorry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So you’re saying that the community based treatment would be on a 16 day
period too, right?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
This was for purposes of illustration of someone, how you could treat
them in the same time frame. The LME/MCO may treat them over say a 14
day period. They may feel that a 30 day period is, is more appropriate.
It, it, it really is gonna depend on, on what they feel are the needs of
that particular individual. One, one point to make is that this sort of
scenario isn’t something an LME/MCO is probably going to consider right
now, because if the LME/MCO pays for the scenario, goes for the scenario
at the bottom, they have to pay that full cost. If they send the person
to an ADATC, they’re essentially paying nothing right now. So what we’re
saying is the, the current system incentivizes the LME/MCOs to send
folks to the ADATCs, and we think the incentives that are in place, made
much higher utilization of the ADATCs then you would see if you bring
the ADATCs into the manage care system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. Cochair, cochair Avila?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. I have somewhat the same issue of using
exhibit 19 and basically to clarify, your statement was that the chart
shows the setting, and not the modality of treatment. So what we’re
comparing here is the same treatment, but different settings. In other
words, at the end of 16 days, that person would have gotten the same
type of treatment regardless of either setting, because that as what was
predicated by their condition. Am I correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, these, these are essentially the ADATC setting versus the 3.7
community setting. So that’s, that’s the difference. It’s the same
number of treatment days, yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up. That really wasn’t my question. I’m not concerned about the
number of days they’re there. I’m concerned with the condition they will
be in at the end of 16 days. And my question is, would it be equivalent
regardless of the setting?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So the, the way our system is, is, is set up is it’s, it’s levels of
care. You could actually receive the exact same treatment modality at an
outpatient, at a residential, at inpatient. So for example, you’ve got,
a modality would be something like motivational interviewing. That’s a
type of modality. And what really drives the cost is not the modality,
it’s the setting. So in the ADATCs setting you’ve got psychiatrists,
you’ve got doctors, nurses. In a more residential setting, you’ve got
physician monitoring and that’s what, that’s what leads to the different
costs. The actual modalities delivered is gonna be dependent upon the
provider.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m not through yet. I guess that’s what’s confusing me. The question is
if they’re getting the same modality of treatment, why don’t we just
have the same setting for everybody, rather than have a setting where
they have physician supervision and one where the staff is psychiatrists
and everything. I’m, what I’m trying

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One last follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah. Do we have that same kind of measurement for all the different
points of continue of care in terms of if they get a treatment and show
up again?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would respond to say one of the things that we are, I think we&#39;re
in agreement with a lot of the conceptual part of this PED study, one of
the things we know that we want to do better is this tracking of
individuals and that outcome data. So what happens for people, when they
leave an ADATC and they go into community, do we follow folks along? And
so that&#39;s part of what we are working on and, again, we agree. But I
think that that&#39;s what we&#39;ll get to once we have those kinds of
tracking measures and outcome data available.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Co-Chairman Dobson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, two quick questions if I may, and either to Mr.
Richard or Mr. Grimes. It seems that, well the first question is it
seems that the recommendation is to move in a direction more in line
with Piedmont Behavioral Health, that would be fair to say?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, it&#39;s not exactly the same model as Piedmont Behavioral Health
but it is definitely more in line with that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, do we have, and I know we have a lack of data and you just talked
about that but since 2003, do we have anything, empirical or otherwise,
that tells us that the care is at least as good at PBH as those not at
PBH?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m happy to respond, and I think what we can tell you is that-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Richard, go ahead with that answer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I&#39;m sorry, sir. I&#39;ve forgotten the protocol. What we have is,
certainly information as Mr. Grimes presented in terms of the cost
avoidance. What we can&#39;t tell you is that we know that we have, in
the five, and it&#39;s really those five counties that were the original
PBH counties, that we have better outcomes for all people who many have
a substance abuse issue. I think that&#39;s, again, that&#39;s the real
issue about us trying to follow that data in a much greater way, to make
sure that we&#39;re looking at the outcomes across the system. I think
we all recognize it&#39;s been a flaw in the way that we have done this
is that we haven&#39;t had a continuum in terms of the way that we
reviewed the information and outcomes and we&#39;re committed to make
that happen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It would seem to me that we do need to be careful, then, to make sure
that the outcomes are at least as good under this new model as they
would be under the current model that we had before we move in that
direction, before we even know that it&#39;s the right way to go. So. I
think we need to be careful about that. And second, would there even be,
would there be a roll for ADATC at all under this new model. It seems to
me that there&#39;s no question that it would be a more limited role,
but would ADATC even be able to be operational under this new model
long-term?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Grimes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There is certainly a role for that level of care. That level of care is
definitely needed in our system. And then, under this new model, the
role of ADATC&#39;s themselves is going to be dependent on what the
LME/MCO feels they need within their catchment area.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Co-Chairman Hise.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think, in concept, I think this is an
incredible idea. I think most research I&#39;ve read indicates that
community based settings have higher levels of outcomes and better
services to individuals and less recidivism than you have in these
institutional settings. Where I have a concern in trying to get the
thought process of how this was developed, I know you&#39;re not a bill
sponsor or those type of things, or an advocate for the positions but
I&#39;ll start with this, this four year transition is what I see as
very problematic, where I start seeing problems. And when PBH went to it
they didn&#39;t phase it in over four year, they picked the time that
their starting and moving forward. And it starts with, on slide number
seven, when you reduce the department, the funding for the ADATC

  <p id="55:00">
  By 25%. This reduction here, if I’m not mistaken, was a 12% reduction,
which was 4.9, and they still spent 5.2 million over their budget. So
from a state we, if we cut them by 25, how do we know they don’t just
spend that amount anyway, transfer it from some other area and we’re
stuck, and now we’re spending 25% more in the overall system. The other
problem I have is for the LME/MCOs. Year one, year two you still have
the same incentive system. They’re still sitting there and saying, if I
can transfer this to the ADATC, then I’m not going to have the full
cost, but now for the community based services, I’m only getting paid
25% of the cost, and so they can put 75% of the cost onto the ADATC. So
as you transition in it, you keep the incentive to move individuals to
the ADATC that’s coming in. You may lessen it a little bit, but it’s not
until you actually transfer the funding completely that they have the
actual incentive to say, let’s treat everybody in the most cost
appropriate setting. Now that they’ve done, that’s what we do with
LME/MCOs across the board. So could have been addressing that, this four
year transition that’s coming over. Why not just make them receipt
supported if that amount of funds are coming in to the state and it’s
appropriate to be in the ADATCs? Why not make those adjustments in a
single year?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So I guess I can try to walk you through our thinking on the, on the
longer transition period. One, one is that the, the department felt like
they needed more time to begin to move toward that different business
model which is, which is receipt supported, which is a very different
way to operate I think than, than they have been funded in the past. In,
I, I think you’re right. In year one, you’re only looking at 25%, and
part of the, the rationale for that is just getting the LME/MCOs and,
and the ADATCs adjusted to, to billing to, to this idea of them being
the payer. Getting those systems set up. They’re certainly gonna have,
still have an incentive to send folks to the ADATCs because they’re
paying 25% of the, of the true cost as opposed to 100. But it’s, it’s
beginning to make that transition in the system. What we also heard from
LME/MCOs when we talked to them was that they felt they needed some time
to build up that capacity in the community. So they’ve got to go out and
develop, find providers, develop contracts, the providers may have to
build or renovate facilities, and they felt that that would take time
and so they wanted some time and certainty in, in this sort of
transition. So that’s, that’s how we ended up at, at, at the four year
period. Obviously there’s other ways you can do it though.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And when you get to the four year period in which these are completely
receipt supported, what was the rationale for continuing to be a state
institution when it is a service provider that’s fully supported outside
of state funds versus allowing the LME/MCOs to own or run the facilities
or to have a private entity on to run these facilities?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess my response would be that that’s certainly an option. The reason
why we didn’t discuss that option was we found the problem, really, to
be that these ADATCs are outside the community based system and so our
recommendation was to integrate them. Obviously who runs them or how
that works is another consideration but it wasn’t part of, part of our
recommendation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let’s ask Mr. Turcotte to make some comments.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chairman. I’m John Turcotte, director of the program
evaluation division. Logically, Senator Hise if you get to that point
where it is a receipt based system, then you could compare their cost
per patient day to other alternatives. Now, in this state we do, we do
not have a process of doing the appropriate analytics and planning for
outsource

  <p id="60:00">
  And so if the system were there, if the state had that system and it was
built in, there would be a way to easily decide who should be the
provider, a private sector for-profit provider, a non-profit provider or
some alternative to a state agency. The Federal government has this,
they call it the A76 process where when you get to the point where you
have a receipt-based system that is mechanically an output process and
what you do is you get the, an analysis called a most efficient
organization and then you get the government entity to propose can they
do that or you get alternatives from other providers, but right now the
state doesn’t do that. Everything is done ad hoc when you get there and
outsourcing decisions aren’t always made rationally. So you are correct
logically, but until the state of North Carolina gets that developed,
it’s going to be very difficult for any state agency to undergo that
kind of transition. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Richard. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Senator Pate, and Senator Hise, I appreciate your
conversation on that. I think part of the reason why we wanted the
longer period of time for transition and, again, the idea of creating
the right financial incentives are things that I think conceptually we
all agree with is that as a state agency and running this safety net
program, remember it is that for so many citizens across the state, we
operate in a different environment. We operate in an environment, you
know, in state employees that are, it’s a difficult system. We can’t
move in and out of the number of people that are available in terms of
state employees to provide those services. We have to have that
workforce ready. We don’t have the same business tools that a private
organization would have, but there are ways that we can run more
efficiently and respond to the market changes. That’s part of the reason
why we want this time, is because I think we can make a reasonably good
business case about how we manage it that way as an organization. Now,
obviously the future is up to the governor and you guys in terms of how
we go forward, but to try to do something in year one that begins to
take that money out that quickly, it is very difficult for a state
facility to respond that rapidly in terms of making those changes that
we need to make to address that, and that really is our view of how we
have to make this transition. Again, we’re committed to whatever comes
out of this process that we’re gonna make work, but there are some
difficulties in managing a receipt-based system this way, and just one
comment about the PBH issue is that the one difference in the way the
PBH worked is that that was a very small amount of money in terms of
system wide, so when you’re talking about the entire, almost the entire
receipts for those ADAC, it’s a little bit more difficult to manage it
that way. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members, I’d like to interject at this time.
We have to be out of this room, we have to adjourn in ten minutes’ time
so I’ve asked Mr. Richard if he will make his presentation, we’ll
reschedule that for another time. We still have five members who have
questions and I will go ahead and take those questions, but at ten
minutes of we’re going to have to gavel ourselves out of here. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Mr. Chair, choice. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Miss Jones. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I did just wanna point out that the bill does not include the
specific amount of the percentage reductions to the ADACs or the
reallocations to the LMEMCOs for each year of the transition period as
was recommended in the PED report. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Co-Chairman Tucker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. Yeah, I don’t know if time’s
gonna be adequate. First of all, question, Mr. Richards, did I
understand you to say that we did not have the tracking measures
required as far as evidence-based outcomes. I know we have, the young
lady next to you said as managing she talks about a 3% but we don’t have
tracking measures for long term outcomes for these people who go to the
ADACs currently? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tucker, what I would say is
that what we have is that we have systems that are two separate systems
essentially. They use a similar platform, but in the ADACs we have one
system and our community system’s different and what we haven’t been
able to do well yet, now there are some cases where we do do that follow
along, but it is not consistent across everybody that goes to ADAC to
where we know exactly what happens long term when folks are in the
community or frankly what has

what we have to make correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Chair, a couple follow ups.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Okay, sir. Please make them timely.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I&#39;ll do my best. You&#39;re saying we&#39;re making a $46 million
dollar a year expenditure into ??, and we really don&#39;t know long
term how effective they are? Is that what you&#39;re saying?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I don&#39;t think I would say it that way, Senator. I think that we know
that the ?? has been effective. I think we recognize that treatment. I
think we have some individuals that we do follow longer. We have some
projects we&#39;ve done . . . What I would say to you is what we
don&#39;t have is data for everybody that&#39;s going through those ??
and what&#39;s happened to them once they&#39;re in a community.
That&#39;s what we have to get to.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Okay. Follow up. To get there on this, you know, its obvious that we
issues in efficiency, $3,500 or $4,000 versus $10,000 to $12,000 a
patient, if that&#39;s what I saw here. In much like the LMCO&#39;s when
we started out in 2011 there can be an evolution. I concur with Senator
Heist that we ought to put in year two that LME&#39;s have . . . The
LMCO&#39;s have skin in the game with cost, and they&#39;ll begin to
work together to make this evolve and to do what needs to be done. If we
do community based treatment more so, which works in my area. Mr.
Grimes, would there be a consideration for a closure of ?? because there
would not be a requirement for those beds because community based
outcomes are as good or better?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
In creating the incentive for the LMCO&#39;s to find the necessary level
of care for their individuals we expect there to be less demand for that
highest level of care, because right now all the incentives are to send
people to that highest level because its already paid for through the
??. I think we expect less demand for that highest level that&#39;s what
you&#39;ve seen in other states that have gone towards that fully
managed care integrated model. We don&#39;t know how much less demand
you&#39;ll see over time and what the impact would be on those
facilities. The way we try to address it, at least in the recommendation
that we made is that, I think its every February the LMCO&#39;s have to
report to the department, how much they anticipate using from that ?? in
upcoming fiscal year. We would expect then the department to plan on how
to best allocate those resource which could include consolidating
facilities, for example to meet that demand. We&#39;re trying to help
the LMCO&#39;s over time better establish what they think the demand are
for the various levels of care. Communicate that to the department, then
give the department some time, hopefully to then manage that reduction
in demand.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr.--
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Senator Tucker. Vice Chairman Pendleton.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Mr. Chairman, I just want to make a comment, is that okay, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
If you do it hurriedly, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I am very concerned about this. The general assembly since 1974 has
reeked havoc upon our mental health programs and our citizens, what
I&#39;m mainly talking about is closing so many inpatient site beds.
Look at the growth of our population and what the beds are. With the
mentality that so many people believe that just about everybody can be
treated in a community setting, but you have to stabilize those people
first. I served on the Wake med board for a long time, they are totally
clogged with people with psychiatric problems, they can&#39;t get them
into psych hospitals. So, what I&#39;m worried about is, hope to God
that you don&#39;t close any of these 196 beds, that&#39;s the last
thing we need is to close anything to do with these beds. That&#39;s an
average of two per county.

  Senator McKissick?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a, a couple of questions, and they’re for you Mr. Grimes. First
of all, this 3.7 level of care which is shown on exhibit 19 of the
number of people going to ADATCs at this time, what would you assume is
the percentage overall of that population that require that 3.7 level of
care? I’m trying to get some sense as to what percentage of that
population being served by ADATCs with 60%, 70%, 80%, would then be
served by this alternative community based alternative. Because it gets
down into the numbers as to what the true savings might amount to.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I wish we could give you an exact percentage. The ADATCs do not track
that data, and so we don’t know what percent are 3.1, 3.5, 3.7, 4.0. The
data is just not there. It’s not tracked systematically by the ATATCs.
If you are to look at the PBH model, you’re seeing a, a very large
percentage of those folks served in the community through PBH, but we
don’t know if that’s a representative example or not.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister chair, if I could?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Quickly, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It would appear to me that it’s a, a flawed, I mean I understand the
advantages in continuity of care, I understand the advantages of
treating the whole person, and I understand the advantages of community
based care, but I think the savings which are projected here may not
ever come to fruition if we don’t have some numbers that can be
disaggregated about the number of people that are going to ADATCs today
that can be served by this new model. I mean, it’s, I won’t call it a
fatal flaw, but it’s certainly a material and significant number that
needs to be able to be estimated to know if we are gonna get what we
hope to achieve, because you’re still saying the ADATCs will continue to
exist underneath this scenario that you have put before us today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I guess one, one point I’ll make is that under the current incentive
structure, the ADATCs, they have an incentive to, to fill up the beds
regardless of, of the particular level of care. So for example, if they,
if they started turning away everyone who had a low need, and those beds
went empty, that’s not gonna look good in terms of their capacity. So
the incentive structure in place is for them to fill, fill them up. I
don’t, I don’t think what we’re saying is there’s, there’s a net savings
for this. What we’re saying is if the LME/MCOs choose to treat those
individuals in a community rather than sending them to a ADATC, it
should be likely more efficient and so then you’re actually going to see
more treatment available, perhaps longer or more individuals served. So
the, the concern over reduced capacity at the ADATC, you’re actually
going to see more capacity in the community, and in fact, the LME/MCOs
have to spend that money on substance abuse treatment, so if they’re not
spending it at the ADATCs, they’re gonna be spending it in the
community. And when they do that we would actually expect them to be
able to serve more individuals rather than less.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
One last quick question, and it’ll be very quick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator McKissick? I’m sorry, I’ll have to, we have to move on. There
are two more questions from other members who have not had a chance to
speak yet, if you’ll yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I will, mister chair, but I simply ask in the future we try to apportion
time in a way that members will have an equal opportunity to ask
questions as opposed to simply the cochairs, vice chairs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Noted. Senator Robinson?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you mister chair, and I’ll make it quick. I first want to say that
I believe that this is a broken system, and I’ve had that opinion for a
long time in terms of knowing that people in communities are not getting
the treatment they need and not having real outcome measures in terms of
where the services ought to be, in terms of transitioning people down.
My question, real quick, is what do you consider a capacity

  <p id="75:00">
  In terms of community bays capacity right now if we are, allowed the
LME/MCOs to begin to use community bays to provide services for the
individuals as we transition down. I guess I’m making an assumption that
y’all are gonna support this, but what do you consider current capacity?
I know some of those facilities earlier were closed. What is capacity at
this point in terms of being able to provide services within community
bay services?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think the capacity is, varies depending on what level of care we’re
talking about. One of the things we pointed out in the report is we’re
not seeing a lot of capacity at that residential level of treatment, and
that’s the next lower level than in ADATCs and again, we think we’re
seeing more folks go to the ADATC because of that capacity at the
residential level is not adequate in the community. So for example, we
pointed out in the report there’s at least a few LME/MCOs that, that
don’t have any providers at that 3.7 level. And we don’t think we’re
gonna see them develop any of those providers until we change the
incentive structure by bringing the ADATCs into the manage care system,
because right now, the LME/MCO has a limited pot of resources, and as
long as they can send that person to the ADATC, they don’t have to pay
for it and they can use that money to treat other people at a lower
level. So by bringing all of this under the LME/MCO, we think we’re
gonna see them making more integrated decisions on how to build out
capacity throughout the levels of care.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members, it’s time for us to adjourn. I’d like to thank the, all of the
presenters. Mr. Richard, thank you very much for agreeing to reschedule
your remarks. This meeting is adjourned.
