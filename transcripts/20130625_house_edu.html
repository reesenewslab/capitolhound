many times they will bring somebody from home campus but I know at
Cherokee they have developed a proficiency exam testing to get to that
higher level so this will encourage each of the constituent universities
to have the same type of policy, the same as UNC Ashville has now,
languages that are not taught on campus.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Follow-up
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Just to clarify so other campuses in the UNC system do have a
proficiency exam that if one passes they would get credit for it, they
don't necessary have to take the course on campus, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
This will be for Cherokee, Cherokee only.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I understand that.  I'm asking, do they do that for other languages
besides Cherokee?  Do you, is there a proficiency exam for Italian, is
there a proficiency exam for Spanish, is there a proficiency exam for
other languages besides Cherokee or are we setting new policy here on a
college campus.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Someone from the UNC system would have to address the 16 constituent
universities.  I don't know how many of them have a proficiency exam for
other languages for that university.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Just also to be clear, I was a linguist for a number of years.  I am
hugely supportive of foreign language teaching and foreign language
knowledge, something that I think Americans, we are very lacking in our
knowledge of other languages and therefore other cultures and other
history and not all the good stuff is written only in English so there
is really good stuff in lots of other languages and a wealth of
knowledge to be gained culturally, historically and technically by being
proficient in other languages so I encourage the sense of the bill, I am
just trying to determine are we setting new policies anywhere in the UNC
system or is a proficiency exam already in place for some language, any
language?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I would have to direct that question to either staff or the UNC system.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff, do you have an answer for us?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think so.  Yes, Representative ??, this is not precedent setting.  It
is done for other languages on other campuses.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's all I need to know. Thank you very much.  I strongly support the
bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative McManus.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, I was over here, far right.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Far right, there you are.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I especially want to thank you for this bill.  My grandparents were
both, and I am, an enrolled member of the Eastern Band.  My grandfather
was sent to a retraining school where they were punished for speaking
Cherokee and that is when the language began to die out and was almost
lost and so I greatly appreciate this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
When they were punished, their heads were shaved and they had to ?? so
our apologies.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My question has been answered.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No other questions?  Representative Warren?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madame Chair. I would like to make a motion for a favorable
report on Senate Bill 444.  I see no referral.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A motion has been made for Senate Bill 444. All those in favor will say
aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All those opposed nay.  The bill passes.  Thank you, Senator Brock.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madame Chair, Members of the Committee.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Our next bill is Senate Bill 337, North Carolina Public Charter School
Board.  I am not sure who is handling it, Senator Tillman is here,
Senator Tillman, I have to have a motion from the.  Representative
Glazier moves to have proposed Committee Substitute for Senate Bill 337

is to hear those and see those and the PCS I will maybe ask staff to run
through that in a minute I'll give you a little bit of editorial comment
as to the background of this bill. Sen. Stevens and I wrote the original
charter school bill 5 or 6 years ago. We worked on it for a long time
and out of that all we got was &quot;raise the cap&quot;. Alright, we're
going to raise the cap. Now we need a comprehensive charter school bill,
and basically that's what we have after many years of work. And it 's
brought us to this point. I would ask that staff, if they would like to
brief us on the PCS which has changed from the bill that was sent over
here.
Madam Chairman, if you would.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. I'm not sure. Cara or Drupti, which one's handling it? Cara?
Cara McCraw.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The PCS, one of the largest changes that's made is that it replaces the
public school- charter school's board which would have been in charge of
the charter school process, with the North Carolina charter school's
advisory board, which will advise the state board of education on its
decisions regarding charter schools. It also removes the fee for charter
school applications, it removes- it makes provisions to changes to the
admissions criteria for charter schools, and the types of things that
charter schools can consider when they give priority admission to some
students. It removes changes regarding the return of net assets
purchased with public funds to the general funds upon disclosure of the
charter school. It would remain as it is in current law where it returns
to the LEA, it removes a bid process wherein the board would have
allowed companies to bid to take over failing charter school. That
provision has been removed. It makes changes to the transfer of local
funds from LEAs to charter schools in terms of the accounting process,
some interest requirements and a provision regarding certification of
ADM. It makes changes to the licensure requirements for elementary grade
teachers in charter schools. Senate bill 337 had removed the licensure
requirements, and this bill restores those but makes the elementary
school's consistent with middle and high schools so that they all have
the same standard.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Tillman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm gonna be calling you Sen ?? again, I'm Rep. TIllman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm sorry, I'm terribly sorry Senator.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No, no, you've elevated me. Thank you Madam Chairman.
Before we proceed with any of the details of the bill, I would like to
hear the amendments. Some have been discussed with me, and there may be
one or two that I'm not familiar with, so could we have that at this
time, Madam Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Certainly.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair? Madam Chair? Over here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm wondering if there are members of the public that wish to speak, and
if we could hear them before the amendments?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have one, but I thought they might prefer to be heard after the
amendments so they would know whether they need to speak.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I only have 1 signed up to speak today, and that is a Matt Ellenwood.
Someone what else might like to speak.
Rep. Jeter has an amendment, and it is ATC-88 version 1. Rep. Jeter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair. I believe the amendment's been passed out, I
actually believe the amendment at the desk list is Rep. Hardister.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We do not have the amendment ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The name on it still says &quot;Hardister&quot;. It is
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It says Hardister, but it has been crossed through and it has Jeter.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The copies that I don't believe do unfortunately.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, if you will look at the number it is ATC-88 version 1.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Everybody good?
Thank you Madam Chair. This bill simply allows flexibility instead of
giving a definitive date end of Feb. 15th, it allows for a date
established by the office of charter schools for receipt of applications
in the prior year. So it gives flexibility as opposed to having a date
certain in this bill, to allow the date to be changed with the creation
of this board. And I would commend the amendment to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's an excellent amendment, they are the ones that should be setting
that date, and that makes a lot of sense. Good amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Bumgardner?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Move that we adopt this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Motion has been made. Do we have any other questions?
Motion has been made to adopt the amendment entered by Rep. Jeter. All
those in favor will say &quot;aye&quot;.

Aye.

The ayes have it and Representative Jeters amendment has passed. Our
next amendment is ATC 85 hardister amendment 2, does everyone have that
amendment?Thats ATC 85 Version 6 that has a 2 on the copy. Does everyone
have it? Representative Hardister
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you madame speaker, This amendment basically if
you look at the PCS before you youll see that the charter school
advisory board is composed in such a way that the governor has 5
appointees, the house and the senate each have 2 and then the state
board of education would appoint a member to serve on the board and the
lieutinant governor or designee would also serve on the board. Whatthis
amendment would do is change it so that the governor would have 3
appointees,the House and the senate would have 3 appointees. And so the
3 from the house 3 from the senate 3 from the governor that would
balance it out. Still the state board of education would appoint a
member, and then the lieutinant governor or designee would serve opn the
board so it would be a 11 member board, so the governor would appoint 3
members but out of those 3 the governor would designate a chair and vice
chair. I think this would just bbring more balance to how the board is
configured and i appreciate your support
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Do we have any questions on this amendment
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Madame chairman
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Tillman
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I like the amendment, i like one part of it that was on
the original bill that it would be 3 3 and 3, because of there advisory
and nature i dont think anyone should have a supr majority on therre,
because these people are advising the state board that6 has all the
power. I would also like to see that group select there own chairman and
vice chairman, out of there group, rather than that be appointed. I
think they feel they need a little independence, and that severs the tie
from the governors office and i have no problem with the governor
getting his way on most things which he certainly does, and that i do
quiver with a little bit. I could take it as it is and we may decide not
to concur and talk about that, its not a huge issue with me but i do
have a problem with that part of it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Do we have any questions? Do we have a motion?
Representative Bumgardner moves for Representative Hardister's
ammendment all of those in favor will say aye, all those opposed no, The
ayes have it amendment passes.Our next amendment it has a 3 in the right
hand corner. Its ATC 84, and its representative Elmore's amendment.
Representative Elmore
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you madame chairman. What this amendment deals
with is the accounting changes that were made in the bill with the
accounting and deflicting of the money to the charter school an back
dealing with the ADM adjustment. Basically what he amendment does, since
were making statitury changes to the transfer from the LEA to the
charter, this amendment would make the transfer back from the charter to
the LEA the exact same standard. So it ensures the money follows the
child either direction that it goes with it. I asked research about this
and they said that the practice from the money ncoming back form the
charter to the LEA was just accounting principles, so since we are
dealing with change in the statute money from LEA to the charter, i
think we need to do the same from charter back to the LEA
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Thank you representative Elmore. Representative Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I think this is fair, i helped put together this PCS
and symmetrical its fair, i support it
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator Tillman
[SPEAKER CHANGES]I just would ask a question on the flipping back and
then backl again, thats fair but is there a deadline for this flipping
to stop at some point
[SPEAKER CHANGES]yes in the amendment it givwes a 30- day period or if
an arrangement hs been made with the LEA
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Fair enough
[SPEAKER CHANGES]Representative Bumgardner moves to accept
representative Elmore's amendment. All those in favor say Aye, all those
opposed. The amendment passes. Again in the right hand corner number 4</p>

ARQ 40, Rep. Whitmire.
ARQ-40 version 1, Rep. Whitmire.
Rep. Stam, could you handle yours, that's amendment number 6, ATC-90
version 1, Rep. Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, this is a semi technical amendment, it's just a redundant sentence.
So we're just moving to take it out so there's one less sentence in the
statutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. TIllman? Do you have a response?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's fine, we major in redundancies around here, Rep. Stam, so I'm not
surprised you found one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I move the adoption of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A motion has been made for adoption of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Oh, I'm sorry Rep. Glazier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a question, I'm trying to read this and figure out, could you ask
staff to explain this one? I may be missing- It may be just a redundancy
but i'm just trying to find out exactly what it does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. Cara ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It strikes a sentence on page 1 that indicates the advisory board would
be located administratively within the Dept of Public Instruction.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up.
Follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
Is that- The first sentence creates the advisory board, but that second
sentence says &quot;where it's to lie,&quot; is that somewhere else in
the bill, so that that is stripping a redundancy, or is it stripping a
sentence about the location of the advisory board?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There is nowhere else within the statute that it specifies where the
advisory board would be located administratively.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Glazier.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My question then would be to Sen. Tillman. If this sentence is taken
out, where would the advisory board be located?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That's a good question, and Rep. Stam, I don't believe that's a
redundancy at all, I believe that is a material amendment because it's
not mentioned anywhere else where it would be located, and we know where
it is located, and the intention is for it to be located there.
Therefore, I don't like your amendment at all.
Madam Chair, I withdraw the amendment and study it and if we need to do
it on the floor, I will- I was possibly ill-advised.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The amendment has been withdrawn. Now I believe you should have Rep.
Whitmire's ARQ-40 version 1, amendment number 4. Does everyone have that
now? Rep Whitmire.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay, thank you Madam Chair.
What this amendment does, it goes back to the- in this one section where
Sen. Tillman sent it over to us. There's plenty of cases where you have
zip codes that may have a city school district in it and also a county
school district, or there may simply be times where children from one
county may be going to another charter school- or going to a charter
school in another county. As we realize that most of the time when
minutiae of determining which school system transfers the funds to a
charter, that review and that vetting that make sure it's accurate is
usually best done at the local level and not 	 at the state level. So
what ARQ-40 does is it puts that back at the local level, that's where
the original version of 337 that came our way was, and it also from an a
?? standpoint so government entities aren't necessarily charging each
others interest, it does that only if it's court ordered. So that's the
2 provisions there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Tillman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I think that it is best determined there the location of the students
and where they are attending done locally, I don't think the state is
that well equipped to do that, I may be wrong, but I don't see anyone
jumping up back there. And I like that the interest charge from one
entity to another would only be according to the amendment done if court
ordered. The history on that is some were getting late payments, and the
only way to assure payment was to put the interest in there. I'm not a
big fan of one entity of the government charging another one interest
from taxpayer money, so I'm okay with that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Stam.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, I'm trying to figure out- this amendment was not shared with the
managers of this before, and I'm trying to figure out what it does</p>

<p id="25:00">
??? If you would ask staff. Miss Chuhon or Miss McGraw to explain what
the actual difference is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Cara McGraw. Can you answer that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] If you look on page 13 of the PCS, which is where this
provision is, there is a sentence regarding necessary adjustments being
made within 30 days of certification of the charter school ADM. That
sentence is removed by the amendment. The next sentence is also removed
which immediately triggers interest if there is a failure to transfer in
a timely manner and that it would accrue from that date. In the
amendment, the interest provision is only if someone brings a legal
action that interest can be awarded but it would not be automatically
triggered by delay in the certification language is removed. That’s the
difference between the two.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Stam?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In that case I would oppose the amendment. It appears
to me to promote litigation. Interest isthe time value of money. That
is, if you don’t have money when you should have had it, you may have to
go out and borrow it. Conversely the party that owed it gets to keep
that money on interest for the time they haven’t given it to you. So the
only way the transferee can be made whole under this provision is to
file suit and it’s not interest from filing suit, it’s on the amendment.
Line 30-31 “From and after the date that any such amount should have
otherwise been paid”. So this is a lawyer’s relief act of 2013 to
require a lawsuit in order to get what you’re owed. I would oppose the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rebuttal? Representative Whitmire?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] With all due respect, I’ll simply say this. For
charter schools and traditional public schools to compete with each
other to raise the bar, the less consternation we create by statute the
more cooperative and the better that outcome will be. As far as
government entities charging interest on each other, you’re going to
have human error along the way at times. I know in my county, in working
with our charter school, which does a great job, I just don’t want that
relationship to have more things that cause dissent and we have seen
plenty of things over the years that have caused some dissent with items
such as this so I simply ask your support that we not have government
entities charging interest on each other. It just leads to
consternation.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]  Representative Cleveland.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chairman. I kind of go along with
Representative Stam on this. I cannot see putting anything in statute
that would encourage litigation, although we do that. I do believe the
original version requires interest to be paid, is a much better way to
go than have someone in a charter school think that the only way they’re
going to be made whole is to file litigation. So I’m going to have to
oppose this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Hardister.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chair. I agree with what
Representative Stam said. I understand and appreciate Representative
Whitmire bringing this forward but I have some concerns about it. I
think this is something we may need to work on a little bit more. At
this point in time I would recommend defeating this amendment and then
we can work on it a little bit more and see if we can find a proper way
to address this issue.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative would you like to answer? I have two
more I believe. Do you want the last word or do you want…?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Madam Chair, if I could go last. I have something that
might satisfy all.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madam Chair. I think that one of the issues
that over the years that we have tried to have is the cooperative
relationship between the traditional public school and the charter
schools. The whole idea of charging interest so that the charter school
can get a little bit more from the traditional public school seems
really running contrary to the notion of cooperation. I think this is a
good amendment because it makes clear…</p>

traditional public school in terms of making the necessary payment, as I
support Representative Whitmire's amendment and would encourage others
to do so.
[Speaker changes.] Senator Tillman, then Whitmire...then Representative
Whitmire.

in this bill, there is a loser pay clause, which we've not had here
before. I don't think that's gonna encourage a lot of lawsuits.

another amendment that hits on what I feel is certainly the larger of
the two issues in this amendment. If I were to pull this one and submit
a second one that relates to keepin' the determination of which system a
student came from in terms of transfers, would you allow me to run that?

for your amendment? That's ARQ-41, Version 1.
[Speaker changes.] Thank you, Madame Chair..and basically, since the
interest seem to be causing some dissent, what this does, goes back to
the first part of what I said earlier. If you have, and we have multiple
situations to where you have a student that transfers and there's...the
determination is that they came from one LEA when, in reality, they came
from another...to resolve that situation, it's best done at the local
level where the local level knows their students and not to where you
would have to depend on the state level to resolve this...what's
essentially minutiae but it does boil down to transferring the funds
properly and makin' sure it comes from the proper LEA and not the wrong
one.  And again, the example I used is take a city and a county school
system that have boundaries that actually have the same zip code, but
the boundary runs through the middle of the zip code.  It is extremely
easy, with the best of intentions/human error, to assign that student's
transfer to the wrong LEA. And this just simply says, don't put it at
the state level, put it at the local level.
[Speaker changes.] Do we have any questions on Representative Whitmire's
amendment?  If not, Senator Tillman?
[Speaker changes.] I'd ask staff to give me their interpretation of this
if they would.  See if it goes any beyond what Representative Whitmire
has described.
[Speaker changes.] I recognize Cara McGraw???????? And she's moving very
rapidly.
[Speaker changes.] Representative Whitemire is correct...it takes out
the piece that....</p>

speak to it, it would leave that up to the local LEAs in the charters to
determine the correct population counts.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Tillman? Do I have a motion?
Rep. Glazier moves the adoption of Rep. Whitmire's amendment, ARQ-41,
all those in favor say &quot;Aye&quot;.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All those opposed, &quot;nay&quot;? The &quot;Aye&quot;s have it.
Rep. Whitmire, you have displaced amendment, would you like to have that
pulled?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma'am, thank you Madam Chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Glazier has an amendment, ATC-89, version 2, is that the correct
one?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is, thank you Madam Chair, and it says Rep. Whitmire, but I'm running
this one.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
This actually I think has already been agreed to with Sen. Tillman. It
adds to the section D on that same page, simply adds that prior to
commencing any action, that there be 15 days notice to the other party
so that if it can be worked out prior to the lawsuit, it would be, and
if it can't be than the suit goes forward. So this is the 15 day notice
provision, and my understanding was there was no objection to this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chairman?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Tillman.
That amendment is ?? think it will bring the healing process a little
more along with what we're hoping for, and that they will have a 15 day
period to sit down and discuss any grievance before a lawsuit is filed.
A very good amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do I have anyone who moves for an adoption?
Rep. Gill moves for the adoption of Sen. Glazier's amendment, ATC-89,
all those in favor will say &quot;aye&quot;.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All those opposed will say no?
The &quot;aye&quot;s have it. And Rep. Glazier's amendment has passed.
Rep. Glazier has another amendment, ATC-87 version 2, amendment number
7.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair.
This is the other amendment, and what this does is try to put the
constancy between under 115C 332 exactly the language we have for public
schools. It doesn't change anything in the background check language
that's in the substantively in the bill, what it does say is there won't
be any liability for negligence on the part of the state or the charter,
but the immunity we're giving them doesn't extend to wanton or
intentional misconduct or gross negligence, which is the standard we use
across the board. So that it's clear that we're granting them immunity
from negligence but we're not granting them immunity from intentional
misconduct or gross negligence, which is the standard we operate under
in all public schools, and this really comes into play in where I think
it's important is when we have sexual abuse lawsuits and there's been
intentional wrongdoing. This allows that to proceed. And I would hope
there wouldn't be any opposition.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Stam, did you-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I was going to say, sounds like a pretty good amendment to me, and after
it's passed if you want to have a discussion I've got a motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have a mo- Is that a motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I have another motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
There's a motion to adopt Rep. Glazier's amendment, all in favor will
say &quot;aye.&quot;
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All those opposed will say &quot;no&quot;. The &quot;aye&quot;s have it,
and Rep. Glazier's amendment number 7 passes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam Chair?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Torbett.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For a motion on the PCS Madam Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
At the correct time, I have someone in the audience who wishes to speak.
Is there any other questions on the bill?
?? Matt Ellenwood?
State your name and who you're with.
Push &quot;mic&quot;. There you go.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair and members of the committee for the opportunity
to speak today. My name is Matt Ellenwood, I'm with the North Carolina
Justice Center, where I'm an education policy analyst and attorney. I've
had some involvement with the charter school approval and oversight
process, it's one of my responsibilities of my job to try to oversee
that and submit comments on ways to improve that. In the current charter
advisory council and the state board have been very accepting of those
comments and really of over the 16 years that they've been administering
charter schools have accepted a lot of outside input on how to improve
the system, and it's still an ongoing process, but has really come a
long way over those years. The Justice Center</p>

is this bill because it unnecessarily lowers certification standards for
teachers.  It potentially creates an unconstitutional board.  It
diminishes the charter school approval oversight and approval process
and it hampers cooperation process between charter schools and
traditional public schools.  In terms of teacher certification, I saw
that the PCS, instead of getting rid of all certification requirements
completely, it lowers them just from, right now you need to have 75% of
your teachers from grades K-5 be certified, it lowers it to 50%.  I am
not sure what the reason is for that.  There is a recent study from Duke
University's ?? to show that North Carolina students who were taught by
uncertified teachers suffered significant learning losses when compared
with students who were taught by certified teachers.  Right now there is
no shortage of certified teachers.  Teachers as I said, can already be
uncertified; there is also a lateral entry process where teachers can
become certified while they are already teaching and the second reason
we oppose this bill is it creates an unconstitutional board.  I heard
numerous members mention earlier that they do not want to pass a bill
that is going to potentially create litigation and I believe this bill
does that.  Article 9, Section 5, of the Constitution gives the
authority to supervise and administer North Carolina public schools,
including charter schools to the State Board of Education.  Of course
there are practical reasons why the Constitution does this.  Some body
has to have responsibility for the entire public school system to make
sure all the different pieces fit together as one coherent ??. One of
the original reasons for creation of charter schools was to encourage
innovation and facilitate the sharing of best practices between charter
schools and traditional public schools and I believe the current setup
is a better way of doing that because it doesn't have that kind of
separation.  Finally, creating a new charter board that is separate from
the State Board would hamper the charter school approval and oversight
process.  Right now what you really want to do is make sure that the new
charter schools are put into places were they are needed where we are
not duplicating existing services.  We don't want to build a new a
charter school right in a spot where there is a planned public school
and have enrollment problems, have half empty schools.  In summary, we
oppose this bill.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you, Mr. ??  You have ?? a few questions here.  Senator Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
It is apparent from the last speaker he hasn't read the PCS.  How can an
advisory board be nonconstitutional, I would ask you.  And I would ask
you where you were in your organization when we started meeting in
January.  I don't need you to respond, sir.  I would say that you never
made an effort to join us from January up until the present day and you
are calling a bill unconstitutional that simply has an advisory board
and I'd say you need to read the PCS and see what the bill does.  And
you need to be familiar with the details of it because you are opposing
it without solid ground for your opposing, number 1.  We revised this
thing 23 different times since January with anybody and everybody that
wanted to be heard.  And we are at this point, after beginning about 8
years ago with the original Senate Bill 8, that's what brings us to the
table.  A lot of people want choice and choice is what makes the market
place work and what makes education work.  If you are trapped in a
school that don't work you got options  now.   You got public charter
schools that you may attend and that's as American as it gets.  Thank
you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative ??
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Madame Chair, Senator Tillman just made my point. The gentleman a moment
ago made the statement that there's an unconstitutional board in this
bill and that's just not the case.  This board is advisory.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Tine.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
My comments aren't on the speakers so.  What I did want to ask is sort
of a general policy question. My understanding is that charter schools
were created to try out new programs, to be more nimble, more flexible
and then take the lessons learned and bring them back to our K-12 system
and my question is, it seems like we are moving more and more towards a
separate system as opposed to one that feeds our K-12 and I wondered if
you had any comments in regard to that as an overall policy ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Senator Tillman
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Tine, yes, it is created to be so, to be innovative and
to share the ideas.  It is not created to clone the public schools
otherwise we wouldn't need the charter schools so we intentionally want
it to be different and we've intentionally made the rules more liberal
where they can try these new things and I think now with the advisory
board and the new board of</p>

Education, and you, Chairman. We will have a harmonious and wonderful
working relationship. I see that coming. You’ll see a change in the next
weeks and months and years ahead, I believe. Good question. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Representative Stam, did you wish to pass? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Pass. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Glazier. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well
just a couple quick comments. I came in at the old version and I think
there were a lot of issues. I think number one the negotiations that
have gone on and the amendments have made this a far better bill, and I
know that some of the Justice Center’s concerns have actually been
addressed in the amendments. I agree actually with Senator Tillman. I
think the PCS does not create an unconstitutional… There was an
unconstitutional or constitutional issue with the original board, but
there’s not, I don’t think, with the advisory board. Strikes me as the
right balance, and while I certainly don’t agree with everything in
here, I suspect nobody in the room agrees with every provision in here.
It is actually my intent to vote for the PCS. I was not going to vote
for the original bill, but I really do think the changes have been made
that make this what it’s supposed to be, an advisory process, and
actually a number of the amendments today I think help as well to make
sure that there’s some more accountability and some legitimacy to what
we’re doing. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Representative Glazier.
Representative Luebke. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. I have
a question first of all for Senator Tillman, and I agree that you have
tightened up this bill significantly since it passed your chamber. My
question now is when you reference the advisory board and that it shall
be located administratively within DPI, what kind of authority does the
state Board of Education have to for example rule against the advisory
board? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Tillman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Good
question, Representative Luebke. They have total authority. The only
authority… The state board of education has total authority to overrule
any recommendation, and that’s all they may make into policy, procedure
or anything else. But that’s the state board now has total power to
overrule anything that they may suggest. They’re only advisory. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] And where is that? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow-up? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Yes, follow-up. Thank you, Madam Chair. And where is that? I
hear you saying that. Where is that stated in the bill? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Not stated. If you’re advisory, you cannot make law, you cannot
make binding decisions. “Advisory” takes care of that. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Pittman. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chair. I often get accused of being a bit too blunt,
and I guess I’m going to live up to that accusation right now because I
object to this objection to teacher certification. A lot of the impetus
I think for having charter schools is because some parents who have the
real responsibility and authority for their children’s education are not
buying what a lot of the traditional public schools are selling, and I
know in the case at my family, the public school’s doing a lousy job
teaching my kids. My son, who is in the third grade, couldn’t read at a
first grade level. He couldn’t read as well in the third grade as I
could in the first grade because he was not taught phonics like I was,
and he was falling further and further behind, so we decided to home
school him. In the course of events we ended up homeschooling all three
of our kids because we weren’t buying what the public school was
selling, and neither my wife nor I were certified teachers. My wife did
mainly the teaching, and she only went to a community college and her
training was as a medical secretary, yet when she was through
homeschooling our three [AUDIO SKIPS] have a certified teacher, but they
were all Dean’s List in college, so certification doesn’t mean all that
much to me and I think that’s an objection that doesn’t carry any
weight, and I’m hopeful that having charter schools and home schools and
private schools, competition, will help the traditional public schools
improve what they’re doing, and I think this bill is along those lines
and so I’ll support it. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Carney.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’ll pass. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brandon.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Madam Chair. I just wanted to briefly make
a statement that the original bill I did have a lot of concerns with,
and I commend Senator Tillman and all of the bill sponsors for making
the effort to listen to all of the folks and make this a really, really,
really good bill that I intend to support, and at the appropriate time,
I’d like to make a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Torbett.</p>

has beat you to that, and I believe Rep. Jordan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair.
I just wanted to briefly address Rep. Luebke's question. Rep. Luebke, I
think if you'll look on page 2, line 33, section 8, &quot;gives the
powers and duties of the board&quot;, and the first 3 are to make
recommendations, and the fourth one is to do whatever else the state
board says. I think that should address your concerns.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And Rep. Luebke, you're next.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair for allowing me to comment on the bill in response
to Sen. Tillman's comments, and I appreciate them Senator. I'm going to
have to disagree with my friend Rep. Glazier. The advisory board that we
have in place works, and what this is doing now is strengthening the
division between the traditional public schools and the charter schools.
I see no need for a separate board to be set up. I do appreciate that
it's under the authority of the Department of Public Education and the
State Board of Education, but what we have done here, and we are doing
in this bill, is strengthening the advisory board in a way that to me is
unnecessary. It makes a statement that the charter schools are on equal
footing with the traditional public schools. That does not fit with the
experience of 90% of the children in North Carolina in terms of where
they are educated right now, and I do believe that the establishment of
this separate advisory board strengthens the position of the charter
schools unnecessarily. What we have now works, and I am going to oppose
the bill and urge others to do so. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Shepard, then Rep. Michaux, and then Sen. Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chair.
A question for the bill sponsor. Sen. Tillman, right over here. Is it
not true that most high schools, elementary schools, and middle schools
in the state of North Carolina already have advisory boards in each and
every one of those schools that give advice and on policy and so forth
to the county school boards and LEAs?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
You're right as rain in August Representative.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Michaux?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, Sen. Tillman, over to your right, you know the man.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Alright.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I'm on the right.
My question to you is, and you know I have a problem with it so we're
going to go into that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If you do, then I would be worried.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
My problem is I'm seeing a lot of charter schools pop up in communities
all across the state, if I can say it very politely, on a segregated
basis. You have black charter schools, you have white charter schools,
each one of them all of them have some tokenism in them. Is there
anything in your bill that speaks to diversity in those charter schools
and that the board should advise on those charter schools in terms of
diversity?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Tillman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Michaux, good question. I believe there is some reference to that
in the bill, staff?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Karen McGraw?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Maybe not, but I think so.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Those provisions are still in and were not changed in any way. It does
look like if you look on page 10 of the bill, there was a reorganization
of that section in order to make it more clear, it was just a  technical
reorganization to the language, moved, and it is underlined, but it is
precisely the same language as before. If you look on page 11, you can
see where that language was struck out, and simply moved up on to page
10. So it is the existing language, no other changes were made regarding
diversity.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sen. Tillman, do you have any other remarks?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If not, we'll take Rep. Torbett's motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Madam Chairman, alas.
I move that the House committee on education report out favorable to
Senate bill 337, proposed House committee substitute as amended,
enrolled to a new PCS.
