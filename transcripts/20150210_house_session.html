  Would you put your seat in the seat? [background noise] [bell dings]
[background noise continues] Members, will you please take your seats?
We&#39;re doing the picture first. [background noise] This is Doug
Chadwick, our photographer, and he&#39;s gonna give you some information
about our picture today and availability for those that you might&#39;ve
missed in the past. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. One thing, you might want to
clear a couple things off your desk, so if, you know, you don&#39;t have
to get carried away, but if you don&#39;t want your desks to look
cluttered, this would be a good time to do it. People ask me about
photographs from previous sessions. You can order photographs of
previous sessions as a part of the ordering process for this year&#39;s
photographs. You can order prints from previous sessions at the same
price, discounted price, as this year&#39;s photograph. Let&#39;s see,
the camera&#39;s about, how old is it? 95 years old now. It&#39;s gonna
take it about two minutes to make the whole sweep. You&#39;ll be in the
photograph for just about half a second sort of when the light is
blinding you, so if you can hold still and give us a big smile then,
that&#39;d be good. I think most of them members sort of cross their
hands on their desks, but however you wanna pose is up to you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] [??] Sitting down in the back, could [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, maybe the young people at the back of the room, you might wanna
stand up. We&#39;d be able to see you better if you&#39;re not sitting
in those benches. That&#39;s good, that&#39;s good. And the two people
in front of the door there, could you move in front of the white wall.
We&#39;ll be able to see you better. That&#39;s good. Yeah, that&#39;ll
work. Okay. [SPEAKER CHANGES] When we get up here and [??] [SPEAKER
CHANGES] They&#39;re moving some of them, okay, okay, and after I do the
picture with the film camera I&#39;ll put the digital camera up there
and shoot a second sweep with that just to have a backup. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, and of course you have to hold
real still when the camera is pointing at you and the light is blinding
you. You&#39;re only in it for about a half second. It&#39;s hard to
tell exactly which half second out of, it&#39;s gonna take almost two
minutes for the camera to do the complete sweep. Okay, do we have
everyone here? We&#39;re still? Oh, okay, okay, excellent. Good idea.
We&#39;re getting a little more symmetry here by filling up the left
hand side of the picture. Okay, and back a little bit further along the
wall there. Yeah, that&#39;ll work. Okay. Okay. Oop, one more. And, and
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, I think we want you back just a little bit.
Maybe one or, yeah. One, yeah, that, that&#39;ll work. That looks good
there. Yeah.

  <p id="05:00">
  Okay. And if the two gentlemen in front of the central doors there,
could we sort of have you in a symmetrical? Yeah, that looks good. Okay,
looks good. Everybody look this way, give us a big smile. It&#39;s gonna
take about two minutes to do the full sweep and we&#39;re starting to
roll now. And it looks good. Yup, okay. Everybody hold still. I better
get out of the way. The camera is built by a division of Kodak in the
winter of 1920/1921 I think, best I can tell by the serial numbers, and
it shoots a negative that is 10 inches high and six feet wide and so the
prints I make in my own darkroom are made with the negative in contact
with the paper. And I have to adjust the camera to go very slowly in
indoor settings, so. Seems to me it&#39;s not moving, but I think it
actually is. Looks good. 3/4 of the way through. Looks good. I better
get out of the way again. Just about done here. Okay, thank you very
much. Relax for a second and I&#39;ll switch cameras if I can reach it.
Okay. [background chatter] So from the 19th century into the 21st
century here. [background chatter continues] That looks good, okay,
everybody get that pose back again. Give us a big smile, look this way.
Oop. Looks good. Looks good, look this way. Looks good, look this way.
Okay, that looks good. Thank you very much. [Applause] [background

[silence] [gavel bangs] The House will come to order. Members please
take your seats. Visitors will retire from the chamber. The sergeant at
arms will close the doors. Members and visitors please silence all
electronic devices. Today&#39;s prayer will be offered by Representative
Pittman. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members and visitors I would ask you to stand during the prayer and also
to remain standing for the pledge of allegiance. [SPEAKER CHANGES] After
taking that light in my eyes I was looking around for Will Smith and
Tommy Lee Jones. Let us pray. Great God, our Father, it is good to be
able to call you Father for among other things it reminds us that we are
brothers and sisters. Lord, sometimes in this world we have a tendency
to forget that fact but we pray you would help us always to remember it
here in this room. Lord, we thank you that you have called each one of
us into your service and into the service of the people of the great
state of North Carolina. May we always remember that we are servants of
the people and not their masters, and Lord, may we always have their
rights and their best interest at heart in all that we do. Give us
strength this day, Lord, give us wisdom and show us what you would have
us to do for your people, your children. We pray in Jesus name, Amen.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Amen. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United
States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation,
under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Gentleman from Harnett, Representative Lewis is recognized for
a motion. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, the journal for February 9th
has been examined and found to be correct. I move that it be approved as

[SPEAKER CHANGES] House Bill 3, Representative McGrady, an act to amend
the North Carolina Constitution to prohibit condemnation of private
property except for public use, to provide for the payment of just
compensation with the right to a trial by jury in all compensation cases
and to make single and satisfactory changes. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The
gentleman from Henderson, Representative McGrady has the floor to debate
and because of an injury last night without objection the rule requiring
the member to stand will be waived. Is there objection? If there is
objection, you&#39;ll have to go deal with Representative McGrady. The
gentleman is recognized to debate the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Mr. Speaker, and for that indulgence. Members, this is the bill that
proposes a constitutional amendment to the North Carolina Constitution

  And requires just compensation to be determined by jury trial if
requested by any party. We had a very strong vote on the bill yesterday,
excuse me, at the end of last week with 111 members supporting the bill.
It&#39;s similar to the support the bill has received in the recent past
and to my knowledge nothing has changed since we debated it other than
the answer man in the Asheville paper, not always the paper that would
expectedly support this has come out and difinitively said that this
bill has nothing to do with fracking, so I would stop there and ask for
a vote to send this bill to the Senate? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Further
discussion, further debate? If not, the question before the house is the
passage of House Bill 3 on its third reading. All those, I believe the
question&#39;s been put, Representative Pittman, I&#39;m sorry I just
saw your light. The Chair will withdraw the question. For what purpose
does the gentleman from Cabarras, Representative Pittman rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] To offer an amendment or send forth an amendment. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman is recognized to send forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I believe it&#39;s coming up on the desk board now.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The clerk will read the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Pittman moves to amend the bill on page 1 lines 12 by
inserting the following between the periods and quotation mark. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] The gentleman from Cabarras has the floor to debate the
amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is basically a
pretty good bill and I have cosponsored it. I will support it
regardless, but I feel that it leaves a little bit lacking because it
does not make clear enough, I think, for our courts what our intent is
and so I wish to add this wording that public use does not include the
taking of property for thereafter conveying an interest in the property
to a 3rd party for economic development. This is what happened in the
Kilo case and I do feel that we need to be a bit more specific than the
bill currently is by placing this language in there to make sure that
the courts understand that it is our absolute intention that what
happened in Kilo will not happen in the state of North Carolina. So,
it&#39;s a good bill but this is just intended to improve it and make it
a little bit more clear on that fact and I appreciate your support for
the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman
from Wake, Speaker Pro Tempore Stam rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To debate
the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate
the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Speaker, members of the House,
reluctantly I ask you to defeat the amendment, oppose it because
it&#39;s not necessary. You&#39;ll recall and I&#39;ve got the
transcript here, this question was raised on second reading.
Representative Pittman, what assurance do we have that &quot;public use
will be understood not to include taking property for purpose of
conveyance to a 3rd party interest for economic development.&quot; And
my reply to him was this, &quot;Representative Pittman, thank you for
the question, and indeed in several drafts of that bill in many other
sessions that language was specifically added in. It&#39;s not here
because it&#39;s not necessary because if it&#39;s for private
development, by definition it&#39;s not for public use.&quot; I have two
objections. One is aesthetic and the other&#39;s practical, and by
aesthetic I mean it just doesn&#39;t fit. If you happen to have your
constitutions here, if you pull it out and if you go to the declaration
of rights which is article one, most of these fundamental rights are one
or two sentences. We don&#39;t want to just add an extra unnecessary
sentence to the declaration of rights just because we feel that we wanna
be repetitive. I have a relative. I won&#39;t name who he or she is or
the relationship who on a telephone call will first tell you what she
wants to tell you, then she&#39;ll tell you what she&#39;s telling you,
then she completes the call by telling you what she told you. You know
anybody like that? Well, aesthetically in a constitution we just
don&#39;t need to have a lot of stray words and in contrast to the
declaration of rights which are fundamental, there on Article 5 Section
14 we have product development financing, remember that, TIFS, and it
goes on for two whole pages and it has only been used once or twice,
usually for disastrous, with disastrous consequences if those of you all
from Roanoke Rapids might know what I&#39;m talking about, so it just
doesn&#39;t fit in a constitution

  constitution to add unnecessary words, but the second reason is
practical, and that is one of the statutes, not statutes, rules of
construction of constitutions and statutes is that the assembly did not
intend any words to be without effect. So if a a court is construing
this, they will construe that that second sentence means something
different than the first sentence, otherwise we wouldn&#39;t have added
it. Since the first sentence completely limits a taking by eminent
domain for those for a public use, what is the court going to do with
the second sentence? It&#39;s not going to think of it as an additional
restriction because it&#39;s already restricted. I&#39;m afraid that if
it&#39;s in there they&#39;ll say, &quot;Well that was really what this
whole thing was about,&quot; and only apply it to economic development
activities. That&#39;s the motivating factor behind this constitutional
amendment, the Kelo v. New London case, but it&#39;s not the only thing
it would cover. So I&#39;m afraid that, although Representative
Pittman&#39;s intent is exactly my intent, the effect of including it is
actually contrary to his own intent. I ask you to not agree to the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Rutherford, Representative
Hager, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, to see if Representative Stam will yield for a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Wake yield to the gentleman from Rutherford?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
He yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Representative Stam. If an entity of municipality decided
they needed 20 acres for a track of land, whatever, park or whatever,
and then through their due diligence, once they purchased the land and
went through the process, they decide they only needed ten acres and
they already own the 20 acres. Could they then, years down the road, one
year, two years, three years, take that other ten acres and convey it
for a private use?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hager, this was asked to Representative McGrady Thursday
and I&#39;ll give essentially the same answer but specifically to your
question. If the taking of the 20 was a ruse to get the ten acres for
the park and convey the other ten acres to a private party, a court will
see through that and stop it. If, in fact, it becomes surplus property
after the taking then this amendment will not stop that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
For what purpose does the gentleman from Henderson, Representative
McGrady, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman has the floor to debate the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I urge the body also, as Speaker Pro Tem has, to vote no on the
amendment but that isn&#39;t because I have any disagreement with my
colleague from Cabarrus regarding the intent here. Many of us are not
lawyers, I happen to be a recovering one, but the issue here is the
language that we put forward needs to not have more than it needs to
have. So if you look at the amendment that is stated, if you just had to
pull out three phrases, the first one would be &quot;public use,&quot;
the second one would be &quot;just compensation,&quot; and the third one
would be &quot;jury trial.&quot; Those are the three big pieces of what
this constitutional amendment does. I would say to my colleagues that
the amendment is, the strength of the amendment, actually, is its
brevity. One can actually read it and figure it out and by the reference
to public use we are explicitly not adopting the Kelo standard that was
established by the U.S. Supreme Court under the Federal Constitution. We
are setting a higher standard and my view is similar to the Speaker Pro
Tem in that if we add this additional language we are actually
potentially undercutting the constitutional amendment that we&#39;re
putting in place. Therefore, while I agree with the gentleman&#39;s
intent, our intent is exactly the same and my belief is that we&#39;ve
accomplished what needs to be accomplished by the language in the fairly
straightforward constitutional amendment that&#39;s in the bill. So I
urge

  No vote on the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the
gentleman from Mecklenberg, Representative Brawley rise? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I wondered if the gentleman from Wake, Representative Stam
would yield for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from
Wake yield to the gentleman from Mecklenberg? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you,
Representative. You&#39;ve introduced a bill like this on several other
occasions. How many times have you tried to do eminent domain. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Approximately 6-7 times and it&#39;s passed the House 4 times.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, would the gentleman accept a second question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman yield to a second question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would yield to a series of questions, yes. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I think I might wrap it up with this one. Not being an attorney
and having heard a lot of attorney talk, what I would like to ask you as
a simple businessman, is the bill better the way it is or would it be
better with the amendment at protecting property rights in North
Carolina. [SPEAKER CHANGES] As is. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] For what purpose does the gentleman from New Hanover,
Representative Catlin rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To see if Representative
Stam would yield for a question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman
from Wake yield to the gentleman from New Hanover? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you. With the
unamended bill, the original bill, would it also prevent new land use
restrictions that were not approved by the property owner? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Would you clarify if these are public land restrictions or
private land restrictions? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, let&#39;s just say
for an environment situation that the county wants to put a land use
restriction on you so that doesn&#39;t have to be remediated. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] It would not. Now, there is, by its terms it would not. Now, if
the land use restriction was so onerous that there was no practical use
that could be made for it at all, then if the restriction essentially
kept it as a public use it would also not be prohibited, but with just
compensation should be paid, but that&#39;s rarely the case. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Thank you for answering my question. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what
purpose does the gentleman from Craven, Representative Speciale rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] To speak on the bill. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman
has the floor to debate the amendment. [SPEAKER CHANGES] I think that if
we&#39;re gonna deal with a constitutional amendment that we need to be
real serious about what we&#39;re doing and we need to make sure that it
does what it&#39;s intended to do, so I have a question for the bill
sponsor. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from, or for McGrady or
for Stam. [SPEAKER CHANGES] We&#39;ll go with Stam. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Wake yield to the gentleman from Craven?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
In as few words as possible, what exactly is the bill supposed to do.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] It&#39;s in two sentences. It&#39;s prohibiting the
taking of property by eminent domain, but not by the police power,
except for a public use as distinguished from public benefit, public
purpose, public interest. The second sentence doesn&#39;t change current
law. The first sentence probably doesn&#39;t change current law, but
makes it very clear. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Follow up. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does
the gentleman from Wake yield to a second question? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I
do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] How does it
distinguish it from public use as opposed to public benefit or necessity
or purpose? [SPEAKER CHANGES] Well, the way we do that is we of course
use the term public use, but because the court cases in North Carolina
over the last 100 years, and here I would refer to a memo by Dean Judith
Wedner a couple years ago who is the Dean at Chapel Hill Law school,
professor of real estate law, and she provided the lawyers on the
judiciary committee a memo on all these cases. They are confused,
conflicting, and all over the place in their terminology and in some
cases the would confuse public benefit and public use or public purpose.
Well, the way we deal with that because we wanna have a legislative
history that we are really trimming the purpose for which you can take
land by eminent domain to a public use, which has been defined yesterday
or Thursday, the way we do that is on the same piece of paper that you
vote on with the constitutional amendment you are also voting on some

  Statutory changes and in four places in Chapter 40A and that&#39;s where
this comes up, 40A is condemnation law by cities, counties, public
utilities, where it says for the public use or benefit we are striking
for benefit. That&#39;s how. [SPEAKER CHANGES] A follow up. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Wake yield to an additional question
from the gentleman from [??] [SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES] You&#39;re striking or benefit,
are you striking necessity or purpose or any other meaning or other
word? [SPEAKER CHANGES] No, because they&#39;re not there. We&#39;re
striking or benefit because that&#39;s what is in the current statutes
today as an authorization to the town of Newburn to condemn for the
public use or benefit. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Now many I speak on the bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] The gentleman has the floor to debate the bill, or to
debate the amendment, actually. [SPEAKER CHANGES] The amendment, sorry.
This is all very confusing, purpose, use, benefit, apparently it&#39;s
confusing to the courts as well because they keep changing it from one
thing to another, use and necessity, it went from use to necessity to
purpose to whatever and this is how we ended up with Kilo versus New
London. If we&#39;re gonna do an amendment, let&#39;s make it count.
Let&#39;s make it clear. I love the way you, he, my colleague spun the
benefits or the aesthetics about how this thing. I&#39;ve read it about
half a dozen times with his amendment and it sounds just fine, but you
know what? Even if it did sound a little awkward, does it get the job
done? Does it protect your property? Does it keep the state from taking
it in a situation like Kilo versus New London? The amendment will do
that. I objected to third reading the other day because I wanted to also
put in there compensation, explaining what it is, to make sure that this
amendment is worth its value and its effort, but it&#39;s a much more
complicated thing than it appears to be so it&#39;s gonna take some
work, but I&#39;d ask you all, okay, to vote for this amendment because
I think it clarifies what needs to be clarified in the minds of people
in this state. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] For what purpose does the
gentleman from Nash, Representative Collins rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To
see if Representative Stam would yield for a question? [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman from Wake yield to the gentleman from Nash? [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Stam, do you think it would make it any clearer that this
amendment is modifying the use of the term public use or just trying to
make clearer what that is rather than adding another conflicting
statement if the amendment were wrapped in parenthesis rather than just
left as it is. [SPEAKER CHANGES] No, legislative history is interesting.
There&#39;s a kinnard out there that North Carolina does not have
legislative history, but we do, and now that all the words that I&#39;m
saying and Representative Pittman said and you&#39;re saying are
recorded forever on the internet, this now becomes part of the
legislative history, so I think it&#39;s clear that the motivating
factor behind introducing the amendment was the situation that
Representative Pittman discussed, but the reason we don&#39;t want to
put it in parenthesis, or how would a court deal with that? The court
would have one choice between two things, either they&#39;re gonna say
that that second sentence expands the protection or it clarifies the
intent of the protection so that it only applies to economic development
situations, but that would be taking away from the protection, and I
can&#39;t, I cannot conceive or imagine a situation that would be
protected by his amendment that is not already protected by the first
sentence, because if it&#39;s a public use it&#39;s not being
transferred to a third party, for the purpose of being transferred to a
third party. So I think no matter how you put it in it would be possibly
dangerous. Probably not, but why take the chance? [SPEAKER CHANGES] For
what purpose does the gentleman from Rockingham, Representative Jones
rise? [SPEAKER CHANGES] To take my turn at offering a question to
Representative Stam. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Does the gentleman from Wake
yield to the gentleman from Rockingham? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I do. [SPEAKER

To a point of personal privilege.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, members of the House. I do a point of personal
privilege about once a session but this one deserves it. You just met
Michael and Christie Johnson and their family and their new daughter,
Nastia. The Cold War is a long time ago and Ukraine and the Crimea and
Russia are far away but Nastia is here for today with us, attending
Hopewell Academy, glad you all are here today as well. Coming through
the war zone in Eastern Ukraine, arriving here just on a day when her
VISA would otherwise expire to escape that situation, and at great
sacrifice, the Johnson, to great personal sacrifice, the Johnson family
did everything they could to get this girl out of danger and into a
loving family and I&#39;m just so appreciative that they did that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you all again for coming today. We&#39;re glad to have you with
us. I would ask the pages to please come to the front of the chamber.

pages are coming forward, for what purpose does the gentleman from
Guilford, Representative Johnson, rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Point of personal privilege.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the House, North Carolina lost a innovator, a man of vision,
a man of courage, in the passing of UNC Basketball Coach Dean Smith. Let
me just say, when he retired in 1997, he was the winningest basketball
coach in college basketball history, he had 879 wins. Let me also say
that his team, well let me back up, let me just say that he had two
national basketball championships, 13 NCC basketball championships, 11
Final Fours. He also coached the 1976 Olympic Team. I get kind of choked
up about this because Dean Smith meant a lot to not just the basketball
arena but he meant a whole lot about civil rights. Some people don&#39;t
realize that Dean Smith, back in 1964, integrated a restaurant. Not just
him, it was

  Self it was also, it was also a black UNC Bible, this is really tough
because he really meant a lot, not just about basketball cause it&#39;s
bigger than basketball. It was about civil rights. He integrated, he
helped integrate the UNC basketball team by bringing the first
basketball player to play at UNC who was Charlie Scott. He could&#39;ve
lost his job for that. Do you all realize that? He actually could&#39;ve
lost his job and we wouldn&#39;t be talking about Dean Smith, but he
endured, Charlie Scott endured being spit on, being ridiculed, and he
did all of this because of the color of his skin. That&#39;s all it was.
Over the 36 years he had no real superstars in his eyes, but we all know
who played at UNC, Greensboro&#39;s Bob Macadew and Michael Jordan. 96%
of his players graduated. He spoke out while others were silent.
There&#39;s a whole lot of folks that were silent back then. What I want
to know, and I&#39;m asking the gallery right now, how many other Dean
Smith&#39;s, Dean Smith minded people are out there in this gallery? How
many of us would&#39;ve had the courage to do what he did? To do
what&#39;s right for the citizens of North Carolina? Cause that&#39;s
what it&#39;s gonna take, it&#39;s gonna take courage. It&#39;s gonna
take someone to say hey, we&#39;re concerned about everybody, not just a
handful but everybody. Are we winning the hearts and minds of all the
citizens? That&#39;s my question. Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Members,
I think our pages are assembled now and so I would ask the clerk to
introduce the pages and pages when you hear your name called, please
step forward so the members can recognize you. [SPEAKER CHANGES] James
Berry III, Sara Lane Cochran, Tenisha Harris, Lydia Newman, Amanda
Patton, Kayla Ramos, Carrie Rough, and Megan Waites. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
