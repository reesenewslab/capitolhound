  Senate will come to order. Sergeant at Arms, close the doors. Members
will go to their seats. Members and guests in the gallery please silence
all electronic devices. Leading the Senate in prayer is the Reverand
Peter Milner, Senate Chaplain. All members and guests in the gallery
please stand.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Let&#39;s take a moment to pray. Lord, when we are faced with difficult
decisions and even disappointment, blue skies and warm air can sometimes
clear our minds but temporary change is actually not what we&#39;re
after. We know all too well our need to seek your wisdom and your
guidance that moves beyond circumstances, and so we stop right now and
we thank you for your wisdom and for your grace. Grace sometimes can
come in the wildest forms, Lord, and this week I have seen it in the
faces of the senate pages, their so wonderful, their so quiet, and I
thank you for them and I thank you for the legislative assistants that
work diligently around this building without praise. I thank you for
their quiet and overlooked service to this body. Lord, we need you to
come down into the minutiae of the details of this day. Even when
we&#39;re crushed beneath details and provoked by our powerlessness,
Lord, we reach out to you and we pray that you will use our dependency
to show or need for your plan. Give us, today, your wisdom to do what is
right, for your power is perfect, Lord, and our weakness surely reminds
us of our need to pray. And I pray in the name of Jesus, Amen.
