Set forth an amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein you send forth your amendment?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein moves to amend the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein is recognized to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President. The Senate. Charter schools do hold promise to
development innovation, create new ways of teaching, organizing schools.
And ideally having a partnership between charter schools, public schools
can improve all public education, whether it's a traditional school in
an LEA or a charter school and so there's much about charter schools and
charter school movement that I'm enthusiastic about. For them to hold
promise they really have to be a meaningful option for every kid., Right
now our LEA public school they're open to everybody and they have to
take whatever comes in, be that child disabled, be that child low
income, whether they come from a family that can provide food or have
transportation to get their child to school. And so, for a public
charter school to have real, for it to be a real option for every member
of the community, we have to be able to ensure that every kid that can
actually get to the school and when they're there they're not hungry.
And that's why we have public transportation for our public schools and
that's why we have free and reduced lunch in our public schools. What
I'm concerned about legislation without certain protections is that it
isn't a meaningful option for a very large segment of the community and
it's an easy problem to remedy. A very large number of existing charter
school s provide food and provide transportation today without a
requirement. The amendment I've sent forward simply says that within
three years of getting a charter a school has to provide transportation
for those who request it. Not every child will want transportation. And
if you are eligible for the free and reduced lunch, they have to provide
food. And that can either be, that can be in 1 of 4 ways. It can be
through a kitchen, which is probably the most expensive way. Or it can
be catered by a private company. It can have a contract with an existing
school to buy a certain number of meals each day that traditional public
schools will do that. Or they can provide a non-cooked meal. And again
it would only be for those kids o are of an income where they need that
tradition in order to learn. This wasn't how I originally structured
this amendment, worked extensively with Senator Tillman. In fact, if you
like the words, the reason you like them is because he wrote them. These
words were exactly how Senator Tillman asked me to draft this amendment.
I did that. And I hope that you all will support this amendment. Thank
you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President, to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman has the floor to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I did help Senator Stein write this amendment, and I'm not a very good
amendment writer, sir. I guess I should've gotten more help on this.
Senator you make some very good points. I think it will be an undue
burden on the charter schools at this time, many of them are just
getting started. To put this on them...most of them are providing
already service of meals, or bagged lunches and so forth, and for that
reason, I would ask you reluctantly, to vote against this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, for what purpose do you rise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To see if the bill's sponsor will yield to a question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman, do you yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes. Senator Stein, have your fun.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The amendment specifies that they need to do it in three years and if
they can't do it in three years they get an additional two years. So
every charter school has five years in order to get up to speed, even
though we want them to do it immediately, and as you said, most of them
are doing it now anyway. So, haven't we taken care of your concern that
it might be a burden on some of these newly started schools?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Stein, most schools, as I said, are doing it now, and if you put
this requirement on them parents are already selecting the charter
school based on the services that are available to the students that are
now available. And there's a waiting line in those schools, and they're
taking schools whether they have transportation or whether they have
lunch. They're opting to send their children there. And if you would
give me an example of someone that's been denied entrance to a charter
school, I would like to have that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator-

Senator Nesbitt or what purpose do you rise? [speaker changes]
To speak on the amendment [speaker changes]
Senator Nesbitt has the floor to speak on the amendment. [speaker
changes]
Thank you Mr. President, and Members of the Senate. Every time we get on
this billl,
the debate just really gets better and better, and we kind of get
further away from the basic problem that public schools face and that we
hope charter schools will help us solve. We have children who don't have
parents who can take them to school, who don't have parents that can
plan which school they're going to send them to. And if you're going to
have true diversity in these schools, you're going to have to make
allowances for that, where if a kid wants to attend a charter school,
and tries, but he can't get there, that we get him there. We do that in
every public school, here in Wade County with all these magnet  schools,
I'd assume they get them there. Somebody transports them to wherever
they decide to go. But for some reason, there's a roadblock to getting
these kids to a charter school, and the only conclusion one can draw is
that they do not want these disenfranchised children in their schools.
That's the net effect of what you're doing here. And to simply say that
if a child wants to go to a charter school, and he or she can't get
there, they ought to make arrangements to get them there, just like we
do in the public schools. This is not onerous. It gives them five years
to do it. If I were doing it, I'd say do it tomorrow. Five years. And
like I said, the conclusion has to be that we're going in one direction
with charter schools in terms of who we want in them, and another
direction in public schools where we accept all children. [speaker
changes]
Senator Hise, for what purpose do you rise? [Speaker changes]
To ask the amendment sponsor a question [speaker changes]
Senator Stein, do you yield ? [Speaker changes]
I do [Speaker changes]
Senator Stein, I have a charter school in my district that serves
children from four counties in the current area. As I read your bill,
and just trying to get you to clarify this, the charter school would
then be required to provide transportation within all four counties, to
all four students, something in excess of what any of those four LEAs
would have to do for their transportation plan? [Speaker changes]
The amendment reads, that on the transportation plan for someone who
lives in the LEA. So I am fine with an amendment that would limit it to
the county in which it's operated in, to the extent that there's any
confusion on that point. [Speaker changes]
Follow up [Speaker changes]
Senator do you yield? [speaker changes]
I do. [speaker changes]
Even if we limit to within that country, counties also create bussing
routes for individuals so they don't have to be transported all the way
across the county for school. And they'll actually select a district in
which they would attend school.  We're also saying, would we then even
be saying that charter schools would have to go above and beyond the
districts of the LEAs to provide for anyone else in those?  [Speaker
changes]
Not necessarily. The charter school can contract with the LEA to provide
transportation, and if there is a way some works - like my kids go from
a middle to a high school where they'll pick up more kids, and then
they'll go around the county- if they had an arrangement whereby the LEA
collected the kids and dumped them off at a high school, the charter
school could pick up the kids form the high school and transport them to
the school. Any of these problems are surmountable. It's just a matter
of will. That's why a majority of them do it today.  [speaker changes]
Speak to the amendment [speaker changes]
Senator Hise has the floor to speak to the amendment [speaker changes]
Thank you Mr. President, members of the body. Charter schools  are very
different. They don't represent defined areas, those little squares
where we carve the state up into 115 LEAs. I don't think the areas in
which children are willing to travel, where parents are willing to take
kids to make sure they get a good education, isn't subject to those
current limitations we put on. And I don't think any of this was
considered in drafting this amendment. I feel like this amendment is
just finding a way to penalize the uniqueness that the charter schools
are. And I would ask that you oppose it. [Speaker changes]
Is there any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question
for the Senate is the passage of amendment 4</p>

Senator Bryant moves to amend a bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Bryant has the floor to explain the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. President and members of the Senate. This amendment makes
four additions to the bill; it doesn't change anything in the bill; but
it makes four additions, which will provide for integrity, the
elimination of any conflicts of interest and accountability of the board
[?]. First change is on page one, lines 28 to 33, in the section on
qualifications of members. And it adds a preliminary paragraph that just
provides that no person shall be appointed to the charter board, if that
person or a member of that person's extended family, or a business owned
or managed by that person, or a member of that person's extended family
may incur a reasonably foreseeable financial benefit, from a decision of
the charter board. For purposes of this subsection, &quot;extended
family&quot; is defined as in the Ethics Statute in section 138. The
reason for this provision is because in the statement of economic
interest, which you have on your desk-- it's the long, legal-size
handout-- you will notice that the statement of economic interest in our
state ethics act, focuses on business being done with the state. It
doesn't focus on business being done with non-profit entities that are
funded by the state. And you can see, on the legal sheet you have, that
I've circled the four relevant questions on your statement of economic
interests-- they ask you about doing business with the state, or
receiving state funds; they talk about having a relationship with the
state board or employee entity, they talk about being on having yourself
or having a family member being on a governing board of an organization
with an interest before the board you're being appointed to. But it
doesn't ask you about your own financial benefit or interests in the
board you're being appointed to; and it also asks you about material
business dealings, or contracts with the state-- the provision being
added in qualification of members is &quot;No person should be appointed
to the board if that person, or a member of that person's family,
extended family, or a business owned or managed by that person, or a
member of that person's extended family may incur a reasonably
foreseeable financial benefit from a decision of that board.&quot;
The benefit we're concerned about for conflict of interest is the
financial benefit from dealing with charter schools, which are not state
entities, they are private entities. And so that would be the reason for
the need for that provision.</p>

<p id="30:00">
It's similar to the provision you added in the regulatory reform bill,
Senate bill 612.  In which you also have on your desk in section  138
8-15.  You added a provision that people appointed to advisory boards
could not be, had to disclose all reasonable foreseeable financial
benefits for matters under recommendation of that board and could not be
appointed if such financial benefit could be reasonably inferred, I'm
paraphrasing, to influence the member in being a member of that board.
Now the only reason you had to add that provision in Senate bill 612 is
because it's not covered in chapter 138, you added that provision to
chapter 138 specifically for advisory boards, but that provision would
not cover this charter school board. So I'm only pointing out that when
you create a board that's gonna regulate a private entity that we fund,
our general ethics provisions don't cover the financial interests in the
matter that's being regulated, which is why have these provisions in
several places in our, as it relates to boards.  So that's the first
edition.
The second edition is around accountability of the board in the terms of
accepting or giving out charters for the charter schools. It provides
measurable standards for it says the board shall create standards for
giving charters to charter school. And it gives 7 areas ,standards to
focus on.  And you can see those 7 areas on page 2 of the amendment.
Measures of student achievement, academic growth, achievement gaps,
post-secondary readiness, attendance and recurring enrollment, financial
performance and sustainability, and compliance with all applicable laws.
 So a charter board shall include in the charter that it gives to a
charter school the standards or requirements they must meet in each of
these areas in order to get the charter and maintain their charter. So
that's the second edition.
The third edition is we just renumbered a section under the powers of
the charter board and made it.
The fourth edition adds to the factors that have to be considered when
charters, when your revising a charter, when a material revision is
submitted and the charter school would have to find in addition to all
the areas listed there, that the board of education of the local school
administrative unit has had an opportunity to be heard on any adverse
impact that proposed growth of the charter school would have on it. That
provision was already there in the statute, was eliminated in Senator
Tillman's bill, but I'm suggesting that if you are going to revise a
charter and allow growth that that's a reasonable thing to allow the
local board of education to be heard. It does not have to dictate the
result.
Those are really the three main changes. One conflict of interest, if
you are financially.  If you're in the business of managing or providing
services to charter schools or have a significant financial benefit from
charter schools we're asking, suggesting that it would be a conflict of
interest up front that should preclude you from being on this board. We
have plenty of strong charter school advocates and people who have been
involved in the founding of charter schools and operations of charter
schools who don't get that financial benefit. Then secondly, asking the
board to create standards when you issue the charter so the charter
schools know what they have to comply with to get the charter and
maintain it.  Then if you are going to increase their enrollment that
you just let the local board of education be heard.  Just those three
items. Thank you. I recommend the amendment to you
[speaker changes] Senator Tillman for what purpose do you rise?
[speaker changes] Mr. President, I think we just heard a new charter
bill if you want to run one that would be a start, that amendment it is
so bad I don't know where to start. Let's start with this, if you trust
the charter school board and you trust your state board of education,
we're putting different requirements on the charter board.  They are
already subject to the same SEI, same financial disclosures, same
everything. Therefore, and when they're taking public dollars they are
not a private entity anymore,  Senator Brian, that makes them a public
entity. They're taking ADM money based on the headcount just like every
body else.   You're setting a different standard</p>

The bill in two particular places the first thing that it does I gotta
tell you over the past few weeks you have made believers out of me and
if we have one governmental entity giving up a resource or an asset and
that governmental entity would like to give it up for it’s fair market
value. So, the first part of this amendment we see that on page 5 that
basically a Charter school could request to the local board of education
a building and the local board would have to rent it two at least two
the Charter school but it would do it for it’s fair market value, excuse
me. The second thing that the bill does on page 11 we have a provision
in the current bill that says if any of the assets that remain from a
dissolved or closed Charter school would go back to the state if it
received any public funds for it. Since these Charter schools within the
counties the second amendment simply or the second part of this
amendment simply says that the assets that were purchased by public
funds will go back to the local school administrative unit as opposed to
coming to other state. I move the adoption of the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman for what purpose you ask?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Tillman has the floor to speak on the amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Blue we are talking about public schools to public schools you
have a building sitting over there in Wake County and let’s don’t use
Wake, they probably don’t have an empty building, well let’s use other
county, you got an empty building sitting there and you don’t have any
use for it and it’s testing your LEA between minimum of 15 up to 50 to a
$100,000 a year to maintain that with utilities, custodial services
knowing ___[02:05]. Now, that’s tax paid dollars started to bloom that’s
tax paid dollars going from an empty building and if your Charter makes
an offer to your LEA in good faith, we wanna lease that building from
you, we are not telling what the lease price is, we are saying
negotiating and if you don’t need, if the Charter does not like what the
terms are and down here Senator Goolsby you have got one ___[02:32] for
70 or $80,000 a year on a building that’s costing them about that much
tax paid dollars it would go to a good use then it will be maintained
well equipped and custodial service paid for the Charter schools. It
seems like to me that’s a reasonable approach, very reasonable.
Therefore, if they can see an agreement fund we are set to price and
secondly if the Charter does not agree with it and in the case they are
trying to hold them up for Ransom then make appeal to the County
Commissioner and they have the final ___[03:05] and they will settle it
and that’s it. So, therefore, I have got several needs for your
amendment I would like that particularly and I would vote against the
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion or debate? Hearing none, the question for the
Senate is the passage of amendment 7, all in favor will vote aye, all
oppose will vote no, five seconds will be allowed for the voting the
clerk will record the vote. 17 having voted in the affirmative and 32 in
the negative, amendment 7 fail, the bill as amended is back before the
body. Senator Robinson what purpose you ask?

Thank you Mr. President and to members of the body if you were a part of

education for all of our kids and what I hear from the bill sponsor and
from a lot of you, you intent for Charter schools to be an alternative
to make sure that children who are not achieving and the traditional
public school had an opportunity to go to a Charter with their
flexibility but also where they can receive individualizing instruction
etcetera that will help them to perform. One of the pieces that are
critical to high performance is quality teachers but teachers who have a
Bachelor Degree and who are licensed as well to teach. Now, there has

Representative: Thank you Mr. President. Ladies and gentleman of the
senate, I was very privileged to participate in an event yesterday
organized by part of the government security detail, that would be Bryan
Lane. As many of you may remember, last fall, we had a state trooper
that lost his life. His name was Bobby Jean Demuth Jr., and his watch
was Saturday, September 8, 2012. Let me tell you a little bit about
Bobby. He was 42 years old. He had been in the patrol for 12 years. He
was a veteran of the U.S. Marines. His cause of death was a vehicular
assault. The weapon was an automobile and the suspect was charged with
murder. Trooper Jean Demuth was just doing his job when he was struck
and killed by an automobile being driven by an impaired driver, who was
fleeing from Raleigh police who were attempting to arrest him on two
charges, including two counts of kidnapping. Demuth was struck by the
subject’s vehicle as he was attempting to ploy spike strips. After
hitting Demuth, the subject continued to flee but was later taken into
custody after he crashed into a guard rail. The dash camera in a deputy
sheriff’s car shows that the suspect intentionally swerved to hit
Demuth. The forty year old suspect who was admitted to Nash General
Hospital with non threatening life injuries, was later transferred to
central prison in Raleigh, where he was held under a $2 million bond. I
n addition to charges stemming from the incident, he was also charged
with felony murder, driving while impaired, and speeding to elude
arrest. Trooper Demuth has served NC patrol fro 12 years was assigned to
Rocky Mount Troop C, District 1, highway patrol office, at the time of
his murder. He also served his country as a U.S. Marine from 1988-1992.
He began his law enforcement career in 199f as a deputy with the
Wilson’s sheriff office until moving over to the Edgecomb’s sheriff
office. Before joining the patrol, he was an officer with the NC motor
vehicle division enforcement section. When Trooper Demuth was murdered,
a wife lost her husband, an 8 year old boy lost his father, and a mother
lost his son, and an entire nation lost a hero. I was privileged to be
part of that ceremony. Our lieutenant governor was there and he spoke,
in addition to Secretary Shanahan. The event was a bicycle ride. We rode
about 64 miles, into the wind the whole way, and then rained for about
30 miles, but it was a great cause. We were met by many cheering people,
