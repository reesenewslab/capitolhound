if you have a farm that's been in operation for more than a year, it was
not a nuisance at the time it began,  and you fundamentally change your
operation, the one-year timer in which you can be sued under the
nuisance laws restarts. Under the Durham v. ? case, it's cited in the
summary. This PCS would make it so that the changes between lines 22 and
26 don't reset the clock.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Wilkins --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chair. This may be for staff as well.
What's the acid, I'm looking at line 23, what's the acid test for
non-permanent cessation? How long's it going to take to determine that?
I lost something. How long's it going to take to determine that?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Chris?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is not a defined term. It's not defined in the
statute. A court would have to decide. I think it would probably be
interpreted not in a matter of years, more like matter of months. But
it's really for a court to decide.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] In my understanding, Rep. Wilkins, under, and this is
a somewhat distinctive law, but under a lot of zoning law and other law
in our state, you have non-conforming use, and if it remains out of
operation for six months or more, then you lose that non-conforming use
designation, so that's what I would, and while that might not be binding
on a court, that's a similar thought. You know, if you had a chicken
farm and then you close that chicken farm down and then three months
later start a dairy farm, I would contend that's not a non-permanent
cessation or interruption of farming. But I think staff's right. It's
ultimately a factual question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. G. Graham --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. Chairman, may I ask the speaker a question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You may ask a question, and no questions are stupid.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Some politician might think so, but not here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Thank you so much, sir. If you convert to a
chicken house and you don't have comprehensive land-use planning and you
have the property out and all of a sudden somebody comes out and builds
a couple of homes for maybe $150,000 or so, and it's next door to my
chicken or turkey operation, can I be ruled against in a case such as
that? Or does that property, if it ever had an agricultural use, that
that permanently prohibits it from being into a suit?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Graham, my viewpoint of this statute of this
proposed bill is that, and I think a reasonable critique of this bill,
would be that if someone was farming, and as you understand, most bona
fide farms are exempt from the local regulations under current state
law. So if I was growing row crops, and I decide to change from row
crops to a dairy farm, this bill would provide you some protection,
would provide the farmer protection, but I would remind you that it's a
rebuttable presumption, so the presumption can be overturned in court,
if you can, as a plaintiff, make that case. I mean that would be my
argument.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Rep. Starnes --
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think this is a wonderful
bill that's needed. In today's economy, with the changing face of
agriculture, farmers want to continue farming, but they find they have
to be diversified in their operations. So where they've been doing one
thing, they have to change into other things just to keep the farm
going. When you asked the question about the non-permanent cessation or
interruption of farming, probably a more accurate explanation to this
would be if you're [CUTS OFF]</p>

Representative: chicken business and your chicken house burnt down, and
it took you a year to get it rebuilt and get back into the chicken
business, they do not want you to say that you were out of farming for a
year. So this allows you to keep going. It is a good bill. Mr. Chairman
I move for a favorable report…
Speaker: Representative [xx], he wanted to do a motion. Is that okay?
Representative: I will be glad to. Staff, I want to make a comment. Just
to clarify, the rebuttable presumption language that was in the first
addition of the bill, it is not in the PCS, but at line 27, it does
provide that an agricultural operation will not be protected when the
[xx] results from the negligent operation of the agricultural forestry
operation.
Speaker: I apologize for misleading you. I am a day behind. You want to
speak behind Representative Lucas? I cannot see your name.
Representative Wells?
Representative: I have a question for staff. Just taking the other side
of this: if a developer wanted to buy a farm, is there anything in this
to keep him from buying a soybean farm next door, converting it to 5000
chickens, and then getting the farm at a better price?
Speaker: Staff?
Representative: The bill does not really affect that. That depends on
zoning ordinances.
Speaker: Representative Lucas, for the motion. This is the PCS and goes
to the judiciary.
Representative: Thank you MR. Chair. I make a motion for a favorable
report to the PCS, unfavorable to the original and to send the bill to
judiciary A.
Speaker: You have heard the motion. All those in favor, signify by
saying aye [aye]. All opposed, no [silence]. The ayes have it. Motion
carries. Thank you Representative Simms. Representative Presnow? House
bill 628, and this is a PCS. Somebody give me a motion for the PCS?
Representative Brisson makes a motion that we have the PCS. All in favor
say aye [aye]. All opposed, no [silence. The ayes have it. PCS is
enforced.
Representative: Okay, this is again, house bill 628. This is a jobs
bill. It supports NC products and said construction, and stops sending
our tax dollars out of the state. This bill actually creates a level
playing field in green building standards in state construction. I want
you to know that there are four governors in GA, AL, OR and ME, that
have already protected their local products and have addressed this
issue by executive order. Similarly, there are four other states, one
being AL, that are adopting legislation to protect their local products:
AL, MS, TN, and FL. My concern on this began when Madison County’s US
forest service was built using no NC wood products. They used wood from
Brazil for a bamboo floor. That is what began the whole thing. This bill
does not eliminate lead or any other national standard. It recognizes
all national environmental building rating systems, as long as they do
not discredit local, certified products. By encouraging lead standards
in public buildings, the general service administration favors a system
that gives preference to foreign timber in domestic building projects.
This market extortion takes place because leads credit based rating
system only recognizes timber certified by the forest stewardship
council as sustainable. Since 90% of the forest stewardship
certifications take place outside of the US and about ¾ of certified
forests in North America are certified in using programs other than the
FSC, the forest stewardship council and lead creates incentives for
builders to import foreign wood and also ignores the majority of high
quality wood within our own borders. Lead will award sourcing credits
for market access to the forest stewardship council certified wood from
Russia, Indonesia, Brazil, but not from the</p>

vast majority of North Carolina and American lumber. I ask Nancy
Thompson, do you want to say a few things?
Bob Schaffer ??
[speaker changes]
Identify yourself.
[speaker changes]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I'm Bob Schaffer. I'm the executive vice
president of the North Carolina Forestry Association based here in
Raleigh. North Carolina Forestry Association is the oldest conservation
organization in North Carolina. We promote the growing and harvesting of
the most precious natural resource, our forest. Our members grow and
harvest North Carolina timber under the most sustainable,
environmentally sensitive practices anywhere in the world. At the same
time, we produce goods, services, jobs, taxes, clean water, wildlife
habitat and recreation. House Bill, House Bill 628 is a great step in
recognizing the forestry business in North Carolina and what they
contribute to the state. That they should not be disadvantaged when
trying to supply lead certified projects. That the certification systems
we use are second to none. You will hear lead gives points towards
certification under regional, material credit. It gives more credit for
wood certified under its own certification scheme for its stewardship
council than any other certification scheme used in North Carolina. In
fact, wood under no certification scheme or system would get the same
credit as other forest service other than FSC. The message here is if
you do not certify by FSC, then you will not get as much credit. Ask one
of the owners of Lampe &amp; Malphrus which is a sawmill located in
Smithfield, North Carolina. Ross Lampe tried last year to get to supply
some of the pine lumber from his mill to a project to try on ??. They
were told the SFI certification lumber was not acceptable. Then the job
was supplied with loblolly pine trees  treated and processed in
Arkansas. US Green Building council will tell you they promote locally
harvested wood. They will also tell you that they promote reduced carbon
emissions using less energy and contribute to a healthier environment or
residents, workers and the larger community. However, I also know the
distance Smithfield and Newburn is slightly different than the distance
between Arkansas and Newburn. I'm sure they contributed to a healthier
environment for the certain residents, workers, and community in
Arkansas. I'm not here to talk about Arkansas. I'm here to talk about
North Carolina products.  Workers, jobs and taxes for North Carolina.
The amount of diesel fuel that it takes to bring a truck of lumber from
Arkansas versus Smithfield should speak for itself. There are 985,000
acres in North Carolina certified under SFI and there is another quarter
million certified under the American Tree Farm system.  Neither of which
are recognized by Lead. House Bill 628 does not disallow the use of
Lead. Rather, it invites lead to the table to discuss the various forest
certification systems that are in place. We have no quarrel with FSC. We
recognize FSC as a legitimate system to certify forests. We just do not
think it is ever good for any system to be a closed shop where only one
avenue for entry into the market is through one entity including Lead,
SFI, SFC or Tree Farm.  Thank you.
[speaker changes]
Thank you.

May I get Mike Carpenter from the North Carolina Homebuilder's
Association? While he's coming up, I will tell you that I had heard that
Commissioner Trotzer from Agriculture - Department of Agriculture-
supports this bill.

I'm Mike Carpenter, executive vice president of the North Carolina
Homebuilder's Association and I'll speak very briefly Mr. Chairman and
members of the committee. We are in support of this legislation for the
reasons Bob so eloquently expressed. Thank you.

I will also tell you, there is an amendment that I just put in. It is
for any construction and renovation projects that are currently in the
bidding process; those are exempt from the beginning of this.</p>

Mr chair did she say she's sending forth an amendment.
yes sir just now passing it out.
I didn't know she was sending forth an amendment.
Mr chairman an inquiry to the chair..over here Mr chairman.
I got you.
my inquiry is whether there's anyone here who would like to speak
against the bill.
is there anyone that wishes to speak against the bill in the audience
okay.
thank you Mr chairman.
thank you Mr chairman members of the committee my name is Will [??] I
represent new core steel corporation new core is one of the largest
steel manufacturers in this nation were headquartered in Charlotte we
have a large steel [??] county representative [??] district [??] roughly
450 people while very well intention-ed we believe house bill 628 would
have a negative impact on domestically manufactured steel any red
blooded North Carolinean would support promoting North Carolina lumber
but we believe this bill goes much further than that I would
respectfully disagree with the previous speaker I believe that this bill
would actually prohibit the state from seeking lead certification in new
publicly constructed projects currently domestic steel benefits greatly
from lead that's because most steel produced here in the united states
and here in North Carolina is made primarily from recycled content at
new core today over 99 percent recycled content and we've invested a
tremendous amount of time and resources to produce a product that can
help generate lead points for those that seek them it's actually right
now it's a big advantage that we have over competitors in China and
India as you can imagine it's difficult to compete with other countries
that don't play by the same set of rules we do but that's an argument
for a different day this is one advantage that we do have lead benefits
domestic steel we would certainly be supportive of some sort of study
[??] to look at how we can help lumber this is not a steel versus lumber
thing we coexist peacefully but taking away lead would hurt steel and we
just hope you can consider that when you vote on this bill.
thank you the amendment representative [??] you read.
no I've remember that this bill does not eliminate lead anything that
lead does and they want to use steel in it [??] I'm for it because
that's for North Carolina if you recall right down here under the I the
first I about the middle it says to achieve sustainable building
standards at a construction project may utilize internationally
recognized high performance environmental building rating system
provided that any such rating system does not use immaterial or product
based credit system this advantage in materials or products manufactured
or produced in this state so I think that that takes care of the steel.
you wanna send forth the amendment.
the amendment is this act is effective when it becomes law and applies
to construction and renovation projects for which the bidding process is
initiated on or after that date.
you've heard the amendment any discussion on the amendment okay now a
motion [??] the amendment all in favor say aye.
aye.
all opposed no..the ayes have the motion's carried representative Dixon
wishes to speak.
thank you Mr chair members of the committee this issue alone with other
issues that come forth in this general assembly we can speak many words
or we can speak a few words I'm gonna choose to speak a few words today
there have been people who have been repeatedly invited to the table for
the last 15 years to level the playing field for our forest tree
industry and our lumber people and our home builders in North Carolina
they have not accepted those invitations it is now time to level that
playing field with this excellent legislation to send a message that we
indeed are concerned about North Carolina jobs North Carolina products
I've had many discussions since our last meeting there is nothing in
here that destroys the competitive nature of any product in our state to
compete for our business.

…you to support this bill as it is in front of you today.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Bell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] For a motion at the appropriate time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Okay. Representative Waddell. Okay. Representative
McGrady.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] With all respect for the sponsor, my view is that the
language that is being proposed here would effectively disapprove the
use of LEADs standards in North Carolina. Basically the argument goes
that some, perhaps all of North Carolina forests aren’t certified by the
Forest Stewardship Council, that’s the FSC, and while this certification
currently earns points towards LEAD certification, you need to notice
that you also get points for local sourcing of wood. So LEADs gives you
some points for local sourcing of wood even if it’s not certified. LEAD
doesn’t explicitly recognize these other two certifications so if this
bill passes, it would effectively end LEADs in North Carolina. Now what
does that mean? A few years ago if that argument was made, it would mean
a lot. Right now the estimate in 2014 is that 40%-48% of new
non-residential construction will be green. That is $120-145 billion
dollar number. Two billion square feet of buildings are currently LEAD
certified as of June of last year. The green building market included
two percent of our non residential construction starts in 2005. It was
12% in 2008 and is 28%-35% in 2012. What I’m trying to tell you is this
market is huge and while the intention of this bill is really good and I
want to be there and I want to support North Carolina project products,
this is a very blunt instrument. So Mr. Chairman I send forth an
amendment. I believe you have it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, does everybody have a copy of Representative
McGrady’s bill?  You’ll know that it’s been fixed then pass it out.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] And if I could while it’s being passed out, I’ll speak
to it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] You can.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Saves some time. This is an amendment that turns the
bill into a study. It directs the state construction office and the
department administration deener to study the use of products and raw
materials manufactured, harvested, mined. It’s broader than just
forests. Then to report back both to the ERC and the joint legislative
commission non-government operations by March of next year. I think
that’s the more appropriate way to handle this and I urge support for my
amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Presnell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Remember that this bill does not eliminate LEAD or any
other national standard. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to please vote
no on this amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Mobley.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. I would ask you to support this
amendment in as much as NuCore is a huge employer in my area. I
certainly cannot vote to not approve the LEADS for them in particular.
It’s one of our larger employers and I think we should do the study in
order to see and make sure. If the amendment is not accepted then I
would certainly have to vote against the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Brisson.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Mr. Chair. I’ll speak in opposition of the
amendment. The bill actually is just promoting North Carolina products.
End of the line and spiny NC groves and just to tell you a little bit
what is going on with the commissioner of agriculture. In the last
couple of years, with using this program and promoting it, we have been

[SPEAKER] These are exports from $1 billion to $3 billion and stand a
chance to continue to move the growth of that. It does not denote steel
or any other building products. So, it’s just about North Carolina
grows. And I would ask you not to support this study amendment. I don’t
know why Representative Grady thinks that we would need the study when
we’re all trying to work with the Commissioner and the State of North
Carolina to put money in there North Carolina products. So I ask you to
oppose it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Luebke.
[SPEAKERS] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And actually, Representative
Brisson, there’s a quick answer to your question. Because when someone
from New Corps comes forward and says this is a problematic bill and New
Corps is a key part of our economy, particularly our northeastern North
Carolina economy, and says that it’s New Corps judgment that the leads
criteria for green sustainability cannot be met under Representative
Presnell’s bill and she thinks it does, well we’ve got a serious
disagreement.
And further though the bill has been sent to agriculture, in fact, as we
see this really affects much more than just agriculture narrowly
defined, it’s actually about our entire economy. So to me, we are really
doing a disservice to the whole issue of job creation and furtherance of
our North Carolina economy if we do not allow this issue to be studied.
I can see the perspective of Representative Presnell from the standpoint
of looking for North Carolina wood products. But the larger question is
what does this kind of legislation impact have on job creation within
the North Carolina economy?
And I think New Corps is saying, it’s a problem. And I think that there
is someone spewed from the Green Building Council. I know, Mr. Chairman,
you’re trying to move things along but there would be another person
that could talk to you about job loss if this bill passes.
For all these reasons, members, I think it’s a very good reason to
support the McGrady Study Amendment. Representative Molly is right on
target in terms of her own district. And I think we should all think in
those larger terms. So I would urge support for the McGrady Amendment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Jordan.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’m just interested we’re
going from forestry and woods and now manufacturing, mining, and
harvesting in this amendment. And I had an inquiry for the amendment
sponsor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative Gray.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I yield.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Are we currently working under a standard that
disadvantages North Carolina products and manufacturing?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No, the lead standard actually provides points. And
that’s what it is, a certification for things that are acquired close to
wherever it is it’s being build. And so, no, I don’t think we’re
operating in that sort of climate. Further responding, I really do think
the issue that Representative Presnell is raising is a bigger issue.
It’s not really just about forest products. And so in talking with the
Department, I really wanted to look at the broader set of issues, not
just forestry.</p>

Hey. Another question.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Okay. You’ve heard the motion. All in favor of the motion, on 628, raise
your hand. All opposed to 628. Votes 26 to 8 in favor. The bill passes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
House bill 623. 663…I can’t read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. This bill, the purpose and
rationale behind this bill is for farmers who produce a product in North
Carolina. Initially, the earlier discussion it was going to be much
broader. It’s limited to raw agriculture commodities. There’s a
definition on line 17-19 of what raw agriculture commodities may be. The
argument is when a farmer produces that product it’s accepted by a
wholesaler or retailer. The farmer should have, and they produce that
product in accordance with standards developed by the USDA, which is
called a gap process. There is protection of liability for that farmer,
to from liability unless in line 14 there is gross negligence,
recklessness, or intentional misconduct on the part of the commodity
producer. As I stated earlier, in another bill. We had a dairy farm. We
do not produce raw agricultural commodity. This does not apply to
anything that we produce on our farm. There is a senate bill. It’s not
necessarily a companion bill, but similar language. It’s Senate bill
649. I would ask you to recommend this bill for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Chair, I make a motion to do. The PCS be enforced.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
All in favor of PCS be enforced say aye, all opposed no. Okay. (??)
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chair. I don’t know. It says commodity producer. A
producer approves fruits and vegetable and other agricultural products.
What is agricultural products?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Rep. Daughtry I don’t think we have a definition in this bill of
agricultural products. We do have what raw agricultural commodity is. I
think maybe there should be some clarification there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up question? If you’re raising chicken or hawks, are they
agricultural products or no?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Staff has that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mr. Chairman. The term commodity producer is defined in the
first addition. It defines commodity producer as producer of fruits,
vegetables, or other agricultural products. In the PCS, it says
commodity producer is a producer of raw agricultural commodities which
is defined in line 17-19.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just says fruits, vegetables, or other agricultural products. The
question I had is what is other agricultural products? I know what a
fruit and vegetable is.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, that’s…I believe that’s in the first addition though. The PCS, the
version six. It should be handed out. It defines raw agricultural
commodity as any food in it’s raw or natural state. Basically any un…</p>

Processed food.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does that include hogs and chickens, the meat?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. A limitation on liability. I'm not familiar with the statute.
What is the limitation?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Starnes, if you meet a certain criteria, that if you,
according to the, I think the bill summary provides some clarification
that under the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service, or state department
act employees, they inspect these farms, they certify that these farms
are GAP certified, and if you're GAP certified, then when the product
leaves your farm and, and you did not commit gross negligence,
recklessness, or intentional misconduct, so just merely negligence which
is failure to adhere to the standard, normal duty of care, you would not
be liable. And I think mister Chairman there are some folks here from
Advocates for Justice and perhaps others that would like to speak on
this bill, and I think in opposition to this bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We, what we've got is two minutes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Chairman, can I follow up?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
And then we'll either vote or hold this motion off. You may, you may.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well I guess, when I was thinking the limitation on liability, I was
thinking you may mean if you produced a, let's say for instance you're
raising, you had eggs and you gave, sold some eggs to your neighbor and
they got infected with salmonella, are you saying there's a dollar limit
on the limitation that they could sue you for? What is the, what type of
the limitation on liability are you talking about?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
They would have to establish that you committed gross negligence,
recklessness, or intentional misconduct, so merely a negligent standard
would not be sufficient. So, and perhaps there are attorneys here that
are better skilled at explaining that than I am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Anyone else? Do I have a motion?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister Chairman, just a point of order, we're past time.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I know that.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well we can't take a motion then.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes we can. Since you don't want me to we'll pull the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.</p>
