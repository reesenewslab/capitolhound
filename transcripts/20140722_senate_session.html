It was happening time and time again. And if we look at the reasons how
we recruit industry in North Carolina. We're looking at the reasons of
how we recruit industry in North Carolina. We're looking at all the
things at the end of the game. Well senator bully the thing that's going
around the country right now, don't go to North Carolina because the
regulations will kill you. You don't want to do that. And the company i
spoke with they said it cant be. And they said without a doubt. All
regulations that we have in North Carolina are worst than California's.
And there's one thing I'll say, a lot of times what happens In Wate
county is not reflective upon the whole state. What may work in Wate
county will not work in Cherokee County, Or Pasqual Tank, or Davie, Or
Ardell, Or Brunswick county. This state is very diverse in our geography
in what we have. And when we have rules and regulations that are passed
upon the entire state that doesn't even effect our own geography. Let
alone our environment, or economic environment. We're suffering. There's
a lot of job growth here in Wate County and I'm glad of that. But I'd
like to have those jobs available in my district. Where at one time we
led the nations in job loss in our area. And senator Hartsful and I know
what it was like when you find out that the largest plant in North
Carolina closed its doors. I had a lot of friends and a lot of family
worked at that plant. And honestly we have the ability to use some of
these facilities that are sitting empty over all these years. That can
bring some of these jobs back. That's already been graded, the building
is already there, the infrastructure is already there. It brings not
only jobs here, but economic development into areas that need it in the
state. And i'd like to get on with it and move this bill through.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Gentlemen are you open for another question.[SPEAKER
CHANGES]Senator Brock do you yield [SPEAKER CHANGES]I do [SPEAKER
CHANGES] He yields [SPEAKER CHANGES] I understand the point you made and
understand your speech. But I'm simply asking you do you understand how
this impacts on a specific project in Rally. And are you interested in
trying to see whether there is some way to accommodate this concern that
the city has. Based on a consensus that was agreed to by all of the
affected governments. The cities and towns. And see whether there could
be some accommodations for this concern. That's my question to you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Bull go back if you look through the
legislation. It allows, senator stein mentioned, the flexibility, it may
be in the 2015 code. The 2012 code did not give flexibility. We allow
them to go to 2009 if they so choose. Says it allows us to go to 2009 or
use the 2012 energy codes. And those are the issues that plague some of
our industries now. Because when the building were build many years ago
they didn't have this in mind about what type of installation techniques
they'll use in these factories and these mills. And with that they
cannot bare the load of the equipment and installation on those ceiling.
And so going back, they do have the choice on what type they want to
use. And so some of these regulations ?? they have the same foresight of
what happened in 2009, said it happened over 6 years ago. But looking at
the reuse permit i just dont see why they wanna slow down the rest of
the state. [SPEAKER CHANGES] One final question.[SPEAKER CHANGES]Senator
Brock do you yield [SPEAKER CHANGES]I do [SPEAKER CHANGES] He yields
[SPEAKER CHANGES] you are talking about the building code and
restriction on what they have to do as a convert, renovate, or expand
these building. I'm talking about storm order rentoffs. And thats what
the city of Rally is concerned about because basically it says that they
began implementation of these rules to assure enough improvement in
water quality that Rally and its partners can avoid the installation of
advanced treatment technology that the M Johnson water treatment plant
as part of an anticipated expansion in 5 to 7 years the estimated cost
of the infrastructure alone exceeds 125 million dollars. I'm not talking
about building code issues. I'm talking about what it does to Rallys
ability to implement its storm water rentoff policy that was adopted by
the 6 cities in the counties plus rally to be in compliance. Thats the
question I'm asking you.  [SPEAKER CHANGES] again senator bull, this is
what deeners been doing this whole time. They've been working, well
they've had the legislation in front of them for the last four months,
we've looked at it but Senator Bull go back to as far as the runoff, if
you said the Wate County and the cities came to this agreement 6 to 8
years ago, you're looking at pre 2009, what happened back then ...</p>
