Our members will please take their seats, we will get started.
Senator Ford, sir, we would like to welcome you as an official voting
member of the Revenue Laws Committee and appreciate you agreeing to
serve. Yes, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you, ??. It's good to be here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] ?? come in here, we normally don't ?? their seats. If
you want to allow them to sit down.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Which...the back row?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, ma'am. Whatever you want to do, that would really
control the way you ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] We're going to offer the members of the committee who
have already been seated. Our guest, if you would like to find seats
here, you may. There's some on this wall over here. There's a few over
here.
Senator ??, sir, do you have any comments that you would like to make?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I would like to welcome Senator Ford to the committee
and congratulate him, and we're certainly happy to have you with us as a
full voting member. Welcome.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee, I believe you received the
minutes electronically. Is there a motion? Senator Gunn has moved.
Second must, Representive Bally. All in favor will say Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Aye.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] All opposed, no. That's unanimous. The bill draft that
was sent to you electronically includes all of the provisions that this
committee has worked through for the last seven months. We're going to
try to take it section by section. If there's any questions to staff
only on that particular section, feel free to send forth those
questions. There will be no amendments or no changes at this juncture.
This role is through the first part.
Part one. Jonathan, reduction for state net loss.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, good morning. So this has been discussed before.
I think you voted on it at the last meeting. It would do away with the
state's current economic loss provision for corporate tax purposes and
it would adopt a calculation that is similar to the federal calculation.
Every other state has a similar provision. As I said, you have discussed
that one before.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee, any comments, any questions
with respect to part one? Part two? Other income tax changes. Jonathan,
I believe you have the lead on that also.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Correct. The primary change here is to correct a
drafting error with respect to the Section 179 expense deduction.
Specifically, if you look at your draft with respect to the investment
limitation for 2013, a mistake was made that put that number in at
125,000 and it should have been 200. That mistake has been corrected
here.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee, any questions or any
comments? Moving on to part three. Ms. Avrett, I believe you have the
lead on that. Agricultural Exemption.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] This is the provision that you all looked at a couple
of different meetings. It hasn't changed from the last time that you saw
it. The key thing that you did here was to make sure that the farming
community, as well as the Department of Revenue, was clear in how to
administer this going forward in the immediate future. The big
substantive change that was made was that the $10,000 income limit that
a farmer must meet to qualify for the exemption may be met through a
three-year averaging. That was something that the farming community
asked because of volatility in some years in their operations. I'd be
happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee, any questions? Senator
McKissick.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] One quick question, Ms. Avrett. As I recall, there was
a substantial number of people that have those exemptions today that we
anticipate not being eligible in the future. Which would in many
respects decrease those numbers, as I recall, by as much as a half. The
people that have them today are going to have to re-apply. Is there
some...</p>

. . . mechanism in place to notify those that currently have these
certificates and exemptions that they need to reapply since in the past
there’s never been a formal reapplication process. So that they are
aware that what they’ve had in the past is now expired or at least has
been extinguished and they have to re-qualify.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Miss Averitt [sp?]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir. The department of revenue is notifying those of those
certificates as well as the Farm Bureau. So there is an education
campaign that is out there at the moment.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Moving on to part number four, the pre-paid meal plan. Miss Averitt, I
believe you have the lead on that, also.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes ma’am. This section we have continued to work with your colleges and
universities on this substantively it has not changed. A few things have
changed in the draft that you had before even from the one that we
emailed you on Friday and that’s because after we sent this out on
Friday UNC Charlotte wrote and said that they have a process in place
where their food service contractor is actually the entity that remits
the tax for them and they wanted to be able to continue to do that. It
didn't seem to matter to this body whether who remitted the tax so long
as the tax is remitted, and it is remitted in a timely manner, and it’s
remitted when the receipts are received. Not some time into the future.
So, on page nine, section 4.1 F, it just allows a reporting option for
pre-paid meal plans, but all this does, there has to be an agreement in
place, it does not change the timing of the remittance, it just changes
who may remit it if the parties have a contract between them so saying.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee, are there any questions, or any comments for
Miss Averitt on section four?
Moving on to section five. Miss Averitt on admissions tax.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The admissions tax, as you know, has had many different comments for the
past several months. We've worked with the parties to come to resolution
on many of those conflicts, the most outstanding conflict, I think where
there is still uncertainty, is the timing of the remittance of the tax.
There is some venues out there that would like to remit the tax, not
when they receive the gross receipts, but when the event occurs. And of
course, when the event occurs may be months after when the money is
actually received. So at this point, the draft continues to follow the
sales tax principles and also the general rule that is used by almost
every state that taxes amusements, which is the person who receives it
must remit it when the gross receipts are received. Some of the changed
that we made in the draft to address different problems was in the
exclusion of amenity. We had to make some technical changes there to
comply with the streamline sales tax agreement. Also, in the definition
of an entertainment activity there were many questions as to when is it
an entertainment? If you have a conference and you have paid money to
attend a conference and as part of that conference it includes your
dinner and there happens to be someone playing the piano at that dinner.
And so, what these things try to clarify is that the live performance
has to be, the purpose of it has to be entertainment. So we were able to
end a lot of those questions. We also provide in here on section B who
the retailer is to provide that it’s the operator of the venue or it can
be the facilitator, someone who sells tickets on the operator’s behalf
if there’s an agreement between them. We use much of the language that
we now have in our congregation statues for a facilitator they have to
remit that money within 10 days of when they receive it, etcetera. As
you will see on line 47 of page 11, we've allowed dual remittances so
that if some instances the operator of the venue is allowed, if they so
choose, to remit part of the tax and the facilitator can remit the other
part. So we tried to accommodate the various business practices that are
out there. And I’ll be happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee, I believe you are just now receiving the
summary which is hot off the press. So to catch up you’ll be on page
two, on part number five. Are there any questions or concerns with the
admissions? Mr. Starnes [sp?]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you. For clarification I thought with most sales taxes, it was due
at the end . . .</p>

<p id="10:00">
The month that you said in the event of these entertainment is due
within ten days of the receipt.[SPEAKER CHANGES]I misspoke on that with
the facilitator, if there is a facilitator that collects the money then
they have to remit it to the retailer or to the state within 10 days
after the end of the month. This is when there is an agreement between
the two parties. [SPEAKER CHANGES]There is not a provision that every 10
days they have to ?? [SPEAKER CHANGES]No sir, no sir [SPEAKER
CHANGES]Any other member of the committee? Ok we are going to move on to
section 6 the service contracts ms. avery [SPEAKER CHANGES] Once again
in this area we have been working very closely with the department and
with the parties that have service contracts to take care of a lot of
their administrative issues. one of the things we have down is to
clarify how those service contracts are sourced. they are to use the
sourcing principles that generally apply. ?? Reduce those payment
amounts. Since 2003 there has been a dispute about the enforcements of
these provisions, and there is some four billion dollars that is being
held in escrow. The parties have through arbitration worked out an
agreement. There are people here from the department of revenue who can
shed more light if you would like on it. But the effect of that
agreement is that much of that money will be released and in fact in
your general fund revenue statement that was in your budget bill there
was a provision actually for fiscal year 13-14 over collections due to
disputed NSA payments of over 71 millions there was also another line
for tobacco master settlement agreement payments of over 137 million.
Those dollar amounts tie into this provision and tie into that
settlement agreement that has been reached by 22 states with those
participating manufacturers. Part of that term sheets settlement was
that certain data would have to be cleared to a data clearing house.
That could then be used to make sure that they states were diligently
enforcing their provision. That is what that section does. We did
contact folks and we have not heard anything back from anyone about it.
Those are the changes of the excess tax provision. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee are there any comments, questions or concerns?
See none, part ten. Mr. ?? i believe that's. [SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes, part
ten hasn't changed any. Its the collection divisions legislative
proposals. The two the committee voted in favor of which was to require
a tax compliance to hold an APC permit and also to increase funding from
the collections fund for the use of locators service from
150,000-500,000 [SPEAKER CHANGES] no questions or comments from the
committee, i see no hands. section 11 ms. griffen [SPEAKER CHANGES] this
is the section that has to do with the central assessment of mobile
telecommunications property an the department of revenue has worked very
closely with the interested parties on this, and the only change to the
section, this appeared in the clarifying and administrative changes
draft that you had at the April 9th meeting, an the only change appears
on page 30 in the definitions, it appears first on line 35 and then also
on line 43 it previously just spoke with to tangible personal property
owned by a mobile telecommunications company. but much of the property
is actually leased, and so the language is added about the leasing of
that property, and also on line 39 clarifying that this does not, the
reference to tangible property doesn't include tangible property such as
SCC licenses,those were just some clarifying changes that the mobile
telecommunications companies wanted to make sure were in there and the
department has signed off on all these changes. [SPEAKER CHANGES]
questions from the committee, comments? May we move forward, section 12
Ms. Griffin. Privilege license tax changes [SPEAKER CHANGES] and there
have been no changes to this particular provision since the last draft
[SPEAKER CHANGES] the committee, Mr brolly [SPEAKER CHANGES] i want to
ask a question this would reference page 35.</p>

<p id="15:00">
and the paragraph beginning in line 32 for 160A-211-2, subsection A,
where it says, &quot;city may levy an annual tax on each business
operating within the city. The tax applies to each business location,
does not apply to individuals employed by or affiliated.&quot; And I
want to confirm that that means that the business would have to have a
physical location within the city for that tax to apply. If, say for
example, 139 businesses located in Wake County solicited businesses in a
large city in the southern Piedmont, they would not be subject to a
business privilege tax as they are now unless they actually rented space
in Charlotte and opened a branch office, is that correct?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is the intent.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Barringer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chair, I just have a couple of comments. I know that
this will move through committee and they'll be changes made and in
looking at the language, it says, &quot;may not exceed $100.&quot; Well,
I want to highlight that I think the &quot;up to or may not exceed&quot;
is very important language because there's some municipalities that
would like to collect less or more and I certainly, and I think many of
us do, believe the best government's closest to the people and I want
them to have that opportunity. The other concern I have is giving
municipalities the opportunity to react to this and the effective date
is a very important part of this and, as I said, I know this is going to
move through committees and will be massaged, so I wanted to call those
points to your attention.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you ma'am, Senator Ford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chair, question for staff is a clarifying question,
madam chair I got a couple of these. The first one is on line 28,
section 12.2A, there's a general statute 160A-211. Can you explain to me
what that is?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ms. Griffin.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure, 160A-211 is the current statute that authorizes cities to levy the
privilege tax. So, what you see here in section 12.2 is that that
statute is going to be repealed come July 1st, 2015 and replaced with
the new statute that you see in 12.2B.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Ford.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, ma'am, follow up.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Next question is on, I think it's line 43, but it starts at 37 which is
the prohibition for cities. Number 3 is providing video programming tax
under the general statute 105-164. For clarification purposes, is that
video programmed, is that include video poker?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
No.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Do you have a further-
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, ma'am.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes, sir, thank you. Members of the committee are there further comments
or concerns? Senator McKissick?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It's more of a comment than anything else, I do have some deep concerns
about this particular provision of our bill that we're sitting for. I
know it's an ominous bill so we're putting a lot into one package but
I've seen some proposed legislation that would, in my mind, at least
help offset the loss revenues that cities will receive. It was based
upon the number of employees that businesses have. It looked like a fair
and reasonable approach to, at least, addressing this projected revenue
loss of about 40-45 million dollars for cities and towns throughout this
state so I hope that, as this bill moves forward, that we will be open
to working with the Leage of Municipalities and other stakeholders to
try to come up with something to offset this significant revenue loss
because if it has to be made up with increases in property taxes we'll
get spreading it across other people in the community and that can have
a, in some respects, a more aggressive impact. So I appreciate our
approach towards trying to simplify this but in the process we need to
be fair and reasonable in terms of offsetting some of these losses that
are going to inevitably impact our communities.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Rucho.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chairman and probably to respond to Senator McKissick's
concern. Senator McKissick, we did get some recommendations from the
league and we will continue to work with them to try to assist in their
concerns and it will be an ongoing effort. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee, are there further comments on this particular
section, section 12? Part 13, the license plate agency compensation,

sp? = not sure if spelling is correct
Yes ma’am.  This provision has not changed since it was considered by
the committee in April and this increases the compensation pay to LPA
(sp?) or TAG (sp?) agents for the collection of property tax under the
Tax and Tag Together Program  by permanently adopting the transitional
rate of a dollar six per transaction.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Members of the committee.  The next section will be our technical,
clarifying and administrative changes.  Section 14.  Ms. Griffin (sp?)
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The changes to this are towards the end of the part and begin on page
fifty.  These are just some additional clean up type changes that sort
of dribbled in after the last meeting mostly from the Department of
Revenue.  The first new section is 14.21, page fifty, beginning on line
two and really the only change, this has to do with a report that people
have to file when they have custody of tangible personal property for
property tax purposes and the statute was missing a reference.
Basically, the reporting requirement doesn't apply if you have custody
of property that is exempt and that is inventories of contractors and,
hold on, I just the other two left my brain, what they were.  Sorry
inventories owned by contractors/manufacturers and inventories owned by
retailers and wholesale merchants and the reference to inventories owned
by contractors was simply missing from the statute.  That’s that 32A so
the only request was to add 32A to the statute so it looks like more
than it is and what we did is since we were amending the statute was to
clean it up because as you see it was referring to reports and based on
the repeal of subdivision one which was repealed in the eighties,
there’s really only one report now in this statute.  So there’s nothing
new substantively here, there’s no substantive change all this does is
clean up the statute and add a site that was missing.
The next new section is 14.24 on line forty of the same page.  This was
requested by DOR (sp?) to solve a customer service issue with the new
Tax and Tag system and all parties have signed off on this.  And
finally, the last section, section 14.25.  This was a request of the
unauthorized substances division at DOR (sp?) and one of, they had
issues with being able to pursue the excise tax on meth because it
doesn’t meet any of the definitions listed as you can see in one through
three so they asked for language to be added where you can see eleven
and twelve to be able to pursue the tax on those drugs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you staff (sp?).  A lot of hard hours have gone in to the work on
this bill with all of our staff.  That takes us through the  (inaudible)
but we’re going to back up for just a second.  We did have a request and
it is in reference to part five, the admissions and they have two guests
who have asked to briefly speak.  There will be no action taken on this
provision today but Mr. Richard Thigpen from general counsel at the
Carolina Panthers and Mr. Billy Traurig with general council the
Carolina Hurricanes.  Gentlemen if you want to come to the microphone at
the back of the room and share your time and make your comments.  And if
you will please just identify yourself when you before you begin, for
the record.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I’m William Traurig with the Carolina Hurricanes and I want to thank you
for the opportunity to speak today.  For approximately ten years, myself
and other members of the North Carolina Travel and Tourism Coalition
have opposed changes to the admissions tax or the gross receipts tax to
convert it to a sales tax on admissions because we were being singled
out.  Last year as part of the changes, as part of the broader package
we did not oppose those changes because we realized we were not being
singled out and that we needed to</p>

<p id="25:00">
Do our part for the state. However, we’ve had some unintended
consequences on that. And the issues that have come up are the timing
for the filing and the remittance of the tax. North Carolina Sales and
Use tax law allows some discretion for some entities to request
permission from the secretary to file the taxes on an accrual basis
which is basically what we did with the Gross receipts tax by paying
after the events and this bill takes away that option. The accrual basis
is in keeping with generally accepted accounting principles and how we
file and remit our taxes in accordance with IRS income tax regulations.
Tickets to us are different than tangible personal property because when
you purchase a piece of personal property you receive it, you get to
enjoy it as soon as you receive it.  A ticket is just a piece of paper
or nowadays even a barcode on a phone that gives you admission to the
event. The entertainment is what we’re selling and the entertainment,
that product is not delivered until the time of the event. And at that
point, that is where we believe the taxable transaction takes place,
similar to a layaway? sale at Walmart when someone goes in and pays over
time it is my understanding that a transaction is not taxable until the
product is actually received by the customer. The other issue that we
run into is that the change because ticketing systems are so different
than Point of Sale systems is that ticketing systems are based around
each event. They’re not based around a single transaction. So the
reports that we get out of our ticketing systems are extremely
complicated and include line items that you may not think of events but
we treat as events for tracking and accounting purposes such as open
practices, hockey camps, season ticket holder events, other things that
are not taxable but they also include up-sales for parking, t-shirts,
merchandise, some of which are non-taxable, some of which the tax is
paid by another entity. If we had to pay on a monthly basis as the
moneys come in because of the complications that we’ve got and the vast
number of events that we have which could be up to and above 250 line
items per day, we would have to hire additional full-time staff; at
least 1 to 2 people in our 3 different ticket offices and at least 1
person in the accounting department just to keep up with this tax and
make sure that we are trying to track it and remit it properly and that
would be a manual transaction - manual entry which obviously would be
subject to errors and then when the department of revenue comes in to
audit, the amount of time if I’ve got to hire 2-3 full time people, the
amount of time to audit would be extremely burdensome. Whereas, if at
the end of an event, the end of a month when you come in to audit, we
could provide you with a report that is for the event and all the events
in the month and the return for the month and it could be very easily be
matched and our audits have in the past lasted approximately one to two
days, I believe, versus an extreme length of time. We appreciated the
time and hope that you’ll understand and make this change for us.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you sir. Are there members of the committee that
would like to have questions for the gentleman? Senator Hartsell.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you madame chair. Let me just simplify this, are
you telling me that under gap principles, the sale of the ticket occurs
when the event occurs?
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. ??. Well actually I wanted to ask the same
question but with different words. So you're saying that you do not
recognize the revenue until the event occurs.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] That is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Mr. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES] How do you...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] I’m sorry, go ahead Mr. ??,  yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] How do you handle people who buy season ticket. Do you
wait until the last game of the season before the tax is paid on that. I
mean...
[SPEAKER CHANGES] No we allocate those as each game occurs. For the
games in October, we pay the taxes for those games in the month of
November as they’re due. So it is spread out as the games occur. And
that is how we also recognize the revenue for gap purposes and IRS
purposes.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Senator Behringer.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Thank you Madame Chair. I’m a season ticket holder
with you folks and so we have the opportunity..</p>

<p id="30:00">
Do Trey change our plans and all of that? How is that handled under this
system?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The system is difficult to operate. Changes can change the value in your
plan if you come in and want to swap seats and end up with tickets that
are more expensive. The taxable rate could go up, or it could go down.
You could get different tickets, and we also have people changing seats
mid-season, as well as before the season once their plans are paid for.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Quick follow up. My interest is to comment. I like efficiency in
business, and so I'd like for us to work with these folks to try to
figure out an efficient way.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
??, a quick question, sir?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yeah, and that's this. You're speaking on behalf of the hurricanes. But,
you're not speaking on behalf of everything that's hold over at TNC.
TNC, they have concerts that sells tickets year out, because I bought
them.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
So I just want to make sure we're just talking only about the hurricanes
as it relates to what you are speaking to, because holding money for
year and not paying it is a whole different thing. What period of time
are you proposing that you look at as this window that begins at a
certain date and ends at a certain date, and as to conforms to a
physical year, the hurricanes, is it conforming to a calendar year. What
precise time-frame are you specifically indicating would be fairer and
more reasonable than remitting it in the 30-days intervals?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Because our ticketing systems are matched up between the hurricanes and
the other events, and it is all one report that we get from the
different systems, from the one system from the different offices, to
separate and handle them in a different manner would add and have us
give the same burden that we would have if we had to do it for the
hurricanes just on a slightly smaller scale.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow-up. SO you're saying you would propose this not just for the
hurricanes, but for all events that are held at TNC, then? And, I guess
if we're talking about TNC, we're also talking about all the other
entertainment venues in the state, including the due-pack, which is over
at my district in Durham. Is that what you're saying? I'm open to trying
to do it in a way that makes sense. I'm just trying to make sure that
I'm aware of what it is that you're asking, and it sounds like for
everything at TNC, which could also affect everything in the state
that's similar.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
It is because it would put all the venues on a similar footing, and all
of them have similar issues that might be slightly different in flavor,
but all of us has similar issues throughout the state, and I've heard
from many of my counterparts throughout the state that they are
concerned about this as well
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. Members of the committee, as you can see this is rather
complicated. It is the intent of the chairs that we will re-visit this
issue at a time in the future. It came to us late. We appreciate you
being here, sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mister ?? Sir, do you have anything else you would like to add at this
time?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Very briefly if I may. Thank you very much for the opportunity. What
we're really looking for is, as the sales taxes expanded and put into
place for different businesses, that you just consider how these
different businesses operate, what their models are like, and work with
them to make it efficient. The goal is certainty of tax, to make sure
for the department of revenue, and for the tax-payer, that everybody
knows what a man is due when the tax is remitted. In our business, it's
really not known until the event has occurred, and so that's why we
asked for this.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, sir. Senator ??, sir, do you have a comment? Okay. We're
going down our agenda. We have an issue that is the taxation of vapor
cigarettes, and Miss Finnel, that is...She's going to give us an
overview and then we have some guests in the back. Miss Finnel, if you
would move forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Good morning. This is a new issue we have not talked about yet, but it
will be a very brief presentation. I'm going to talk to you briefly
about vapor products, or e-cigarettes. So, I didn't actually know a lot
about these before I started this presentation, although I've seen them
around and you've probably seen them around. So, what are these
products? These are a new product that has probably been around for five
years, but they're becoming increasingly popular, and this is a product
that actually...</p>

<p id="35:00">
… creates a vapor from nicotine suspended in a liquid and so it is not
exactly the same as cigarettes but it’s similar. So here’s some examples
of some vapor or e-cigarette products. They usually consist of a few
common components. There’s going to be a mouthpiece, there’s going to be
a cartridge to contain the liquid that contains the nicotine and there’s
usually a battery and an atomizer. And the battery fuels the little
mechanism that atomizes the liquid, or vaporizes the liquid, to be
inhaled. Some of these products also light up at the end so they sort of
look like cigarettes, but not all do. And as you can see, some of them
look just like cigarettes and some of them look like other things. Some
people call them hookah pipes, although they’re not actually hookahs.
They’re different items, so this is sort of what we’re talking about.
So what’s really happened with this? We've actually had some recent
Federal action on this. A lot of states were waiting to decide what to
do with taxation to decide what the Feds were going to do ‘cause the
Feds could have gone a couple of different ways. But in 2009, the
Federal government enacted the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco
Control Act and the purpose of this act was to subject new products to
FDA regulation. So for example, vapor cigarettes, nicotine gels, they’re
dissolvable. They’re little tablets that you can now dissolve on your
tongue that have nicotine in them. In April 2014, the FDA finally
adopted proposed rules that would subject these new products to the
following restrictions: minimum age and ID for purchase, registering the
product and reporting its ingredients, and marketing restrictions on the
product. So, a little more detail of what they actually did was they
actually said, this is a tobacco product under Federal law. Some folks
feel that this isn’t really a tobacco product. There’s not actually
tobacco in it. For the most part, it’s nicotine and the fact that people
like to cite, which I find very interesting, is that you can actually
get nicotine from products other than tobacco. For example, eggplants
apparently have nicotine in them. Who knew?
But the FDA has indicated that they want to continue to look at the
continuum of nicotine delivery products, so they’re really looking at
the nicotine products, not just tobacco as it is. So again, a little
more information on the regulation of tobacco products, so now that
these vapor products are tobacco products, again here’s a list of the
restrictions they will now be under: they can’t be adulterated or
misbranded, they can’t have modified risk descriptions. So for example,
you can’t call them light cigarettes or light e-cigarettes. You can’t
give out free samples, you have to have a premarket review and, again, a
minimum age for purchase.
So you look at what the state did. The state was ahead of the Feds on
this issue. Last year, you may recall, the state actually adopted a law
to prohibit the sale of vapor products to minors. It’s a class two
misdemeanor for anyone to distribute these products to individuals under
18. Retailers must post a sign and no vending machines may be allowed to
use these products unless they’re in a restricted area. This became
effective August 1, 2013. 33 states adopted similar provisions but as
you know, now the Feds have stepped in so now no one under 18 across the
country can purchase these products.
So this is why we’re here. We’re here to talk about tobacco taxes. So
here’s a brief overview of Federal and state tobacco taxes. As you can
see, the Feds have a lot more categories about how they tax tobacco
products but us here in the state, we basically have two broad
categories. We tax cigarettes at 45¢ per pack and we tax OTP at 12.8% of
price. So OTP is basically everything else: cigars, snuff, chaw, all
that stuff is OTP and it’s taxed based on the purchase price.
So right now, vapor products don’t fall under the definition of
cigarettes or OTP, so they are not subject to the tax. They are subject
to sales tax but they’re not subject to a specific tobacco tax. So
that’s part of what this draft is about.
Other states, like I said, for the most part, were waiting to see what
the Feds were going to do before they decided to tax it. We do have one
state which taxes vapor products. They taxed it at their OTP rate which,
as you can see, is quite a bit higher than ours. That’s 95% of wholesale
rate. Other states have come up with some proposals. They haven’t
enacted them yet. For example, South Carolina had proposed 5¢ per
milliliter of the product sold. Governor Christie of New Jersey just
indicated that he wants to tax them like cigarettes and he’s going to
tax them the equivalent of $2.70 per pack, which is New Jersey cigarette
tax. Washington State has also had a house finance committee approve of
75% tax on the e-cigarettes.
So these are some of the options are here. You actually have a proposal
in front of you that’s very similar to the South Carolina proposal. So
what it would do is tax vapor products at 5¢ per milliliter of
consumable material. So that’s your liquid that’s in your cartridge
that’s in your e-cigarette or your vapor product. So per milliliter, it
is 5¢. If you sell less than a whole milliliter, it’s a portion of that
tax. It’s very similar to the motor fuels tax or the tax on liquor</p>

<p id="40:00">

...And wine, so it’s a per milliliter volume tax. Now it’s gonna be
administered as OTP. It’s not gonna be administered as a cigarette tax.
Now the reason why that‘s important is now cigarettes can only go
through the wholesale model in the state, so they first come into the
wholesaler and the wholesaler pays the tax on the cigarettes. For OTP,
the entity that first acquires the product in the state pays the tax, so
either the retailer or the wholesaler can pay the tax. Now one note on
that, for OTP products, there is a licensing program, so the wholesale
dealer or retail dealer that first touches that OTP must be licensed,
that’s gonna be the same for vapor. Now there is still only going to be
one license, it’s going to be an OTP, tobacco or vapor product license.
But some retail dealers only sell vapor so they’re not currently
licensed. So if you’re a vapor dealer, this will require you to be
licensed. So there will be some new licensees under the act.
There’s also no discount for vapor allowed in this bill. There’s a two
percent discount for cigarettes and OTP. This goes back to the days of
stamping. There used to be a discount allowed for stamping. That
discount has remained in the law even though there is no stamping. So
this does not extend that discount for filing timely to the vapor.
The proposal also has a provision that’s not related to taxes. And this
is about restricting vapor in our prisons, our state confinement
facilities and the local jails. This is basically the parallel
provisions to tobacco. It goes in and clarifies, that where tobacco is
not allowed in these places, you’re also not allowing the vapor. So in
state facilities, it states that you may not use these products on the
premises. There are exceptions, for religious use, and used by employees
and visitors as long as they are locked in the vehicles outside of the
premises.
The treatment for local facilities your sheriff’s jail is slightly
different. It’s actually a class 1 misdemeanor to either give vapor to
an inmate or to possess a vapor product. We have shared this with DPS
and the Sheriff’s association. They don’t have a position on it, but to
our understanding, is that these products aren't currently allowed
anyway. But, we are clarifying that they are prohibited in these prisons
and jails. So that’s it. I’d be happy to answer any questions.
Madam Chair: Members of the committee, questions for our staff? Senator
McKissick.
Senator McKissick: A couple of questions, okay? First when we first
start talking about a millimeter, is that equivalent to one refill on an
electronic cigarette? Is that the volume that it actually holds?
Speaker: One of the issues with vapor is that there are many different
manufacturers and there’s a lot of different products. So it’s not a
unit, it is a unit that is recognized, but depending on what product you
use, you could use a different amount. So it’s not like cigarettes where
it’s very standardized. So if you recognize a unit of volume, you can
recognize however they’re selling it, but we don’t know what a standard
unit at this point is. Because it’s sort of all over the place at this
point.
Senator McKissick: Follow up if I could?
Madam Chair: Follow up Senator McKissick.
Senator McKissick: I've seen a Reynolds’ product which I guess was on
sale, in Colorado today and in one other state I do believe. Now would
that...do you know whether in fact that product and the way it is
packaged and sold, if that one refill that they gave you, is that a
milliliter or are you familiar with that at all or...
Speaker: I’m not sure what the Reynold’s product, I believe our, we’re
gonna have a presentation, and I believe it is sold in two...
Madam Chair: Sorry.
Speaker: That’s okay. They are sold in milliliters, so whether its five
milliliters or ten milliliters, we would be able to tax it at that
amount. I cannot tell you with any certainty which product has how many
milliliters in it. So they are sold on a volume...there is a provision
in the bill that requires all manufacturer’s invoices to state the total
amount in milliliters of consumable material. So that is where it’s
gonna be taxed at. The retailer is not going to need to sit there a
figure out how many milliliters there are.
Madam Chair: Senator McKissick, we have a guest from, David Powers, from
the Reynold’s and I believe he’s gonna be prepared to answer all of
those technical questions for you.
McKissick: Okay. Maybe what I’ll do is hold all of my questions to that
time Madame Chair. It would be fine if you can recognize me after his
presentation.
Madam Chair: That might be a good...yes sir.
McKissick: Thank you.
Madam Chair: Is there other questions from the committee for Ms. Fennel?
If not, Mr. Powers, if you would like to come up. You may remain there
but you’re welcome to come up front. Do you have an overhead? You may
come up here if you would like to. I think it’s just easier with your
overhead from this point. Members of the committee, [our guest??] David

<p id="45:00">
Who has all the answers to the technical questions
(SPEAKER CHANGES)
Thank you madam chair, Senator Raven, and members of the committee. I
really appreciate the opportunity to come here and talk with you today.
My name is David Powers, I’m vice president of government relations for
RAI services company, you know us better as RJ rentals tobacco company
as well as RJ rentals vapor company. I’m pleased to be able to give you
a quick overview of a consumer product which is now a fast growing
segment of the general tobacco category. E cigarettes or vapor
cigarettes and vapor products. E cigarettes in general have these common
features: they contain nicotine derived from tobacco pharmaceutical
grade is suspended in a liquid generally made of pharmaceutical grade
propylene glycol and glycerin. The liquid is heated, typically by
battery, and when the consumer draws on it, it produces a vapor, not a
smoke. No tobacco is burned, e cigarettes are smoke free. The products
on the market currently are made in China, with one notable exception,
the e cigarette that is made by RJ rentals vapor company, Vuse. Vuse is
currently being marketed in Colorado and Utah, and will be sold
nationwide later this summer, actually next month. Vuse is different
from any other e cigarette currently on the market for a few reasons.
One is the only digital vapor cigarette designed and assembled in the
United States. Cartridges are made using high speed machinery, and
filled not by hand, by machinery. Vuse, unlike many cigarettes on the
market, is a closed system, meaning not only does it not need to be
refilled, it is designed to prevent reuse. The Vuse cartridge only works
with a Vuse battery, so you can’t put a separate cartridge on our
battery, or vice versa. Vuse cartridges are designed to minimize the
possibility of any leaks, and to be tamper resistant, and choke hazard
resistant. Vuse is currently manufactured in Kansas, we’re looking at
expansion opportunities, especially here in North Carolina. Studies show
that e cigarettes have the potential to significantly reduce risk,
primarily because they do not expose the consumer to tobacco smoke which
is the chief risk component of traditional cigarettes. E cigarettes
present less risk than traditional cigarettes, but they still contain
nicotine, which is addictive. The legislature was absolutely right last
year when you passed, with our support, legislation ensures minors
cannot buy these products. Because e cigarettes are different from
traditional cigarettes, it makes sense that they should be taxed
differently than traditional cigarettes or other tobacco products. So
this is what e cigarettes are, and this is what vapor products are, they
produce vapor, not smoke. No tobacco is burned, they’re smoke free.
They’re not traditional cigarettes, and they are certainly not like
other tobacco products, cigars, chewing tobacco or snuff. They simply
don’t fit any of the traditional categories of tobacco products because
they’re a totally new kind of tobacco derived product. What we’re asking
this committee to do, is to establish by statute a new category of
tobacco derived products, e cigarettes, vapor cigarettes, and vapor
products which reflects the risk difference between e cigarettes and
traditional tobacco cigarettes and other tobacco products. Again, I want
to thank you for your time, I am willing to take any questions. I have
some colleagues from rentals in a more technical and legal areas that
can answer some questions also, so thank you very much for your time,
and I appreciate the opportunity to be here.
(SPEAKER CHANGES)
Thank you Mr.Powers and if you’ll just remain right there, I think one
of the questions that’s just come up to the chair, are you asking to be
taxed in this respect
(SPEAKER CHANGES)
I promise you you’ve never heard me or probably anybody else in any
industry stand up and ask for their product to be taxed, but yes ma’am,
we are.
(SPEAKER CHANGES)
Thank you sir. Members of the committee, I believe in your handout you
will see that there is generates revenue, new revenue of 2.1 million
14-15, about 5 million in 15-16. Members of the committee, are there
questions? Senator Starn, Representative Starn, sorry.
(SPEAKER CHANGES)
Thank you. The tax that goes on this, it’s on the, do you pay sales tax
on the electronic cigarette when you buy it, and then this new</p>

Representative [Starns?]: The other tobacco product tax is up based on
the refill cartridges...
Speaker B: Well, Representative, the real reason we’re here today. The
one state that taxes is Minnesota and they do it as a percentage of
wholesale price.  They do it at a very high rate which we’re very much
against because we want to encourage smokers to try this product. We
don’t want to create distance in it for them to try it. But one thing
they do, the product comes in two forms. This is a singles use
electronic cigarette. The cartridge is equivalent to about a pack of
cigarettes. The battery is rechargeable, a recharger’s in this packet.
If you tax this based on wholesale price, you’re actually taxing the
battery, as well as they consumable liquid. The cartridge is only
liquid. So we feel like it’s a much more sensible and fair excise tax to
tax the consumable part of the product. Which is why we feel like it
should be taxed based on that liquid volume. But yes it would be
separate; five cents per milliliter, accessed on the invoice at the
original, by the original purchaser, on the product.
Unnamed male: Follow up...
Madam Chair: Follow up? Representative Starns?
Representative Starns: Hold up the one that we’re taxing.
Speaker B: Actually both. This is a cartridge that replaces, that goes
on this to replace the cartridge when it’s used up.
Representative Starns: On the actual cigarette part you hold in your
hand, when you purchase that. There’s a sales tax...
Speaker B: There is a sales tax on it just like on many others.
Representative Starns: And then there’s the other, the tobacco product
tax applies as well.
Speaker B: No, not today. Not today. That’s what we’re...
Representative Starns: But under this legislation, it would be?
Speaker B: Yeah. Yes sir.
Representative Starns: One final technical question;
Madam Chair: Representative Starns.
Starns: Many smokers choose their cigarettes based on the taste and the
flavor. Do electronic cigarettes have a taste or a flavor?
Speaker B: We’re currently marketing two products. One is, this is
menthol, just like menthol cigarette and the other one’s tobacco
flavored. That’s what we’re...there’re many different flavors on the
market. We’re marketing these two in Colorado and Utah.
Madam Chair: Senator Mckissick?
Senator [Mckissick?]: A couple of questions, sir. And first, it’s good
to see you again.
Speaker B: It’s good to see you Senator.
Mckissick: I’m just curious. This milliliter question I had earlier. I
guess your typical refill there is one milliliter. Is that what that is?
Speak B: Our cartridge is about half a milliliter.
McKissick: Half a milliliter.
Speaker B: But other cartridges range to a milliliter and maybe even a
little more. One reason we chose this measure is because many systems
which are what they call open systems where you can go buy a bottles of
refillable liquid, come in 30 milliliter, maybe 50 milliliter bottles.
And we feel like this captures all products, on the market at the same
rate, fairly at the same rate.
Mckissick: Quick follow up Madam Chair?
Madam Chair: Yes sir?
Mckissick: Based upon your projections, in terms of migration from
traditional cigarette products, to the new electronic cigarettes, if we
were to look out over a five year window of time, based upon where we
stand today, what percentage of your market do you think will make that
transition from traditional cigarettes to the electronic?
Speaker B: For us, it’s really hard to judge because we've only been
selling in two states for a very few months. I really don’t think I can
make a qualified answer on that. I do feel like this category. I've seen
conservative growth estimates of 70 percent a year in this category. Now
how that translates to us, like I say, we’re a very new product on the
market&gt; There’s been electronic cigarettes on the market for several
years. This time next year, I’d have a lot better idea about that or
even six months from now, after we've got some experience on a national
level selling it. But first our company’s concern, I really couldn't say
with any certainty.
Madam Chair: Senator [Baranger?]?
Baranger: If I can make one comment Madam Chair.
Madam Chair: Yes, sir?
Baranger: That simply this; I support the idea of us moving forward with
this legislation. I think it’s a good idea. I think in the long run, it
behooves us all if we move people from traditional cigarette products to
electronic cigarettes. It exposes people to less of a harmful impact
that you get from cigarette smoke because you have the vapor involved
and it is a decreased, health risk in cost as well. So, I think it’s a
great idea as well. The thing I think we need to be mindful of is as we
move forward and I think this five cent per milliliter is a good point
perhaps to start. I don’t know where that should be a year or two down
the road. And I don’t think there’s any way for us to know where it
ought to be today. I do think there’ll be...

Senator Powers: ...significant migration of the market. And I believe
that there are significant revenue losses that we will experience in
terms of traditional income that we would receive from cigarettes. We’re
looking at four five cents a pack. And one of those cartridges is
equivalent to a multitude of packs.
Unnamed committee member: Actually it’s about one pack.
Powers: About one pack; so you’re moving from forty five cents to five
cents. So that will have impact upon us when we do our budget
projections for loss revenues: so you’re moving from forty five cents to
five cents. Is it fair to move in some direction that’s consistent with
what the difference is between the products....Absolutely? And I think
it’s meritorious to do so.  I just don’t know if five cents is where it
needs to stay: it’s a good starting point.
So I applaud the industry for its research and for its advances in
technology, and hope that this legislation moves forward and will at
least have some basis to look out in a couple of years and see what
we’re doing and seeing if it needs adjustment.
Unnamed committee member: Thank you Senator.
Senator Powers: Thank you
Madam Chair: Thank you Mr. Powers and members of the committee. Are
there other questions for Mr. Powers or his colleagues? If not, sir you
may be excused. Thank you. Members of the committee, you have the bill
before you, the draft proposal. Are there questions for our staff or,
again for Mr. Powers’ staff? This is the Tax Vapor prohibits in jails.
Senator [Roucho?], a motion sir, Are you prepared for a...?
Sen. [Roucho?]: I think so.
Madam Chair: Senator Rabun?
Senator Rabun: Yes, Madam Chair, I was going to make a motion when we
wrapped up at the end to put everything into that one omnibus bill. At
that time do we need to do that ahead of time or I think that would be
proper just when we wrap up at the end of the day, go into one bill if I
may.
Madam Chair: Okay. Are there any further questions on the vapor tax?
Miss Carney?
Ms. Carney: Why do we need to roll these two together? Why can’t we just
have it separately...Just a question?
Sen. Rabun: What I was, my plan was after we finish today, was because
we’re going into and in the interest of time in a shorten the session,
rather than have several bills, I was going to move that we wrap
everything into one omnibus bill and send those to finance and work
through it that way.
Ms. Carney: Madam Chair...?
Madam Chair: Yes, Ms. Carney?
Ms. Carney: I understand that we roll a lot of bills together up here,
but we’re getting these two in here today before we go into session and,
are these two tied similarly? Are we going to be able to support both?
Sometimes people want to vote for one but they don’t want to vote for
the other. And these are two new bills that are before us today...
Madam Chair: Ms. Carney, I’m gonna give you an option; we have the vapor
cigarette proposal before us. Chair moves that we give the vapor tax
favorable recommendation. Are there any further questions or comments?
If not, all in favor of the vapor tax draft will say Aye.
Committee: Aye.
Madam Chair: All opposed, no.
[Silence]
Madam Chair: I think that’s unanimous. We still have the option to roll
all of the bills together but we have a clean vote on the vapor tax. Our
fifth item is Single Sales Factor. Jonathon Tarp sir, if you would like
to discuss that.
Jonathon Tarp: so you have a proposal in your packet and I’ll just start
with that first before we go over those slides. This is a proposal that
would increase the weight of the sales factor and the corporate
[proportionate?] formula. The increase would be from two times the sales
factor to four times the sales factor. And I briefly pointed to the
physical memorandum mentioned; found this in your packet, is it?
Physical memorandum on the back...

...So that you will see, what occurs there with you revenues. For the
fiscal year of 13-14, there will not be an impact. For 14-15, there
would be a reduction in general fund revenues of 10.2 million dollars;
and then in fiscal year 15-16, 23.4 million reductions going out to
about 28-29 million in the out years. So, that’s the proposal. Again to
increase the weight of the sales factor does not actually go to a
formula that would only use the sales factor. We've talked about singles
sales factor apportionment at a previous meeting, so today I’ll just
briefly talk about that corporate apportionment process again to refresh

have any questions, I’ll try to answer them.

questions? I’m, sorry. I am so sorry. I got ahead of you.
Well, it’ll be a brief overview, perhaps not that brief.
[Laughter from the committee]
[Speaker changes] Make it brief.
Yeah, maybe. Well, federal law, if you remember. Federal law prevents
states from taxing all the multi-state corporations’ income. If they
could do that, then potentially you’ll have one dollar being taxed up
fifty times, by fifty different states. So corporations calculated an
apportionment percentage. They multiply their income, by this
apportionment percentage to determine how much of their income is
subject to tax in a given state.
In North Carolina we also use this same percentage to apportion the
franchise tax base. As model legislation from years back, years ago, I
suggest states do this in a certain way to so that you have uniformity.
That suggested method is that you would use three factors; and those
three are the percentage, of the corporation’s property, payroll and
sales in the state. So mathematically that is stated as your property
factor plus your payroll factor, plus your sales factor divided by
three. So in that formula each of the factors has equal weight. The
sales factor in particular, since we’re talking about that has the
weight of one third in the formula.
Now over the years, states have started increasing the weight of the
sales factor in this formula; some going all the way to using only the
sales factor and they've done this as an economic development tool.
North Carolina followed suit in 1989. We increase the weight of our
sales factor to double weight. So after that change, it meant that the
sales factor counted as much in the formula as the property and payroll
factor combined, and counted as one half.  So we moved from having a
formula where the sales factor had one third influence to one where it
was one half. And that’s where we stand today.
Under this proposal you would increase the weight to four times.  So,
now you have six factors, with the sales factor making up four parts of
it. You end up with a 4/6 ratio or 2/3’s. So if you adopt this proposal
you would have gone from a formula that counts as a sales factor one
third, in the old days, current law counts as one half. Now it would
make up two thirds of the formula.
Now the economic development argument can be made in a fairly simple
hypothetical. If you assume you have all of your property and payroll in
state, but all of your sales outside the state, under the old formula
you would have had one third of your income subject to tax here. Under
current law, you would have half of your income subject to tax here, and
if you made this change to four time’s sales factor, you would only have
one third of your income subject to tax here.
So what you’re saying to states, I guess that kind a states that
argument, folks that would make the case for this would say,
“Come and invest your property and your payroll in North Carolina. If
you do so, we’re going to reduce the influence that your property and
payroll investment has and determining how much your tax bill is going
to be.&quot;
That’s the argument they’ll make. Now I have a couple of slides here. I
guess they’re a little more detailed, but really I've illustrated the
concept to you in that simple hypothetical. That hypothetical was just
not very realistic because if you have all your property and payroll in
North Carolina it’s very unlikely you’re not gonna have some sales here.
This really is, the concept is really no different. You just, in this
slide you have...</p>

<p id="65:00">
… property and payroll here, and 20 percent of your sales. This assumes
the tax payer had a thousand dollars in taxable income. And on the left
you have North Carolina with a double-weighted sales factor, and we
assume you have another state that just has the standard, original form
of just the one third weight, and you see at the end of the day at a 5
percent tax rate, North Carolina offers some savings to that tax payer
because we have double-weighted sales, versus the sales factor only
counting a third in the former. Under this proposal today, you would
increase it to four times sales, and this tax payer would enjoy
additional tax savings in that scenario. And now, a lot of states that
have moved to single sales factor have done this in a sort of I guess
fractional steps where they continue increasing the weight until
ultimately they’re just using the sales factor only, and so you see some
states going up 60 percent, 70 percent, or they continue using the
fractions. It’s the same thing until they get to 100 percent sales
factor. And then finally I have an example up here that shows you what
would happen if you had a 100 percent sales factor, based on that same
example, and you see that tax continues to go down. Down from 20
dollars, I think, in the original one, down to 10 dollars here. So the
argument for single sales factor is definitely primarily an economic
development one. Folks will argue that it encourages investment in job
creation in North Carolina, again because you deemphasize their property
payroll factors and the apportionment. They also point out that it
rewards these companies that increase their property payroll here, and
it exports the tax burden to out-of-state companies that use the state
as a market rather than as a location for their jobs and investment. The
other argument is the consistency argument. North Carolina does allow
single sales factor apportionment for some tax payers already. They
include excluded corporations, which are defined as building contractors
and security dealers, loan companies and companies that receive more
than half their income from intangibles, public utilities and capital
intensive corporations. Now there are definitely some arguments against
single sales factor or against continuing to take this progression of
increasing the weight with the sales factor. You’ll hear them argue that
this is not an effective economic development tool, it’s just a trend,
and ultimately states just follow the trend – everybody does it – until
the only winner’s really the companies that you’re just giving the tax
?? away. That’s an argument you’ll hear. They’ll argue that it
arbitrarily picks winners and losers, and it is true that if you adopt
this, there will be winners and losers. Not everybody wins. Some will
pay more. And it’s pretty easy to see in the formula, if your sales are
higher than your property and payroll ratios, you’re going to pay more
because the sales factor’s being emphasized more in the formula. And
then finally they will argue that it ignores why businesses pay tax in
the first place. They’ll make the point “Well the property employees in
the state equals a demand for more government services, so you should be
taking that into consideration when you do the apportionment.” And one
last argument they’ll point out is that it does not help the majority of
North Carolina corporations. The majority of corporations don’t
apportion at all. It’s because the majority are small companies that are
just 100 percent North Carolina. They don’t do business outside of the
state, so they don’t have anything to apportion. It’s just all tax tier.
In case you’re wondering what our neighbor states do, Virginia has gone
to a double-weighted sales factor with the option of single sales factor
for manufacturing and retail companies. South Carolina has now adopted
single sales factor. Tennessee is double-weighted sales and Georgia also
has gone to single-weighted sales factor. And that’s all I have.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Members of the committee, are there questions? Mr.
Starns. [SPEAKER CHANGES] What other states do a four-times sales
factor? [SPEAKER CHANGES] I couldn’t tell you the other states right off
hand that do a four-times sales. There are some that do triple-weighted
and some have gone that step. It usually is a process where they’re
intending to go to using the sale factor only, and you may see them take
steps from using four-times sales factor up to six-times and on up. I
saw one state here that has gone to 90 percent and then they’re going to
95 percent sales factor before they get there, but usually they’re just
doing that as a phase-in process. I don’t know of any that just…</p>

Follow up Mr. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The slides shows you have the winners and the losers, give me an example
the tops of industries or businesses in North Carolina that would
benefit the most from this. Is this gonna be a manufacturer because and
the reason is because they are property intensive, they have heavy
property investment and may have a lot of payroll. So, there are the
ones that typically benefit manufacturers. And the one as far as the
losers, a service company could definitely be a loser because the way
resource the services revenue if they could have more of their sales
outside the state in a lot of circumstances and they could pay more.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Follow up Mr. ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
But it would be safe to say the majority of North Carolina businesses
would be losers under this formula that is not correct there are about
85 to 90% corporations would not be impacted. Again, this is primarily
because mostly just about 100% North Carolina companies they don’t
approach, out of the remaining population if you just look at the
existing records with no assumption that they are gonna have increase
property payroll investment you have about 6,000 that would pay more and
about 3,000 that would pay less.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator ??.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you Mam, Jonathan wanna say thank you for your presentation and
really appreciate and respect the fact that you included the pros &amp;
cons of the single factor and what we are considering here in the state.
Our question for you again relates to give me the reductions in revenues
again so I can make sure that get clarify and I will make sure I
understand it?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Sure, if the revenue sort of confront that drop and then you got lot of
?? but in 2013-14 you would not have any impact and that’s because is
not a fact until the 2015. Fiscal year 2014-15 there would be a 10.2
million dollar reduction and 2015-16 a 23.4 million dollar reduction,
2016-17 a reduction a 28.4 and in 2017-18 reduction of similarly 29.2
million dollars.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator ??
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just simplifying this, it sounds me like this is beneficial if we want
to attract manufacturers, our manufacturers want to expand this is
beneficial.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Correct and in most cases that will be correct there is standing that’s
most of them is correct.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Miss. Carney.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam, that is more just of a comment rather than questions.
I’m not sure why we are having this discussion today to move this
forward in short session and this is the members all of us when we are
looking at shorter just in the state and of revenues to the 400 plus
million dollars and yeah this is the bill that’s gonna target just about
3,000 businesses in our state and we have got teachers that are
screaming for a pay increase. Now, when we compare the other states
around us that are move into the double way or single sales or whatever
and we are gonna go to the quadruple. I’m not sure that this is the
right time for us to be doing this to take a hit 10 million next year
and then 20 million going forward and revenues. So, I guess I’m
perplexes to why this is before us today, why this is a long session
discussion that we should be having going forward as we see the sales
tax, the sales tax increases and the cuts that have been implemented by
the general assembly going forward to give those time to see where we
are gonna be in the revenues coming forward in 2014-15 and 2015-16. I’m
just not sure I mean if I was manufacturing company that might be
appealing but for my employees if South Carolina is doing quite a few
things that North Carolina has eliminated they are jumping on the back
where I can expanding amenities in their state so I might go there if
it’s the double, I don’t understand why we have to do this today and for
that reason Senator ?? I was saying bundling these I can’t support this
today but I could support the ??.

A comment here Miss Manager. Thank you. I think there has been
discussions with Secretary Decker and I think its documented that in
fact she has found that we may have already lost one or two
manufacturing opportunities in recruitment due to this law. So, as we
try to recruit manufactures in our state, I think its important that we
try to have the best tools our there.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jones.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Madam Chairman. In terms of the committee, I'd like to
comment, if I may. So, then that makes a good point. Secretary Decker
would be here today, but she couldn't get back in town. She basically
said boldly, she supports this effort and the effort to recruit
manufacturing jobs. If you look at manufacturing jobs in North Carolina,
as in most states they have had a decline in manufacturing. Yet, they
are some of the best jobs because of the multiplier effect of someone's
widget will help add to a manufacturing facility and therefore it
creates many new jobs. That is our goal to try to create a rock solid
manufacturing base here in North Carolina. We worked hard on the tax
policy, we reduced the rates, both personal and corporate. We've seen
some very positive results because of it. 220 Thousand jobs created over
the last three years. We've seen a significant reduction in
unemployment. If we remember of this general assembly is to stimulate
economic growth and stimulate private sector jobs. And, our goal will be
a bit picky. We don't need anymore $9 an hour jobs, because nobody can
take care of a family. No. We want the ones that are $14, or $25, or
greater. That's what this does when it recruits manufacturing jobs into,
not specifically into the urban areas, but into the rural areas. Which
is something we're trying to get across this state. By, coming forward
now, what we're actually trying to do is keep the momentum going, so we
can continue creating those good jobs that have already come our way. We
are one of the leading states of creating jobs. In doing so, this can
bring it forward. It can be continued to be [??] in both the house and
the finance committee. It becomes part of our overall package to sell
North Carolina, not only to businesses that come here, but even more
importantly, to keep the North Carolina businesses here. When we can
attract them here, because there is less than a tax burden on the
purchase of land, or property, or buildings, or capital investment.
Also, rewarding North Carolinians businesses that actually hire North
Carolinian employees. That is a great step forward, that's what we want
to be known for, there are a number of states already looking at us from
across the country, looking at us already and this is another step in
that direction. I would urge this committee to support this. It can
further discussed and debated in both house and senate finance, but this
is another positive as we move forward in creating economic growth in
jobs. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Representative Blust.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
I have a question about the physical impact. I think under our tax
reform last year we are going to have a possible further reduction of
the corporate rate if certain revenue targets are hit. On physical
impact, are these assuming the current corporate rate, or are these
assuming a further reduction in the rate and then, wouldn't that affect
the numbers in future years, if the rates reduced?
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
The numbers are based, since this proposal was in effect, starting with
the 2015s, last year. The numbers are based on the tax rate in effect
for 2015, which is a 5% rate. Since the rate reductions are contingent,
it does not include any provision for that temporary rate cuts. If those
rate cuts were to occur, the impact would be reduced, because the rates
lower.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
Follow up Representative Blust.
[SPEAKER CHANGE]
When you're doing these calculations, do you use some sort of dynamic
system? Are you anticipating that if we do this there might be more jobs
in the future, more manufacturing. Therefore, that additional economic
activity will generate.</p>

Male 1: Some tax revenue that might lower the fiscal impact?

use this proposal, versus what the formula was when they thought.
Female: Senator [Rabin?]?
Male 3: Thank you, Madam Chair. And going back, and thank you for the
pros and cons. That was a very good presentation. I think, at a glance,
that the pros do outweigh the cons, but thank you for putting them out
there. And to pair up what Senator Rucho has said, and some other
members, what we’re trying to do here is to move forward and create an
environment for good manufacturing jobs in this state. It’s a shame to
lose them because of minor glitches in our tax code, and the way we do
business to our states to the south and to the west. And I think, in
every session, Representative Carney, going forward, we need to prove to
the businesses nationwide and worldwide, that we are focused and that we
are on a path to make North Carolina not only competitive, but the best
state to stay in and do business and maintain what we have and to come
to and do business. And I think it’s very necessary for us to take this
step and to move forward.
Female: [???]
Male 4: Thank you, Madam Chairman. I would just like to say I think in
the last session, we did, as you all know, a very massive restruction of
the tax code. And since at this point—And this sounds like a wonderful
concept, but when you look at the bottom line of where we are at this
point in history, we really should wait and put this on the back burner
and see what our revenues are going to be, because this is going to cost
revenue in the current budget situation. We don’t have a crystal ball,
and I suggest we let this ride, and take it up in the long session.
Female: Senator Hartsell.
Male 5: First, Madam Chair, Jonathan, could you back up to the slide— Or
I don’t know what they call it now – The one that discusses our
surrounding states?
Male 6: Yes sir.
Male 5: Okay. As I understand it, what that does is illustrate the fact
that our surrounding states are already farther along than we are, which
puts us at a disadvantage comparatively to them now. Is that accurate or
not? In terms of attracting, manufacturing, or those similar operations.
Male 6: Senator Hartsell, I don’t feel comfortable answering that. I
think it’s more of a policy question. I think that if I showed you data,
I think you could find that it shows, on the whole, manufacturers tend
to do fairly well under these changes.
Male 5: That’s my—
Female: Follow up, Senator Hartsell?
Male 5: My point is, when you see single sales factor for South Carolina
and Georgia, that means what we’re doing is an incremental movement
toward single sales factor. We’re not going all the way. We’re simply
going part of the way so that we can be more competitive with our
surrounding states. Is that – In that particular area – Is that not
correct?
Male 6: That’s the argument that most advocates make, is that you want
to increase the weight to attract business investment.
Male 5: And for attracting—
Female: Follow up.
Male 5: And for attracting entities such as Google, or their server
farms, Amazon, and all these others, single sales factor can be a
significant element in drawing them to us.
Female: Jonathan, are you prepared to answer, sir?
Male 6: Well, if I can make a general comment. You know, a company that
[??] comes to you and wants to make a large capital investment may like
a single sales factor. Essentially it gets down to if they’re going to
make this investment and they’re going to run their calculations, and
they see that their property and payroll factor are going to be much
higher than their sales factor, of course they’re going to want this
change.
Female: Members of the committee, further questions? We are on the
single sale factor bill, so if you’re prepared. I’m waiting for a motion
or a debate on this bill.
Male 1[?]: Madam Chair, I am going to move again that we wrap all of
this into the omnibus bill and—</p>

move forward.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr rally.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
yeah request information does the senator's motion include the vapor
bill or is it just the single sales factor bill?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
yes it was I'm sure I'd like to second it.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Ok you have a motion that the Omnibus bill that we'll be voting on to
include the vapor tax portion of the bill and to also include the single
sale factor that is the motion before you discussion on that motion Mr
start.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you well madam chair I think that we want to do the right thing in
the right way at the right time and I'll do it by following these three
rules it always serves our purpose but I declare while I think there's a
lot of merit to doing the changing of sales form portion I'm not sure
that now is the right time to do it and it concerns me that all this
will become part of the Omnibus bill these are not minor tweaks or
changes these are very significant changes this is major policy issue
that I think it needs to be vetted outside of the big bill and I would
hope that we would not roll them all into one bill because I don't think
that it will get the discussion that it deserves I think it will detract
from some of the other very important and good policy changes that we
have in the revenue technical bill or the corrections bill so I hope
that the committee will not roll them all into one bill and let this
very major policy change stand on its own.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
the committee the motion before you as we stand..
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
representative Carney.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
looking at Robert's roles may I offer that there's a motion to roll
these into can I make a substitute motion that we take these the vapor
and the tax bills..
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Miss Carney you can make a substitute motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
then I make a substitute motion that we separate these two bills out
from the Omnibus technical corrections bill that we've already voted on
the vapor bill so I'm asking that we vote them separately.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
We'll be sure then to understand your motion your motion is that we vote
separately on the vapor bill and the sales tax factor those two will be
separate votes is that your motion? okay ladies and gentlemen you know
what the motions are you just heard the motion so I'm gonna ask you to
raise your hand all in favor of the Carney motion will raise your hand..
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Excuse me madam chair I need some clarification and does that require a
second
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
and [??] ah or Ney what the ramification of that vote are.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The first motion is that we will vote separately on the Omnibus bill,
the vapor tax and the sales tax that would be three votes three separate
votes there would be three separate bills that would be the consequence
of the Carney motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Madam chairman.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
senator [??]
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you madam chairman you know it's interesting because all this
really does is it moves it forward so that the house [??] finance can
further debate and understand all of these issues and to just to try to
stype all the debate makes absolutely no sense we've got good progress
moving forward it would be an absolute tragedy if we can't continue
moving that ball forward some folks might like to have high unemployment
rate but when you've seen it drop from ten point four to six point three
percent that's progress ladies and gentlemen and we need to keep.

that momentum forward, and all we're doing, by Senator Raymond's
original motion, was to allow this to be set forward into house and
senate finance for additional debate, additional discussion, which it
will definitely get.  And I would urge every member to vote against
Representative Carney's motion and get onto Senator Raymond's motion.
[SPEAKER CHANGES] Representative B? on the Carney motion. [SPEAKER
CHANGES] I just want to be sure. I mean, if we vote for the Carney
motion, these bills- these will still be moving forward won't they?
They'll just be moving forward in separate bills so that we can consider
one and then consider the other, and the other so they're not mixed
together. And a weakness in one might be made up by strength in another
so I would just tend to favor the motion. I think we've had way too many
optimist deals lately and I think some things have passed into law that
would not have passed into law had they been considered on their own
because they've been mixed together and I'm not pre-judging any of these
particular bills, but as a legislator, I'd rather consider some of these
important changes separately. And I'm not saying I won't favor them
going forward, I may well, probably will. I'd like to keep them separate
for now. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Mr. B? [SPEAKER CHANGE] Point of parliamentary
inquiry, if the Carney bill passes, does that [SPEAKER CHANGE] The
Carney motion passes [SPEAKER CHANGE] If the Carney motion passes, I'm
sorry, does that preclude the vapor bill and/or will a portion of the
bill be included in the omnibus bill in the finance committee? [SPEAKER
CHANGE] No, it would not preclude, but they would be voted on
individually opposed to a package, but all of the bills would be sent at
the same time to the finance committee and therefore, they may all come
out in one bill as opposed to three separate pieces. We have the Carney
motion before us. All in favor of the Carney motion, Have you understand
the motion? Any further question on that motion? Do you prefer to
clarify on that motion? [SPEAKER CHANGE] The Carney motion all bills
will go forth. Three separate bills. Is that what we're voting on now?
[SPEAKER CHANGE] Yes sir, that's what the intent is. [SPEAKER CHANGE]
Thank you. [SPEAKER CHANGE] All in favor of the Carney motion will raise
your hand. All opposed will do likewise. The motion fails. We're back to
the original motion from Senator Raymond. Sir would you like to read
your motion? [SPEAKER CHANGE] Thank you madam chair. My motion was to
wrap everything into the one bill including the vapor and the single
sales before the vapor tax. [SPEAKER CHANGE] Committee the motion should
there be discussion on that motion? If not, all in favor of Senator
Raymond's motion will raise your right hand please. All opposed will do
likewise. Motion carries. Instruction to our staff will be that the
taxation of the vapor tax and the single sales factor will be
incorporated into the omnibus bill. There would be a new summary and
that bill will be eventually sent to the finance committee. We would
need a motion to approve the final report. Mr. Brawley, all in favor
will say aye. All opposed, no. With that, thank you for attending and we
