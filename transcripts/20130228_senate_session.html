[Speaker Changes] In the life and memory of Dr. Joey Joseph Johnston,
Fred D. Alexander, Richard C Erwin, John W. Winter Sr., Dr. Alfred
Johnston Webb, Dean Hopkins, Lucas, and other pioneer African American
members of the General Assembly in observance of African American
history month.
[Speaker Changes] Senator Bryant, would you like to be recognized to
explain this resolution? Senator Davis would you like to be recognized
to explain this resolution?
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Mr. President. To the members of the Senate,
as you are well aware, this is the last day of February, which is also
the last day of Black History Month. Although it was originally
established in 1926 by Carter G Woodson, nationally we began to observe
black history month in 1976, and mind you that President Gerald Ford was
actually the first President to acknowledge black history month, and
ever since, Presidents have acknowledged black history month. As we may
have seen many events and received invitations to such events throughout
this month. Schedule allowing have attended. I know Senator Paid, in the
past Mount Olive puts together a pretty good black history parade and
hundreds line up longest stretch and we’ve attended and participated and
I think that parade is coming up Saturday. And likewise, here in the
general assembly it is not uncommon for us or for a member to stand up
and reflect on black history month. Many may remember, even though I was
not here last session, but our dear friend Ed Jones stood up and brought
forth some words. And he shared a story with you that he had shared with
me quite often. And he was talking about his time when he was in the
army, and he had a buddy that he served with and he reminded us then
that service wasn’t about race, in the line of fire, it was about
survival. And he shared that story and I remember talking to him shortly
afterwards, and God bless his soul. Well in leu of a single words of
reflection today, we have this joint resolution 133 that recognized the
outstanding Americans and North Carolinians that just so happen to be
African Americans who served in the North Carolina General Assembly. But
before moving forward, I would like to pause just briefly and recognized
Senator Briant who actually came up with the idea of this Joint
Resolution and putting in one document a historical account of those
legislatures who have served of African American decent. So I do thank
you for working on it. She was working about, started last week, and by
the time staff finished the resolution, she was out of town if you
noticed. And she is back with us, and we are glad to have you back with
us so that you can continue on the journey while you had asked me to
work this resolution. But Joint resolution 133, as I said provides a
historical account starting in 1868, through today highlighting on the
accomplishments of african Americans, regardless of political party
affiliation that have served and made great contributions in shaping
north Carolina into the state that it is, beginning in 1868 when the
first African Americans that served in our state Senate included
Senators such as Harry Ebbs of Halifax County, and Abraham Galloway of
New Hanover County, and John Heiman of Warren County. And by 1833, there
were nineteen African Americans who were serving in the House and
Senate. And this was, during tis time, one of the larger groups that its
served of African Americans. And actually history tells us that it was
greatly due to the North Carolina Republican party. Now, interestingly,
and God rest his soul, when I was serving before, I sat right here with
Senator Tucker and Jim Forester, Senator Forester, who shared so many
stories and he reminded me for the efforts of the Republicans along the
way. But heading up to the century there were 111 African Americans that
served...</p>

General Assembly.  Then as the ?? returned it wasn’t until the six to
eight years later that we began to see African-Americans begin to serve
once again in our General Assembly with one the first in 1968 then
Representative Henry Fry, which many of us know and understand later
became Justice Fry of Guilford County.  Also I remind you by 1971 we
began to see the first African-American female to serve in our House on
Dr. Alfreda Webb of Guilford County and twenty years later, twenty years
later, 1991 we saw the first African-American to go on to become the
Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives and that
gentlemen is by the name of Daniel Terry Blue, Jr. and he wasn’t  have
enough fun in the House.  He was not truly fulfilled with being a
Speaker so he sought his true fulfillment her in the Senate, Senator
Blue.  Yet history continues to chart itself.  By 2009, 2009,
Representative Pearl Burris-Floyd of Gaston County was the first
African-American Republican elected to serve in the General Assembly.
I’m currently, there are 31 African-Americans including 2 Native
Americans serving in our General Assembly in this session.  What rich
history do we have as a state as we reflect on this last day of
February, 2013.  Historically 2013 was a very significant year for other
reasons.  This year marks too, the 150 year of the signing of Lincoln’s
emancipation proclamation which freed over 3 million slaves and also
many may remember fifty years ago we had a march on Washington and
interestingly history tells us that A. Phillip Randolph, the visionary
behind the march on Washington and that’s the begin to plan the march
nearly 20 years before the actual march took place.  However in working
with President Roosevelt at the time an executive order was put forth to
help alleviate discrimination in the defense industry and therefore he
held off on the march but then by 63 A. Phillip Randolph in the big six
were very content on moving forward with the march on Washington and the
reason for that was because we wanted at the time they were interested
in capturing a historic account to examine the progress made since the
signing of the emancipation proclamation then 100 years later.  Although
Civil Rights movement, the march in Washington produced tremendous
leaders as we remember Martin Luther King, now Congressman John Lewis
and even Floyd McKissic.  Now not our Senator Floyd McKissic but his
father was a tremendous giant in the Civil Rights community and actually
Senator McKissic’s  was one of the featured speakers on the march on
Washington and we continue to remember his contributions today.  My
friends, as we now reflect then in this joint resolution on what history
tells us for our state  there’s some things that I hold onto.  Number
one,  Black History does not by any means, shape or form, conflict with
American History, the history of our great state or any other history.
It is in essence our histories a deeply connected and rooted in American
history, in North Carolina history.  Number two our past, as we reflect
here today we see in that past both strengths as well as struggles
within our communities, even our political parties at times, our state,
our nation, but yet as we reflect on the same history it’s our
unyielding resilience</p>

That as brought us brought thus for in our ability to persevere. So as
we allow our reflections to lead us and guard us in to our future. That
may be get to known which simply suggests that this joint venture simply
reminds us too of the beauty of this institution of this institution .
Senator Apodaca reminds us that we are a family. It’s this family that
bring us together the child of the east to meet with mountain men like
Nesbitt. This child of the east of all the senators he has to meet with
outstanding this child of the east brings educational experience to meet
up with [??] gentlemen too. Is he growing up growing up for me small
rule ring county often people with saying  growing up that they are
going to the town that was to go to the county seat. Nevertheless they
would have thinking about  imagined of planning a trip to a big city.
This institution allows the son of the east to come in and exchange
ideas with big senators from the big city [??] Senator Clodfelter and
so many. My friends I would simply say this institution this institution
that as we perform that allows us and will allow us to move forward and
has given us the strength to get here today. As we keep our god ahead of
all and keep our love of country and our state at the forefront I am
convinced that our strength our strength  our collective strength would
continue to allow us to rise above any of our struggles and challenges
of our past. As we reflect on the history of this  institution and its
progress let us hold on to this fact that often our policies are
reflection of our relationships and often our politics are reflection of
our hearts. And its important in therefore to allow hearts to guide us
and allow our relationships to move us forward, Understanding this, the
true progress as we lurk in this resolution, it is required that both
parties to move us forward people from both the parties to move us
forward people of all races to move us forward people from different
backgrounds to move us forward people from different religions to move
us forward. I am glad to serve with each and every one of you and I am
glad to celebrate this enormous legacy that’s captured in this
resolution. I am joined to  celebrate and honor pioneers such as Senator
Blue and I am honored to submit this resolution to you.. I do ask for
your support on this resolution and I also ask for god to continue to
guide and build our state. May god bless you.
[Speaker Changes] Thank you Senator. Any further discussion or debate

[Speaker Changes] You have the floor Senator
[Speaker Changes] Thank you and I want to thank and commend senators
Davis and Brian and others and I want to congratulate one of my  mentors
Senator Blue for his work both in the house and the senate and I want to
certainly commend one of my greatest mentors on whose campaign I worked

Supreme Court Justice Fry for the work he did.</p>

back up to the top of our calendar now, with local bills.  Second
reading, roll call bill, senate bill 56.  Clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate bill 56. Wallace satellite annexations.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Jackson, for what purpose do you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor to explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  Ladies and gentlemen of the senate, this bill
might look a little familiar to you.  In our haste in late June of 2012,
we passed a house bill very similar to this, for this same area, this
same town, this same development.  But we added one section in there
that did not need to be in there, and we decided to let it go, and we
would correct it now.  And that's what this does.  Rarely do we get
bills come to us that are win-wins, and this is certainly a win-win for
the town of Wallace, and it's a win-win for the developer, and it's a
win-win that they've already brought in three businesses, so we need to
get this passed so they can move forward with the water and sewer as it
goes.  So I would appreciate your support.  Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate?  Hearing none, the question
before the senate is the passage of senate bills 56 on its second
reading.  All in favor will vote aye, opposed will vote no.  5 seconds
will be allowed for the voting.  The clerk will record the vote.  Cook.
48 having voting in the affirmative and zero in the negative, senate
bill 56 passes its second reading, and will remain on the calendar.
Senators, we'll be moving down to non roll call public bills on second
reading.  Senate bill 84.  The clerk will read.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senate bill 84.  Cancel aircraft lien, to surety bond deposit.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. President.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Clodfelter, for what purpose do you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To explain the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. President.  Members, when someone does repair or
maintenance on an airplane, they are entitled to keep possession of it
until they get paid.  If there's a dispute, though, about the work they
did, or about how much they're owed, that goes to court, and under the
current law, the airplane just sits parked.  It can't fly.  What the
bill does is allow a procedure whereby if there's a dispute about the
work or the value of the work or what's to be paid, the owner can post a
bond for the amount of the claim by the mechanic, and then recover
possession of the aircraft, and the dispute goes ahead in the courts.
That is exactly the same procedure we already have statutes for other
kinds of vehicles.  Cars, trucks, boats.  We just don't have it for
aircraft.  This conforms a statue for aircraft, the same procedure we
use for cars, trucks, boats.  Glad to answer questions.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, senator.  Is there any further discussion or debate?  Hearing
none, the question before the senate is the passage of committee
substitute senate bill 84 on its second reading.  All in favor will vote
aye.  Opposed will vote no.  5 seconds will be allowed for the voting.
The clerk will record the vote.  Davis.  Barefoot.  Aye.  Barefoot Aye.

Mr. President.

Senator Hartsell, for what purpose do you arise?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
To speak to the bill.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator, you have the floor.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The bill comes to us from the general statutes commission, at the
request of the board of law examiners.  The old law said that the board
of law examiners got $50.00 for each session.  They haven't actually
been paid that since the mid-seventies, and we're simply eliminating
that provision.  That's all it does.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Is there any further discussion or debate?  Hearing none, the question
before the senate is the passage of house bill 77 on second reading.
All in favor will vote aye.  Opposed will vote no.  5 seconds will be

Thank you mister president. Members. We discussed this yesterday in our
committee meeting. What has happened, there have been a few applications
that were giving the wrong information by the ethics commission on what
ethics forms they were suppose to file. So anyway, we're going to open
the nominations back up. They'll be open through 5 pm tomorrow afternoon
Friday, March 1st. We'll keep the rest of the schedule going forward as
it was.
To ensure as many nominees as possible eligible for consideration by the
senate we feel like this is the fairest approach to get everything
corrected. So, I ask for your support.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion? debate?

Mister president.

Yes, senator Pate.

Question for senator Apodaca.

[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yes sir.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
I understand that some nominees submitted the wrong form to the ethics
commission. Will they have to resubmit and do they know that- have they
been notified that they have to resubmit?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Senator Pate, thank you very much. Yes. We sent out notices out
yesterday to all the sponsoring members, to your email, to check and
give you the information needed for your candidate to be in compliance.
So be sure to check your email.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Any further discussion? debate?
Hearing none, the question before the senate is the adoption of senate
resolution 141. All in favor will vote aye. Opposed will vote no. Five
seconds will be allowed for the recording. The clerk will record the
vote.

Forty-eight having voted in the affirmative and zero in the negative,

Members, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the
exemplary service of an assistant intern that I had this week. Miss Emma
Sam ?? is from Cashiers in Jackson county in my district.  And she is
quite a young lady, a real self starter, and I have a certificate of
appreciation for her signed by the lieutenant governor and the president
pro tempore. And she is standing back there in the back. She is a sharp
lady. She'll be beginning college this fall and I don't there is
anything that she can accomplish that will surprise me. Thank you.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, senator.
