[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. A question?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Trying to get some idea if we are aware of what we’re going to be able
to work on tomorrow after Rules or in Rules as well.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Hall, we are currently in discussions with the Senate
around what could end up being an adjournment resolution. We’re not
going to be able to adjourn now. We’re going to go into recess until 8
PM and the intervening time we will be meeting with the...we will take
no substantive votes tonight, incidentally we did let everybody know
that there may be a vote tomorrow and we tried to...I think we were 47
hours and 15 minutes, Representative Jackson, from the time that we sent
it out to the time that we would come in, but I will wait for the votes
to be 15 minutes to live up to the 48 hour commitment. We’re trying to
sort out whether or not we will have session tomorrow, Representative
Hall. We will come to that conclusion sometime tonight depending upon
the negotiations with the continued discussions with the Senate. As soon
as any matter has been agreed to, we will make sure that we contact your
office to inform you as quickly as we can. Representative Kearny, please
state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
A question for the Rules chair.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Does the gentleman yield?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Of course.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman yields.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Well, if we don’t have votes tomorrow, will we still have a Rules
Committee?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That’ll be determined this evening. If we don’t have votes...I don’t
know yet. We’ll make that determination this evening. I don’t know.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
That is correct and we had tried to inform members who were traveling
distances , this would be a skeleton session so that they could come in
tomorrow if there were any logistical problems and we do decide to have
session take a vote tomorrow, we’ll make sure that any member who
intends to be present for the that we’ll make the accommodation to get
here. We won’t let logistics be the reason why they’re not in the
chamber when the vote’s taken. Further notices and announcements?
Representative Pierce.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Just a follow up question, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
The gentleman may state his inquiry.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
By eight o’clock tonight, Rules chair will know something, is that
correct, Mr. Speaker? At least by eight tonight.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Yees.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Representative Robert Brawley, please state your purpose.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
If everything is worked out, I’ve heard another rumor. Any chance we’ll
still be here Saturday?
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Highly unlikely, Representative Brawley. Representative Moore is
recognized.
[SPEAKER CHANGES]
Mr. Speaker, I move that the House stand in recess until 8 PM.
